=Episode 24=

3
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,520
Qiankun Society is nothing.

4
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,750
How dare he argue with Master Cheng?

5
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,520
I wish I could kill him.

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,990
He's been acting so bold lately.

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
Did he find a supporter?

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,630
That's it.

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,680
Now I get

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
why you came here.

11
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,010
But I'm no longer the leader,

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,350
so it's not up to me.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
Not up to you?

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,070
No one's in charge?

15
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,720
You should dismantle the gang.

16
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,070
(Powerful Presence)
I don't mind working hard.

17
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,720
After all, it's for

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,600
Lion City's growth and prosperity.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,160
What?

20
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,440
Are you leaving without a word?

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,630
Cheng Hui, you'll regret it.

22
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,350
Master An,

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,750
please don't be angry.

24
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,510
Let's

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
put it aside for now.

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,320
We'll discuss it

27
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,910
and get back to you.

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
Tell Cheng Hui

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,470
I tried to be nice.

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,280
If he doesn't appreciate it,

31
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,880
he'll regret it for sure.

32
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,320
Boss, who does he think he is?

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,280
How dare he ask for

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,160
our territory?

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
Qiankun Society

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,350
is full of rascals!

37
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,510
Boss,

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Weiyuan Hall will

39
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,060
eliminate the evil

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,160
for Lion City!

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,070
The point is
what makes him so confident?

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,160
He definitely has a supporter.

43
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,670
Lie down with dogs,

44
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,040
wake up with fleas.

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,950
His supporter can't be a decent person!

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,150
An Gexiong has been

47
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,190
threatening you.

48
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,600
If he didn't have something on you,

49
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,280
he wouldn't dare do this.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,680
What are you afraid of?

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,950
Qiankun Society never does real work.

52
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,670
All they do is collect fees

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
and bully the people.

54
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,560
Calling them a mob

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
is flattering them.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,190
What can they possibly do?

57
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,230
You're right, Heihu.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,470
He never plays by the rules.

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,720
We can't let our guard down.

60
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,560
Master Cheng.

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,990
Where does Nanping live?

62
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,390
I'll go check on her.

63
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,080
Now that we've offended the rascals,

64
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,310
we should tell Nanping

65
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,230
to be more careful.

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,840
Let Zhongxin take you there.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Zhongxin.

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,190
Master Cheng said

69
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,110
he'd deal with you later.

70
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,400
Now take me to find Nanping.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,480
What happened?

72
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,710
Maybe nothing happened.

73
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,800
It was you who sent people

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
to protect her.

75
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,070
Yes.

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,630
What's wrong?

77
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,720
Oh, no!

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,870
No one is with her today!

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,080
Take me to her place.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
What?

81
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,280
Say that again.

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,520
That girl often comes by to buy food.

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,110
She's a reporter.

84
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,400
The other day, the neighbors were saying

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,520
she's someone's daughter.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Cheng Hui?

87
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,430
Not this name.

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
It was Master or something.

89
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,270
Shanhai Gang,

90
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,270
Master Cheng?

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,310
That's it.

92
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,190
Shanhai Gang.

93
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,550
Everyone knows about them.

94
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,280
Did you see it yourself?

95
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,160
They kidnapped her in broad daylight.

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,160
I just couldn't stand by,

97
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,350
so I came to report it.

98
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
Please don't mention me, okay?

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,430
They might come after me.

100
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Dad!

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Dad!

102
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,270
(As Present)

103
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,150
Any news?

104
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,710
It's my fault.

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I couldn't protect Nanping.

106
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,310
Boss,

107
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,360
we've searched everywhere

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,270
but couldn't find her.

109
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,150
There's

110
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,400
no evidence,

111
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,350
but I think Nanping

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,840
is in danger.

113
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,430
It has to be Bin Langxiong.

114
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,950
Otherwise,

115
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,310
why would he act so arrogantly?

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,680
Boss,

117
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
let me gather our brothers

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,720
and wipe them out!

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,960
Yes, wipe them out!

120
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
Shut up!

121
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,040
Ping is my daughter.

122
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,430
This is my personal matter.

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,080
I can handle it myself.

124
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,390
Boss!

125
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,760
If the gangs start fighting,

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,990
we'll fall right into their trap.

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,520
Boss, put that aside!

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,110
We must bring Nanping back!

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,670
Yes, Dad.

130
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
Master Cheng is right.

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,760
If we fight,

132
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,990
others will take advantage.

133
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,550
At worst, our entire gang

134
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,430
could be wiped out.

135
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,270
So, we cannot

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,310
let others know about this.

137
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
With Master Cheng's influence,

138
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,840
the news would spread like wildfire,

139
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,600
and by then, the situation

140
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,520
would be hard to control.

141
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,080
What does that mean?

142
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
Should we just stand here waiting?

143
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,520
No, Dad!

144
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,920
Nanping is Master Cheng's

145
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
only daughter.

146
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,720
She's everything to him.

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
How can he

148
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,870
stay calm

149
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,200
and make the right decision?

150
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,510
For this matter,

151
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,830
I'm in charge now.

152
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,950
Boss.

153
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,830
Listen to him.

154
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,190
Okay.

155
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Sheyan,

156
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,400
stay at home with Boss.

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
Heihu,

158
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,630
Zhongxin, come with me.

159
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,510
Wait a second.

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,840
Are you going to gather information?

161
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,920
Yes.

162
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,510
First, we need to confirm

163
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,990
that the kidnapper was An Gexiong.

164
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,470
I'll go with you.

165
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
Master Cheng.

166
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,430
I'll follow your lead, alright?

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
Okay.

168
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,190
Only the five of us

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,990
can get involved in this.

170
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Master Cheng,

171
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,080
let's use the back door.

172
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,200
Well done.

173
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,080
Yes.

174
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
We caught Cheng Hui's daughter.

175
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,640
We'll be

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,950
greatly rewarded.

177
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,150
Definitely.

178
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,270
Guys,

179
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm Zhao from Shanghai Gang.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sorry for this.

181
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,950
Master Cheng likes making friends.

182
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,150
Actually, Shanhai Gang

183
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,910
and Qiankun Society

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,430
are never enemies.

185
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,030
So, here's the deal.

186
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,480
As long as you answer

187
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,150
our questions

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
honestly,

189
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,040
I promise not to

190
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,510
kill you.

191
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,160
Okay!

192
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,870
Hold on, I'll get the door.

193
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,950
You got lucky.

194
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,790
Don't move!

195
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,760
- Don't move!
- Put it down!

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
Don't move!

197
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,550
Bros,

198
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,390
sorry to interrupt.

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,950
We're two

200
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,160
great gangs.

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,630
We have rules

202
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,510
and must be righteous.

203
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,120
We don't want to use force,

204
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,000
not to mention killing anyone.

205
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,280
I just want to ask you something.

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,600
I hope you can

207
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
be honest with me.

208
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,650
Sir,

209
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,630
everything's set

210
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,510
as you planned.

211
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,760
If they start fighting,

212
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,360
we'll surround them in five minutes.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,280
Hasn't Shanhai Gang

214
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,520
taken any action?

215
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
What did An Gexiong say?

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,070
He wants all

217
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,150
Shanhai Gang's territory

218
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,040
except for Shanhai Street.

219
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,790
How dare he say that?

220
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,750
Will he walk out of Shanhai Gang alive?

221
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
Cheng Hui

222
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,000
is really old

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,880
and useless.

224
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,080
No,

225
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,000
he's really stubborn.

226
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,830
Maybe An Gexiong

227
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,790
got scared and didn't say it.

228
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,070
No way.

229
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,640
Look how proud he was.

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
He acted like he owns

231
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
the entire city.

232
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,790
What did he do to Nanping?

233
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,630
No idea.

234
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,910
He's holding Nanping hostage

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,520
for more territory.

236
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,400
An Gexiong is fooling us.

237
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,790
How's that possible?

238
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,790
Why don't you see for yourself?

239
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sure he's serving

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,280
Nanping the best food and drinks.

241
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,120
If Nanping returns unharmed,

242
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,670
no one will ever

243
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,590
be able to defeat Cheng Hui.

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Actually, that girl is nice.

245
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,830
She's pure.

246
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,030
Help!

247
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,880
Is anyone there?

248
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,520
Help!

249
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,950
Somebody, help!

250
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,830
She's so pretty.

251
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,160
Our boss is so happy.

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,030
- You like her too?
- Kind of.

253
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,590
Why are you laughing?

254
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
Boss,

255
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,950
we're just happy for you.

256
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,830
You'll be the groom tonight.

257
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
Cheng Hui's daughter

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,190
is really beautiful.

259
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,670
But she's a bit skinny.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,880
Nonsense!

261
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,760
Do you think I kidnapped her

262
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,830
just for this?

263
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,120
Zheng Qiu thought I was an idiot.

264
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,190
I've been a lackey for half my life.

265
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,120
Now I've finally come this far.

266
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,120
Why would I still obey him?

267
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,480
Then why did you kidnap her?

268
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,910
I'm going to replace Cheng Hui

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
and Zheng Qiu

270
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
to be the King of Lion City.

271
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,750
Today, I went to Shanhai Gang and

272
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,640
told him what I wanted.

273
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,430
If Cheng Hui agrees,

274
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,190
their reputation will be ruined.

275
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,720
When that happened,

276
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,160
I'll kill her daughter,

277
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,590
leave her body on the street,

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,520
and plant it on Zheng Qiu.

279
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,240
They'll have a big fight.

280
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,310
No matter who wins,

281
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,520
I'll have the last laugh.

282
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
Look,

283
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,480
Cheng Hui

284
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,840
is too old to protect

285
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,830
his own daughter,

286
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,310
so who will support him?

287
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,910
Shanhai Gang will definitely

288
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,070
fall apart.

289
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,320
Right?

290
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
That's right.

291
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
As for Zheng Qiu,

292
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,520
that girl calls him Uncle Zheng,

293
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,400
yet he wants her dead.

294
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,310
Don't you think

295
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,590
Zheng Qiu is a monster?

296
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,710
Who's going to support him?

297
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,760
Who's going to trust him?

298
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,640
Even the governor would take him down.

299
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,720
However,

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,070
everyone will know

301
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,910
this is all my work.

302
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,910
From now on,

303
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,830
no one will dare to
mess with Qiankun Society.

304
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,000
Boss, you're so far-sighted.

305
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,600
We really admire you!

306
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
That's right.

307
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,550
Xiong, hello.

308
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,430
Officer Lin,

309
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,670
what brings you here?

310
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,830
I'm here to see Xiong.

311
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,190
You're really bold, you know.

312
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,000
You're hiding here

313
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,670
instead of staying at Qiankun Society.

314
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,240
Mind your own business.

315
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,430
I'm worried that Shanhai Gang

316
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,430
might attack your place,

317
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,550
and you'll lose many brothers.

318
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,710
None of your business.

319
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,590
As for Qiankun Society,

320
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,670
I know what to do.

321
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Okay.

322
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,070
Why are you even rinsing your mouth?

323
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Boss.

324
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,270
Get lost!

325
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Listen up, all of you.

326
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,710
From now on,

327
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm done with chewing betel nuts.

328
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,910
Gangs

329
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,160
play an important part in society.

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,950
As the leading gang,

331
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,200
chewing betel nuts will affect

332
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,710
all the other gangs' reputations.

333
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,830
So, no more chewing for all of you.

334
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,590
Spit it out and rinse your mouth!

335
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,270
Okay.

336
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,240
Sir,

337
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,310
go back and tell Officer Zheng

338
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,550
that he doesn't need
to teach me anything.

339
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,480
I'll do what needs to be done.

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,950
As for how far I go,

341
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
I know what I'm doing.

342
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,040
See him off.

343
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,240
It's a big forest.

344
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,830
Don't let him get lost.

345
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
Yes, Boss.

346
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,670
This way, please.

347
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,400
Okay, you can stop here.

348
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,670
Head back.

349
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,070
I've reported it to my leaders.

350
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,760
But no one's paid attention.

351
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,000
So, I figured

352
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,240
I should tell you.

353
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,820
I sneaked out.

354
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,030
I have to go.

355
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,910
Wait a second.

356
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
Thanks, man.

357
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,200
Well,

358
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,480
now that I can't walk,

359
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,670
can you

360
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,120
pass a message to Shanhai Gang?

361
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,550
I can't.

362
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,760
They gathered all our forces.

363
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,910
Dozens of bullets

364
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,310
for each gun.

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
What's going on?

366
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,190
They say it's a gang fight.

367
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,160
The street where Nanping was kidnapped

368
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,310
belongs to Qiankun Society.

369
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,480
They did this
in the middle of the day,

370
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,280
so it has to be their own territory.

371
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,880
Shanhai Gang is a mess.

372
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,680
You should dismantle it.

373
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,240
We welcome all of you

374
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,760
to join Qiankun Society.

375
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
It's An Gexiong.

376
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm not sure about that.

377
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,360
Sir, I really have to go.

378
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,760
Wait a minute.

379
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,200
If An Gexiong took Nanping,

380
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,830
where would he hide her?

381
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,920
How would I know that?

382
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,670
Last year,

383
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,440
we were looking into hidden opium.

384
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,720
That cabin in the woods

385
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,150
belongs to An Gexiong, right?

386
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, the palm grove.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
It's his place.

388
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,310
The woods are perfect for hiding.

389
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,880
Sorry, bro.

390
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,880
Wait, sir.

391
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,030
Why are you apologizing?

392
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,910
I have to go.

393
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,990
Bro,

394
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm really sorry.

395
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,390
Nanping is my sister.

396
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,680
My real sister.

397
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,000
Officer Lin.

398
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,310
Officer Lin, hurry!

399
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,190
Please help me!

400
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,190
Hurry!

401
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,760
They really prepared food and drinks.

402
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,830
Officer Zheng was right.

403
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,000
Did Uncle Zheng ask you to save me?

404
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,390
Untie me now.

405
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,360
Hurry!

406
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,680
Just a moment.

407
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,990
What are you doing?

408
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,190
Nanping,

409
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,030
I'm taking huge risks

410
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,910
to save you.

411
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,440
It can't be for nothing.

412
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,030
You're a cop.

413
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,390
How can you say something like that?

414
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,760
Right now,

415
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,790
I'm just a man.

416
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,070
Are you crazy? Stay away from me!

417
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,280
Don't touch me!

418
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Get off me!

419
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,590
Don't touch me!

420
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,910
Stay focused!

421
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes.

422
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,150
There are quite a few guards.

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,920
Nanping

424
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,550
must be here.
