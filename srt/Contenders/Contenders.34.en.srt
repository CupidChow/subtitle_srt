00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,300
(Four years later)

4
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,320
Jie,

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,270
I heard

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,960
the pier's business

7
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
is booming.

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,750
You need to book

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,750
this car in advance.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,960
That's right.

11
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,750
Shanhai Gang has a good reputation,

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
and it's your car.

13
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,990
They love to book it.

14
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,150
Sorry for holding you up today.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,760
Not at all.

16
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,150
When I heard you needed the car,

17
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,150
I was thrilled.

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,360
I cleaned it three times.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
Anywhere else you want to go?

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,990
Let's just park here.

21
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,150
Alright.

22
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,110
You're done here.

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,590
Grab a smoke or some tea.

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,240
After dinner,

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,150
come back and drive.

26
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,110
Okay.

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,120
Go inside and find a seat.

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,400
Congratulations!

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
- Thanks.
- Congratulations!

30
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,080
Come on.

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,630
- Welcome, thank you.
- Congratulations!

32
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,590
No need to be polite.

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,830
Master Cheng.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,320
If Jinhu

35
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,430
could see this,

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,480
he'd be so happy.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
If Rong were still alive,

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,680
he'd be happy too.

39
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,790
Rong?

40
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,920
He's Zhongxin's uncle.

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
What?

42
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,720
How come I never heard about this?

43
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,000
He didn't want to talk about it,

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,510
so I never brought it up.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Rong was a decent guy.

46
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,630
Zhongxin is your godson.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,320
I think

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,510
he just didn't want others to say

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,390
he was trying to get close to you.

50
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,950
Zhongxin

51
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,190
was supposed to get married
early last year.

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
But he was looking after Rong,

53
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,120
so the wedding got delayed a whole year.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,750
He did his best in the end.

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,520
Zhongxin

56
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,040
really repaid his uncle's kindness.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,070
Congratulations.

58
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,790
Have some wedding candy.

59
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,920
Come on.

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
Wedding candy.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,390
The banquet's about to start.

62
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,190
It's your daughter's wedding.

63
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,720
Don't you want to go?

64
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,870
Of course I do.

65
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,310
But if I go there,

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll ruin the wedding.

67
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,270
Go ahead.

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,390
I already gave them my gift yesterday.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll skip the banquet.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll stay with you instead.

71
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,360
I'll make it up to you another day.

72
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,390
Congratulations!

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
Uncle Heihu!

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
Coming!

75
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,750
Congratulations!

76
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,480
You're married.

77
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,440
Thank you, Uncle Heihu.

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,070
Come on in.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Why does that person

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,240
at the corner look so familiar?

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,080
Okay.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,080
Thanks.

83
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,990
Congratulations.

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,760
Long time no see.

85
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,000
- What's wrong?
- Uncle Heihu,

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,360
it's someone I know. Go inside.

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Carry it inside.

88
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,710
Zhongxin

89
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,160
also recognized him.

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,650
Who is it?

91
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,610
If you know him,

92
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,870
invite him to the banquet.

93
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,920
I must be so happy

94
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
that I made a mistake.

95
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,010
It's okay. Just go inside.

96
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,680
Zhongxin.

97
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,950
- All good.
- Thanks.

98
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,910
Come on.

99
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,390
- Thanks.
- Zhongxin,

100
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,870
we want to see the bridal chamber.

101
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,950
Okay, go upstairs.

102
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,990
I'll show you around later.

103
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,950
Okay.

104
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,910
Come on, let's go.

105
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,230
Bro,

106
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,590
enjoy the food.

107
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,480
Congrats.

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,440
Thank you.

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
Thanks.

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Appreciate it.

111
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
Come on.

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Thank you.

113
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,800
Tonight, let's eat and drink well.

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay?

115
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
- Enjoy your meal.
- I'll head over there.

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
If you need anything, just call me.

117
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,430
Okay?

118
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,390
Okay.

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
Enjoy the meal.

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Congrats.

121
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,240
Congratulations.

122
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,230
Zhendong.

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,120
Zhendong.

124
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,520
Uncle Tiehan.

125
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,830
How have you been?

126
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,790
All good.

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,240
When did you come back?

128
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,510
Well, I arrived

129
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,480
last night.

130
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,950
If I'd come any later,

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,550
I might've missed the wedding.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,040
Where have you been

133
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,070
all these years?

134
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,910
Last time,

135
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,750
your family just left without a word.

136
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,720
Why didn't you leave a letter?

137
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
Didn't he ask me to leave?

138
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,750
I do have a habit of writing.

139
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,870
Every month,
I sent two letters to Lion City.

140
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,430
However,

141
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,480
Shanhai Gang is heartless.

142
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,310
I shouldn't embarrass myself.

143
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,590
Zhendong.

144
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
Don't say that.

145
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,870
Am I wrong?

146
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,150
Nanping is getting married,

147
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,920
but he's hiding in his car.

148
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,520
Does he really care?

149
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,390
But I'm sure on a happy day like this,

150
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,240
Nanping wouldn't want to see him either.

151
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,150
As her brother,

152
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,590
I will attend

153
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,550
my sister's wedding for him.

154
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,110
I have to go.

155
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,720
Zhendong is back!

156
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,080
Come on in.

157
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Enjoy the meal.

158
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,280
- Thanks!
- Uncle Heihu.

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,080
Zhendong!

160
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,230
Uncle Heihu.

161
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,480
Zhendong, where have you been?

162
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
These years,

163
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,030
I've missed you so much.

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,870
Sheyan, I've missed you too.

165
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,870
Zhongxin, look who's here.

166
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,790
Who is it?

167
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,750
Come over here.

168
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,120
The bridal chamber is nice, right?

169
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,080
It's really nice.

170
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
The layout...

171
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,710
Zhendong?

172
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,920
Hey, Zhongxin.

173
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,990
This is for you.

174
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,110
Congrats.

175
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,360
You must treat my sister well forever,

176
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,560
or I won't go easy on you.

177
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,270
Since when was she your sister?

178
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
When we were kids,

179
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,910
she only called you Zhendong

180
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,370
but called me Brother Zhongxin.

181
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,870
Looks like these four years,

182
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,390
you've really worked hard.

183
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,790
Now you're finally not

184
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,750
Brother Zhongxin anymore.

185
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,800
By the way,

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,960
I have a red packet

187
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,040
for the bride.

188
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
Maybe it's a small one,

189
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
but it's full of cash.

190
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,550
Give it to me.

191
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,510
Speaking of which,

192
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,830
where's the bride?

193
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
With the wedding lady.

194
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,840
Something's wrong!

195
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,600
The bride went missing!

196
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,830
What?

197
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,320
She disappeared!

198
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,270
At first,

199
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,270
I thought it was just a wedding prank.

200
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,270
The door was closed,

201
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,360
and we needed to pick her up.

202
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,550
After we broke the door,

203
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,960
there was no one inside!

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Look for her!

205
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,480
We asked the neighbors.

206
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,870
They said she left early

207
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,560
and hasn't come back.

208
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,870
Mr. Xiao!

209
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,750
What happened?

210
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,630
They also went to

211
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,600
pick up the bride.

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,510
Nanping isn't home?

213
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,440
No, I checked the office.

214
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,870
No one was there!

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,150
Also, Han Xiaojie is also missing!

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Who's Han Xiaojie?

217
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,750
Our new intern reporter.

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
He's on the same team as Nanping.

219
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,960
They were following a story

220
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,910
about missing people.

221
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,320
Brothers,

222
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,280
come with me!

223
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,590
Wait a second.

224
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,120
What missing

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
people?

226
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Let's figure it out

227
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,630
and split up to search.

228
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
Alright.

229
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,080
Everyone, split up.

230
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,270
- Go to the office.
- Got it.

231
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,320
We'll check the streets.

232
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Boss,

233
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
something's off.

234
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
Sheyan,

235
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,710
what's going on?

236
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,120
Nanping is missing.

237
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,750
What happened?

238
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Boss, don't worry.

239
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,630
She went to investigate
a missing people case.

240
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,270
It might be connected.

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,030
Or maybe it's just a coincidence.

242
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,390
Maybe Nanping

243
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,590
hid somewhere.

244
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,960
I think that's it.

245
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,800
Who are you?

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,010
- Who are you?
- Answer!

247
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,910
What's all that noise outside?

248
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,360
Argue at home!

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,080
Go on.

250
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,510
Who is it?

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
Huang Zhongxin?

252
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,480
Tell me!

253
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,720
Where is Nanping?

254
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,420
(Wu A'xiang, Leader of Shanding Gang)
If you kill me,

255
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,200
you'll never find her.

256
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
Fine.

257
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,320
I'll fulfill your wish!

258
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,440
Tell me!

259
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,400
Tell me!

260
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,120
I'll ask you one more time.

261
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,720
Where is Nanping?

262
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Go ahead, kill me.

263
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,510
She can be buried with me.

264
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,030
Calm down!

265
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,150
Zhongxin, Zhongxin.

266
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,480
Let me handle this.

267
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,710
Wu A'xiang.

268
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,960
Your brother Wu A'nan's death

269
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
put us on opposite sides.

270
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,840
Now Master Cheng's daughter is missing,

271
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,600
so we have to suspect Shanding Gang.

272
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,320
If it was you,

273
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,910
just tell us straight up.

274
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,710
Yes.

275
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,360
Of course it was me.

276
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,200
I hate Cheng Hui so much.

277
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,870
I curse him every single day!

278
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,320
His daughter got kidnapped?

279
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,840
I...

280
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm thrilled!

281
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,630
Zhongxin, Zhongxin, Zhongxin!

282
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,600
Calm down!

283
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Looks like you want to die.

284
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,340
Fine.

285
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,440
I'll give you what you want!

286
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,400
Kuan!

287
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,390
It wasn't me.

288
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,350
I swear, I didn't do it!

289
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,650
I didn't do it!

290
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Alright then.

291
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,790
Did you cause trouble

292
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,960
at Zhongxin

293
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,200
and Nanping's wedding?

294
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Yes.

295
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,400
I did make trouble.

296
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,110
But Shanding Gang

297
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,310
isn't what it used to be.

298
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,600
We're no match for you now.

299
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,450
We… We've given up!

300
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,390
For real!

301
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,350
I mean it!

302
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,670
Zhongxin, Zhongxin!

303
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,670
Wait, don't!

304
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,630
Don't!

305
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,720
He's not lying.

306
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
We must keep looking for her.

307
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,140
Come on, let's go.

308
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,830
Boss.

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,280
Look.

310
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,120
It's the latest missing persons info

311
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,630
logged by Nanping.

312
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,750
If we follow these leads

313
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,710
and keep digging,

314
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,960
maybe we'll find something.

315
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,670
It's like searching for a needle.

316
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,030
I'm afraid we're out of time.

317
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,630
We have to try.

318
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
Sheyan.

319
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,110
Send more people.

320
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,280
Check every lead.

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
Got it.

322
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,840
It's very likely

323
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,910
that they'll send the victims

324
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,320
to the Americas by ship.

325
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,440
The best solution

326
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,960
is to seal the pier.

327
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,870
No ship can leave.

328
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,470
Unfortunately,

329
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,670
Charles just left Lion City,

330
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,990
and we haven't made

331
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,840
any connections with the new governor.

332
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
This matter

333
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,910
won't be easy to handle.

334
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
Find Zheng Qiu.

335
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,150
Keep moving. Why did you stop?

336
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,790
Heihu,

337
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,750
how are you?

338
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,390
Many people are missing.

339
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,800
Did you do this?

340
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,000
No.

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
We'd never do something like that.

342
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,240
20 years ago, you trafficked people.

343
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,720
You took over 30 girls

344
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
and tied them up on a boat.

345
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,870
Master Cheng saved them,

346
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,910
and you stabbed your own thigh.

347
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,600
That's why we spared you.

348
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,150
Now you've forgotten the lesson, right?

349
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,010
No, I haven't forgotten.

350
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,670
I swore to Master Cheng I'd change.

351
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,840
I never did it again.

352
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,240
Then why did they all

353
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
disappear from your turf?

354
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm asking you.

355
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,200
Tell me the truth!

356
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
I really didn't do it!

357
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,270
Heihu, please don't kill me!

358
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,030
It's Xiangfu Gang.

359
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,630
What is Xiangfu Gang?

360
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,990
They showed up three years ago,

361
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,960
hiding on our turf
and stirring up trouble.

362
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,510
Many people are missing.

363
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,670
I think

364
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,790
they're behind this.

365
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,360
You think?

366
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,320
No...

367
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,670
I'm sure it's them.

368
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,040
Where do they

369
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,320
usually stay?

370
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,440
What? Close the port?

371
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,080
No ships can go in or out?

372
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,360
How can that be possible?

373
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,240
I've already said no to James.

374
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,720
The governor wants to talk to me?

375
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,600
Yeah, of course.

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,200
Zheng Qiu.

377
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,790
Yes, sir. It's Zheng Qiu.

378
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,870
I'll fully cooperate, sir.

379
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,230
Yes, sir.

380
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
Thank you, sir.

381
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,200
Well,

382
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,160
did he yell at you?

383
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,550
I honestly don't get it.

384
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,000
Why make such a big scene?

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
That's not for you to ask.

386
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,590
Make a call

387
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,680
and order all your guys

388
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,640
to follow my lead!

389
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,630
Quick, come on!

390
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,200
Come on!

391
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,470
Quick!

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,520
Come on! Let's go!

393
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,750
Come on!

394
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,750
Boss,

395
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,670
this brat is James.

396
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,750
Sir,

397
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,910
everyone's ready.

398
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,880
Go.

399
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,840
Yes, sir!

400
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,470
Everyone,

401
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,800
left and right!

402
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,030
Go!

403
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,000
Come on!

404
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,960
Quick!

405
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,620
- Mr. James.
- Go, go, go!

406
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,630
James, long time no see.

407
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,880
Oh, it's you.

408
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,920
- Hello.
- I'm on duty.

409
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,950
No time for golf.

410
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,180
(Police Station)

411
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,230
That fake foreigner

412
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,710
is hard to deal with.

413
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,920
It's been years,

414
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,710
and we can't break through.

415
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,310
Just follow the orders.

416
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,430
Stop asking questions.

417
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,840
Sir.

418
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,720
Now everyone in Lion City

419
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,120
is helping you find your daughter,

420
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,160
and you want to

421
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,190
give orders to me?

422
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,270
- No.
- Don't deny it.

423
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,870
The governor gave the order himself.

424
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
The port is now closed.

425
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,150
No ships can enter or leave.

426
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,240
All the police are

427
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,400
hunting the human traffickers

428
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,750
and rescuing your daughter
Cheng Nanping.

429
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,910
The new governor
just took office two days ago.

430
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,470
How did you make that connection?

431
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,120
Sir.

432
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,520
Thank you for your hard work.

433
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,910
We'll take our leave now.

434
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,350
Back then, you even claimed

435
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,910
to cut ties with her.

436
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,320
So pretentious.

437
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,080
The dock is already shut down.

438
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,640
Everyone is out

439
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,590
searching for

440
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,760
human traffickers.

441
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,840
Plus, James is leading the team.

442
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,840
This will only tip them off.

443
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,270
Nanping

444
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,470
will be in danger.

445
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,200
Dong, I have to go.

446
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
Suit yourself.

447
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,360
Not here.

448
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,450
So strange.

449
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,520
They said dozens of people

450
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,640
from Xiangfu lived here.

451
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,790
They all disappeared.

452
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,760
It looks like human trafficking.

453
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,440
Indeed.

454
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,080
They need to escort the victim.

455
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,950
It seems they all took action.

456
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,350
Where did they

457
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,470
take Nanping?

458
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,070
Zhongxin,

459
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,030
calm down.

460
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,070
On my way here,

461
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,760
I heard the police sealed the pier.

462
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,760
As long as she's in Lion City,

463
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,430
we'll definitely find her.

464
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,600
How's it going?

465
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,550
Mr. Xiao,

466
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,790
what's the name of

467
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,750
that intern?

468
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,990
Han Xiaojie.

469
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,230
Where's his office?

470
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,440
Over there.

471
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,120
Here.

472
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,230
He hasn't been here long,

473
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,600
but with Nanping guiding him,

474
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,800
he's improved pretty fast.

475
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,670
Does he have any special skills?

476
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,840
Yes.

477
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
Photography.

478
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,640
Sometimes, for breaking news,

479
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,630
he'll stake out all night.

480
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,880
Taking photos.

481
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,430
Do you have a darkroom?

482
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,440
Yes.

483
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
Take me there.

484
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,560
He came here last night.

485
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,470
I told him to develop them later.

486
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,600
He wouldn't wait.

487
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,270
Xiaojie, your shift's over.

488
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,230
No need to work.

489
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,550
Head home.

490
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,510
I can't.

491
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,320
This is an important task from Nanping.

492
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,030
I have to get these photos done

493
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,990
and report back to her.

494
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,710
You can go.

495
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,400
He developed the photos himself

496
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,390
and stayed up all night.

497
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,080
He grabbed the photos

498
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,910
and rushed out.

499
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,600
Is the roll here?

500
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,630
He left in a hurry.

501
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,630
He probably didn't take it.

502
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
That's great.

503
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,550
Where's the roll?

504
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,790
