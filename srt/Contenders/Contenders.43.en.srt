3
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,730
Where's my dad?

4
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,910
Mr. Cheng...

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,440
He was arrested.

6
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,040
He killed someone.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
He deserves this.

8
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,040
Who did he kill?

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,600
My real dad,

10
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,710
Huang Jinhu.

11
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,270
Nanping,

12
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,350
I saw his body

13
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,830
with my own eyes.

14
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,150
Cheng Hui

15
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,230
asked them to take him back

16
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,240
from the hospital

17
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,310
and...

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,030
Why don't you believe me?

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,830
If my dad

20
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,710
killed someone,

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,640
it had to be his enemy.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Huang Jinhu is his brother.

23
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,080
He'd never do that.

24
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,150
Nanping,

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,640
he's a real criminal.

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,640
Your mom died because of him.

27
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,640
He even cut ties with you.

28
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,310
He'd do anything.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,120
Didn't you already

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,310
cut ties with him?

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,590
Why did you take that knife for him?

32
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
Mr. Huang, Nanping is seriously injured

33
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,820
and needs to rest.

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,340
You're so angry right now.

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,740
You shouldn't be here.

36
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,540
She's my wife!

37
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,340
You shouldn't be here!

38
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,060
You two never had a wedding.

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,820
And Nanping

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,500
wants to cancel the engagement.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,460
Say that again!

42
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,460
So what?

43
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,660
Are you going to hurt me?

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
No one should

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,100
disturb her rest.

46
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
You can't force her to accept anything.

47
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,300
Mr. Huang,

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,260
please leave!

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,140
Nanping,

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,660
rest well.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,430
Mr. Xiao,

52
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,220
thanks.

53
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,980
Was my dad

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
really arrested?

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,060
Yes.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,380
The police

57
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,150
took him from the hospital.

58
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,420
Zheng Qiu must be behind this.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Xiaojie,

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,350
help me find Liu Zhendong.

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,740
It has to be Zheng Qiu's plan.

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,180
He's always wanted to hurt my dad.

63
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,320
He pretended to care about me

64
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,860
just to know

65
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,790
my dad's whereabouts.

66
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,210
Okay.

67
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,620
Don't talk too much.

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,460
You should rest.

69
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,790
Zhendong,

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,980
you can save my dad,

71
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,980
right?

72
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,540
He's our dad.

73
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,140
Zheng Qiu is nasty

74
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,540
and

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,820
very cunning.

76
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,780
He even tried to turn me

77
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,980
against my dad,

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,060
saying my dad

79
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,420
and your mom...

80
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,380
I didn't believe it.

81
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,260
You're smart.

82
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,060
But I was tricked.

83
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,180
All these years,

84
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,420
I always thought you

85
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,860
were my half-sister.

86
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,660
Even though I was fooled,

87
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,980
it doesn't feel so bad.

88
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
You risked your life

89
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,580
for me

90
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,060
because you thought I was your sister.

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,820
That kind of bond

92
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,460
is unique,

93
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,260
and nothing can

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,300
replace or change it.

95
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,660
Brother,

96
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,580
save our dad.

97
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,300
Before I came back,

98
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,100
I had made up my mind.

99
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,380
I must take down

100
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,220
Zheng Qiu for our dad.

101
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,740
Today,

102
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,740
every mainstream newspaper in Lion City

103
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,820
reported

104
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,380
that Cheng Hui
was arrested for suspected murder.

105
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,860
Look at the headlines.

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,980
Gang Leader Cheng Hui

107
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,260
finally brought to justice,

108
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,660
a great relief

109
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,180
for all.

110
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,580
The Chinese people in Lion City

111
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,140
don't read these English newspapers.

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,980
But the governor reads them.

113
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,340
This will only make him

114
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,100
more determined to wipe out the gangs.

115
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,140
You said you'd cause some trouble

116
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,180
for Shanhai gang.

117
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,380
But the gangs you control,

118
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,940
including Dafan Gang,

119
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,100
haven't taken any action.

120
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,820
I pulled back on purpose.

121
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,500
Why?

122
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,100
Going after Shanhai Gang now

123
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,260
is really pointless.

124
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Once Cheng Hui

125
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,180
gets charged with murder,

126
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,660
Shanhai Gang

127
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,740
will collapse immediately

128
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,620
like a building

129
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
with no foundation.

130
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,820
But Liu Zhendong is different.

131
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,100
Based on my observation,

132
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,300
he will indeed become

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,260
an obstacle.

134
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
My friend,

135
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,060
this part is your

136
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,820
job.

137
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,700
I can't stand the awful coffee

138
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,260
in Lion City anymore.

139
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,660
We've gotten used to it.

140
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,340
For us,

141
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,100
this is the best drink.

142
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,500
You know what,

143
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,100
the anti-crime agent

144
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,980
isn't just after gangsters.

145
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,980
He has another

146
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,500
important mission,

147
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
taking down

148
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,900
corrupt cops.

149
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,500
He's started to look for

150
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,380
dirt on you.

151
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
What can he possibly do?

152
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,100
He's just a spoiled rich kid.

153
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,460
But he's hard to handle.

154
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,940
I've dealt with him before.

155
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,300
Trust me,

156
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,740
as the old saying goes,

157
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,660
"Strike first to gain the upper hand."

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,220
Good luck.

159
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,740
And another one,

160
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,580
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

161
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,940
Hope you like

162
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,460
our coffee.

163
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,420
Nanping will be fine, right?

164
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
(Ward Area, No Admittance)
yes.

165
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,380
That's right.

166
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,120
Nanping is really tough.

167
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,940
Yes.

168
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,900
Liu Zhendong!

169
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,100
Zhongxin,

170
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,420
are you crazy?

171
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,500
Liu Zhendong,

172
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,620
it's all your fault.

173
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,540
Nanping regretted it because of you.

174
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,590
Why did you come back?

175
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,420
If you're such a narrow-minded man,

176
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,660
Nanping really shouldn't marry you.

177
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,740
- You...
- I'm an anti-crime agent,

178
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,500
more powerful than Zheng Qiu.

179
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,900
If you hurt me,

180
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,980
you'll face a heavy sentence.

181
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Go ahead.

182
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,860
I don't care!

183
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,420
You'd better get rid of
such a stupid brain!

184
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,260
If I wanted to steal Nanping from you,

185
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,340
I would've done it ages ago.

186
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,540
Use your brain.

187
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,820
Yes,

188
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,180
Nanping is really sweet,

189
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,900
but she's my sister.

190
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,860
My sister!

191
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,860
Come on,

192
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,580
do it.

193
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,140
Hit me in the head.

194
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,860
Let's see if Nanping

195
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,020
will ever

196
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,060
talk to you again.

197
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,620
Do it!

198
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,100
Zhongxin,

199
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,740
I do understand.

200
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,720
On your wedding day,

201
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,420
so much went wrong.

202
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,860
Your dad came back to life,

203
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,260
but he died so soon.

204
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,420
No one would

205
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,620
be able to handle

206
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,140
the pain.

207
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,660
But we're from Shanhai Gang.

208
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,540
We're bound to take more

209
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
than others do.

210
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,540
Right now, you can't

211
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,780
calm down and think straight.

212
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,540
If you keep giving up on yourself,

213
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,020
I'll look down on you.

214
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,660
You've been here for 20 years.

215
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,180
Have you done anything else

216
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,060
other than hooking up with women?

217
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,700
No.

218
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,020
Here,

219
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,580
I...

220
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,620
I'm very capable.

221
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,460
My people...

222
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,540
Your people?

223
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,340
They're all useless!

224
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,780
Two of them died,

225
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,420
and one was arrested.

226
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,780
If I hadn't shown up in time,

227
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,180
they would've sold you out.

228
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,100
I underestimated our enemy,

229
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,820
but I'm still capable.

230
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,700
- In Lion City...
- Say that again,

231
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,180
and I'll send you to jail.

232
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,740
All the things you've done

233
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,220
could get you a hundred years!

234
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,100
Mr. James.

235
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,360
We're friends.

236
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,460
As for Liu Zhendong,

237
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,500
I'll deal with him myself.

238
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,270
Trust me.

239
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm capable.

240
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,940
Show me.

241
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,300
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

242
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,460
You're back so late.

243
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,420
I didn't see you come in.

244
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,780
Have some soup.

245
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,940
Gui taught me this.

246
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,780
It's good.

247
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,580
You picked it up fast.

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,460
Sit down.

249
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,220
(As Present)

250
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,580
I came back just to check on you.

251
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,780
If I knew you were fine,

252
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,340
I wouldn't have come back.

253
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,140
Are we

254
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,300
troubling you?

255
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,100
It's not about you.

256
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,900
A lot has happened.

257
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,020
And I just...

258
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I heard

259
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,660
Ms. Nanping got hurt.

260
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,860
Is it serious?

261
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
It's not just

262
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,900
physical injury

263
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,380
but also a wound to her heart.

264
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,180
Her dad was framed and arrested,

265
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,460
and her husband

266
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,620
stabbed her.

267
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,780
Poor girl.

268
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,260
Back then,

269
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,420
because of me,

270
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,940
you two ended up

271
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,140
misunderstanding each other.

272
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,580
How is that your fault?

273
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,420
You had a child.

274
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,540
Why didn't you ask
Officer Gou to write to me?

275
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,140
If you didn't care about me,

276
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,020
wouldn't that just

277
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,260
bother you?

278
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,180
This child

279
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,540
was meant to be with you,

280
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,340
so you met again.

281
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,220
Do you like this place?

282
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,300
I really like it.

283
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,580
This yard is pretty big.

284
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
(As Present)

285
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,700
There's enough space for him.

286
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,620
I have to go.

287
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,100
Just listen to my mom.

288
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,100
Time for some fresh air.

289
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,820
Boss, your injury hasn't healed.

290
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,020
Maybe you shouldn't go.

291
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,500
We won't go.

292
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,220
Then you'll have to wait
until next week.

293
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,500
I want a bit of sunshine.

294
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,900
Alright.

295
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,260
One, two.

296
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,580
Boss.

297
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,900
Someone's coming.

298
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,140
You looked so familiar.

299
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,900
Turns out it's Master Cheng.

300
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,090
Weng...

301
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,320
Weng Fucai, right?

302
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,660
You still remember my name.

303
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,800
Why are you still in jail?

304
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,460
Because of you!

305
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,500
You kidnapped rich people's kids

306
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,390
and killed them
after receiving the money.

307
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,940
You deserve this, okay?

308
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,780
How could you blame me?

309
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,420
I kidnapped so many people,

310
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,500
and the police never captured me.

311
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,980
However, the powerful

312
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,940
Shanhai Gang

313
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
blocked us and my hostage.

314
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,420
It's our duty

315
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,580
to wipe out the evil for the people.

316
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,740
Now you're also here.

317
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,050
This is the price for being

318
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,180
the police's lackey!

319
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,980
Watch your language!

320
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,420
Shanhai Gang would never
allow a rascal like you

321
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,680
to harm the innocent.

322
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,020
You cripple,

323
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,260
today is the day

324
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,740
you die!

325
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,700
Get them!

326
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Boss, get up!

327
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,260
Come on, get up!

328
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,020
Get down!

329
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,220
Get down!

330
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,300
I said down!

331
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,660
Officer Xu,

332
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,980
they started it first.

333
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,960
Lock them all up!

334
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,570
(Cheng Hui Finally Brought to Justice)
Nanping,

335
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,540
where did these papers

336
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,020
come from?

337
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,530
The nurse got them this morning.

338
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,700
When I left the office,

339
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,380
Mr. Xiao asked me

340
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,780
not to show you these papers.

341
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,060
Do we have

342
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,580
any similar reports

343
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,100
or

344
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,620
reposts of these articles?

345
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,380
No.

346
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Mr. Xiao

347
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,900
believes Cheng Hui is innocent.

348
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,300
He even suggested

349
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,500
we do a fair report

350
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,700
to introduce

351
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,500
Cheng Hui to the readers.

352
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,500
Has anyone started on it?

353
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,540
They don't think

354
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,980
they can handle it.

355
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Tell Mr. Xiao

356
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,300
I'll do it.

357
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,060
Grandma.

358
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,980
Give me a hug.

359
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,940
Mom...

360
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,660
- Hug.
- Mom.

361
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,980
Mom.

362
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,620
Mom.

363
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,740
Stay here and play with your mom,

364
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,700
okay?

365
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,300
Take care of him at home.

366
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,660
Don't go anywhere.

367
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,220
Mom.

368
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Are you going out?

369
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,500
You sound so sweet.

370
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,500
I'll meet someone important.

371
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,100
It's time to settle an old matter.

372
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,460
Mom.

373
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,860
Be careful, okay?

374
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,180
Don't worry.

375
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,620
Sir.

376
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,540
You have an appointment?

377
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,500
No.

378
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,460
She...

379
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,620
Officer Zheng,

380
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,740
you're such a high official.

381
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,930
As your old friend, I can't see you

382
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,720
without an appointment now?

383
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,300
Hong Yan, it's you.

384
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,740
What a surprise.

385
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,380
Have a seat.

386
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Your staff is so careless.

387
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,100
Just now,

388
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,150
I walked right in,

389
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,370
