=Episode 6=

3
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,870
Morning, sir!

4
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,830
As you were.

5
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,280
I just received an intel
the Shanhai Gang is planning to

6
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,270
disrupt the peace.

7
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,150
They'll pose a threat to our society.

8
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,750
The person behind all this

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,120
is Cheng Hui.

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,240
Zhendong,

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,520
I need you to help me gather evidence.

12
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,550
No favoritism.

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,030
Sorry, sir.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,430
This is too difficult.

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,920
I cannot do it.

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,800
What are you doing?

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,430
Get down from there now!

18
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,550
Put your uniform back on now.

19
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,030
I'm not going to ask you again.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,480
Listen, westerner.

21
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,240
I'll give it back.

22
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,310
From now on, I won't work for you.

23
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,520
What's wrong with him?

24
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,710
I don't know.

25
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,800
Just got here?

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,150
- Officer Liu.
- Take good care of him.

27
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,680
Morning, sir!

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
Sir!

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,590
Why are you dressed like this?

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
Are you serious?

31
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,990
Doing business this early?

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,870
Sir, it's not about the time.

33
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,190
You make me want to do business.

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,750
There's new tea?

35
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,750
Of course.

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,710
Come here.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
Our new tea.

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,210
Come over.

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,240
Are you here by choice?

40
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,390
Were you forced into this?

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,680
Who hit you?

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,430
Sir,

43
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,550
she's a newcomer.

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,040
She needs some guidance.

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,360
I've told you before.

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,930
Just focus on your business.

47
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,230
If you break the law,

48
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,190
the police might not care,

49
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,470
but if you cross the line

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,600
or hurt your own people,

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,320
Shanhai Gang won't go easy on you!

52
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,430
I got it.

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,480
Okay.

54
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,470
How old are you?

55
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,830
20.

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,430
Also,

57
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,430
if she doesn't want to,

58
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,870
don't force her to take clients.

59
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,920
You need to handle her meals.

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,600
If you don't want to eat it,

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,750
don't give it to her either.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,120
As for the money,

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
put it on my tab.

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,160
Alright, whatever you say.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,990
Officer Liu, take care.

66
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,380
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Boss, about this matter,

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,010
- I know more about it...
- Uncle!

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,320
Uncles.

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,880
I, Liu Zhendong,

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
am back.

72
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,470
Please take me in.

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,910
Qi.

74
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,950
Take Zhendong

75
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,280
to take a shower and get changed.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,760
No need.

77
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,870
I grew up

78
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,830
in this yard.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,760
Heihu told me

80
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,040
I used to run around with no pants,

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,280
so it's not

82
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,070
embarrassing.

83
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,470
Uncle.

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,040
You sent me to Europe to study.

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,800
When I got back,

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,070
you had me join the police.

87
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,470
I did pretty well.

88
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,600
In just a few years,

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,680
I became a team leader.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,520
I didn't

91
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,990
let you down.

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,320
I know.

93
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,640
Get up first.

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,880
Zhendong.

95
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,470
Come on.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,760
Young Master.

97
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,630
Did they bully you

98
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,990
and take your uniform away?

99
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,280
I don't think so.

100
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,120
Zhendong must've been wronged

101
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,510
and given it back

102
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,870
to the westerners, right?

103
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,470
Yes.

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,920
Uncle Heihu, you know me well.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Uncle.

106
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,870
When I was born,

107
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,520
you held me in your arms

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
and said

109
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,720
I was the youngest member
in Shanhai Gang.

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,230
Were you serious

111
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
or just joking?

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
I was serious.

113
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,880
That'd be great.

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
I've been here for over 20 years,

115
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,480
so I'm an old member, right?

116
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,480
Zhendong's name

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
is definitely on our roster.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,430
I just checked it.

119
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,950
Now that Xiongwu is gone,

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
we should offer Zhendong

121
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
a good position.

122
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,510
It's just that...

123
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,190
But you've been
a policeman for too long,

124
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,280
and so much has happened lately...

125
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,510
My bad.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
My bad.

127
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,190
What are you waiting for?

128
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,150
Didn't Boss tell us

129
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,070
to train the young ones?

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
Well, we've got one here.

131
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,150
Zhendong,

132
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
would you like to be

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,760
my deputy?

134
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,190
Your deputy just died.

135
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,150
Not a good sign.

136
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,750
I don't care about the title.

137
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,390
Uncle,

138
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,920
I want to find the killer

139
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,630
and avenge my dad!

140
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,710
Zhendong,

141
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,990
you're Xiongwu's son.

142
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,550
It's inappropriate for you

143
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,990
to do this.

144
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,350
Liuliu.

145
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,000
You haven't finished

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,960
your speech.

147
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
On the roster,

148
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,910
it says Zhendong is a lackey.

149
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
If he wants to earn respect...

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
he should...

151
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
Zhendong,

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
you studied abroad,

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,400
and you were a leader.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,480
Do you accept to be

155
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,840
a lackey?

156
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,230
I can accept it.

157
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,590
My former position
doesn't mean anything!

158
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,840
I'd rather be a lackey

159
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,720
of Shanhai Gang

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
than a chief!

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,960
Sheyan.

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
Zhendong is one of our own.

163
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm leaving him to you.

164
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,830
Okay!

165
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,840
You entrusted Zhendong to Sheyan

166
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,670
on purpose, right?

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,550
Sheyan couldn't become

168
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,910
the leader,

169
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,910
so he must've been upset.

170
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,910
He also caused Xiongwu some trouble.

171
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,150
Now that he's training Zhendong,

172
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,080
it's somehow making it up to Xiongwu.

173
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,750
If Sheyan holds a grudge,

174
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,270
will he bully Zhendong?

175
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,510
He won't.

176
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,440
Sheyan is the leader of Zhongxiao Hall.

177
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
He deals with traitors

178
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,910
and takes care of our brothers.

179
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,030
He's never biased.

180
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,440
He and Xiongwu

181
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,670
both had a bad temper

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,030
and wouldn't back down.

183
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,510
However, their brotherhood

184
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
can't be broken

185
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,390
by some arguments.

186
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,680
Besides,

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,480
Zhendong

188
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,840
is Xiongwu's son.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,720
Don't worry, he'll treat him well.

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,670
What's so funny?

191
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,910
We're all

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,870
under your control.

193
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,390
No one can escape.

194
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,670
You got it wrong.

195
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,990
You're all in my heart.

196
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,960
When we started

197
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,510
Shanhai Gang,

198
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,600
we nearly lost everything.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,440
If Sheyan hadn't

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,750
broken out and brought reinforcements,

201
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
I wouldn't have survived, right?

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,030
His leg

203
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,990
was hurt in that battle.

204
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Where should we put Young Master?

205
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,350
Look,

206
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,960
every basket's already full.

207
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,840
It's all trash.

208
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,990
Just throw it away.

209
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,910
Maybe somewhere near Shanding Gang.

210
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,990
Let's do A'nan's people

211
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,230
a favor.

212
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,720
Good idea.

213
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Hand the orphan of our gang

214
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,030
right over to our enemy

215
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,200
and let them kill him.

216
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,200
- Boss.
- I'm not your boss!

217
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,440
If I died,

218
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,080
you'd do the same to my son.

219
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,670
No way, Boss.

220
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
But his father is Xiongwu.

221
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,630
What's wrong?

222
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,120
How dare you call him

223
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,360
by his name?

224
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,960
Back then, he smashed your casino

225
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,440
because your croupier

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
cheated.

227
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,670
How could you hold a grudge?

228
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,630
I...

229
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,480
Xiongwu and I followed Master Cheng

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,600
and fought for our gang.

231
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,960
But because of you,

232
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,630
we were on the outs

233
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,960
and never said a word since!

234
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,030
Boss, I taught him a lesson.

235
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,990
Please calm down.

236
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,390
Who did you call trash?

237
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,790
I...

238
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,030
I meant the chicken bones.

239
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,320
Zhendong was born

240
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,960
to be one of us.

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,150
He joined the gang earlier than you did.

242
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,080
You saw him as chicken bones

243
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,480
and threw him away like trash.

244
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,040
Eat them!

246
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,390
Listen, all of you,

247
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,840
I'll have Zhendong's back.

248
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,000
If anyone dares to set him up

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,670
or bully him,

250
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,840
I won't go easy on him!

251
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,000
(Da De Xing Restaurant & Teahouse)

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,960
- Aye!
- Aye!

253
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,360
Mr. He, it's been over two years.

254
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,790
Let me pay my respects.

255
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,510
Leader Cheng, please get up.

256
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,840
(Mr. He)
Don't make me worry.

257
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,990
Come on, have a seat.

258
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,510
Mr. He.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,840
Master Cheng prepared this for you.

260
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,200
Do you like it?

261
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,030
Leader Cheng, you're so thoughtful.

262
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,080
You still remember

263
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,560
what I like.

264
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,600
Mr. He,

265
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,270
I'm no longer the leader.

266
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,600
Just call me Cheng Hui.

267
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,750
Today's paper says

268
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,870
Cheng Hui takes over Shanhai Gang again.

269
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,940
(Lion City in Turmoil,
Cheng Hui Takes Over Shanhai Gang Again)

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,990
That's the reporter's assumption.

271
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,990
Over 30 years ago,

272
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,150
I was rushing to a business meeting.

273
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,440
My rival had messed with my car,

274
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,590
and the tire blew out.

275
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,080
That's when I met you.

276
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,630
You took a shortcut with your rickshaw

277
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,600
and got me there in 20 minutes.

278
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
That day,

279
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,360
I closed the biggest deal

280
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
of my life,

281
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
but it also caused you

282
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
a lot of trouble.

283
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,960
My rival

284
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,550
even broke your rickshaw.

285
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,600
But you got me a new one

286
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,870
and gave me a big sum of money.

287
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
With that money,

288
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,630
I rented the yard

289
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,720
and provided a shelter

290
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
for my brothers.

291
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,910
And now it's become

292
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,440
our headquarters.

293
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,720
We've known each other forever.

294
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,680
Mr. He,

295
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
you're my lifesaver.

296
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,680
You're too kind.

297
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,350
Today,

298
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm here to learn from you.

299
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,510
Times have changed.

300
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,000
And I'm not sure

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,200
which path

302
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,870
we should take.

303
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,560
I need your advice.

304
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,560
Well, in my opinion,

305
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,150
the main business matters most.

306
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,280
Main business?

307
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,670
We all started with rickshaws.

308
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,240
What main business do we have?

309
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,390
Don't look down on rickshaws.

310
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
At that time,

311
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,910
it was the most important

312
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,030
means of transportation.

313
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,680
Transportation?

314
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
Mr. He, that's a sharp insight.

315
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,390
Right now,
Southeast Asia needs rebuilding.

316
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,320
All trades need transport.

317
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,910
The point is

318
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,480
it requires a lot of people.

319
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,600
Cheng Hui, you have many old buddies.

320
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,440
You can't bear to kick them out, right?

321
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,110
Mr. He,

322
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,720
you know me so well.

323
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Thanks for your advice.

324
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,400
Please.

325
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,030
It turns out Mr. He and you

326
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,720
are on the same page.

327
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,480
In this case, Shanhai Gang

328
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,440
can be Shanhai Company now.

329
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,670
A few years ago,

330
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,030
we were ready for this.

331
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
But Jin Yaju's death

332
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,840
ruined our plan.

333
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,600
However, the neighbors on Shanhai Street

334
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,200
might not get used to it.

335
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
Just a matter of time.

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,960
Shanhai Company

337
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,030
will still protect them

338
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,240
and ensure their safety.

339
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,150
If they buy our shares,

340
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,720
they'll get profits by year-end.

341
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,320
So, you've thought it through.

342
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
I won't use

343
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,510
the car tomorrow.

344
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,560
Drive to the dock

345
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,080
and pick up the rich merchants.

346
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,960
Set clear prices

347
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,510
for rides

348
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,470
and rents.

349
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,150
How can we do that?

350
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,600
This is your car.

351
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,480
Pick up merchants

352
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,670
and charge rent,

353
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,630
this...

354
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,870
This will make headlines.

355
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,800
Great.

356
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,160
Once we're famous,

357
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,990
we can charge even more.

358
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,440
If we want to do
transportation business,

359
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,270
whether it's people or goods,

360
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,870
we have to be the best.

361
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
But right now,

362
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,440
transport business

363
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,240
can only account for

364
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,790
about 15 percent of our income.

365
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,230
No rush.

366
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,510
We've got to take it slow.

367
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,270
Anyway,

368
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,240
for a real business,

369
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,390
our effort will finally pay off,

370
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,360
and we'll get stronger.

371
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,440
- Stop.
- Get over here.

372
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
You, get over here.

373
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,710
Hurry up.

374
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,200
What's going on here?

375
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,150
It's no big deal.

376
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,270
Last year, the government
started a reform,

377
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,630
saying they'd limit
rickshaws on the streets.

378
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,070
Seriously?

379
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,350
But I've felt

380
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,670
it's just an excuse.

381
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,390
By the end of every month,

382
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,800
the police fine us.

383
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,280
Once we pay, it's all good.

384
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,470
It's basically a protection fee.

385
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,830
Officer,

386
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,870
if we can't get on the streets,

387
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,560
how can we make money?

388
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,310
I've got old parents
and little kids at home,

389
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,590
waiting for me to feed them,

390
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,550
sir.

391
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,440
This?

392
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,880
Pull rickshaws?

393
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,790
We paid for them, okay?

394
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,960
Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet

395
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,070
has over 100 rickshaws,

396
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,030
and they're running fine.

397
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,270
Now they're suddenly worthless.

398
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,190
You're targeting Shanhai Gang.

399
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,510
Master Cheng is back in Lion City.

400
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,550
You better be careful.

401
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,190
Look, the fines

402
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,150
won't go to my pocket, okay?

403
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
I also have a wife and kids.

404
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,040
They count on my paycheck.

405
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,160
But we have to

406
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
make a living, okay?

407
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,590
But I also have to

408
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,630
make a living.

409
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
- Master.
- Master.

410
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,510
- Sir.
- Officer Liu.

411
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm not a police officer anymore.

412
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,160
You're the officer here.

413
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,000
Good afternoon, Officer Gou!

414
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,360
Gou?
[*Gou: Dog]

415
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,520
Guys, dog!

416
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,800
Why are you laughing?

417
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,080
Gou is my surname.

418
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,800
I don't bark.

419
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,320
Exactly. Don't laugh.

420
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,600
Hold it back.

421
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,190
Okay.

422
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,880
Sir,

423
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,560
why are you doing this on the street?

424
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't even ask.

425
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,640
Since you left,

426
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,960
our new boss

427
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,270
has been giving me a hard time,

428
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,430
asking me to patrol the streets.

429
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,360
Please go to another street.

430
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,480
With rickshaws

431
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,950
printed with "Shanhai",

432
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
they're all my relatives.

433
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
Look at him.

434
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,470
He's my uncle.

435
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,680
Aren't we like brothers?

436
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,750
Yes.

437
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,790
So, my uncle

438
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,080
is also your uncle, right?

439
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,230
Uncle.

440
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,080
Could you walk a bit further?

441
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,400
Two blocks away,

442
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,670
it's Shanding Gang's fleet.

443
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,150
Just fine them a bit more.

444
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,320
I'll treat you to barbecue next time.

445
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,200
Treat me?

446
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,070
Of course.

447
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,000
We had a deal,

448
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,390
still brothers.

449
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,550
Alright.

450
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,550
Let's go.

451
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,510
Let's go.

452
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Thanks, Young Master.

453
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
Thank you, Young Master!

454
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,880
Don't call me Young Master.

455
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,840
Just call me Zhendong.

456
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,560
We're all brothers.

457
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,510
Remember,

458
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,710
on these two days each month,

459
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,280
the police would fine rickshaw pullers.

460
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,510
Keep your heads down then.

461
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,590
Understood.

462
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,070
Okay, just get back to work.

463
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,760
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

464
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,160
Let's go.

465
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,140
(Shanhai)

466
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,220
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

467
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Dad.

468
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,680
You're sweating a lot.

469
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Wash your face.

470
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,950
How did it go?

471
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,200
Dare not speak?

472
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,670
Then it has to be one of our men.

473
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Yes.

474
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,670
All hall leaders are suspicious.

475
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,660
(Gamble)

476
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,640
Xiong.

477
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,790
I'll bet with you.

478
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,440
I wouldn't dare.

479
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,040
Last night,

480
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,110
didn't you get so many

481
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,080
identical numbers in a row?

482
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,480
You had good luck.

483
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,520
Why not bet with me?

484
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,480
Identical numbers always win.

485
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,710
We got the guests' money.

486
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
You're the hall leader.

487
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,150
It's different.

488
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,430
So, you really cheated?

489
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
Hand me the dice.

490
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,750
All identical numbers!

491
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,990
Leader, it's incredible!

492
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,310
Impressive!

493
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Incredible!

494
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,790
Look at you.

495
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,830
You're using
the fair and just reputation

496
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,390
of Shanhai Gang

497
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,670
to bully our guests!

498
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,600
Leader, leader!

499
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,030
Cheater!

500
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,350
How dare you cheat?

501
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,840
Leader, please stop!

502
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,880
- Boss!
- Boss!

503
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,840
Get out of my way!

504
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,880
A few years ago,

505
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,430
Uncle Xiongwu took over the casino.

506
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,150
Sheyan wasn't happy about it.

507
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,840
It was run by Zhongxiao Hall.

508
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,670
Yet Uncle Xiongwu taught his men

509
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,430
a lesson without telling him.

510
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,760
Sheyan is a proud man.

511
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,870
He couldn't accept it.
