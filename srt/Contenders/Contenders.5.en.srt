3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,690
I haven't been to Europe in years.

4
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,520
Why don't we

5
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,150
settle down together

6
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,090
in Europe?

7
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,340
Why, Mom?

8
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Over there,

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,800
no matter how hard we Chinese try,

10
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,970
we never really have a place.

11
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,370
But in Lion City,

12
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,250
even though it's also
ruled by the westerners,

13
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,310
at least we still have

14
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,810
a shot to succeed.

15
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,220
Just like my uncle.

16
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,810
But your dad...

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,290
He's already gone.

18
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,970
He never uses his brain.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,570
He was bound to end like this.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,250
I'm just worried
Lion City isn't safe for you.

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,460
Don't worry, Mom.

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,970
I'm smart.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,130
Cheng Hui is back.

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,460
He'll look into

25
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,240
everything.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,530
Then I'll help him.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,250
Alright, Mom.

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,460
Don't worry, okay?

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,620
I know what to tell him

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,730
and what I shouldn't tell him.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,220
I know what I'm doing.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,580
It's so crowded here today.

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,870
It's so lively.

34
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,850
Indeed.

(Shanhai Is Our Home)

36
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,420
Boss.

37
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,720
Master Cheng, look here.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,660
What are you doing?

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,980
Zhongxin.

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,190
Boss, don't worry.

41
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,460
This newspaper is friendly.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,190
Hurry up.

43
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,130
Take the photo.

(Filial Piety)

45
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,890
Boss.

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,510
Uncle.

47
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,580
I'm glad you're back.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,220
This isn't the place for you.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,300
Please leave.

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,260
Let's greet our leader!

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,410
(As Present)
Greetings, Leader!

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,290
Yes, I'm back.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,220
But I'm not the leader.

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,410
But Shanhai Gang

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,580
must have a leader.

56
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,450
Liuliu.

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,930
Let's discuss this later.

58
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,370
Let's bring Fa's memorial tablet first.

59
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,570
Fa,

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,170
you left under that name.

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,870
We can't hold

62
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,100
a big funeral for you.

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,420
Sorry.

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,220
(Tablet of My Late Brother Chen A'fa)

65
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,010
Liuliu,

66
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,870
ask them to go back.

67
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,810
Okay.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,540
Liuliu.

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,070
Boss,

70
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,020
you're finally back.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,460
Still so strong.

72
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,570
Fa!

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Get up.

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,060
Get up, Zhendong.

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,340
Fa died in my stead.

76
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,140
He brought me up.

77
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,610
I want to spend time with him.

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,140
Xiongwu is gone.

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,610
Now Shanhai Gang is struggling.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,050
Master Cheng

81
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,610
must lead our gang again.

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,580
If you don't agree

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,050
but let us fight for it,

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,850
we'll be the joke of the city.

85
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,890
Liuliu,

86
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,020
fighting is good.

87
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,340
We treat the gang as our home

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,700
and fight for it.

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,860
It's good.

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,660
Brothers,

91
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,930
when I was away,

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,020
you did a great job.

93
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,580
But today,

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,140
let's not talk about the new leader.

95
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,180
Let's focus on

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,780
the future

97
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,370
of Shanhai Gang.

98
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,660
Elder Zhuang,

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,740
you're the oldest here.

100
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,810
Why don't you go first?

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,780
Well, I handle the money.

102
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,140
I'll serve the group.

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,780
Peng.

104
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,050
His full name is Huang Youcai.

105
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,360
Come on,

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,860
tell us what you think.

107
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,810
Okay.

108
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,850
Boss,

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,260
to be honest,

110
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,420
nothing else really matters.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,940
Our priority is to make money.

112
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,220
If the headquarters hadn't

113
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,100
meddled in our business,

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,700
Fengyun Hall

115
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,790
would've earned

116
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,180
way more money.

117
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,130
In other words,

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,660
in Lion City,

119
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,370
money works better than people.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,540
As long as we're rich,

121
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,250
we'll have more members.

122
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,730
In my opinion,

123
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,730
Shanhai Gang needs money

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,420
to go forward.

125
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,730
Heihu.

126
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,780
Do you disagree?

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,610
Now that you've asked,

128
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,250
I'll just be honest.

129
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,010
Maybe Weiyuan Hall

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,540
doesn't earn much,

131
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,970
but in the past two years,

132
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,580
our deputy leader died,

133
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,610
and our general got injured.

134
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,890
Shanhai Gang's territory and reputation

135
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,180
aren't built on money

136
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,940
but on our strength.

137
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,670
I think Peng has a point.

138
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,610
That's nonsense!

139
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,210
Everyone, sit down.

140
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,010
Hall Leader She,

141
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
what do you think?

142
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,940
Boss, just call me Sheyan.

143
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,940
I've gotten used to it all these years.

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,940
Maybe Zhongxiao Hall

145
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,370
hasn't earned as much as Fengyun Hall,

146
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,820
but it's still a lot.

147
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,820
When it comes to fighting,

148
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,340
Heihu has contributed a lot,

149
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,100
but if you need me for anything,

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,940
I'll never back down.

151
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,910
Now that you're here,

152
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,060
it's not my call to decide

153
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,100
which path to follow.

154
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,130
I lead Zhongxiao Hall.

155
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,720
If I can't even

156
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,060
stay loyal,

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,340
do I deserve the name?

158
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,490
That's too much.

159
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,210
Have a seat.

160
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,700
I asked you to speak freely.

161
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,090
Liuliu.

162
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,380
What do you think?

163
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
Boss, you'll decide

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,460
which path to follow.

165
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,890
Let's reappoint you

166
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,730
as the gang leader.

167
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
To be honest, I'm too old

168
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,100
to fight.

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,030
I really hope

170
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,420
someone young and promising

171
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,060
can be the new leader

172
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,180
and make Shanhai Gang

173
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,970
thrive.

174
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,610
You joined the group

175
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,220
at different times,

176
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,030
but we're peers

177
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,850
who fought side by side.

178
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,150
I want to

179
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,270
pick someone from the youngsters.

180
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,890
Do you have a problem?

181
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,250
Boss, it's your call.

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,460
Master Cheng,

183
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,220
you really have a vision.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,580
However, Shanhai Gang

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,010
has grown stronger.

186
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,580
The seniors with achievements

187
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,010
can still play their part,

188
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,220
yet can the youngsters

189
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,940
really hold the fort?

190
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,060
Back when I was the leader,

191
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,700
I was attacked many times.

192
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,210
I was lucky

193
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,630
to have survived

194
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,570
all of them.

195
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,750
However, Xiongwu

196
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,460
was killed while in office.

197
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,820
That's Shanhai Gang's biggest shame.

198
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,220
If we can't catch the killer,

199
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,610
what will others think of us?

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,130
How about this?

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,510
Among the four hall leaders

202
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,910
and the youngsters,

203
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,870
whoever catches the killer

204
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,250
will make a name for himself

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,130
and be our new leader.

206
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,130
Does anyone have a problem?

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,540
Boss.

208
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,850
It's a good idea.

209
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,030
Xiongwu was killed

210
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,970
in your warehouse.

211
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,630
Looks like you've got the upper hand.

212
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,570
What do you mean?

213
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,390
You're being sarcastic.
What do you want?

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,660
What are you talking about?

215
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,180
Boss, sorry about that.

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,130
Since no one's against it,

217
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,300
then it's a deal.

218
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,300
Zhongxin.

219
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,570
Zhongxin.

220
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,080
What's wrong?

221
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,130
There's a woman outside.

222
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,220
She wants to see Master Cheng.

223
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,060
A woman?

224
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,380
How old is she?

225
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,260
20-something.

226
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,610
She's quite pretty.

227
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,300
It's her.

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,020
Zhong...

229
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,780
What are you doing here?

230
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,820
You want to see Master Cheng.

231
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,610
Which newspaper?

232
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,690
Lion City Evening Post.

233
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,220
It doesn't work for us.

234
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,810
Master Cheng's not available.

235
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,330
Go.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,940
Just go.

237
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,820
You're so arrogant.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,780
Nanping.

239
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,580
What brings you here?

240
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,730
Why can't I come back?

241
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,790
This is my home, okay?

242
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,320
No, I mean...

243
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,240
Of course you can.

244
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,670
But do you know that in Lion City...

245
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,330
Enough. I know you're not a talker.

246
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,970
I want to see him.

247
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,910
How about this?

248
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,460
Tonight, I'll take you in
from the back door.

249
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,330
Tonight?

250
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,810
What about now?

251
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,120
Now...

252
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm hungry.

253
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,510
You're hungry?

254
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,890
Let's have bak kut teh.

255
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,180
It's the place

256
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,900
we always brought you food from.

257
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,420
It had gone bad
before you arrived in Penang.

258
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,340
No way.

259
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,510
I wrapped it tightly

260
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,270
with ice and a bamboo basket

261
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,940
- to make sure...
- Don't be nervous.

262
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,700
I also want to eat at the restaurant.

263
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,200
I've been back for over a year,

264
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,770
and I haven't eaten it.

265
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,030
You're so naughty.

266
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,420
Come on, let's go.

267
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,500
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

268
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,450
Dad.

269
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,660
Checking the books?

270
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,850
You must be tired.

271
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,260
Look,

272
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,200
Elder Zhuang has kept perfect records.

273
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,220
Everything's so clear.

274
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not tired at all.

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,130
But you must be hungry.

276
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,730
I don't feel like eating.

277
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
Bak kut teh

278
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,580
with extra white pepper.

279
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,420
Maybe later.

280
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,100
This isn't from me.

281
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,690
Who bought it?

282
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,420
Look who's here.

283
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,210
Dad.

284
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,490
Ping.

285
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,620
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

286
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,100
(As Present)

287
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,670
Dad.

288
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,610
Do you like it?

289
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,610
It's so good.

290
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,370
Back when Xiongwu and I

291
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,610
just got here,

292
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,850
we didn't

293
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,720
have a penny.

294
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,220
We starved for three days.

295
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,380
Later on,

296
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,930
we found the hometown club

297
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,010
our seniors started

298
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,460
and told them our names,

299
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,890
and they welcomed us in.

300
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,700
They treated us to our first meal,

301
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,770
and it was bak kut teh.

302
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,010
I'll never forget

303
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,010
that meal.

304
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,260
It's okay, Dad.

305
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
I'll buy you bak kut teh every day.

306
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,300
Ping,

307
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,580
why did you come back?

308
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,490
Why can't I come back?

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,580
The press industry here is promising.

310
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,100
And I've always

311
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,150
wanted to be a reporter.

312
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,850
But when you left,

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,340
I made everything clear.

314
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,490
Dad.

315
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,120
You were the gang leader

316
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,370
and had a lot of enemies,

317
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,300
so I couldn't stay in Lion City.

318
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,610
Later, you sent me to Penang.

319
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,020
You only

320
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,060
visited me once half a year
or even once a year.

321
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,450
Yes.

322
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,540
I didn't

323
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,010
take good care of you.

324
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,010
Now you're no longer the leader,

325
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,340
and I'm grown up.

326
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,740
I can protect myself.

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,370
It's more dangerous now.

328
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,350
No one else can find out

329
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,610
about our relationship.

330
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,850
Actually,

331
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,300
Yadajia and Mogu

332
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,300
also have many Chinese newspapers.

333
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,850
I can help you

334
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,060
get a job there.

335
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,250
Dad,

336
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,480
why do you always

337
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,780
try to send me away?

338
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,590
I've grown up

339
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,740
in this courtyard!

340
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,980
Back then,

341
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,400
this place wasn't even

342
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,490
the headquarters of Shanhai Gang.

343
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,160
Many people

344
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,100
lived here.

345
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,000
I played

346
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,410
with many kids here.

347
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,070
I remember Uncle Zheng

348
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,890
often came by to teach us English.

349
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,820
Whenever one family was cooking,

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,980
we would all smell it.

351
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,110
Did you return

352
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,210
because of Zheng Qiu?

353
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,260
Uncle Zheng

354
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,740
heard that I graduated,

355
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,410
so he visited me in Penang

356
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,300
and even introduced me
to some newspapers.

357
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,550
Dad,

358
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,930
actually, Uncle Zheng

359
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,260
really wants to help you.

360
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,500
Will he really help me?

361
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,250
Do you think

362
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,850
you don't need anyone's help?

363
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,400
If Fa hadn't

364
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,480
taken the blame,

365
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,070
you would've been in jail, right?

366
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,100
I never asked anyone to take the blame.

367
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,850
I was set up from the very start.

368
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,320
Then why did you run away?

369
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,160
To clear your name

370
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
and show up in public,

371
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,370
you sacrificed your brother.

372
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,450
Is the leader's position

373
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,100
that important to you?

374
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,260
I'm no longer the leader.

375
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,790
But as long as you're here,

376
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,500
the new leader
will have to listen to you.

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
When I left the office,

378
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,480
I saw the draft

379
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,690
for tomorrow's paper.

380
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,790
Right on the front page,

381
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,580
it says Cheng Hui
takes back Shanhai Gang.

382
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,610
You arranged it, right?

383
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
All I see is power at play.

384
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,030
Do you want to lead the biggest

385
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,690
criminal group in Lion City
until you die?

386
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,030
When did Shanhai Gang

387
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,340
become a criminal group?

388
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,510
You're against

389
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,880
the government and the police.

390
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,300
Aren't you criminals?

391
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,980
You kill people
for territories, set fire

392
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,440
to places, and find scapegoats.

393
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,200
Aren't you criminals?

394
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,110
Don't you dare slander

395
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,260
Shanhai Gang like that again!

396
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,100
After my mom died,

397
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,680
you sent me to Penang.

398
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,170
You shed tears on the way,

399
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,880
saying you didn't want

400
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,300
to live in violence anymore.

401
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,920
You said you only wanted

402
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,860
to watch me

403
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,060
grow up safely.

404
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,580
Don't you remember?

405
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,740
I can't do it now.

406
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,210
I need more time.

407
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,290
Dad,

408
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,980
is it really that hard?

409
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,450
If you announce

410
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,450
that you'll leave Shanhai Gang,

411
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
we won't need to

412
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,260
sneak around like this.

413
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,170
I'd never make an announcement.

414
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,240
I won't admit the gang I built

415
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,790
is a criminal group.

416
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,680
Shanhai Gang

417
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,480
is our home.

418
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,110
Even when we're old

419
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,050
and retired,

420
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,550
we're proud of

421
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,720
the blood we spilled

422
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,340
and the things we did for the gang.

423
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,890
I'd never leave the gang.

424
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,300
So, in your heart,

425
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,850
Shanhai Gang is more important than me.

426
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,440
- Nanping!
- Zhongxin!

427
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,380
Follow her.

428
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,980
Don't let her walk alone at night.

429
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,210
Nanping!

430
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,530
Nanping!

431
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,340
Sir.

432
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,940
- Officer Liu.
- Officer Liu.

433
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,790
Officer Liu.

434
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,930
I heard you were arrested.

435
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,100
I can't believe it.

436
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,340
They must've made a mistake.

437
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,030
You're smart.

438
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,580
You know it was a mistake, right?

439
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,680
Wish you prosperity.

440
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Thank you.

441
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,620
Grab a mango.

442
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,900
No need.

443
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,180
Okay.

444
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,660
Come on.

445
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,740
Good morning, sir!

446
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,130
I didn't bring coffee today.

447
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,270
No need.

448
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,350
We chipped in

449
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,590
and bought coffee for you.

450
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,970
- No need.
- Don't be so polite.

451
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,620
From now on,

452
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,310
I can't treat you guys

453
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,250
to coffee every day.

454
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,140
You know what,

455
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,610
I'll just give you red packets.

456
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,900
Yours.

457
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,860
Perfect, all three of you.

458
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,900
Thanks.

459
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,070
- Thanks.
- Officer Liu.

460
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,540
You're really too kind.

461
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,300
We're brothers.

462
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,530
Remember,

463
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,680
I've been your leader

464
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,100
for four months.

465
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,340
No matter what happens,

466
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,450
we'll always have each other's back.

467
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,740
Of course.

468
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,540
What did he say?

469
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,690
Can you translate for him?

470
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,550
Officer Liu says we're brothers.

471
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,490
Okay?

472
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,860
Everyone.

473
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,580
