3
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,310
How's your business?

4
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,710
Good.

5
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,520
Ever since I modified your rickshaw,

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,680
I've been busy.

7
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,200
Many people want to modify theirs.

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,120
See? That's a good thing.

9
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,560
Hurry, get back to work.

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,120
You're not kicking me out?

11
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
He's your nephew.

12
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,680
You're way too strict.

13
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,120
He's so scared.

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Master Cheng,

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,870
he talks too much.

16
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,680
If he stays in Lion City,

17
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,710
he'll make trouble again,

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,310
and I can't handle that.

19
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,310
Live and learn.

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,700
After this,

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,080
he'll definitely be more careful.

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,240
Right, Xiang?

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
Yes.

24
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,750
I won't talk nonsense again.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,870
Don't drink too much.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,430
Drinking leads to slip-ups.

27
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,680
That's how trouble finds you.

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,080
Got it.

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
I'll keep that in mind.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,990
So, you're

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
letting him stay?

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
Of course.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
All the rickshaws

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,800
of Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,010
need to be modified

36
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,870
into pedicabs within a month.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,000
He's my mentor.

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,460
We need people now more than ever.

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,810
If I kick him out,

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,360
I'll take a huge loss.

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,360
Kowtow to Master Cheng!

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,820
- Say thanks!
- Stop.

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,680
Thanks, Master Cheng!

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,590
No need, get up.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,470
Alright, get back to work.

46
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,150
Thanks, Master Cheng.

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,080
You got nothing to say to me?

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,310
Now that you're here,

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
you can ask me

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,680
anything.

51
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,030
Actually, the day
I came back to Lion City,

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,190
I already figured you out.

53
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,560
What about the people
who care about you?

54
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,910
He's already dead!

55
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,630
Even if you figure it out,

56
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,840
what difference does it make?

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,030
Get me out of here,

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
or I'll die in front of you!

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
You did that

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,310
just because you wanted me

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,870
to leave Lion City.

62
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,310
You were afraid I'd find out
Zhendong got his dad killed.

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,240
However, your action

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
made him more suspicious.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
Luckily,

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,120
I figured out soon

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,070
that Zhendong didn't
cause Zhendong's death.

68
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,040
A real hero

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
can kill countless enemies,

70
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,390
but he'd never hurt his own family,

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,630
especially not his father.

72
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,750
I was so stupid.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,870
Zhendong is young and impulsive.

74
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,750
I was worried...

75
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,750
Stop!

76
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,600
You brat!

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
Liu Xiongwu!

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,310
You rascal!

79
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,600
How dare you call my name?

80
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
- Son!
- What?

81
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,680
- Son!
- What do you want?

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
I...

83
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,120
Mom, Mom!

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,070
You...

85
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,950
Liu Xiongwu.

86
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,240
One day, I'll kill you!

87
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,190
He was just angry, that's all.

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
He's grown up.

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,870
He wanted to protect you.

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,950
He just wanted to prove

91
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,310
that he's a grown-up man.

92
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,230
There are things

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
I have to tell you.

94
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,680
Now that you're here,

95
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,360
I won't hold back anymore.

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,480
When I was young,

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,750
I did have feelings for you,

98
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,390
and it wasn't

99
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,360
just gratitude.

100
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,360
Then I found out

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
you married Shuzhen,

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,310
and I decided to marry Xiongwu.

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,190
After that, I never felt the same

104
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,150
for anyone else,

105
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,870
even after

106
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,790
the divorce.

107
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,120
What I said to you

108
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,410
was so embarrassing.

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Hong Yan,

110
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,310
I know what kind of person

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,510
you are.

112
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,470
I understand.

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,800
You had your reasons.

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,680
But the real rascal

115
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,600
is the person who poisoned Xiongwu.

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,360
He not only harmed his body

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,190
but messed with his mind,

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,720
making him crazy.

119
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,390
No matter what he did,

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,190
you should forgive him.

121
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,390
He loved you so much.

122
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
He'd never mean any harm.

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
Alright.

124
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,600
Let's just move on.

125
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,710
Hong Yan,

126
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,030
I need you

127
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,560
to recall

128
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,310
when he wasn't crazy,

129
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,830
what he thought

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
was strange

131
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,650
and whom

132
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,000
he found suspicious.

133
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,940
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

134
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,020
(Fortune Residence)

135
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,670
Elder Zhuang.

136
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,350
Have some herbal tea.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
Sorry to let you buy this for me

138
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,840
every day.

139
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,590
Just passing by.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,870
Besides,

141
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,710
I'm your student now.

142
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,970
How can I learn it for free?

143
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,600
I sterilized

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
the tea jar at home.

145
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,950
Okay.

146
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,790
It's okay.

147
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,800
I can't drink all this alone.

148
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,020
Let's share it.

149
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
- Here, this is yours.
- Okay.

150
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
Good tea.

151
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,880
Way better than before.

152
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,890
Nurse,

153
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,320
which room is Liu Zhendong in?

154
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,270
That lady just

155
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,200
went into that room.

156
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,910
How many people

157
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
stay there?

158
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,870
It's a single room.

159
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
He stays there alone.

160
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
Are you here to bring food?

161
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Go ahead.

162
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,240
So, you found

163
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
the plate I broke

164
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,270
and figured out I was kidnapped.

165
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,750
We're really connected.

166
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,160
I broke the plate

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,910
to leave a sign.

168
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,320
Dad scolded you for that.

169
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,630
Do you regret it?

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,510
Do you have to bring that up?

171
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,630
My bad.

172
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I didn't expect Zheng Qiu

173
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
to be so nasty.

174
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,440
Now you know

175
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,730
how dangerous this city is.

176
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,360
Think about what I said before.

177
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,990
You should leave

178
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,960
with my mom.

179
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
This is our hometown.

180
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,960
We're the youngsters.

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
If we all leave,

182
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,750
who's going to change this city?

183
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,920
I will.

184
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll stay here.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Once things are better,

186
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
I'll bring you all back.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,390
Didn't we agree on this?

188
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,480
Why should I leave

189
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
and let you stay?

190
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,750
Because you're a girl.

191
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
So what?

192
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,870
Maybe I can't fight,

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,080
but the pen in my hand

194
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,240
can be as strong as any weapon.

195
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
You already got

196
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,270
kidnapped once.

197
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,870
Aren't you scared?

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
I am.

199
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,910
I was terrified.

200
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,510
I still have so many regrets.

201
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,870
I haven't told my crush

202
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,870
that I like him.

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,200
So, you have a crush.

204
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Then tell him.

205
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,580
It's a new era.

206
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,510
Girls chasing boys is interesting.

207
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
I totally support that.

208
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,040
Who is it?

209
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,750
Who is it?

210
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,110
Idiot.

211
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,600
When did you

212
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,860
figure it out?

213
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,560
Nanping.

214
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I...

215
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,270
I'm so hungry right now.

216
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,910
So, what did you make?

217
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
Let me see.

218
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,910
I'll handle it.

219
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Shrimp.

220
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,040
Eat it.

221
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,870
Why is this so salty?

222
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Salty?

223
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,750
What's this smell?

224
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,280
Nanping,

225
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,550
your cooking

226
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,150
is getting worse.

227
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,360
No more meals.

228
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,870
I've put up with it for days.

229
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,240
If this continues,

230
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,930
my condition

231
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,670
will get worse.

232
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,480
But you didn't say anything.

233
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,660
Liu Zhendong,

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,390
so you've been enduring this.

235
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,440
I was trying to be nice,

236
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,220
but I really had a hard time.

237
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,410
I thought

238
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,740
you'd figure it out

239
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,870
sooner or later,

240
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,720
but you've never noticed it.

241
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,920
Maybe I can continue

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,270
to put up with it.

243
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
No need!

244
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,680
Wait.

245
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,000
I tasted every dish.

246
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
He was trying to piss me off.

247
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Naughty boy.

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,390
What's wrong?

249
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,960
Come in.

250
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Savior, it's me.

251
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,550
Oh, it's you.

252
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
How's your injury?

253
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm fine.

254
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,720
How did you know I got hurt?

255
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,550
Who told you I was here?

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,630
I hadn't seen you for days,

257
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,360
so I went to Shanhai Gang

258
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
and asked around.

259
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,100
Then I found out you got injured

260
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
and came here.

261
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,120
I made you some food.

262
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,910
But I just saw

263
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,910
a beautiful lady

264
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,000
bring you some food too.

265
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,080
Maybe I shouldn't have made it.

266
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,350
Not at all.

267
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,630
Actually, I'm hungry.

268
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,120
Let me see what you made.

269
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,390
That's real food.

270
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
It looks so appetizing.

271
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,200
It smells so good.

272
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,670
You're not only beautiful

273
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,510
but good at cooking.

274
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,120
I'm so lucky

275
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,550
to have you.

276
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,050
Come here.

277
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
Will you marry me?

278
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,810
I want you to cook for me

279
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,080
every day.

280
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,750
Just looking at you

281
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
makes me crave food.

282
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,750
"Feast for the eyes",

283
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,270
I finally get it now.

284
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,200
Sorry.

285
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,610
Don't take it

286
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,910
seriously.

287
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,080
Whatever you say,

288
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,630
I'll never cross the line.

289
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,390
Someone like me

290
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,600
doesn't deserve

291
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,550
to be your wife.

292
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,960
However,

293
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm already yours.

294
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
As for my life,

295
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,200
if you want it,

296
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,960
you can have it.

297
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,840
What are you talking about?

298
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,200
I mean it.

299
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,720
If the madam forced me to work,

300
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,790
I'd definitely kill myself.

301
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,150
So, my life is yours,

302
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,590
whether

303
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,590
you want it

304
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,150
or not.

305
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,150
Let me try it first.

306
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,110
It's pretty good.

307
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,750
Why are you staring at me?

308
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,200
Sit over there.

309
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,260
I can't eat like this.

310
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,870
What's your name?

311
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,840
I don't have a name.

312
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,750
Then what's your last name?

313
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,270
I don't have one either.

314
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,480
No name is fine.

315
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,680
No last name?

316
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,840
Are you serious?

317
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,750
My father sold me.

318
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,840
Why would I share his last name

319
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,720
and use the name he gave me?

320
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,480
But if you don't mind,

321
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,400
I can use the surname Liu

322
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,570
because I know

323
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,590
you're Mr. Liu, Savior.

324
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,310
Stop calling me savior.

325
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,110
Call me Liu Zhendong.

326
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,350
Liu Zhendong.

327
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,960
So, what should I be called?

328
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,700
(Xiefeng & Co.)

329
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,270
I believe that Shanhai Gang

330
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,550
has a positive

331
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,880
influence on the city.

332
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,240
I've seen nothing

333
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,110
but improvements in security...

334
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,160
No, no, no, I disagree with you!

335
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,440
Hold on, please.

336
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,550
Good evening, Governor.

337
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,910
Please sit.

338
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,080
Thank you, sir.

339
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Zheng Qiu.

340
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,070
(Sir Goode, Governor of Lion City)

341
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,110
This is good.

342
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
You don't understand what's good.

343
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,880
If you attempt to interfere

344
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,350
with the business of Shanhai Gang,

345
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,880
I will fire you!

346
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,920
I will kick you out!

347
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,560
Yes, sir.

348
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
If you do not want to listen to me now,

349
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,400
you can leave.

350
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,340
(Zheng Qiu's Residence)

351
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,320
Sir.

352
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,070
What a coincidence.

353
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,590
I wanted to pick you up with my rickshaw

354
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,030
like 30 years ago.

355
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
Master Cheng, you're so funny.

356
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Right now, even

357
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,270
the foreign elites

358
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,680
are defending you.

359
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,200
Even if you showed up with a rickshaw,

360
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,480
I wouldn't dare use it.

361
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,030
Let's have dim sum.

362
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,520
Ten seconds.

363
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,150
Five.

364
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,680
Four.

365
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Three.

366
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,950
Two.

367
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,670
One.

368
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,240
That's exactly 45 seconds.

369
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
