=Episode 25=

3
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,870
There are many guards.

4
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,640
Nanping

5
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,280
must be here.

6
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,480
Boss, how about this?

7
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,920
One of us

8
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,560
will draw their attention up front.

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,230
The others will split into two groups

10
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,430
and flank them.

11
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,230
- Boss!
- Dad! Dad!

12
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,120
Zhongxin, come with me.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Who?

14
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,550
Who is there?

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
There's an old man.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Cheng Hui.

17
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,590
Today, I'll kill you.

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,430
Then I'll make a name in Lion City.

19
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,030
Guys, get him!

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,510
Boss, it's Cheng Hui!

21
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,470
Cheng Sandao!

22
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,630
Well, Cheng Sandao,
[*Sandao: three strikes]

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,870
three strikes for a life.

24
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,840
Get my gun!

25
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,990
Get off me!

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,630
Get off me!

27
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,400
Help!

28
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
- Help!
- Quiet!

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Boss!

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,270
Old thing!

31
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,960
You broke the rules.

32
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,870
You're using a gun!

33
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,990
An Gexiong.

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
You fired first.

35
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,280
You shameless rascal!

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,840
You broke the rules first!

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,840
Let my niece go!

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,840
Shoot them!

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
Keep an eye on Cheng Hui!

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Guys, go!

41
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,360
Hold them off!

42
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,800
I'll get Cheng Hui's daughter.

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
They'll show up and die one by one!

44
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,710
Nanping.

45
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,150
Do you want to die?

46
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,480
Mr. Zheng is up to no good.

47
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,510
He wants us all dead.

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
No way!

49
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Come with me!

50
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,670
We can't find Nanping.

51
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,870
Boss, deep in the woods,

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,070
there's a small cabin.

53
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,910
Stop! Stay back!

54
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,110
Or I'll kill her!

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
An Gexiong.

56
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,830
We've taken down

57
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,000
all your men.

58
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Let Nanping go,

59
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
and maybe Master Cheng

60
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,830
will spare your life.

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,560
Trying to bluff me?

62
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,430
Zhao has to die.

63
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
Otherwise, Shanhai Gang

64
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,270
will only get stronger.

65
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,110
Zhao Tiehan,

66
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,190
you were kicked out.

67
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,510
Why did you return?

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,630
A good horse never turns back.

69
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,680
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,190
Born a Shanhai Man,

71
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,310
die a Shanhai Soul.

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
For Master Cheng

73
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,400
and Shanhai Gang,

74
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
I can do anything,

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,430
including sacrificing my life!

76
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,470
Cheng Hui,

77
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,830
I really envy you.

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
You have many talents,

79
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,600
smart brains

80
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,950
and good fighters.

81
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,560
No wonder you dominate Lion City.

82
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,710
I admire you!

83
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,230
Zhao!

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
Give me your gun.

85
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,240
Mine is out of ammo.

86
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,270
Show me your sincerity,

87
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
and I might consider

88
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,070
what you said.

89
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,270
Okay.

90
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
Zhao.

91
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,800
Boss, don't worry.

92
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
An Gexiong

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
is also a famous

94
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
gang leader.

95
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
I think

96
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,510
he'll keep his word.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
An Gexiong.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,320
- Zhao!
- Uncle Zhao!

99
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
Oh no.

100
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
- Stop! Don't come closer!
- Uncle Zhao!

101
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,720
It's still too far.

102
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,670
Missed the shot.

103
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,830
An Gexiong!

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
Zhongxin.

105
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,600
I know you're tough.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,510
But you're so dumb.

107
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,830
I've never seen you as a threat.

108
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,360
Heihu is important, though.

109
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,750
Come over and be my hostage,

110
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,190
and I'll let her go.

111
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Okay.

112
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,630
Heihu, let me do it.

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,680
You old cripple.

114
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,310
You mean nothing to me.

115
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,290
Heihu,

116
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,720
are you too scared to come?

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
Uncle Heihu!

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,560
Don't worry about me! Shoot him!

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,400
Quiet!

120
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,040
Well, isn't Weiyuan Hall

121
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,160
supposed to be invincible in Lion City?

122
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,870
Turns out it's a lie.

123
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,030
Heihu.

124
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Boss.

125
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,180
Don't move.

126
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Bin Langxiong.

127
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,630
You took my daughter.

128
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,920
Come at me if you dare.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Stop!

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
No way.

131
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,390
Cheng Sandao, I'm impressed.

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,000
You're still so strong.

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
I just saw it.

134
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,510
I'm so scared.

135
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
Heihu,

136
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,710
don't go further.

137
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,030
He's scared of your gun.

138
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,030
Toss him the gun.

139
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,870
An Gexiong.

140
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
Heihu

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,910
can drop the gun.

142
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,960
And I promise,

143
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,390
if you let Nanping go,

144
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,030
we won't go after you.

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
We'll pretend

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
nothing's happened.

147
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,480
Zhao is smart.

148
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,240
Heihu, why don't you give it a try?

149
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,870
Enough, Cheng Hui.

150
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
Put down your knife.

151
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,030
Come here and take your daughter.

152
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,750
Dad, let me do it!

153
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,710
Go away!

154
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,150
Who do you think you are?

155
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,550
If you come over,

156
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,550
I'll shoot her immediately!

157
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Don't move.

158
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,630
Dad.

159
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,840
Dad, stay back!

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
Dad!

161
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,670
Dad, stay back!

162
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,360
You're a reporter.

163
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,600
Let me show you

164
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,550
what I've got.

165
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,390
Cheng Hui.

166
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,150
All gangsters

167
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,440
have to listen to you.

168
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,870
As long as you're alive,

169
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,510
no one can rise.

170
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Dad!

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
Stay back, Dad!

172
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,800
Dad!

173
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,990
Stop!

174
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,600
Dad!

175
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,390
Nice shot.

176
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,790
Your turn, Mr. Cheng.

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Boss.

178
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,960
Just follow Mr. Charles's

179
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,960
direction.

180
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,630
That's the best spot.

181
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes.

182
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,590
You're not professional, I see.

183
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,710
He said you can't play.

184
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
Sorry, it's my first time.

185
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,910
Hasn't he had any lessons?

186
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,080
He said I didn't teach you.

187
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,930
He did.

188
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,120
I just didn't have time to learn.

189
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,590
Remember,

190
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,150
we had an agreement.
The more shots you take,

191
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,630
the more money I get.

192
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
Is that your intention?

193
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,940
You Shanhai Gang

194
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,510
are really a little bit clumsy
making friends.

195
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,600
Making friends

196
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,550
is all about honesty,

197
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,510
not pretending.

198
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't worry, this is my first time,

199
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,870
but I'll try my best.

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,200
Well.

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
That's three shots.

202
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,390
Looks like I'll be counting the money.

203
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,510
He said this is your third shot.

204
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,670
If you miss it again,

205
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
you'll lose a lot of money.

206
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
Where's the green?

207
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
Can you see the woods?

208
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,270
The green is right behind them.

209
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
It's over there.

210
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,440
Why am I aiming

211
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,690
at his ball?

212
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,310
That's way too far.

213
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,720
You can't get it in with one shot.

214
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,390
It's the third shot already.

215
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,410
I want to give it a try.

216
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,320
Ball.

217
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,120
Listen, don't swing too hard.

218
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,320
The smoother, the farther.

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Behind this tree, right?

220
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,080
Well done!

221
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,320
You're near the green.

222
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
Boss,

223
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,270
you're a genius.

224
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,280
Nonsense.

225
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
I twisted my back.

226
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,400
Well, let's go.

227
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,510
Let's head to your position.

228
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,870
Double, do you accept?

229
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,230
What does that mean?

230
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,750
He wants to double the bet.

231
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,960
Are you in or not?

232
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm in.

233
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,750
I don't think you should.

234
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,240
Charles is steady at this.

235
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,720
He'll finish in two shots.

236
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,320
Even if you get a hole-in-one,

237
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
it's still a tie.

238
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,440
It's not a good deal.

239
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
I accept it.

240
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,350
Boss.

241
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,600
That is par.

242
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,910
You need this goal, otherwise

243
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,550
you'll be counting the money for me.

244
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,420
Or you'll lose.

245
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
Boss, relax.

246
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,510
Look,

247
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,470
it's all downhill.

248
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,470
No effort is needed.

249
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,080
Just push it straight in.

250
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,670
Unbelievable.

251
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,510
Mr. Cheng,

252
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,120
you're incredible.

253
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,630
You know,

254
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,120
a lot of people

255
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,510
talked bad about you.

256
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,030
It seems

257
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,670
maybe I should believe them.

258
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,710
What did they say?

259
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,200
They said you were

260
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,320
dangerous.

261
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,630
Indeed.

262
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,270
You just

263
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,630
showed that.

264
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,200
Can you make it clear?

265
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,670
Your first shot was off.

266
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,270
But then

267
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,960
you went straight for the green.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's what gangsters do.

269
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,120
They hate losing.

270
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,270
That's why you

271
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,360
keep fighting all the time.

272
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,080
No surrender,

273
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,240
no giving in,

274
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,320
that's our people's trait.

275
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,910
Actually, we don't like fighting.

276
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,720
We prefer peace and harmony.

277
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,200
The reason why

278
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,120
I took the risk

279
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,120
was that I didn't want to lose.

280
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,840
It's hard to make money now.

281
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
I have a family to support.

282
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,680
Don't want to lose.

283
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,270
That barely makes sense.

284
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,670
When I said double,

285
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,910
you agreed, which means

286
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
you wanted more.

287
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,360
That's exactly

288
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,910
what a gangster is like.

289
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,000
But Shanhai Gang never takes

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,030
other people's property.

291
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,840
Mr. Zhao already told me

292
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
you're great at golf.

293
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,910
As long as it's on the green,

294
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,270
you only need two shots.

295
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,390
Think about it.

296
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,510
I got a hole-in-one,

297
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,720
and it was a tie.

298
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
If I missed it,

299
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,630
I'd lose more money.

300
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,150
I never get to win your money.

301
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
So, why did you agree?

302
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,630
I had to respect the host.

303
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,510
This is my first time.

304
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,550
You agreed to play with me.

305
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,360
It was a waste of your time,

306
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,200
so I wanted to make you happy.

307
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,870
That's also one of our traits.

308
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,630
That makes you

309
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,550
even more of a gentleman.

310
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,680
We don't call it "gentleman"

311
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,000
but "righteousness".

312
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,430
Unfortunately,

313
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,750
I'm not righteous.

314
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,510
To be honest,

315
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,350
I killed someone yesterday.

316
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,030
Are you reminding me

317
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,270
I'm playing with a criminal?

318
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
My daughter was kidnapped.

319
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,350
I had to save her.

320
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,750
So, does that make me a criminal?

321
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,070
That's complicated.

322
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,590
But why was

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,110
your daughter kidnapped?

324
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,270
That's also complicated.

325
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,310
I've always wanted
to change the situation.

326
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,150
Trust me.

327
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,830
Haven't sat in this car for ages.

328
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,150
Jie.

329
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,750
How's the car business at the pier?

330
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,930
Pretty good.

331
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,920
The car is always booked.

332
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,510
Who booked the car?

333
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,000
Mostly merchants from abroad.

334
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,950
Sometimes for weddings

335
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,910
or birthday banquets.

336
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,400
You must've got a lot of tips.

337
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,570
Yes, quite a lot.

338
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,240
But I still prefer driving for you.

339
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,960
I'm afraid it's not going to happen.

340
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,030
We played golf today.

341
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I've tried

342
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,920
to persuade him

343
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,270
so many times that he finally

344
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,750
agreed to use the car.

345
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,030
It's our company's car.

346
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm fine with walking.

347
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
When I'm in a good mood,

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,640
I can even pull a rickshaw

349
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,160
or ride a tricycle.

350
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,350
Jie,

351
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,590
just focus on the business

352
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,270
and make more money for us.

353
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,510
Take care of the clients,

354
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,030
and we'll get more business.

355
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,340
Don't worry.

356
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,190
If you work hard,

357
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,510
I'll give you a reward.

358
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,320
Got it.

359
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
Thank you, Boss.

360
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,160
Pull over there.

361
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,590
I'll leave you here.

362
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:12,580
(Tanjong Pagar)

363
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,850
Get out!

364
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,350
- Aunt!
- Out!

365
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,310
- Out!
- Aunt!

366
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,430
Go!

367
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,440
You're not my nephew!

368
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,370
Go back to where you're from!

369
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,490
Stop embarrassing me in Lion City!

370
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,660
Aunt, I'm so sorry.

371
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,030
Please don't send me back!

372
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,240
You won't go, huh?

373
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,990
Fine.

374
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,960
In less than

375
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,180
three days,

376
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,070
someone will break your legs.

377
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,190
Who's this?

378
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,670
Who's threatening to break his legs?

379
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
Master Cheng.

380
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,590
Master Cheng.

381
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,590
I'm sorry!

382
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,720
Please have mercy!

383
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,400
Who said I'd kill you?

384
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,330
- Get up.
- I wouldn't dare.

385
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,350
Please don't order them
to break my legs!

386
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,400
What's going on? I'm confused.

387
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,070
He talked too much.

388
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,000

00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800

391
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,150
Get up.

392
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,830
How's your business?

393
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,240
Good.

394
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,040
Ever since I modified your rickshaw,

395
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,190
I've been busy.

396
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Many people want to modify theirs.

397
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,640
See? That's a good thing.

398
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,070
Hurry, get back to work.
