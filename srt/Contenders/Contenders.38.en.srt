3
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,880
The blast

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,270
was deafening,

5
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,190
and I got thrown clear.

6
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,040
I... I only remember

7
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,600
I got blown away

8
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,070
and landed in the river ditch.

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,440
When I woke up,

10
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,960
I was already in Fanbang.

11
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,910
Local fishermen pulled me out.

12
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,240
Dad,

13
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,240
you've been in Fanbang this whole time?

14
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,470
No,

15
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,550
I've been to Manzhou,

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Xiangfu, and Gaonan.

17
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,120
I went wherever I could

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,440
make a living.

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,690
Dad,

20
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,400
why didn't you come back to Lion City?

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,190
We've all

22
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,200
missed you so much.

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,190
If Dad knew you were alive,

24
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,310
he'd be so happy.

25
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,280
Dad?

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,760
Here's the thing.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Back then,

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,670
everyone thought you were gone.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
I became Shanhai's orphan.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,310
Well, Master Cheng,

31
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,310
the leader of Shanhai Gang,

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,830
told me to call him Dad.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,030
He's the one who raised me.

34
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,550
Cheng... Cheng Hui?

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,310
Cheng... Cheng Hui?

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,150
He's been good to me.

37
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,030
He even let his own daughter

38
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,310
marry me.

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,310
No, don't tell Cheng Hui.

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,480
Don't ever let him know

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,270
that I... I'm still alive.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
What's wrong, Dad?

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,800
Cheng... Cheng Hui

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
wanted me dead.

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,520
He told me to take explosives

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,590
and meet up with them.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
He wanted to kill me!

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,750
How's that possible?

49
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,750
Dad, did the blast mess with your head?

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Back then, you risked your life

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
and saved

52
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,680
Shanhai Gang.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
Now everyone in the gang

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,750
sees you as a hero.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,310
No more.

56
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,310
Stop.

57
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
Wait...

58
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,080
Just go.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,950
Just go!

60
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,310
Just pretend you never saw me.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,560
- Dad, Dad!
- Never saw me.

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,450
You never saw me.

63
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,990
Dad, please calm down.

64
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,240
It's all my fault.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,550
I just wanted to see you

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
before I die,

67
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,750
so I came back to Lion City.

68
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,150
I was so stupid!

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,990
- Dad, calm down.
- My life isn't important.

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,800
But if something happened to you,

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,710
what would I do?

72
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,990
Dad, what are you talking about?

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,740
(Liu Zhendong)

74
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,030
Anti-crime agent?

75
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,310
I was appointed

76
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,800
by the new governor.

77
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,990
I'll work with the police

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,710
to wipe out the gangs

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
and keep an eye on corrupt cops.

80
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,870
Well, congratulations.

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,870
Your judgment was right.

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,480
The government
wants to wipe out all gangs,

83
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
and Shanhai Gang

84
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,590
is at the top of their list.

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,430
That's odd.

86
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,080
Shanhai Company

87
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,360
only runs legit

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,750
businesses now.

89
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,390
Yet they still think so highly of us.

90
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
There's nothing I can do about it.

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,310
Just think about what I said.

92
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,750
Take Nanping and leave Lion City.

93
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,990
Leave these matters to me.

94
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll do my best to look after

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
your old brothers.

96
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
They're family to me too.

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,310
You can trust me on that.

98
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,750
I can't.

99
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,750
Lion City is more complicated

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,630
than it was a few years ago.

101
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,840
Just take care of yourself.

102
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,870
If something happens to you,

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,600
how will your mom handle it?

104
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,190
By the way,

105
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,720
you just said outside

106
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,750
that I messed you up.

107
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,720
What did you mean by that?

108
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
Honestly, it's hard to explain.

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Are you leaving or not?

110
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,470
No.

111
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,260
I just became

112
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,510
the gang leader again.

113
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,700
I won't give it up that easily.

114
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,960
But it was never about the title.

115
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,510
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
given it to my dad.

117
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,870
You just wanted to

118
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,240
take on the responsibility yourself

119
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,510
and protect

120
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,480
all your brothers.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,510
But times have changed.

122
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,820
A tiger may rule the wild,

123
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,990
but it also grows old and tired.

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
Even though

126
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,430
you really hurt me deeply,

127
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,800
after I figured it out,

128
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
I respect you even more now.

129
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,790
I worked hard for four years

130
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,530
and paid a huge price

131
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,310
just to meet the new governor.

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,280
However, he took two years
to take office.

133
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,680
No matter what,

134
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,480
I'm back in Lion City

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,510
as an anti-crime agent.

136
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,430
This position

137
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,150
means more to Shanhai Gang

138
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,070
than you old folks.

139
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm begging you.

140
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,520
Just leave.

141
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,640
Zhendong,

142
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,720
you're urging me to leave.

143
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,630
Is someone after my life?

144
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,460
Kill one as a warning to others.

145
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,050
Use my death

146
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,510
to scare off the other gangs.

147
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,790
Something like that.

148
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,630
It may not happen so soon,

149
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,160
but you're really in danger now.

150
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,600
Whatever you want to do,

151
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,840
I can do it for you.

152
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,950
Since the day I was born,

153
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,190
I've been part of Shanhai Gang.

154
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
My feelings for Shanhai

155
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
are just as deep as yours.

156
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
I know that.

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
I understand what you said.

158
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,990
And I appreciate it.

159
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,640
Zhendong,

160
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,310
just focus on your job.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,990
If you can serve the people

162
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,920
of Lion City with fairness,

163
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
we'll all be proud of you.

164
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,310
Back then,

165
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,920
I accidentally found out

166
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,190
Cheng Hui used

167
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,510
Shanhai Gang's money

168
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
and

169
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,630
opened a private account.

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,480
He was afraid I'd tell

171
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,280
other brothers

172
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,190
and turned them against him.

173
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
So, he...

174
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,390
set me up.

175
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
That's impossible, Dad.

176
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,990
Liu Xiongwu...

177
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,430
Do you know him?

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,510
Of course.

179
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,480
He was my second uncle.

180
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
If you don't believe me,

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
just ask him.

182
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,200
Ask him.

183
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,750
He also knew this.

184
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,590
Ask him.

185
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,790
Well, he's

186
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,680
already gone.

187
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,190
Cheng Hui did it too?

188
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,350
No.

189
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,680
He was killed by our enemy.

190
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,160
So, there's no proof now.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
Anyway,

192
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,390
son,

193
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,840
listen to me.

194
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,300
Don't trust Cheng Hui.

195
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,550
He's

196
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,360
always

197
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,360
talking about morals.

198
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,560
But in fact,

199
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,280
he's just a petty man.

200
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,510
He lied to everyone

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,990
in the gang.

202
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,600
You...

203
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
If you don't believe me,

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
go check the private account

205
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,430
and see if it really exists.

206
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,750
Cheng Hui...

207
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,800
Cheng Hui wants to kill me.

208
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,960
Cheng Hui wants to kill me!

209
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,580
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

210
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,500
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

211
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,820
(Ho Kong Cng Clinic)

212
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,300
(Dr. Xu daytime clinic
paused for urgent cases)

213
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,710
Coming.

214
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,870
Robbery?

215
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,350
I don't have money.

216
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,680
You have no money,

217
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,320
but your boss sure does.

218
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,800
Master Cheng.

219
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,750
Cheng Hui.

220
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,270
Does he have a private account?

221
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,990
Let's talk.

222
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,790
Put the knife down first.

223
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,750
Cut the chatter.

224
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,830
Tell me!

225
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,790
Private account?

226
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,560
It's been a long time.

227
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
At least 20 years.

228
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,870
I'm the deputy treasurer.

229
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,630
But if it's Master Cheng's

230
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,590
private account,

231
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,150
I have no right to manage it.

232
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,360
Don't play games with me,

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
or I will kill you!

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
You won't!

235
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,750
A Shanhai Man for a day,

236
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,720
a Shanhai Soul for life.

237
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,790
You wouldn't hurt your family.

238
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,990
So, you recognized me.

239
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
No, I didn't.

240
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,920
But you called him Master Cheng.

241
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,680
I guess

242
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
you're someone from the gang

243
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,960
or maybe a former member.

244
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,200
Stop trying to get close to me.

245
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,470
Tell me!

246
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,510
I really don't know.

247
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,080
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

248
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,870
Otherwise, I wouldn't be

249
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,830
a proper deputy treasurer.

250
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,750
Honestly, you should just end me.

251
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,630
- You...
- Do it!

252
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,720
It was Zhongxin.

253
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,560
Are you sure about this?

254
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,240
His face was covered,

255
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,510
but I recognized his voice.

256
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,390
I'm sure it was Huang Zhongxin.

257
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,390
But I don't know

258
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,910
how to tell Master Cheng.

259
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
Zhao,

260
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,360
do you have any ideas?

261
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,120
He got upset
because of his failed marriage.

262
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,920
He's still young.

263
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,870
I understand why he

264
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,150
acted rashly.

265
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,510
However,

266
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,790
he's digging into

267
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,550
Master Cheng's private account.

268
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,560
That

269
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,390
doesn't seem like acting out.

270
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,920
Yes.

271
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,440
I heard

272
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,910
Zhongxin and Nanping

273
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,080
had an argument.

274
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
If I tell Master Cheng

275
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,010
about this

276
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,480
right now,

277
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,510
wouldn't that

278
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,790
make things worse?

279
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,750
Guangrong,

280
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
you're really thoughtful.

281
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,830
However,

282
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,040
we can't

283
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,670
keep it from Master Cheng.

284
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,230
Come in.

285
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
You're here.

286
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I've been here for a while.

287
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,280
Just now,

288
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,440
I had a chat at Fortune Residence.

289
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,990
Boss, I need to

290
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,350
tell you something.

291
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,510
Is it urgent?

292
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Not really.

293
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,990
Okay.

294
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,840
Do me a favor first.

295
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,320
Call Zhongxin over.

296
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,480
I need to talk to him.

297
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,590
What a coincidence.

298
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,670
The thing I wanted to say

299
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,510
actually involves Zhongxin.

300
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,240
Want to hear it?

301
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
- Hello, Mr. Zhao.
- Gui.

302
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,080
Hello, Master Cheng.

303
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,390
It's been four years. How are you?

304
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,510
Thanks to you,

305
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
everything's going well.

306
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,440
Thank you for taking care

307
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,150
of my nephew, Xiang.

308
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,560
That kid's talented.

309
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,390
Last year, he even became

310
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,180
the manager of the garage.

311
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,480
You need to thank Zhao.

312
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,680
He promoted him.

313
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,490
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

314
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
So, what do you need?

315
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,200
My lady wants to

316
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,470
talk to you.

317
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,990
It's pretty important.

318
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,990
Alright, I'll be there.

319
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,240
I'll go back and wait for you.

320
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,800
Zhao,

321
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,480
find Zhongxin right away

322
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,630
and bring him over here.

323
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,030
He can't go anywhere unless I say so.

324
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,990
Got it.

325
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
Sir.

326
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,280
Need a ride?

327
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh, a rickshaw.

328
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,840
I haven't seen this for years.

329
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,670
Yes.

330
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,720
No cups at this hour,
so I need to hurry up.

331
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
I need to feed my children.

332
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,320
Want a ride?

333
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Sure.

334
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,990
Let's take a nostalgic ride.

335
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,670
Alright.

336
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,630
Sit tight.

337
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,710
Okay.

338
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,280
Hey, you're going the wrong way.

339
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,720
Wrong way.

340
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
Wrong way.

341
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,120
Don't worry, President Zhang.

342
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,280
It's me.

343
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,590
Huang Zhongxin?

344
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,800
It's urgent.

345
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,280
I have no choice.

346
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,560
Sorry for this.

347
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,110
My dad

348
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
asked me to find you.

349
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,470
Master Cheng?

350
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,750
He needs something?

351
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,350
Yes.

352
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,840
He wants to withdraw

353
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,790
some money from his

354
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
private account.

355
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,030
Just bring his passbook to the bank,

356
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,200
and that's all.

357
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,910
I haven't heard anything

358
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,240
happened to Master Cheng.

359
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,510
Is he okay?

360
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,600
You're his close friend.

361
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
So, you knew about

362
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,150
his private account.

363
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,320
Yes.

364
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
He opened the account 25 years ago.

365
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
At first, I helped him handle it.

366
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,750
However,

367
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,150
he only saves money.

368
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,790
This is the first time
he wants to withdraw it.

369
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,870
Go handle it at the bank counter.

370
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
If Master Cheng

371
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,600
can't make it here himself,

372
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,120
just write an authorization letter.

373
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,150
Thanks, President Zhang.

374
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,590
I'll send you to office.

375
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,800
Okay.

376
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,870
Okay.

377
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,030
It's been four years,

378
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
and you look even younger.

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,320
It's only been four years.

380
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,440
Look at yourself.

381
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,840
You can barely stand up straight.

382
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,110
Yes.

383
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
I admit I'm getting old.

384
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,080
Well, but you never

385
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,790
admit defeat.

386
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,750
What's so good about being

387
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,200
the gang leader?

388
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,630
Be careful.

389
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,480
Don't end up like Xiongwu,

390
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,200
gone before you even know it.

391
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,110
Are you cursing me?

392
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Yes.

393
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,360
I curse you every day.

394
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,150
That way, Xiongwu

395
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,430
wouldn't be so lonely.

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Speaking of which,

397
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

398
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,390
Four years went by.

399
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,150
I've really missed him.

400
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,470
There's something

401
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,630
I've kept to myself for over a decade.

402
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
I've wanted

403
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,520
to find a chance to tell you.

404
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,750
It's been over ten years,

405
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,870
so why bring it up now?

406
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
No.

407
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,560
It's about Shuzhen.

408
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,550
Shuzhen?

409
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,430
I failed you and Shuzhen.

410
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,200
Wait, what happened?

411
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,040
When we lived in the small yard...

412
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,360
Honestly,

413
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,190
I never liked that place.

414
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,360
But Xiongwu and Zhendong liked it.

415
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,430
At that time, Shanhai Gang

416
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,870
wasn't anything special.

417
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,600
Xiongwu was full of energy every day.

418
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,800
He said he wanted
to conquer the city with you,

419
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,790
but he

420
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,150
ended up getting hurt

421
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,840
and making enemies everywhere.

422
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,070
Yes.

423
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Looking back now,

424
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,720
there was so much chaos

425
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,080
back then.

426
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,510
I couldn't give you

427
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,840
a peaceful life.

428
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,800
That year, Long Shiqi

429
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
threatened to wipe out our families.

430
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,630
You had Xiongwu

431
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,040
bring Zhendong and me back here

432
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,600
and asked your brothers
to take turns keeping us safe.

433
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,600
Liuliu

434
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,360
sent you to the countryside,

435
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
and Zhao

436
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,600
kept you safe.

437
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,430
Shuzhen died in the countryside.

438
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,600
She told me the address.

439
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,190
It was me...

440
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,200
I accidentally

441
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,400
slipped up.

442
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,360
Hong Yan,

443
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,040
it's not your fault.

444
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,760
You weren't the only one

445
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,040
who knew her address.

446
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,800
I know you're trying to comfort me.

447
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,560
Now that I think about it,

448
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,560
that person came to me

449
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,670
just to get your address

450
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,670
from me.

451
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Who are you talking about?

452
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,630
Zheng Qiu.

453
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,950
After Shuzhen died,

454
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,390
I heard it myself.

455
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,720
Zheng Qiu said he really regretted

456
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,120
what happened to Shuzhen.

457
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,520
I once used that to threaten Zheng Qiu.

458
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,120
Zheng Qiu, listen,

459
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
if you don't help me,

460
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,150
I'll tell Cheng Hui everything.

461
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,510
You know how many men

462
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,470
Cheng Hui has.

463
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,750
Believe it or not,

464
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,080
if each one

465
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,640
stabs you,

466
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,520
your body will be full of holes.

467
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,310
Alright.

468
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,390
I'll do my best to help Zhendong,

469
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,950
as long as he cooperates.
