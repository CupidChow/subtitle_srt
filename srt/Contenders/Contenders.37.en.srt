3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,160
Do you like it?

4
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,040
Return the gifts.

5
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,320
(Happiness)

6
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,310
The wedding didn't work out,

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,190
so let's cancel the engagement.

8
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,710
Nanping,

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,760
what are you talking about?

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,060
Let me explain.

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,110
Don't explain.

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
I know.

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
You must've been freaked out.

14
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,120
Ping, it's my fault.

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,310
I couldn't protect you.

16
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,630
But you shouldn't have

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,870
put yourself at risk.

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm your husband.

19
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,560
If anything happens,

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,550
you can tell me first.

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,150
If I was by your side

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,550
instead of that

23
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,870
loser Xiaojie,

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
they wouldn't dare to do this!

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,150
Can you listen to me, Zhongxin?

26
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,550
Go ahead.

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,240
I think our marriage

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,750
was too hasty.

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,990
Hasty?

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
We've known each other for life,

31
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,960
and I've made so much kway teow for you.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
I left

33
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
Shanhai Gang for you

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,750
and became a cook

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,710
when I had a promising future!

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,680
Now you're telling me it was hasty!

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,240
Zhongxin, I know you're upset.

38
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,800
I'll always remember

39
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,480
your kindness.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,800
You'll always be my Brother Zhongxin.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,520
As for getting married,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
let's not bring this up again.

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,800
We're already married.

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,520
We're already married!

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
- Nanping!
- Zhongxin.

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,240
- Zhongxin!
- We're married!

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,470
- What are you doing?
- Sleep with you!

48
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,430
Zhongxin!

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Zhongxin!

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,480
What are you doing?

51
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,590
Nanping.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
- Mrs. Huang.
- Mrs. Huang.

53
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,550
Nanping.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,120
The police station was in chaos.

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,270
I didn't ask for details.

56
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,710
Did those human traffickers

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,760
hurt you?

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Don't worry,

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
I will

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,710
make sure they're punished.

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
I'll stand up for you.

62
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,870
Nanping!

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,960
Nanping!

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,870
having a fight?

66
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,910
Chase her.

67
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,870
But I found

68
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,840
which hospital he's in.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,560
I don't think we need to rush.

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
He's definitely not Huang Jinhu.

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
No,

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,430
I have to see him.

73
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,030
Please, sir.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,760
Get in the car.

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
Sir.

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,430
Doctor,

77
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,390
how is he?

78
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,390
Sir,

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,640
he's still alive.

80
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,790
We didn't found

81
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,160
clear injuries on his body.

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,750
No bleeding inside the skull.

83
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,480
No damage to the organs either.

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,750
We just need
to wait for the last report.

85
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,590
Got it.

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,030
Dad.

87
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,310
Dad, is that you?

88
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,470
Is it fun?

89
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,710
Come on, Zhongxin.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,960
Eat.

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,640
Does it taste good?

92
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
Yes.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,600
He does kind of look like him.

94
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,840
But he can't be Huang Jinhu.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,190
Back then, Huang Jinhu

96
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,390
pushed a cart full of explosives

97
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
and fought the pirates to the end.

98
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,950
The river was stained with blood.

99
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,070
No one ever found

100
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,160
his body.

101
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,870
He was blown to pieces.

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,310
No, he must be my dad.

103
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,840
I'm sure. I saw it in his eyes.

104
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,390
That'd be so strange.

105
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,870
But he's still in a coma.

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
Ask him when he wakes up.

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
We should leave.

108
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,360
I'll stay here till he wakes up.

109
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,870
But his identity

110
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,920
hasn't been confirmed.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Are you losing it

112
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,750
because Nanping was kidnapped?

113
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,710
No.

114
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,270
Sir,

115
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,640
no, Uncle Zheng,

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,390
please let me stay here.

117
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,080
Okay.

118
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,600
I was close to the accident scene,

119
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
but I didn't see it clearly.

120
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,310
The driver said

121
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,510
he bumped into the car himself.

122
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,030
When he wakes up,

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,280
ask him about it, okay?

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
If the driver

125
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,040
tries to dodge it,

126
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,310
we will go after him.

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,080
Alright.

128
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,470
Dad.

129
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,030
It's me.

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,750
I'm Zhongxin.

131
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,190
Where's Boss?

132
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,190
Master Cheng and the others

133
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,320
are all trapped inside.

134
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,470
They have guns.

135
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,590
You must be careful!

136
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,760
Go away!

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
Dad.

138
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,230
Dad...

139
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,920
Join us.

140
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,360
Ms. Hong is talking to you.

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
Come here.

142
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,520
Ms. Hong,

143
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,040
it's inappropriate.

144
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,430
Where did you get the money
for the teahouse?

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,670
When Mr. Liu left...

146
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,990
I already paid off your debt.

147
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,590
As for the money,

148
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,150
take it and start a business.

149
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,840
You can make a living, right?

150
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
Mr. Liu,

151
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,600
I can't take this.

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,390
Then what do you want?

153
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
I want nothing.

154
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,920
You saved my life

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
and gave me freedom.

156
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,560
I'll kowtow to you.

157
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,560
Get up.

158
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,360
Keep the money.

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,040
Well,

160
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,510
then keep this.

161
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,710
I have to go.

162
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,960
I had no idea that pocket watch

163
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,510
was so valuable,

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,960
so I kept it.

165
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,670
Later, I got pregnant

166
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,390
and couldn't find a job.

167
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,790
I was about to starve to death.

168
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,160
I had no choice

169
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,200
but to pawn the pocket watch.

170
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,510
That's when I found out its worth.

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
The former owner

172
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,120
happened to move out,

173
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,440
so I rented that place

174
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,960
and opened Suibian Teahouse.

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
How's the business?

176
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,790
Pretty good.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,960
Back in my hometown,

178
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,080
my family ran a teahouse too.

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,960
When I was little,

180
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,510
I learned to do business

181
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,470
from the elders.

182
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,440
Later, my dad

183
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,990
got hooked on

184
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
opium

185
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,680
and lost everything.

186
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,230
Then he sold me.

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,280
No wonder

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,910
a woman like you from abroad

189
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,720
managed to keep the teahouse.

190
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,750
It's all thanks to Mr. Liu.

191
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,590
You know so many people.

192
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,410
Officer Gou

193
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
often goes to my place.

194
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,170
With such a client,

195
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,680
no one dares mess with me.

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,920
Is that so?

197
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,510
Didn't you pawn it?

198
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,750
Yes.

199
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,030
Then the teahouse started earning,

200
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,910
so when I saved enough money,

201
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,410
I'd take it to the pawn shop.

202
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,910
The shopkeeper promised
to save the watch for me.

203
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,440
Last month,

204
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,670
I finally got it back.

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Mr. Liu,

206
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,920
I'm returning it to you.

207
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,390
Thanks to your generosity,

208
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,240
I've survived

209
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,110
in Lion City.

210
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,430
I've given it to you.

211
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,670
Why are you giving it back?

212
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,800
Take it.

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,160
No.

214
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,800
You're so generous, aren't you?

215
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,960
Your grandpa

216
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,380
left this pocket watch.

217
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,630
You don't remember?

218
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,030
Mom.

219
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,150
This is our heirloom.

220
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,030
You gave it to Suibian,

221
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,240
so it's a token of promise.

222
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
Gui,

223
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
pick a date.

224
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,080
- Wait...
- Okay.

225
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,560
Pick a date for what?

226
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,960
My grandson is already three.

227
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,630
You haven't had a wedding.

228
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,800
I...

229
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,320
Sit down.

230
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,750
Let's eat.

231
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,720
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

232
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
From now on, call me Mom.

233
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,800
Mom.

234
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,670
Is that in Niangre language?

235
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,350
Yes.

236
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,560
I like it.

237
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,320
Marriage is a big deal.

238
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,930
You can't just call it off.

239
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,320
Why would you do that?

240
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,200
Marriage is for life.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
I have to think it through.

242
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,040
Let's just

243
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,560
talk about

244
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,710
how Zhongxin

245
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,290
opened a restaurant

246
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,350
across from your office

247
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,950
and took care of you for four years.

248
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,090
You've spent so much time together.

249
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,200
Why do you still need to think it over?

250
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
I know Zhongxin's been great to me,

251
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,670
but marriage isn't

252
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,630
built on friendship.

253
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,910
What I feel about him

254
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,960
isn't love.

255
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,780
Your decision

256
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,400
will certainly hit him hard.

257
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm worried he can't take it.

258
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,270
I hope you're just

259
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,630
being stubborn.

260
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,710
I'm not.

261
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,910
Some things are finally clear to me.

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,320
You published that statement

263
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,600
and cut ties with me

264
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,120
only to protect me, right?

265
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,390
Lion City's gotten
more dangerous lately.

266
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,910
Gang rivalries keep getting worse.

267
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,030
One boss ends up dead
on the street today,

268
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,990
another vanishes
without a trace tomorrow.

269
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
You should leave the gang.

270
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,030
If Mom were still here,

271
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,200
she'd be telling you the same.

272
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,700
I'm glad I have a daughter

273
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,780
who cares about me.

274
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,200
Okay.

275
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,120
If you and Zhongxin

276
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,480
give me a grandchild,

277
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,360
I'll leave the gang

278
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,320
and babysit for you.

279
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,510
Are you forcing me?

280
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,630
I know everything.

281
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,030
Huang Zhongxin didn't want

282
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,110
to leave the gang.

283
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,560
That was your order!

284
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,600
Also,

285
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,200
he didn't rent that place.

286
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
You bought it with your money!

287
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,960
As for the so-called time together,

288
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,870
you forced Zhongxin to please me.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,310
Honestly, I never wanted you

290
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,570
to arrange for my life!

291
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,470
It's rare.

292
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,720
We haven't argued in years.

293
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,370
Alright, I'm leaving.

294
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
Dad,

295
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,680
you've spent your life

296
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,360
fighting for the gang.

297
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,240
You deserve some peace now.

298
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,270
As your only daughter,

299
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,910
I want the best for you.

300
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,400
Dad.

301
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,800
Dad, you're awake.

302
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,560
Are you feeling okay?

303
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,630
Who... Who are you?

304
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,870
It's me, Zhongxin.

305
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,840
It's me, Zhongxin.

306
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,440
Zhongxin.

307
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
Huang Zhongxin?

308
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,440
It's me, Dad.

309
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,150
My... My son.

310
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,910
You've grown up.

311
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,560
Dad.

312
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,080
It's really you.

313
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
I've missed you, Dad!

314
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,860
(Fumantang Restaurant)

315
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,630
Master Cheng,

316
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,600
what would you like today?

317
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
I already ate.

318
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,600
- No, thanks.
- Alright.

319
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
How's business lately?

320
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,230
Not bad.

321
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,630
I once promised

322
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,560
I'd never set foot
in Shanhai Gang again.

323
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,760
You already left Lion City,

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,270
so why did you come back?

325
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,060
I was worried you'd be too old

326
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,960
to handle things alone.

327
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,070
Back then,

328
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,950
you forced me to leave
on purpose, right?

329
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Whatever.

330
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,880
Uphill tiger,

331
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,760
fierce and proud,

332
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,520
a single roar stirs the night.

333
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,640
Downhill tiger,

334
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,230
walking alone yet domineering,

335
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,560
even the mountains stay silent.

336
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,850
Well, you

337
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,300
went to Europe.

338
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,560
You should read and speak

339
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,550
foreign languages.

340
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,600
Why are you reciting
old Chinese poetry?

341
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,560
There were Chinese books.

342
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,640
To be honest,

343
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,750
when I got bored,

344
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,320
I read Romance
of the Three Kingdoms twice.

345
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,670
Well, I'm impressed.

346
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
When you were young,

347
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,840
you started Shanhai Gang.

348
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,310
With royalty,

349
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,270
you made it thrive.

350
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,870
Now, seeing the bigger picture,

351
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,320
you lead the younger ones

352
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,590
onto the right path.

353
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,950
You open companies,
do business,

354
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,030
close the casinos,

355
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,990
and stop taking money.

356
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,470
With what you've done,

357
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,480
you're on par with anyone

358
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,710
in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

359
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,400
At this point,

360
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,630
maybe it's time to step back

361
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,840
and enjoy your life in peace.

362
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,560
That's so strange.

363
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,520
Today,

364
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,280
you're the second one to persuade me.

365
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,800
I'm curious who the other one is.

366
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,680
Nanping.

367
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,790
Well, that's perfect.

368
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,920
We're both persuading you.

369
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,310
Maybe you should listen.

370
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,560
Back then, I called you Dad.

371
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,320
Why did you agree to that?

372
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,320
Did that really happen?

373
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,400
Oh, yes.

374
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,360
Now I remember.

375
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,510
You were badly hurt that time.

376
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,040
You even called me Dad.

377
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,910
Did I actually agree?

378
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,430
You didn't say no, so that's a yes.

379
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
That's right.

380
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,150
Well, your dad

381
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,000
was my sworn brother.

382
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,680
He's gone,

383
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,800
and you call me Dad.

384
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
That's pretty normal.

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,120
Old man,

386
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,560
you really messed me up.

387
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,360
All these years,

388
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,670
where have you been?

389
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,710
Back then,

390
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,040
I pushed the explosives

391
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,120
and rushed at those pirates.

392
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,360
It was about to explode,

393
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,000
and I...

394
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,670
I turned and ran.

395
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,870
I tried to get out the window,

396
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,430
but I couldn't make it.

397
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,670
The blast

398
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,080
was deafening,

399
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
and I got thrown clear.
