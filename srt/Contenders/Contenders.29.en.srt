3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Nanping,

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,320
are you alright?

5
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,840
As a reporter,

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,400
you have to be a tough fighter

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,280
who can face any storms.

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,310
Whether it's society or your family,

9
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,840
don't let it break you down.

10
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,560
Honestly, I regret

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,710
that I didn't make the statement first.

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,640
Cutting ties with him

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,710
was my idea.

14
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,840
Look at us now.

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,070
By the way,

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
a full-page statement

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,430
needs advertising fee.

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,590
Did you give him a discount?

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
No.

20
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,590
Good.

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
I'll try to be

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
a good reporter.

23
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
From now on,

24
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,520
his status won't affect me anymore.

25
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,590
I have good news.

26
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,430
Today's paper had four extra prints.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,710
Looks like we made a name for ourselves.

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,750
Sorry.

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,590
I wasted two hours of work today.

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
It won't happen again.

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,590
You heard about

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
the statement, right?

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,310
I'd rather not know.

34
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,960
While I was buying herbal tea,

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,190
newsboys shouted after me.

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,120
Throughout his life,

37
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,910
he only has one daughter.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,870
It's his family matter.

39
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,870
We shouldn't judge him.

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,990
I've studied overseas,

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,400
so I do understand

42
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,000
the western way.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
That's true.

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,310
Dr. Xu, Master Cheng wants to see you.

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Okay.

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Elder Zhuang,

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
I have to go.

48
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,080
Can't you say it on the phone?

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,400
No, I can't.

50
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,750
I can go to Shanhai Gang,

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,030
but I'm afraid you'll be embarrassed.

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,990
I got it.

53
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,630
I'll be there soon.

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Boss.

55
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,350
Sorry.

56
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,190
I have an emergency.

57
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,310
I need to go.

58
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,600
It's okay.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
We'll know the result

60
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,680
in a day or two.

61
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,830
Boss, what kind of ride do you want?

62
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,870
Rickshaw or pedicab?

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
I'll get one for you.

64
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,590
Zhendong.

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,880
How's your injury?

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,160
Do you have to do this?

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,310
Isn't there a better way?

68
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,750
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,800
It's confusing.

70
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,110
Nanping.

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
She'll be so upset

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,070
when reading the news.

73
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,510
She had it coming.

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
You don't mean that, do you?

75
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,240
I know.

76
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,800
You're doing this

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
to protect her.

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
Then you should help me

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,190
persuade her to leave.

80
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,480
Persuade her?

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,750
I know my daughter.

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,070
Even kidnapping won't work.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,920
You might not know everything.

84
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
She's simple

85
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,870
and fragile.

86
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,630
You can't keep hurting her like this.

87
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,310
Are you meddling in my family affairs?

88
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,600
It's my family too,

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
isn't it?

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,310
You're right.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
Rest well.

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Little Tail,

93
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,160
call him a pedicab.

94
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,240
Tell the rider to go slow.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,630
His injury can't take the bumps.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
Bye.

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Goodbye, Uncle.

98
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,870
I'm really happy for Xiongwu.

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,360
He has a good brother like you.

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,070
But I feel bad for Shuzhen.

101
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,920
Why did you do that to Nanping?

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,480
This is my family affair.

103
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
Why are you so worked up?

104
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,430
So, do you mean

105
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,830
the bond between our families

106
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,120
should end here?

107
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,470
Hong Yan,

108
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,310
you know that's not what I meant.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,750
Let me ask you.

110
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,190
Is that fair to Shuzhen?

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,510
I've let her down long ago.

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,360
You've really got no shame.

113
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,030
Hong Yan,

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,190
to be honest,

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
decency

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,630
will never be as important as the heart.

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
Then tell me,

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,040
what's the real story

119
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,270
behind all this?

120
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,350
Nanping.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,840
Uncle Zheng.

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Zheng Qiu.

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
What do you want?

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
Zhongxin.

125
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,880
Why are you so rude to Uncle Zheng?

126
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm warning you.

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
You should leave.

128
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,200
Uncle Zheng.

129
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,310
We both have time today.

130
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,720
Let's take a walk.

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
Sure.

132
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,070
How's your work?

133
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,150
Not bad.

134
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,240
Stop lying to me.

135
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,560
He made the statement on purpose

136
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,950
to get you fired

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,070
and force you to leave.

138
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,160
He's not just a gang leader

139
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,920
but a warlord.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,560
I've never seen

141
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,720
a father like this.

142
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,390
He's made the statement.

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
He's not my father.

144
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,310
I can't believe

145
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,270
he did such nasty things for that woman.

146
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,150
Woman?

147
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,120
It's better if you don't know.

148
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,390
Anyway, this is the story

149
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,750
of our generation.

150
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,600
But I still want to know.

151
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,800
Uncle Zheng.

152
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,190
You're familiar with the name

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,200
Hong Yan, right?

154
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,960
I used to call her Second Aunt.

155
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,200
She's a brave woman.

156
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,280
Years ago, in the small yard,

157
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,200
it was packed with workers.

158
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,720
But Hong Yan moved right in.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
In a way,

160
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
it was like walking into danger,

161
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,240
but she never flinched.

162
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,440
She knew exactly what she wanted.

163
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,120
She wanted to marry Cheng Hui.

164
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
But back then,

165
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,960
Cheng Hui had already met your mom.

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,390
In the end, he still chose

167
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,840
to marry her.

168
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,110
And he let

169
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,790
his best friend marry Hong Yan.

170
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,960
He thought

171
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,670
he could end this mess.

172
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,270
However,

173
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,080
such entanglement

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
would last a lifetime.

175
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,840
Your mom died,

176
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
and Xiongwu was killed.

177
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm afraid they were

178
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,670
deeply connected to this.

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,670
After Shuzhen passed away,

180
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,790
I sent Ping away because

181
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,910
I couldn't let my enemy

182
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,080
get something on me.

183
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,270
Back then, I just thought,

184
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,000
"No one can bring me down.

185
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll make Shanhai Gang

186
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,870
rule Lion City."

187
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,760
However, since Xiongwu died,

188
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,440
I've gradually realized

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,200
that time defeats us all.

190
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,030
Shanhai Gang

191
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,670
won't be able to keep up with the times.

192
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
Are you giving up?

193
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Why don't you leave

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,030
Lion City with Nanping?

195
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,360
Didn't you once say

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,390
you were happy to live

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,870
a carefree life?

198
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,630
I can't leave my brother behind

199
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,150
at this point.

200
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,870
I have to be responsible.

201
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I want to

202
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,030
help every Shanhai Man

203
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,270
to build a career.

204
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,960
Who do you think you are?

205
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
The governor of Lion City?

206
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,320
The governor is a foreigner.

207
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,390
He wouldn't care about us.

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,600
In the end, we have to

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,960
rely on ourselves.

210
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,750
You cut ties with your daughter

211
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,040
for Shanhai Gang.

212
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,840
I'm so impressed.

213
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,630
What am I supposed to do?

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
My son suffered because of you.

215
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,110
I know

216
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,870
he's badly injured this time.

217
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm not talking about his injury.

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Zhendong has always kept in mind that

219
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,480
born a Shanhai Man,

220
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,270
die a Shanhai Soul,

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
a Shanhai Man for a day,

222
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,670
a Shanhai Soul for life.

223
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,630
After Xiongwu's death,

224
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,000
I tried so hard

225
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,610
to persuade him to leave,

226
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,470
but he wouldn't.

227
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
You know, Zhendong's

228
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,320
only hope

229
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,960
and dream

230
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
is to be Shanhai Gang's leader.

231
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
Now you're telling me

232
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,790
the gang can't keep up with the times

233
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,630
and is going to be dismantled.

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
What about my son?

235
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,150
What about his career

236
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,720
and future?

237
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,320
You must give him an explanation.

238
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,320
Nanping,

239
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,200
your brother's here.

240
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,480
My brother?

241
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,320
Yes, tall and handsome.

242
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,390
Over there.

243
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,510
I wanted to treat you to a meal.

244
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,040
No need for that.

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,120
Just tell me what you want.

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,480
I saw the news.

247
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,870
Cutting ties

248
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,510
was my idea.

249
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
If there's nothing else,

250
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,150
I'll leave!

251
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,990
Nanping,

252
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,390
some things

253
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,360
aren't as simple as they seem.

254
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,840
Maybe you'll get that

255
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,510
in a few years.

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
Some people don't say what they mean,

257
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,680
while others

258
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,680
care about you

259
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,200
but never say it out loud.

260
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
Some feelings

261
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,910
are just obvious,

262
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,480
but some sincere feelings

263
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,360
always get misunderstood.

264
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,280
Are you talking about

265
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,560
yourself or about him?

266
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,550
I don't need your sympathy,

267
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,800
especially when

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
your words feel so empty.

269
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
You studied overseas,

270
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,390
but you just partied all the time

271
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,790
instead of working hard, right?

272
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,990
Yes.

273
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,030
Take care of yourself.

274
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,670
I don't want to

275
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,840
see your name

276
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,550
when I'm writing an article

277
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,840
about the gangsters

278
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,790
who died on the streets.

279
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
Besides,

280
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,510
stop pretending to be my brother.

281
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,790
Nanping.

282
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,630
Wait a minute.

283
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,630
Your cooking was pretty good.

284
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,870
You put your heart into it!

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,840
As your brother,

286
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,720
I hope you can forgive your dad!

287
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,030
Nanping!

288
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,120
I hope you always stay happy!

289
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,800
No need to rush.

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
(Chatsworth Hospital)
You're fine.

291
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,820
(Ward Area, No Admittance)

292
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,840
Elder Zhuang, we're here.

293
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,160
- Okay.
- Be careful.

294
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,870
Come on.

295
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,120
Elder Zhuang, no need for this.

296
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,270
No way.

297
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,150
Just take it.

298
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,990
Elder Zhuang.

299
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,030
I can't give you a ride tomorrow.

300
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
- Why?
- Well,

301
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
everyone's using pedicabs

302
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,150
instead of rickshaws.

303
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,320
And I also want

304
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,350
to modify mine.

305
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,030
Otherwise, if I see

306
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
the cops on the streets,

307
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,440
I'll have to avoid them.

308
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,120
I might even be fined.

309
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,320
Besides, after they use pedicabs,

310
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,840
their business got better.

311
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,000
They're earning way more now.

312
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,870
With just two legs,

313
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,870
I can't beat three wheels.

314
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,110
What a pity.

315
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,120
But I still like rickshaws.

316
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,840
Alright, that's enough.

317
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,750
Sorry, sorry.

318
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,600
What's going on?

319
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,850
Guangrong.

320
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,670
You don't look good.

321
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,990
Yes.

322
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,480
Last night,

323
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
I had nightmares.

324
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,510
I feel like

325
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,390
I can't breathe.

326
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,240
You should go to the hospital.

327
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,510
Did you forget

328
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm a doctor?

329
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,990
That's right.

330
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,470
So,

331
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,630
what's your own diagnosis?

332
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Haunted by a ghost.

333
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,990
Ghost?

334
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,840
That's not a real illness.

335
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,080
I must find the ghost

336
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,270
to cure my disease.

337
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,160
Sorry for this.

338
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
It's okay.

339
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,440
Honestly,

340
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,910
I'm neither

341
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
a good doctor

342
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,440
nor a good accountant.

343
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,280
Guangrong, have some tea.

344
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,630
Have some tea.

345
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,470
Okay.

346
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
I'll take a sip.

347
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,470
Elder Zhuang.

348
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,750
My stomach feels off.

349
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,110
Okay.

350
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,720
Boss, boss!

351
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,320
You're drenched in sweat.

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Here, wipe it off.

353
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,000
Everyone's been notified.

354
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,030
Which restaurant?

355
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,710
No need.

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,840
I'll cook myself.

357
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,870
Elder Zhuang.

358
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,710
Feeling better now?

359
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,470
Yes, a bit better.

360
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,680
Elder Zhuang.

361
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
There's a new foot massage store
at the corner.

362
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,630
Have you been there?

363
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,070
That's not really my thing.

364
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,320
Is that so?

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,110
It's not special.

366
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,640
When I feel off,

367
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,160
a foot massage

368
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
makes me feel better.

369
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,190
I want to take a day off

370
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,240
and give it a try.

371
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
If it's good,

372
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,830
I'll invite you next time.

373
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,190
Go ahead.

374
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,950
I can't waste this.

375
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,560
I'll take my leave.

376
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,430
Zhongxin.

377
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,400
Did they invite you for lunch?

378
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,160
- Yes, they did.
- Good.

379
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,030
And Little Tail said

380
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,880
my dad told him to invite me.

381
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,150
Do you know why I'm waiting here?

382
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,960
I was thinking,
if they didn't invite you,

383
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
I wouldn't go either.

384
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,950
Uncle,

385
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,480
don't blame me for this,

386
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,270
but I think

387
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,830
you went a bit too far last time.

388
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,960
I was defending you.

389
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,670
I know.

390
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
But Dad

391
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,440
has always been fair.

392
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,110
And I really messed up.

393
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,960
I'm just worried I'll drag you down.

394
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,920
Uncles always care for their nephews.

395
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,510
Even if you do, I won't blame you.

396
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,150
Let's go.

397
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,580
(Filial Piety)

398
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,430
Little Tail,

399
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,800
where's Dad?

400
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,910
He's cooking.

401
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,070
Cooking?

402
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,910
Himself?

403
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,110
What? I'll help him.

404
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,680
No need.

405
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,310
I just made some rice noodles.

406
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,430
- Here.
- Careful.

407
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,150
Come on.

408
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
Everyone, have a seat.

409
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,880
This is so touching.

410
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,350
Someone's not here.

411
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,190
Call him.

412
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,390
Elder Zhuang.

413
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,630
Time for the banquet.

414
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,630
Banquet?

415
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,720
No other dishes, just rice noodles.

416
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,310
But Master Cheng asked me

417
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,070
to tell everyone it's a banquet.

418
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,440
Honestly, I have no clue either.

419
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,950
Okay.

420
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,590
The rice noodles smell

421
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,510
- amazing.
- Everyone.

422
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,150
Okay.

423
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,630
It's so good.

424
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,920
Why did he call it a banquet?

425
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,590
Dad's cooking is better

426
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,270
than any banquet meal.

427
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,640
Little Tail was telling the truth.

428
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,150
This is a real banquet.

429
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,190
Elder Zhuang,

430
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,630
tell him about it.

431
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,750
Well,

432
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,920
it's the story of 30 years ago.

433
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Back then,

434
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,080
the small yard

435
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,280
was all run-down.

436
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,830
Many laborers lived here,

437
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,590
mostly rickshaw pullers.

438
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,440
By the end of the year,

439
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,520
there were more guests.

440
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,720
They worked harder

441
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,750
and earned a bit more.

442
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,110
Everyone was happy.

443
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,910
So, they'd invite

444
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,440
each other,

445
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,670
saying,

446
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,790
"Banquet tonight!"

447
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,440
And they'd reply,

448
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,590
"Okay!

449
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,320
I'll bring some wine!"
