3
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,700
I devote my whole

4
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,480
life to Shanhai Gang.

5
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,920
My leg

6
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,480
even got injured.

7
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,360
You finally spoke out.

8
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,320
I thought you
didn't want it.

9
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,360
Turns out you
want it, too.

10
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,990
I worked with

11
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,450
Master Cheng

12
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,480
before.

13
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,420
Technically,

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,450
I'm your senior.

15
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,390
Come on.

16
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,080
We need a
qualified leader.

17
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,480
You mean I'm
not qualified?

18
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,600
Hey.

19
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,600
We don't have

20
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,670
to decide this now.

21
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,390
I'll just head the

22
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,950
procession.

23
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,480
- No.
- No.

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,100
Why?

25
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,860
Zhendong.

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,900
You're a police

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,740
officer now.
You can't do it.

28
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,660
Elder Zhuang.

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,740
We worship

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,180
Lord Guan.

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,740
We're
renowned for our

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,860
righteousness.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,540
You really
want to insist and

34
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,700
stop a son
from leading his

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,060
father's funeral
procession?

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,980
Elders.

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,980
I was

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,420
born and

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,500
grew up here.

40
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,820
Could

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,020
you please let

42
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,420
me do this?

43
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,220
It's my

44
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,300
dad's funeral.

45
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,460
Elders, please let
me do this.

46
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,860
Get up. Zhendong.

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,180
Get up.

48
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,020
He loves his dad.

49
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,900
Can you stop fighting

50
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,820
about this?

51
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,980
What do you think

52
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,180
you're doing?

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,940
(Morality)

54
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,700
(Tribute)

55
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,780
The whole

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,740
Shanhai Gang

57
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,220
mourns you,

58
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,660
Master.

59
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,500
(Tribute)

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,940
(In Loving Memory)

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,100
Stop! Don't move!

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,020
Stop!

63
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,460
What are you doing?

64
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,340
(Tribute)

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,380
It's our

66
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,540
master's funeral here.

67
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,900
Shanding!

68
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,180
Get out of the way!

69
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,100
(Wu A'nan, Shanding Gang Leader)
How grand!

70
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,180
I thought

71
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,460
you're
celebrating something.

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,300
Turns out,
Mr. Liu died.

73
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,980
How dare you!

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,220
Xiongwu is our leader.

75
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,540
Stop talking nonsense!

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,300
Your leader is dead.

77
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,740
Who is heading?

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,020
Are you blind?

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,580
I'm his son.

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
I'm heading it.

81
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,780
Sure.

82
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,460
You're his family.

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,740
So, as I said,

84
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,420
it's Mr. Liu's funeral.

85
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
If it's Master Liu's,

86
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
the one who heads

87
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,580
this will be
the next leader.

88
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,260
Now a cop
is doing this.

89
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,540
Does it mean
that the whole

90
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,500
Shanhai Gang

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,260
will be led
by a cop soon?

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,500
Qi!

93
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,940
Don't you dare!

94
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,860
Officer.

95
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,260
I'm so scared.

96
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,660
Shoot me! Go ahead!

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
Here!

98
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,100
Come on.

99
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,900
All the cops

100
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,620
do just as westerners

101
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,540
say!

102
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,460
You head this.

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,050
Don't you feel ashamed

104
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,380
of yourself!

105
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,620
Well, since you don't

106
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
have a leader now.

107
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,220
Your guys are done.

108
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,380
Shanding

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,540
Gang will be

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,820
in charge here.

111
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Yes!

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,180
Shut up!

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,300
Don't you dare
say that again!

114
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,780
Zhendong.

115
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,700
He did it on purpose.

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,060
Come on! Shoot me!

117
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,100
In front of everyone.

118
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,580
Kill me!

119
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,660
Do it!

120
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,020
Officer Liu!

121
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,500
I...

122
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,980
It's Xiongwu's funeral.

123
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,020
Could your guys

124
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,420
do us a
favor and move?

125
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,900
No.

126
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,380
Your guys must
be exhausted.

127
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,700
Put down the coffin.

128
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,220
We should be
clear about something

129
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,780
first.

130
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,940
Back off!

131
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
We won't put it

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,340
down during funeral.

133
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,780
Guys!

134
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,060
They made trouble!

135
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,580
Go kill them!

136
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,500
Yes!

137
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,580
Get out of the way!

138
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,820
Get out of the way!

139
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,340
Get out of the way!

140
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,660
- Get lost!
- Get lost!

141
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,540
(Morality and Honesty)

142
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,420
Master Cheng!

143
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,300
Master Cheng is back!

144
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,820
- Master!
- Master Cheng.

145
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,140
- Master!
- Master!

146
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,060
- Master Cheng!
- Master!

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,860
- Master is back!
- Master Cheng!

148
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,780
Master is back!

149
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,180
- Master Cheng!
- Master Cheng!

150
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,180
Master!

151
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,100
Uncle.

152
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,620
- Master Cheng!
- Master Cheng!

153
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,140
Tell our people
to step back.

154
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,420
Guys!

155
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,500
Step back!

156
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,900
Take back the weapons!

157
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,860
Take it

158
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,780
back.

159
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,700
Shanding.

160
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Long time no see.

161
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,860
Tell me,

162
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,500
what do you want today?

163
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,660
Our master
died 2 years ago.

164
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,260
Your guys

165
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,860
are responsible
for it.

166
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,180
Jin Yaju is dead.

167
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,100
The police are
trying to arrest me.

168
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,700
We can go to
somewhere else

169
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,060
and deal with it.

170
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,140
You know I
didn't kill him.

171
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,300
If you really want to

172
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,580
avenge his death,

173
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,140
give me some time.

174
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Besides,

175
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
at your
master's funeral,

176
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,340
we didn't do
this to you.

177
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,500
Xiongwu even
went there with

178
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,580
4 Hall leaders.

179
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,060
We've all been
here for years.

180
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,180
Please don't do

181
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,740
things this way.

182
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,380
I'm telling you,

183
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,700
if we really
fought with each other,

184
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,940
Shanhai Gang

185
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,580
would unite together.

186
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,380
I think you know this,

187
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,340
you can't beat us.

188
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,660
What?

189
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
You're

190
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,900
not in charge?

191
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,460
Cops and westerners

192
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
hate us the most.

193
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,020
Someone must ask

194
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,420
you to do this today.

195
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,460
Why don't you just

196
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,260
ask your boss here?

197
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,420
I'll wait.

198
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,980
I am

199
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,740
in charge.

200
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,820
No one is my boss.

201
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,780
Put down the weapons.

202
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,140
Master Cheng.

203
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,780
I came to
pay tribute, too.

204
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,060
I'm just
a little late.

205
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,660
And they said
I caused trouble.

206
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,860
So it's just
misunderstanding?

207
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,260
Okay.

208
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,540
Then thank

209
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,780
your guys

210
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,140
for coming here today.

211
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,740
Xiongwu,

212
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,860
may you rest in peace.

213
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,900
Let's go.

214
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,940
Master.

215
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
You're finally back.

216
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,660
Liuliu.

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,340
Thanks for that.

218
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,260
Please speak
a bit louder.

219
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,540
So Xiongwu
can hear us.

220
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,620
Okay.

221
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,260
Uncle.

222
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,980
Keep going!

223
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,850
Let's go!

224
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,740
Go on!

225
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,860
Go on!

226
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,820
Sheyan,
let me do this.

227
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,020
I can handle it.

228
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,180
Your leg is injured.

229
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,140
Xiongwu
would feel bad.

230
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,460
Just let me.

231
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,140
(Tribute)
Xiongwu.

232
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,100
Rest in peace.

233
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,660
(Lion City Police Station)

234
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,140
Sir!

235
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,220
There's a
fight, right?

236
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,820
How many people died?

237
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,980
(Zheng Qiu, Lion City PD Chief)
Today is the funeral.

238
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,260
I knew this would happen.

239
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,620
Get everyone together.

240
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,820
Let's go there.

241
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
There isn't a fight.

242
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,020
But my guy told me

243
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,660
(Lin Anle, Lion City PD)
Cheng Hui is back.

244
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,810
He showed up
at the funeral.

245
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,210
Someone opened fire.

246
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,420
Let's go!

247
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,060
Hey!

248
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,140
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

249
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,140
Freeze!

250
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,220
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

251
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,740
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

252
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,700
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

253
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,380
Someone reported

254
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,980
your guys opened

255
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,420
fire and got

256
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,900
into a fight.

257
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,980
Go!

258
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,060
Nothing, sir.

259
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,820
Sorry for your loss.

260
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,820
Chief.

261
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,220
Only Liu Zhendong

262
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,460
carried a gun.

263
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,100
Liu Zhendong.

264
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,260
On behalf of

265
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,980
Lion City PD, sorry for

266
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,660
your loss.

267
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,100
Thank you, sir.

268
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,500
You all

269
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
are Mr. Liu
Xiongwu's family

270
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,990
and friends.

271
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,180
I'm chief of Lion City PD.

272
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,940
I promise we'll find

273
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,100
the murderer

274
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,260
as soon

275
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,020
as we can.

276
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,740
Heihu!

277
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,940
When I knew Xiongwu,

278
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,900
you were just a nobody.

279
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,620
We found that

280
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,380
the murder suspect, Cheng Hui,

281
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,700
is in Lion City now.

282
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,260
Anyone who
helps us catch

283
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,060
him will get
a large amount

284
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
of money.

285
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,860
Let's go.

286
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,980
(Tribute)

287
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,860
- Dad.
- Uncle.

288
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,460
Be careful.

289
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,140
Master, be careful.

290
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,740
Here.

291
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,820
I wish I could stay

292
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,900
here with Xiongwu.

293
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,400
When we came here,

294
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,210
we were very poor.

295
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,940
We couldn't afford

296
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,010
the tickets.

297
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,660
We hid in
a small place

298
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,100
in a boat.
We felt like

299
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,940
we were
in a coffin.

300
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,060
Xiongwu.

301
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,700
You did so many

302
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,180
things for
Shanhai Gang.

303
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,420
We'd never

304
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,860
forget you.

305
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,380
(Forever in
Our Hearts)

306
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,300
Mrs.

307
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,100
Mrs. Hong, you
want to take it home?

308
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,460
I can help you.

309
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,580
Burn it.

310
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,500
Yes.

311
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,680
(Hong Yan, Wife of Liu Xiongwu)
It's done.

312
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,820
Take all this away

313
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,540
and burn it.

314
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,980
But Fa said we'd keep

315
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,260
this a few more days.

316
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,900
Xiongwu is dead.

317
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,580
Just do

318
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,220
as I said.

319
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,620
Take this away!

320
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,980
Okay.

321
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,780
How are you doing

322
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,700
these years?

323
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm fine.

324
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
Where were you?

325
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,900
I went to many
places in the first year.

326
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,260
Then

327
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,170
I lived in
Qingmai for a year.

328
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,180
What did you
do for a living?

329
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
I opened a

330
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,580
restaurant.
No one knows me.

331
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,340
I'm very happy.

332
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,070
Happy?

333
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,140
Ever thought of the
one who misses you?

334
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,980
Sure.

335
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,620
Xiongwu

336
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,220
must miss me so much.

337
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,380
I left.

338
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,100
He had to take

339
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,220
care of everything
in Shanhai Gang.

340
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,340
You know I
didn't mean that.

341
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,340
I know.

342
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,860
Xiongwu is dead.

343
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,820
You're upset.

344
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,660
But please.

345
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,820
Take care.

346
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,780
Cheng Hui.

347
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,870
You only care
about your

348
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,060
people and
Shanhai Gang,

349
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
huh?

350
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
I almost died
because of you.

351
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,980
Zhendong
is my only son.

352
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,020
If something
happened to him,

353
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,900
I'd be devastated.

354
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,640
For old times' sake,

355
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,360
Cheng Hui,

356
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,050
can you take
Zhendong and I away

357
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,060
from here?

358
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,980
Hong Yan.

359
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,580
Xiongwu is
my best friend.

360
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,080
Someone killed him.
And we

361
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,620
haven't found
the murderer yet.

362
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,820
Enough. I don't want

363
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,530
to live like
this anymore.

364
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,340
Besides,

365
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,250
he is dead.

366
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,020
You can't
bring him back

367
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,260
to life anyway.

368
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,100
Xiongwu has just died.

369
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,180
How can you say this?

370
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,300
Don't you feel
sorry for him?

371
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,140
You two owe
this to me.

372
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,260
I spent my

373
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,300
whole life with

374
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,500
someone I don't love.

375
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,660
I felt bad.

376
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,500
But I have

377
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,140
to protect my son.

378
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,300
Hong Yan.

379
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,620
Calm down.

380
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,660
Do you know

381
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,940
anything about

382
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,820
Xiongwu's murder?

383
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,300
No.

384
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,980
I don't know anything.

385
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,380
Take us
away from here.

386
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,180
Or I'll kill myself.

387
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,220
Mom!

388
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,860
Mom!

389
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,940
- Mom!
- I'm talking

390
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,060
to your uncle now.

391
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,220
Don't come in.

392
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,020
Okay.

393
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,460
But uncle
has to leave.

394
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,200
The police

395
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,660
will come here soon.

396
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,580
You heard him?

397
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,740
I'm still a
murder suspect.

398
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,660
I got to go.

399
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,430
Uncle, this way.

400
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,330
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

401
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,200
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

402
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,020
Don't move!

403
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,060
Don't move!

404
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,100
Don't you dare!

405
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,500
Uncle. Here.

406
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,060
Remember to
stay in our area.

407
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,340
Keep it in mind.

408
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,760

409
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,860

your arrest.

Got it.
