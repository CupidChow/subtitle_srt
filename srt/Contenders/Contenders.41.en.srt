3
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,160
He was your brother.

4
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,550
Yes, he was.

5
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,040
But he betrayed me

6
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,780
and Shanhai Gang.

7
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,630
I had to deal with him.

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,240
That's our rule.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,270
You're so cooperative.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,880
Do you know

11
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,600
everything you say now

12
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,680
will be used against you

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,880
in court?

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
Of course I know.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,710
Why did you change your mind and confess

16
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,600
without your lawyer?

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm just tired.

18
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,270
I'm exhausted.

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,470
If I keep playing this game,

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,630
even I'll find it pointless.

21
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,630
No need to write this.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,940
Just let him sign it.

23
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,190
His confession.

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,980
(Cheng Hui)

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,720
Try this tea.

26
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,630
You'll miss the taste.

27
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,310
How did Huang Jinhu end up

28
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,190
like this?

29
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,670
What happened?

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
I was lucky.

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,670
It was god's plan

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,280
that I found Huang Jinhu.

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,190
What did you do to him?

34
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,790
I won't tell you.

35
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,280
There's no point.

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,960
Okay.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,070
I'll ask another question.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,680
Hope you can tell me the truth.

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,440
Did you get Shuzhen killed?

40
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,790
How come?

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,880
You don't admit it?

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,510
Admit what?

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,350
You were the reason she died!

44
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,790
Maybe she came from a small family

45
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,530
and wasn't a good match for me,

46
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,280
but if I begged my father,

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
he would have agreed.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,520
I'd take her as a concubine

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
or at least a mistress.

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,280
But you, a laborer

51
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,510
from overseas, seduced her.

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,280
If she hadn't married you,

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
would she have died so young?

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,790
You got her killed.

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,790
I never meant to hurt her.

56
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,080
You tricked that woman.

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,030
Is this my fault?

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,350
She was your life,

59
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,570
but I planned to

60
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,630
support her and Nanping

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,820
after you die.

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,360
I'd let them live without worries.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Let them

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,210
live a wealthy life.

65
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,880
I wanted her to know

66
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,560
I was the right man for him.

67
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,840
You got her killed.

68
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,630
But Shuzhen

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,350
was so stupid.

70
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,040
She knew it was risky

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,110
but still ran out to warn you.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,560
Otherwise, she'd still be alive.

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
I told her what to do.

74
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,150
What's wrong?

75
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,710
You look so angry.

76
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,960
Shuzhen was supposed to be my woman!

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,400
Why are you so angry?

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,470
I made you the undercover agent.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,080
You got the evidence,

80
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,270
but you didn't hand it over.

81
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,360
You handed it

82
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,640
to my boss instead

83
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,160
because you found out

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,840
my dad was the mastermind.

85
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,070
I know what you wanted.

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,270
You just wanted to

87
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,310
use my family

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,440
to make a name!

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,600
You wanted to dominate

90
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,910
Lion City like I did!

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,520
Ever since you betrayed me,

92
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,870
you should've known

93
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,600
you would end up like this!

94
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,720
You're the reason Shuzhen died.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,680
Maybe

96
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,430
you'll end up on death row.

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,840
Maybe there's really an afterlife,

98
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,640
and you'll see her again.

99
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,910
But I believe,

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
she'd never forgive you.

101
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,670
Okay.

102
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,640
Well then, we have a deal.

103
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,870
From now on,

104
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,200
let's keep each other informed.

105
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,230
We all respect you.

107
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,280
We'll follow your lead.

108
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,990
We'll follow your lead.

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,550
To all of you. Thank you, guys.

110
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,430
Enjoy your meal.

111
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,600
Come on, there's plenty of food.

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,870
Thank you, sir.

113
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,990
Thanks.

114
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,410
Come take a look, sir.

115
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,370
No, thanks.

116
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,230
Take a look.

117
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,520
Check it out, miss.

118
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,200
I don't even know you.

119
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,470
Why do you want me dead?

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,350
I got paid!

121
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm a special agent.

122
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,640
Do you know the consequences

123
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
if you couldn't kill me now?

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,040
Impossible.

125
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,600
With one stab,

126
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
you will surely die!

127
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,950
Uncle Heihu!

128
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,310
Run!

129
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,310
I won't ask you again.

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
Who sent you here?

131
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,710
Tell us,

132
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,870
or I'll kill you!

133
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,980
(Robert, Killer from Fanbang)

134
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,110
Forensics sent the report.

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,280
It says there's poison

136
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,600
on your clothes

137
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
and the weapon.

138
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,840
It's toxic.

139
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,960
Even without the report,

140
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,190
I could guess that myself.

141
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,350
Well, sir,

142
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,840
how did you dodge that?

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,760
What is this?

144
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,700
Made by horsehide.

145
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,840
Do you really want to

146
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,980
be a good agent

147
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,470
or just to put on a show?

148
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,720
It's not for show.

149
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,910
Wiping out criminals

150
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,430
and bringing peace

151
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,120
back to Lion City is my mission.

152
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,240
Wait.

153
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
Isn't this...

154
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,670
Ping's

155
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,550
mom made it for me by hand.

156
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,480
It saved my life more than once.

157
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,520
Now I'm giving it to you.

158
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,910
No matter where you go,

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,270
even if it's hot,

160
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,550
promise me you'll wear it.

161
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,790
Cheng Hui really cares about you.

162
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,240
Every father cares for his son.

163
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,640
Have you found out

164
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,720
that killer's identity?

165
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,160
Not yet.

166
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,590
He had no criminal record at all.

167
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
Besides,

168
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,710
I think he just arrived in Lion City,

169
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,310
and he's probably here for you.

170
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,550
You're giving me too much credit.

171
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Here,

172
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,150
and here.

173
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,350
- Got it.
- Make a note.

174
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,200
Here too.

175
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,790
- Okay.
- Check it.

176
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,150
How's it going?

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,000
Sir,

178
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,950
Mr. He stepped up

179
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,640
and helped you stop the killer.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
He deserves an award.

181
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,310
He killed himself.

182
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,270
The killer...

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,710
Change that. It was a suicide.

184
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,270
Thanks.

185
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,150
He Yaohui.

186
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,520
Come outside.

187
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,120
Sir,

188
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,190
I'll leave you two alone.

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,880
Have a seat.

190
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Uncle Heihu,

191
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,310
I was lucky to have met you.

192
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,720
It wasn't luck.

193
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,640
I sent people to look for you.

194
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,430
I figured you'd take that road home,

195
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,600
so I met you there.

196
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,960
Why did you look for me?

197
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,550
Here's the thing.

198
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,080
Find Zhendong.

199
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,150
He's our descendant,

200
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,030
and he can be trusted.

201
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,070
You're an agent now.

202
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,430
Shanhai Gang is counting on you.

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,830
We want you to save Boss.

204
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,690
Still don't trust me, do you?

205
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,340
What are you saying?

206
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,040
If not, would I even come?

207
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,320
Then why are you so polite?

208
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
Fine.

209
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,640
It's my bad,

210
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,750
okay?

211
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,390
Here's the thing.

212
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,000
This all just happened so fast.

213
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,270
Where's the

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,550
fake Huang Jinhu's body?

215
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,910
Uncle Heihu,

216
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,670
you really don't trust me.

217
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,240
He's not fake.

218
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,840
What?

219
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,360
I saw him with my own eyes.

220
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,190
He really is Huang Jinhu,

221
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,720
Zhongxin's real father.

222
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,310
I've always called him Brother Jinhu.

223
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,910
I can't be wrong.

224
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,150
Old man,

225
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,550
are you going to sleep or not?

226
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm sleeping right now.

227
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,790
Who sleeps sitting up?

228
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,550
I'm not used to lying down.

229
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,200
You're sitting here,

230
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,190
and I just can't stand it.

231
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,120
How does that

232
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,520
bother you?

233
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,000
You just sit here,

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,360
looking like a clay statue.

235
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,910
You're freaking me out!

236
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry.

237
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,400
I'm old.

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,760
I hope you'll understand.

239
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
You...

240
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
Forget it.

241
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,710
Stop arguing.

242
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,710
Don't you know who he is?

243
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,070
He's Cheng Hui from Shanhai Gang,

244
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,640
a real gang leader.

245
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,480
Sharing a cell with him,

246
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,280
you'll have stories for half your life.

247
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,310
You're so annoying!

248
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,240
If he wants to sit, let him sit.

249
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,670
If he wants to lie down, let him.

250
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,550
It's still sleeping.

251
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,910
Why should we care?

252
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,960
Alright.

253
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Let's sleep.

254
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,760
Psycho.

255
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,200
Get up!

256
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Guys!

257
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,160
Guys.

258
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
Am I...

259
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,040
your enemy or something?

260
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,790
Is this a misunderstanding?

261
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,150
Misunderstanding?

262
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,190
No.

263
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,910
However, if we kill you,

264
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,430
we'll have enough money
for our later years.

265
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,430
Okay.

266
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,160
I got it.

267
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,830
Whatever they're paying you,

268
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
I can match that.

269
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,950
We don't have any real beef.

270
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,030
Can't you just

271
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,950
spare my life?

272
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,550
Cheng Hui,

273
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,430
we weren't

274
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,710
even cellmates.

275
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,310
We just all had blood feuds with you,

276
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,910
so we ended up together.

277
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,790
How can we spare you?

278
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,080
Cheng Hui.

279
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,630
You didn't

280
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,760
see this coming, did you?

281
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,710
Don't talk too much. Just kill him!

282
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,640
Someone help!

283
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,870
The new guy wants to kill him!

284
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,720
What are you doing?

285
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,760
What's all the fuss about?

286
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,040
Step back!

287
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,080
Stop!

288
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,600
Step back!

289
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,550
All of you, get down!

290
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,480
Let him go,

291
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,520
or I'll shoot you right now!

292
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,910
Cheng Hui, you'll be

293
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,590
punished for this, okay?

294
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,190
Put me in confinement.

295
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,630
No need to walk me out.

296
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,790
I'm a grown-up man.

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,790
You're walking me home.

298
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,110
That's so embarrassing.

299
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,490
Don't talk nonsense.

300
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,880
What leader?

301
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,000
Uncle Heihu, at this point,

302
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,550
you have to lead the gang.

303
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,670
Tomorrow morning,

304
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,690
the whole gang needs to

305
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,640
know about this.

306
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,430
We're in danger.

307
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,910
This is our only option.

308
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,590
Sheyan and Sheyan said the same.

309
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,360
Right now,

310
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,480
you have to

311
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,360
turn the tables.

312
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,550
What are you doing?

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,880
What are you doing?

314
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,600
Don't run!

315
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,430
Don't move!

316
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,750
Hands up!

317
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,960
A hundred steps away!

318
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,030
Or I'll ignite it,

319
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,550
and everyone will go down.

320
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,430
Don't move!

321
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,200
Who sent you here?

322
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,390
None of your business!

323
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,400
Arson is a capital crime.

324
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,830
If I hadn't run into you,

325
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,430
who would know I started this fire?

326
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,430
Why not just find a regular job?

327
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,280
Why risk doing things like this?

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
People would do

329
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,120
anything for money.

330
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,710
If you want me to stop,

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,870
just step back.

332
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,750
Okay!

333
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,590
Put the gun away!

334
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,430
I...

335
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,430
Help!

336
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
This place is on fire!

337
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,630
Let go!

338
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
Don't run!

339
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,070
Put out the fire!

340
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,550
Why is it on fire?

341
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,430
What happened?

342
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,480
Why is it on fire?

343
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,630
I'm leaving this to you.

344
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,630
Take care of our son

345
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,510
and my mom.

346
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,670
Okay.

347
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,440
- Don't move!
- Let go of me!

348
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
Behave yourself!

349
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,590
- Don't move!
- Let me go!

350
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,510
Uncle Heihu.

351
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,630
Let me go!

352
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,720
This guy won't talk.

353
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,030
He'd rather die.

354
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,870
Who sent him here?

355
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,630
The one we knocked out,

356
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,750
I'll take him to the police station.

357
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,350
Let this one go.

358
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,800
- What?
- Uncle Heihu.

359
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,520
Let him go.

360
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,230
Time for food.

361
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,230
Come out.

362
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,320
Hurry up!

363
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,670
Come out and eat.

364
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,360
Hurry up.

365
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,880
You.

366
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,840
Sit here.

367
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,840
Report.

368
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,520
Restroom.

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Just go.

370
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,440
Put the fork down!

371
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,840
Hands up!

372
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,110
He started it.

373
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,390
You killed him.

374
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,790
It was self-defense.

375
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,200
Why did you hit me?

376
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Someone died in prison.

377
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,440
I'm responsible for that!

378
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,800
Hit him!

379
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,790
Teach this old man

380
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,670
a lesson!

381
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,960
Sir, do you want to see Cheng Hui?

382
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,310
Yes.

383
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,190
Well...

384
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,880
What's wrong?

385
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,760
Can't I see him?

386
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,710
