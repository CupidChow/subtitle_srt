3
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,150
Everyone was happy.

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,960
So, they'd invite

5
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,480
each other,

6
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,710
saying,

7
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
"Banquet tonight!"

8
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,480
And they'd reply,

9
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,630
"Okay!

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,350
I'll bring some wine!"

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
When evening came,

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,150
they went back to the yard

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,070
and gathered at the table

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
to have a meal.

15
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,510
No matter what

16
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,190
they ate,

17
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,400
they called it a banquet.

18
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,200
You get it now?

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Yes.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
That's right.

21
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,790
As for cured pork rice or roasted chicken rice,

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,950
we could only eat that in the New Year.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,470
Banquets usually meant

24
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,430
having meals together.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
That's right.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
I was young,

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,680
and I often came without being invited.

28
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,560
Honestly,

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,550
the food doesn't really matter.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,560
As long as we share a table,

31
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,590
we're family.

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Well said.

34
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,870
Here's the herbal tea.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
Master Cheng made

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
the monk fruit tea.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
It cools you down.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Come on.

39
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,430
Rong,

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
you often get worked up.

41
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
You should

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,310
drink it all.

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,520
Elder Zhuang.

44
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,120
Boss,

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I yelled at you last time.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,190
Please don't blame me.

47
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,190
With your word,

48
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,150
I'll forgive you.

49
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,270
Let's eat.

50
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
By the way,

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,120
why isn't Zhao here?

52
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,910
He's out

53
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,750
for business.

54
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,030
What about Dr. Xu,

55
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,710
Elder Zhuang's student?

56
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,870
Is he not coming?

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,840
Dr. Xu is not

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,870
feeling well.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
Nowadays, young people

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,080
are so impatient.

61
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,520
Is Dr. Xu

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
impatient?

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
He's better than average people.

64
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
Not bad.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,430
Well, no one can stay calm

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,710
if they're poisoned.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,800
Poisoned?

68
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,590
Who's poisoned?

69
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,430
Boss.

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,520
Dr. Xu's here. Should we let him in?

71
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,920
Let him in.

72
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,310
When having a banquet,

73
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,030
we hate getting interrupted.

74
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,520
I just told them

75
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,870
not to

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,000
let outsiders in.

77
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,310
Boss.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
How's it going?

79
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,960
Here's the herbal tea I had

80
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,190
for the last three days.

81
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
It was poisoned.

82
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
The lab results show

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
it's the same poison

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Leader Xiongwu took.

85
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,080
- What's going on?
- This...

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
Dr. Xu, this...

87
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,240
Xiongwu was assassinated.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,750
Why was he also poisoned?

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
Elder Zhuang,

90
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,920
we need to ask you about this.

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,510
How would I know?

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
I see.

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
Guangrong's teapot

94
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
was poisoned for three days,

95
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,510
and I live in Fortune Residence.

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,190
He's setting me up!

97
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,120
Well, I've been managing

98
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,390
the books for over 30 years.

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,310
I'm just too old to do this.

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,830
Boss,

101
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,160
if you find another person,

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
just tell me,

103
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,160
and I'll retire.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,310
You don't have to do this.

105
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Anyway,

106
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,830
maybe today should be

107
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,430
my last day at work.

108
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,830
Xu Guangrong has

109
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,870
gone through all our books.

110
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,430
He can definitely

111
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,720
handle the work.

112
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,510
Boss, you even prepared

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,720
the banquet yourself.

114
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,320
I feel

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,190
so honored.

116
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,900
Thank you.

117
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,400
Come on.

118
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Everyone,

119
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,800
it's been 31 years.

120
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,920
As an accountant,

121
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,160
I've tried my best,

122
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,310
but I haven't done a good job.

123
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,470
Please don't blame me

124
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,750
for the mistakes I made.

125
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,230
Well,

126
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,390
you really think I poisoned him?

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,960
Do you have any proof?

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Elder Zhuang,

129
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,750
you've always been careful.

130
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,950
Even if we search you,

131
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,510
we won't find any poison.

132
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,360
We won't find anything

133
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
at your place either.

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,240
Zhao went out for business.

135
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,070
Do you know where he went?

136
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,720
The Zhuang Estate.

137
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,830
Those two rundown rooms?

138
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,480
You call that an estate?

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,750
I'm talking about
your big mansion in Xinshan.

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,070
- It's mine!
- It's mine!

141
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,950
Give it to me!

142
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,120
- My turn!
- Give it to me!

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,430
Are you Mr. Zhao?

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Yes.

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,600
Did you make plans with

146
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,510
our master?

147
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,870
But he only

148
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,240
comes every two weeks.

149
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
It can't be wrong.

150
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,510
We agreed on today.

151
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,870
But...

152
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,870
Master said he wouldn't

153
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,920
be back until tomorrow.

154
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,000
Really?

155
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,360
He must've mixed up the dates.

156
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
How about this?

157
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,630
Why don't you give him a call?

158
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
Hello.

159
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,750
Elder Zhuang,
someone wants to talk to you.

160
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,270
Elder Zhuang.

161
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,560
Go answer the phone.

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
What if it's something urgent?

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Hello.

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,600
Master,

165
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,190
someone wants to see you.

166
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,600
I'll let him talk to you.

167
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,110
Hello.

168
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Zhuang.

169
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,160
It's Zhao.

170
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,360
I've met your wives,

171
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
sons,

172
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
and daughters.

173
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,360
What took you so long?

174
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,950
Which Zhao?

175
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Well,

176
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,270
you don't even recognize

177
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,310
my voice anymore?

178
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Shanhai Gang,

179
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,430
Zhao Tiehan.

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Boss.

181
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,350
I'm begging you.

182
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,360
Please spare my family!

183
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,630
I don't care about the women.

184
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,910
But my kids...

185
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,480
Don't hurt my kids!

186
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,310
You made your wife

187
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,190
live a hard life with you here,

188
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,870
yet you own a big mansion

189
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,270
in Xinshan.

190
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,790
You're not young anymore.

191
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,960
Why do you need so many women?

192
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,560
Zhuang.

193
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,240
What on earth are you doing?

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
How much money did you take?

195
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,200
I didn't take anything!

196
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,320
I bought stocks and traded futures.

197
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
I earned it all myself.

198
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,870
Yes.

199
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
He's good at stocks.

200
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,550
He even said he'd teach me.

201
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,110
Where did you

202
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,480
get the money to buy stocks

203
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
and trade future?

204
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,670
I borrowed it from the bank.

205
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,270
Why would the bank give you

206
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,550
such a big loan?

207
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,630
I...

208
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
I have a lot of friends.

209
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,990
Here are

210
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,320
some of his loan documents.

211
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
English?

212
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,910
Let me translate for you.

213
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,750
No need to show off.

214
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,590
I'll tell you!

215
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,150
I used Shanhai Gang's assets

216
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,990
as collateral before,

217
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,910
but the loan's paid off, and

218
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,200
the collateral is released.

219
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,510
Shanhai Gang

220
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,910
has high prestige

221
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,960
in Lion City.

222
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,810
Which bank dared to

223
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,200
use our assets as collateral

224
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,870
to give you a personal loan?

225
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,840
Exactly.

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,240
Explain what happened.

227
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,870
Rong,

228
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,630
I heard

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,390
you helped him with this.

230
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
I...

231
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,110
Zhuang,

232
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,480
when you asked me

233
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,870
to deal with the bank manager,

234
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,720
you said the bank was cutting our interest.

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Sheyan,

236
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,960
you helped him too.

237
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
Me?

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
Boss,

239
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,240
I really don't remember.

240
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,720
Give me a hint.

241
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,960
Six years ago,

242
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,390
did you kidnap a young master?

243
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,670
He told me

244
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,360
that kid was a bully

245
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,320
and needed a lesson.

246
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,750
That was the bank president's son.

247
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
You held his son for three days.

248
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,960
That's why he agreed

249
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
to offer the loan.

250
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,200
Old thing,

251
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,150
you fooled me.

252
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,840
Calm down.

253
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,680
Heihu,

254
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,230
you too.

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,160
What?

256
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,150
I often asked you to have meals with me.

257
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,390
Two tables in a restaurant,

258
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,270
one was for the bank,

259
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,550
while the other

260
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,720
was for your guys.

261
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,270
Actually, I just wanted you to sit there

262
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,960
and scare them.

263
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,160
But none of this

264
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,390
was for work.

265
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,960
It was all for myself.

266
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,510
Fine, I admit it.

267
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
I lied to them.

268
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,150
I took them for fools.

269
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,360
They never knew the truth

270
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,440
and didn't gain a thing.

271
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,030
I'm not as stupid as you.

272
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,840
You've risked your life

273
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
for the gang,

274
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,000
yet every one of you is so broke.

275
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,360
You already made so much money.

276
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,910
Why did you hurt Uncle Xiongwu?

277
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,600
I didn't!

278
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Still denying it?

279
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,550
After everything you said,

280
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,390
what's

281
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,030
the point

282
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,870
of denying this?

283
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,080
Because none of these things

284
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
were unforgivable.

285
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,390
Zhuang,

286
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,790
did you poison him

287
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
or not?

288
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,990
Enough.

289
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
Let's all calm down.

290
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's eat

291
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,480
while the fried rice noodles

292
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
are still hot.

293
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,750
Don't waste food.

294
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,320
Zhendong,

295
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,600
(Elder Zhuang's Home)
I remember you love rice dumplings.

296
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,120
Next Dragon Boat Festival,

297
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,030
bring your mom, your wife,

298
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,270
and your brother

299
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,440
here.

300
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,300
(Elder Zhuang's Wife)
Elder Zhuang and I

301
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,240
love having guests.

302
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,550
You have to come, okay?

303
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,320
Uncle.

304
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
I'm back.

305
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,630
Little Tail.

306
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,750
Pour him some herbal tea.

307
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,390
Boss made this himself.

308
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,800
To be honest,

309
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,590
this tea

310
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,000
is not as good as Mrs. Zhuang's.

311
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,470
What did you do to my wife?

312
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,840
Little Tail, step outside.

313
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,630
Mrs. Zhuang is good.

314
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,390
She said he'd make rice dumplings

315
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,320
for me next year.

316
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,750
I found this

317
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,390
at Elder Zhuang's home.

318
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,200
What... What is this?

319
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,710
Spit it out!

320
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
Elder Zhuang!

321
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
It's a slow-acting poison.

322
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,240
Taking it once is fine.

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,150
Luckily, I used to be a cop and

324
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,590
have some experience.

325
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
I kept some evidence.

326
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,470
Hand it to me.

327
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
I'll go to the hospital

328
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
and compare it.

329
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,440
No need.

330
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Cheng Hui,

331
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
you're impressive.

332
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
You caught me red-handed.

333
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,550
I was the one who used poison.

334
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,920
Zhuang?

335
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
Why did you

336
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,870
hurt Uncle Xiongwu?

337
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,230
Last year,

338
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,630
my stocks crashed hard.

339
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,720
I lost almost everything.

340
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,080
I had no other choice

341
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,320
to use the company's money.

342
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,710
However,

343
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,390
Liu Xiongwu,

344
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,750
who seemed to be careless,

345
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,320
turned out to be pretty sharp.

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,550
He caught me

347
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,200
and just wouldn't let go.

348
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,870
I was desperate,

349
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,000
so desperate that I almost...

350
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,960
thought about ending myself!

351
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I was scared
he'd hire a real accountant.

352
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,110
So, I...

353
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,280
I...

354
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,670
But it wasn't actual poison.

355
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
Otherwise,

356
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,870
he wouldn't have lasted this long.

357
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,240
A slow-acting poison

358
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,960
allows the user to do it secretly.

359
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,280
And the poison has serious side effects,

360
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,080
damaging the nervous system.

361
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
I get it now.

362
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,960
Back then, Xiongwu

363
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,670
was drinking and beating others

364
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,280
like crazy.

365
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,000
You did that to him!

366
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,670
I suspected so many people

367
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,750
but never thought of you.

368
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,870
Elder Zhuang,

369
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,030
you hid it too well.

370
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,910
You nasty old thing!

371
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,960
Because of you,
I blamed Zhendong and Second Aunt!

372
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,710
- I'll kill you!
- Stop.

373
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
It's not your turn.

374
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,750
Zhendong,

375
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,840
he didn't directly
cause your dad's death,

376
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,910
but that poison made him

377
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,670
go mad and hurt people.

378
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,960
You and your mom suffered so much.

379
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,910
You should decide

380
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,480
how we deal with him.

381
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Zhendong.

382
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Zhendong.

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,150
I'm 70 years old.

384
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,750
Please have mercy.

385
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,240
I'm 70 years old,

386
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,960
but I can still work.

387
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,320
If you have kids someday,

388
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,550
I can take care of them.

389
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,110
Don't worry,

390
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm really good at

391
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,960
babysitting.

392
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
Remember it.

393
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,550
Elder Zhuang is the senior here.

394
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,870
It's not up to me.

395
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
I'll take my leave now.

396
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,980
Isn't it supposed to be
slow-acting poison?

397
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,880
What's going on?

398
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,720
Check on him.

399
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
Looks like he took all the poison

400
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,780
at once.

401
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,030
We have to get him to the hospital.

402
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,150
No...

403
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,800
No need.

404
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,240
No need.

405
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,350
I...

406
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,590
I brought this on myself.

407
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,720
Cheng Hui,

408
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Cheng Hui.

409
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
I'm begging you.

410
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,190
Cheng Hui,

411
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,080
please,

412
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,720
I've served Shanhai Gang

413
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,110
for over 30 years.

414
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
Please don't hurt my kids.

415
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,830
They are innocent.

416
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,590
Alright.

417
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,790
We've figured it out.

418
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,430
Now Xiongwu

419
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,850
can rest in peace.

420
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,830
Elder Zhuang seems so kind,

421
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,110
and Mrs. Zhuang is a good person.

422
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,480
How come?

423
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,760
Sometimes,

424
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
our eyes

425
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,030
can be blinded by illusions.

426
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,750
Kind people

427
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,110
can be easily deceived.

428
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,280
I need to go.

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,040
Wait a minute.

430
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,440
Did Zhendong take revenge for his dad?

431
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,390
No, he didn't.

432
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,240
Hong Yan,

433
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,510
do you want him to do it himself,

434
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,350
or...

435
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,040
I don't know.

436
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,000
Anyway,

437
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
I don't want his hands to be stained

438
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,720
with too much blood.

439
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,480
So many extra copies today.

440
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,640
Mr. Xiao was so happy.

441
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,510
Let's keep it up.

442
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
Yes.

443
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,440
Nanping, we'll split here.

444
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,590
- Bye.
- Bye.

445
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,520
Well, I hid myself

446
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,640
pretty well, right?

447
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I told you

448
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,240
they wouldn't spot me.

449
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
Aren't you bored?

450
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,720
No, it means a lot.

451
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,270
Keeping you safe

452
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,110
is my responsibility.

453
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,920
I've messed up too many times.

454
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,910
Can't happen again.

455
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,070
He cut ties with me,

456
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,310
yet he sent you here.

457
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,350
He didn't ask me to do this.
