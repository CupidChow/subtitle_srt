3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,190
We already cut ties,

4
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,440
but he sent you here.

5
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,470
He didn't ask me to do this.

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
No, he asked me to do this.

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,750
You're a bad liar.

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,960
Nanping, I mean

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,270
although he didn't order me to do this,

10
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,310
he didn't send me back to Fengyun Hall

11
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,440
or gave me any tasks.

12
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Well, that means

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,350
he wants me to protect you.

14
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,880
I... I guess.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,280
Forget it.

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,600
Let's not mention him again.

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm hungry.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
I want some char kway teow.

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,360
Let's go to that place from last time.

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,800
Come on, Nanping.

21
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,510
Your favorite char kway teow.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,590
Eat while it's hot.

23
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,240
Come on.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Thank you.

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,240
Okay.

26
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,350
Have some more.

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,950
Smells amazing.

28
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,590
Zhendong,

29
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,750
you haven't recovered.

30
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
What are you doing here

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,750
at this hour?

32
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,590
I'm hungry.

33
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,790
I came for late-night snacks

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
and ran into you.

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,040
You two really get along.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,880
Did you forget?

37
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,030
When we were kids,

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,310
I used to help Aunt Shuzhen

39
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,350
take care of Nanping.

40
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,560
Yes, you're older than me.

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,670
You always had

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,880
that privilege.

43
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,510
What do you mean by that?

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,670
Sounds like you're jealous.

45
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,910
Listen,

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
after Nanping left Lion City,

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,280
Dad always took me

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,560
to visit her.

49
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm her favorite

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,440
Brother Zhongxin.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,070
Then keep trying,

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
not as her brother.

53
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,470
What do you mean?

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
Do you think

55
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,490
Nanping and I

56
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,560
are a good match?

57
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,630
But you need to know her better,

58
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,750
support her,

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,040
get close to her heart,

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
and become the person she can rely on.

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,510
But honestly,

62
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,310
I don't know
what kind of person she wants.

63
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,950
No rush.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
Take your time.

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,260
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

66
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,360
Zhongxin?

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,430
Why are you kneeling here?

68
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,310
You didn't kneel all night, did you?

69
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,160
Hush.

70
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Don't wake Dad.

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,270
He isn't even in the room.

72
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,790
I checked last night.

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,680
Dad's not here?

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
Dad.

75
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,480
Dad.

76
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,950
Dad.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
Dad must be in trouble.

78
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
What?

79
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,760
Dad once told me

80
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,230
except for this room,

81
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,960
he'd never stay anywhere overnight.

82
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,720
Something's wrong.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,240
Hurry, call the guys.

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,280
Let Uncle Heihu know.

85
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,310
- Let's go.
- Okay.

86
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,430
Where are you going?

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
Boss.

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,360
Dad.

89
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,700
(Fortune Residence)

90
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,910
I sat here all night yesterday.

91
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,110
I heard noises outside,

92
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,990
but I didn't expect it was you.

93
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,910
Why were you kneeling?

94
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,510
Dad.

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,400
Elder Zhuang did it.

96
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,550
But I acted on my own

97
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,040
and made a huge mess.

98
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,040
I almost ruined your plan.

99
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,430
I feel guilty.

100
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,310
I deserve punishment.

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Dad.

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,720
I was just worried you'd be too upset.

103
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,830
I cared about you,

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,110
so I came to keep you company.

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,600
It's karma.

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,520
Zhuang poisoned Xiongwu.

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,600
In the end, he took poison himself.

108
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,230
He ruined himself because of greed.

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,600
He thought he

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,310
could get away with it all.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
I need you

112
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,080
to recall something for me.

113
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
When he wasn't mad,

114
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,280
who did he find

115
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,520
suspicious,

116
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,040
and what did he think was strange?

117
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,350
He did mention something.

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
He said in Shanhai Gang,

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,200
someone he trusted messed up.

120
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,950
He wanted to investigate it

121
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,040
and give you an explanation.

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,440
Actually, Xiongwu

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
had been suspecting Elder Zhuang.

124
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,870
On the day he was attacked,

125
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,310
he met me in the warehouse.

126
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
He asked me

127
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,750
to find out the truth

128
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,280
about Elder Zhuang's income

129
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,640
from stocks and futures.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,880
Unfortunately,

131
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,550
when I got there,

132
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,830
Xiongwu

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,600
had been gone.

134
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,640
Xiongwu had noticed him.

135
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,240
He warned him,

136
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,120
hoping he'd

137
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,780
return all the money

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,910
he took,

139
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,870
so that his punishment could be lighter.

140
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,670
However, he went too far,

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,600
even poisoning others.

142
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
He really

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,470
had it coming.

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,080
Why should I be upset?

145
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,360
Dad,

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
I know

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,880
all this time,

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
you've always valued brotherhood.

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,670
What he did was unforgivable,

150
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,870
but after all,

151
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,000
he was your old friend.

152
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,240
But these years,

153
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,150
all your old friends

154
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,190
have left you one by one.

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm worried about you.

156
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,390
Dad!

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,830
Gui's cooking is unmatched.

158
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,670
I've missed the taste

159
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,550
for days.

160
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,430
If you like it,

161
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,830
I'll bring it to you every day.

162
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
I'll return home soon.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,160
You got shot.

164
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,480
You should stay longer

165
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,790
until you fully recover.

166
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,840
Well,

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,310
I can always come back for checks.

168
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,910
This hospital feels so stuffy.

169
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,070
I just can't stand it here.

170
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,910
Besides,

171
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,950
if I stay every day at the hospital,

172
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,870
how can I spend time with Mom?

173
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,750
Right?

174
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,430
Mom,

175
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,120
aren't you tired?

176
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,670
You should get some rest.

177
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Well,

178
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,120
which girl is coming

179
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,670
to bring food for you?

180
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,400
Trying to get rid of me?

181
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,120
No.

182
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,430
Who are you?

183
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,270
Food delivery.

184
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
Just leave it there.

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
You've already eaten.

186
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,430
Then I won't leave it here.

187
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,120
It'll smell if left inside.

188
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
It won't be comfy for you either.

189
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,720
I'll make something else tonight

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
and bring it over.

191
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,270
Miss,

192
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,310
what's your name?

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
Madam,

194
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,590
I'm Liu Suibian.

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
What?
[*Suibian: whatever]

196
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,980
(Liu Suibian)
Suibian.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
Mr. Liu gave me the name.

198
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
Zhendong,

199
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,550
why did you give her a nickname?

200
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,550
So rude.

201
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,550
It's my

202
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,880
real name.

203
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,550
When did I give you a name?

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,190
That day, I had a surname.

205
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,430
Then I asked what my name should be.

206
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,760
You said, "Whatever."

207
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,760
I really like this name.

208
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,510
Mom,

209
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
it's a long story.

210
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
You should leave.

211
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,630
Miss,

212
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,400
what do you do for a living?

213
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,640
I have no job.

214
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,550
Where do you live?

215
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,960
I stay at a brothel.

216
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,040
Madam, please don't misunderstand.

217
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,790
Even though I live there,

218
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,310
my reputation is clean.

219
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,670
That's all thanks to Mr. Liu.

220
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,550
I belong to him.

221
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,280
You're my savior's mother.

222
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,910
I'll kowtow to you.

223
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,860
(Ward Area, No Admittance)

224
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,710
The food's a bit plain,

225
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,670
but she must've tried her best.

226
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,430
She said

227
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,710
she's yours.

228
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,830
What are you going to do?

229
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,400
Like a stubborn bandage,

230
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,710
she's stuck to me now.

231
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll give her something to do

232
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,000
and get her settled.

233
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,760
You're really something, huh?

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
Mom,

235
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,150
one day, I'll

236
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,590
become Shanhai Gang's leader.

237
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,160
Giving her a position
is a piece of cake.

238
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,590
It's easy to say.

239
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,160
What will she do?

240
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,390
Pull a rickshaw,

241
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,600
watch the casino,

242
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,480
or work at the pier?

243
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,030
Listen,

244
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,510
a woman from a brothel

245
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,960
can never get into our family,

246
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
not even as a concubine.

247
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,600
You better break it off now.

248
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,760
Don't meet her again.

249
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,500
(Filial Piety)

250
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,950
I've been thinking

251
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,240
who is

252
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,790
a true talent.

253
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,950
Of course, it's you.

254
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,480
Don't try to flatter him.

255
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,790
I'm not flattering.

256
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
Besides me?

257
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,950
Then it's Zhao.

258
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Nonsense.

259
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,430
Zhao,

260
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,510
what do you think?

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,910
Well...

262
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
Rong.

263
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,720
Why?

264
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,070
Rong's smart and strong,

265
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,120
bold and careful.

266
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,240
He follows the rules.

267
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,640
He's a true talent

268
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,160
only second to you.

269
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,310
He's the one.

270
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,670
Because of the money,

271
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,640
Xiongwu punished Rong.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,990
I checked the accounts myself.

273
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,830
The mistakes Xiayi Hall made

274
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,080
weren't on purpose,

275
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,080
just a bit careless.

276
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,670
The books were just handed in late.

277
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,030
Do you mean

278
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,360
Xiongwu went a bit far?

279
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,520
I can't say for sure.

280
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,840
It was indeed too far,

281
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,880
especially the fine part.

282
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,830
He forced Rong to sell his house.

283
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,430
He really went too far.

284
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,720
Do you think he'd resent the gang

285
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,670
because of that?

286
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,030
No, I don't think so.

287
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,790
He told me

288
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,550
he never regretted

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,480
joining Shanhai Gang.

290
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,710
After I came back,

291
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,790
I had a real talk with Rong.

292
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,310
After all, as soon as I returned,

293
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,510
you put me in

294
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,790
such a crucial spot.

295
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,190
I worried Rong would overthink.

296
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Turns out

297
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,240
I was overthinking.

298
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,750
That's a relief.

299
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Just help me

300
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,120
persuade him

301
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
to leave Shanhai Gang.

302
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
Boss.

303
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,000
Rong

304
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,640
has been here for over 30 years

305
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,550
and worked so hard.

306
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,120
He made mistakes,

307
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,880
but none of them are serious.

308
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,710
After Bin Langxiong died,

309
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,520
Qiankun Society fell apart.

310
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,790
Street thugs started showing up,

311
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,520
and some of them are desperadoes.

312
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,400
The neighbors

313
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,600
couldn't find peace.

314
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,190
We have to handle that.

315
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,640
You want to take them in?

316
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,750
Take them in?

317
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,080
Isn't that what Zhongxin

318
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,160
did before?

319
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,040
It looked like
he took in Qiankun Society

320
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,360
and even took over their turf,

321
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,390
but in reality,

322
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,160
we never truly won their trust.

323
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,160
Instead, we fueled more resentment,

324
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,240
and it might become a threat.

325
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,790
That's the point.

326
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,030
It's even easier

327
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,070
for schemers to use this against us.

328
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,200
They might spread the rumor
that Shanhai Gang is

329
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,160
challenging the government,

330
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,870
and other gangs

331
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,790
would feel uneasy

332
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,590
and join forces

333
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,630
to deal with us.

334
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,790
Boss,

335
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,080
are you suggesting Rong

336
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,400
should leave Shanhai Gang

337
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,480
and become

338
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,880
the leader of Qiankun Society?

339
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,400
Qiankun Society

340
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,430
has been around for over 10 years.

341
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,960
They won't just let us

342
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,160
take them in,

343
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
unless we send someone

344
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,520
smart and brave to step in

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,960
and take charge.

346
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,950
And we can't wait.

347
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,960
If the others get them first,

348
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,190
we'll miss the chance.

349
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,710
You're right.

350
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,640
However, I'm afraid

351
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,670
Rong probably won't agree.

352
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,400
Reason with him.

353
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,270
First,

354
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,950
Rong can see the bigger picture.

355
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,310
Second, Qiankun Society's leader
also enjoys

356
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,400
a high prestige in Lion City.

357
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,910
He'll value this chance.

358
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,240
Third,

359
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
this move

360
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,480
will affect

361
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,480
Shanhai Gang's future.

362
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,630
Think about it.

363
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,390
If Qiankun Society

364
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,390
keeps making trouble,

365
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,760
the government will step in early

366
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,160
and clear the gangs.

367
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,830
And we'll suffer

368
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,190
the biggest loss.

369
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,000
Got it.

370
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,430
Zhao,

371
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm counting on you.

372
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,000
Zhendong,

373
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
you're out?

374
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,390
Little Tail,

375
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,910
what did you just say?

376
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,350
You're out?

377
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes.

378
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,630
I've fully recovered.

379
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,440
Staying there is pointless.

380
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,200
- Is Master Cheng here?
- No, he's not.

381
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,080
He'll be back later.

382
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,390
Then deliver a message for me.

383
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,760
I got injured

384
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,520
and made them worry.

385
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,910
I want to host a meal.

386
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,950
No problem.

387
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,500
(Filial Piety)

388
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,550
Soup's here.

389
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,270
Here we are.

390
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,520
With just a few of us,

391
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,720
you prepared so many dishes.

392
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,280
It's not that much.

393
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,390
I ordered the soup in advance.

394
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,560
Drink it while it's hot.

395
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,960
As for the other dishes,

396
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
I picked each one carefully.

397
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,990
Uncles, please dig in.

398
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,760
The soup's fresh.

399
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,470
Actually,

400
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,550
I also invited Rong,

401
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,960
but he left Shanhai Gang

402
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,670
and couldn't come.

403
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,800
I also invited Zhongxin.

404
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,910
He wanted to come,

405
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,390
but you dismissed him.

406
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,910
He wouldn't dare come.

407
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,680
I don't want Zhendong's hands to be

408
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,000
stained with too much blood.

409
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,520
I'll

410
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
raise a glass for you.

411
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,470
I don't drink wine.

412
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,180
Uncle,

413
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,280
drink whatever you like.

414
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,560
Wishing you good health.

415
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,230
Wish Shanhai Gang prosperity.

416
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,360
I'll finish my drink.

417
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
Zhendong has recovered,

418
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,350
and we need real talents.

419
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,830
Last time, we announced
that we'd pick a new leader

420
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,830
after Xiongwu's 100-day memorial.

421
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,040
It's about time.

422
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,920
Do you have someone in mind?

423
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,200
Yes.

424
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,150
He's here.

425
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,520
A smart young man

426
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,110
who studied abroad,

427
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,480
fought and nearly died

428
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,390
for us.

429
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,280
He's the perfect choice, right?

430
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,320
Heihu.

431
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,380
What do you think?

432
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,350
I think it's a good idea.

433
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,480
I've watched him grow up.

434
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,660
I trust him.

435
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,470
Zhendong,

436
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,590
is this why you invited us?

437
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,840
No, Uncle.

438
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,750
I can do anything,

439
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,960
whatever the position is.

440
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,790
Hope I can

441
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,280
give my all for the gang soon.

442
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,270
If I could ease

443
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,590
your worries a bit,

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
that'd be even better.

445
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,240
To be honest,

446
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,880
at your age,

447
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,830
you're still

448
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,110
doing everything yourself.

449
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,920
I really feel bad.
