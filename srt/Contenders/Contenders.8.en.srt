3
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,410
If we do it your way,

4
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,020
we'll need a lot of stuff.

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,610
Maybe I can look for them in the garage.

6
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,050
That'll cost money.

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Come on.

8
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,430
I'll tell them it's for you,

9
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,610
and they won't charge me.

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,380
Rules are rules.

11
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,760
It's still their business.

12
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,010
Get some money.

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,780
Take this.

14
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,100
Xiang.

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,690
Remember two things.

16
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,330
First, don't buy new stuff.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Reuse the old ones.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,970
Second,

19
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,000
always bargain with them.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
Bring the cost down.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,320
Okay, got it.

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,060
Take it easy.

23
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,780
Why did you come here?

24
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,090
Aunt.

25
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,250
Master Cheng asked me over.

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,660
He's my only son.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,780
You asked him to fight four guys!

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,530
Do you want him to die?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
I'm really confused.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,570
One against four?

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,150
He's working for Sheyan
at Zhongxiao Hall.

32
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,250
How could this even happen?

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,780
Gui saw it with her own eyes.

34
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,430
If the police hadn't come in time,

35
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,370
he would've been dead!

36
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,400
Wait, calm down.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
Let me call them.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,300
Wait a second!

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
He listens to you.

40
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,080
Help me persuade him

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,500
to go to Paris with me.

42
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,570
Tomorrow,

43
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,770
get him

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,380
on that boat, whatever it takes.

45
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,620
It's a good thing to go to Paris.

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,030
Why didn't he agree?

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,380
It's all because of you.

48
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,810
You've always told him,

49
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,220
"Born a Shanhai Man,

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,500
die a Shanhai Ghost.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
A Shanhai Man for a day,

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,180
a Shanhai Soul for Life."

53
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,780
He quit his job

54
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,030
because he heard

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,290
you wanted to cultivate young ones.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,030
Is this really training?

57
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,570
You're sending him to hell!

58
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,090
Master Cheng, Boss!

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
What's wrong?

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Boss,

61
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,620
I have some good news.

62
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,970
Zhendong is truly a talent.

63
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,390
He fought Qinglong Gang alone

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,070
unscathed.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,250
It was a big win!

66
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,150
Boss.

67
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,090
- Boss.
- Boss.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,740
- Ms. Hong.
- Ms. Hong.

69
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,220
She's here to settle the score.

70
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,180
What did I tell you?

71
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,100
How could you let him fight?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,530
It's not my fault.

73
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,180
You made it clear,

74
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,850
and I did as you told me.

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,570
Zhendong is too upset,

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,780
and he's still angry.

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,690
Just let him be for now.

78
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,060
Boss, don't worry.

79
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,570
I'll train him well.

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,080
Don't give him any tasks.

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,020
Let him cool off.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,630
He'll get bored

83
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,340
and leave the gang.

84
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,850
Boss.

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Xiongwu is gone.

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,680
Zhendong

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,430
must be safe.

88
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,370
Do you get it?

89
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,260
I gave him an easy job

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,660
and kept him close to me.

91
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,800
I swear.

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,340
He was supposed to watch Zhendong.

93
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,260
He listened to everything Zhendong said.

94
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,170
He even stopped reporting to me!

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,070
It's all my fault!

96
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,010
Where is my son?

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,630
He went out last night

98
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,000
and still hasn't come back.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,940
Hong Yan,

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,060
don't worry.

101
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,950
Zhendong went to the police station

102
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,700
with Qinglong Gang.

103
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,370
He informed them in advance.

104
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Just need to pay some money.

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
Zhendong persuaded

106
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,370
a gang to join us by himself.

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,660
Well,

108
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,100
Qinglong Gang agreed to join us

109
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,000
as part of Zhongxiao Hall.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Actually,

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,260
Qinglong Gang had some beef with us

112
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,630
and even took our turf

113
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,820
while we were in trouble.

114
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,830
But Zhendong

115
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,930
sorted everything out.

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,340
No more problems.

117
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,280
Boss, you said

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,490
you wanted to cultivate talents.

119
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,370
Zhendong is truly a talent.

120
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,850
Boss, I have an idea.

121
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,890
I want to talk to you.

122
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,630
Hong Yan,

123
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,600
Zhendong was born

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,240
to be a leader.

125
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,720
No one can stop him.

126
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,040
Besides, everyone knows

127
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,610
he killed Wu A'nan.

128
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,690
Sorry about that.

129
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,020
(Da De Xing Restaurant & Teahouse)
Guys,

130
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,220
Leader Li gave the word.

131
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,820
From now on, Dong

132
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,260
is our new boss.

133
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,460
No one holds grudges.

134
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,600
Got it?

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,890
- Got it!
- Got it! Come on!

136
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,820
Cheers!

137
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,900
Cheers!

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,050
Come on, cheers!

140
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,240
Cheers!

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,090
Bottoms up!

142
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,170
Cheers!

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,260
Order whatever you want.

144
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,630
- It's on me.
- Okay!

145
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,080
- Thanks, Dong.
- Thanks, Dong.

146
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,180
Thanks, Dong!

147
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,270
Come on.

148
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,160
Come on, let's drink.

149
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,340
I'll bring my friends here.

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
Come on.

151
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,620
This is really good.

152
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,360
Bak kut teh

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,300
and some pastries.

154
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,090
Officer Zheng,

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,300
my former boss.

156
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll go say hi.

157
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,980
Take your time.

158
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,060
Sir.

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,100
What a coincidence.

160
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,210
Good to see you.

161
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,560
I was seriously injured,

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,730
but you didn't visit me.

163
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Sir,

164
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,070
you've been through

165
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,040
all kinds of things.

166
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,100
This is just a scratch.

167
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,870
You quit your job

168
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,600
without telling me.

169
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
As the chief,

170
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,070
I have to see you in person.

171
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,900
Just to see me?

172
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,660
I'm so flattered.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,970
I'm a bit nervous.

174
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,780
You've always liked gangs.

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,180
You've got what you want.

176
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,160
Congrats.

177
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,290
You recruited Qinglong Gang.

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,140
How did you know?

179
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,490
Did you send someone to follow me?

180
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,260
Well, I didn't,

181
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,450
but

182
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,610
you're so famous,

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,290
and you have brothers
in the police station.

184
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,340
You can easily let them
arrest or release someone.

185
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
If I didn't know this,

186
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,360
I'd be a terrible chief,

187
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,930
wouldn't I?

188
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,930
The officers

189
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,820
enforce the law impartially.

190
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,630
It's just

191
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,580
that they still respect me.

192
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,690
After all,

193
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,500
I bought them coffee for years.

194
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,580
That's called connections.

195
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,610
Okay.

196
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,980
Do you remember

197
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,100
the deal

198
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,540
we once had?

199
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,180
I'm a police officer,

200
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,770
and you're a gangster.

201
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,170
I'm a chief,

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,730
and you're a gang leader.

203
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,290
Together, we can make Chinese people

204
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,140
rise in Lion City.

205
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,100
Honestly, I admire you.

206
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,130
How dare you say this?

207
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,020
Have you no shame?

208
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,120
Back then, your plan was

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,530
to let my dad retire.

210
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,900
At worst, he'd be in jail
for a few years.

211
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,340
But now he's gone.

212
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,410
You're a liar.

213
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,970
I arrested him

214
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,250
and asked him to retire

215
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,460
because I wanted him

216
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,970
to live a little longer,

217
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,170
but he wouldn't listen.

218
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,360
He kept making enemies.

219
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,340
Who could've saved him?

220
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,020
Nonsense!

221
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,940
You're the reason my dad's dead.

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,020
Do you have any proof?

223
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,300
I'll find it.

224
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,650
To be honest, I think you did it.

225
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,870
You know

226
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,820
your relationship

227
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,790
with your

228
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,770
so-called father.

229
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,730
You called him dad for many years

230
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,940
just to go back and be the leader.

231
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,550
But he arranged for you to be a lackey.

232
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,610
Could you accept it?

233
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,970
Besides,

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,260
he hurt your mom,

235
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,700
almost beat her to death.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,130
Everyone knows

237
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,420
you love your mom.

238
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,730
So,

239
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
you had more righteous reasons

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,340
to kill him than I did.

241
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm quite curious.

242
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,180
Did you do it yourself,

243
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,490
or did you hire someone else?

244
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,570
Shut up!

245
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,460
You better be careful.

246
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,220
Don't let Cheng Hui find out.

247
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,850
He's ruthless, you know.

248
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,250
He doesn't care who you are.

249
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,460
Better work with me.

250
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,750
After all, I can help you

251
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,890
take over Shanhai Gang.

252
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,460
No need.

253
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,100
I'd rather rely on myself.

254
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,900
I just saw Master Cheng.

255
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,140
Master Cheng is here!

256
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,900
Master Cheng.

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,910
- Boss!
- Boss!

258
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,220
- Boss!
- Boss!

259
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,300
Master Cheng.

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,940
Young Master Zheng,

261
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,570
how have you been?

262
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,540
I haven't heard you

263
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,370
call me this for 30 years.

264
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,970
Back then, I often gave you rides.

265
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,000
You helped me a lot.

266
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,850
Lately, I've been thinking of you.

267
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,060
I'm grateful, you know.

268
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,700
You also helped me a lot.

269
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,580
I worked my way up

270
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,730
to the chief.

271
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,420
Couldn't have done it
without Shanhai Gang's support.

272
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,970
It's been two years,

273
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,220
but you haven't changed.

274
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,940
Well, you look

275
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,020
much younger.

276
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,100
Well, you weren't in Lion City,

277
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
which made my job easier.

278
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,140
Is that so?

279
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,940
Just kidding.

280
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,740
Sorry about that.

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,180
You're still injured.

282
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,910
Why didn't you ask me

283
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,890
how I got hurt?

284
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,960
If I did ask,

285
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,340
you'd just blame me for it.

286
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,370
Why bother asking you?

287
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,130
Fate brought us here.

288
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,940
I'm so glad to see Officer Zheng here.

289
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,670
(Great Ambitions)

290
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,960
Kid, you're so careless.

291
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,550
Why didn't you tell me

292
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,850
you'd meet with your uncle?

293
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,970
It wasn't planned.

294
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,490
We met by fate.

295
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,270
Sorry.

296
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,510
I'm too busy right now.

297
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,420
I'll treat you next time.

298
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,610
You definitely should.

299
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,720
Shanhai Gang

300
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,080
has caused much trouble lately.

301
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,020
It's a deal.

302
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
Sit down. Come with me.

303
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,540
- Okay, Boss.
- Thanks, Boss.

304
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,690
Take care, Boss.

305
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,780
Uncle.

306
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,840
One against four,

307
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,270
you're really something now.

308
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,030
Not really. Uncle, you know

309
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,970
when it comes to fighting,

310
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,650
Zhongxin is the best.

311
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,610
I'm just telling the truth.

312
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,660
Look at how strong you are.

313
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,650
He's always bullying me.

314
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,420
I'm not here to joke around.

315
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,030
Your mom bought two tickets

316
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,600
to Paris tomorrow.

317
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,890
She wants you to go with her.

318
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,320
I think it's a good idea.

319
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,480
- Wait...
- Well,

320
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,600
just keep your mom company

321
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,750
and let her relax a bit.

322
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,690
No.

323
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,440
Uncle, now that you're back,

324
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,970
Shanhai Gang looks stable,

325
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,540
but that's not really the case.

326
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,970
I can't leave at this point.

327
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,750
Born a Shanhai Man,

328
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,080
- die a Shanhai Ghost.
- Enough.

329
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,840
Don't say this again.

330
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,940
Your mom doesn't like it.

331
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,610
A Shanhai Man for a day,

332
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,870
a Shanhai Soul for life!

333
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,460
- Hey!
- Who are you saying that to?

334
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,890
You're an adult now.

335
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,150
I can't make

336
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,820
decisions for you.

337
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,970
But you're a good son,

338
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,490
and your mom worries about you.

339
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,900
It's

340
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,390
up to you.

341
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,330
Dad.

342
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,890
Without a car,

343
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,390
things are so inconvenient.

344
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,790
How come?

345
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,080
In Qingmai, we always

346
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,020
relied on our own feet.

347
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm used to it.

348
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,590
By the way,

349
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,750
where are we heading now?

350
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,690
Well, I remember there's

351
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,060
a used bicycle shop nearby.

352
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,840
They sell bikes the westerners

353
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,850
have worn out, right?

354
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Yes.

355
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,030
On the next street.

356
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,960
- This way?
- Yes.

357
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,330
Cheng!

358
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,410
- Who are you?
- Qi,

359
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,940
step aside.

360
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,540
Lin?

361
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,720
Cheng, you still remember me.

362
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,630
I really appreciate it.

363
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,580
How could I forget you?

364
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,140
Do you need anything?

365
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,660
Cheng,

366
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,020
you're respected by all.

367
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
If you could host

368
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,770
my son's wedding,

369
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,610
that would mean a lot to me,

370
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,300
and my son and his wife

371
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,940
would take care of me

372
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,860
when I'm old.

373
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,850
What does your son do?

374
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,460
What else could he do?

375
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,540
He sells chicken rice, just like me.

376
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,460
The shop is right there,

377
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,940
on Heihu's street.

378
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,260
Qi,

379
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,320
whose turn is it to host the big meal?

380
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,300
It's Rong's turn.

381
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,750
Tell him

382
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,690
it's on me.

383
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,680
We'll eat at

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,530
Lin's son's restaurant.

385
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,540
Let them know.

386
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,570
Alright.

387
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,780
Come on.

388
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,030
Tell me what you wanted to

389
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,060
but wouldn't dare to say.

390
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,090
Tomorrow, Cheng Hui will send someone

391
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,220
to get you on the boat.

392
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,900
No way.

393
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,420
He said

394
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,180
I can make my own choice.

395
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,690
My Lady,

396
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,730
how about...

397
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,380
Liu Zhendong.

398
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,610
Since you were born,

399
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,300
I've never hit you

400
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,460
or said anything harsh.

401
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,750
Today,

402
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,420
I have to say this.

403
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,370
If you don't come with me,

404
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,150
I'm afraid we'll never

405
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,890
see each other again.

406
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,740
(Shanhai)

407
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,900
(Hainanese Chicken Rice)

408
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,850
Found anything?

409
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,900
Nothing.

410
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,890
I was supposed to treat today,

411
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,200
but Boss insisted.

412
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,490
I thought it'd be somewhere nice.

413
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,250
This place is so old.

414
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,270
Look,

415
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,200
someone

416
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,610
just wrecked the place.

417
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,060
Rong,

418
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,250
when he treats us,

419
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,700
does it matter what we eat?

420
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,970
Of course not.

421
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,060
The chicken rice Boss loves

422
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,810
must be good.

423
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,370
Well, but

424
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,490
he's cooking alone.

425
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,650
How long do we have to wait?

426
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,940
Almost done.

427
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,300
Come on, Lin.

428
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,390
Bring that over here.

429
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,330
Alright.

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,580
Good food's worth the wait.

431
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,340
We can catch up.

432
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,540
When Shanhai Gang

433
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,980
first started,

434
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,340
there were already
a leader and a deputy leader.

435
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,180
The deputy leader

436
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,770
was called Deputy General,

437
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,460
Baishan was the strategist,

438
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,890
and the treasurer managed the money.

439
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,540
In five years,

440
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,210
the gang grew bigger,

441
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,330
and more people joined.

442
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,220
So we decided

443
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,910
to set up the halls.

444
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,970
Liuliu,

445
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,160
the names of the four halls

446
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,250
were all your ideas.

447
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,730
Each has its own meaning.

448
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,540
Come on, explain them to us.

449
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,380
Fengyun Hall

450
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,300
means staying strong in the storm.

451
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,970
It runs business

452
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,850
and is also responsible

453
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,120
for scouting

454
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,060
and gathering intel.

455
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,370
Huang Jinhu, the first hall leader,

456
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,060
pushed a cart of explosives

457
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,700
and went down fighting pirates

458
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,130
to save our brothers.

459
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,060
His body was never found.

460
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,610
Peng,

461
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,130
you're his successor,

462
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,740
and you've done a good job.

463
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,930
Zhongxiao Hall

464
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,100
means loyalty and filial piety,

465
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,660
mainly responsible for

466
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,100
punishing traitors and taking

467
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,860
care of our brothers.

468
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,970
She Xingwang,

469
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,500
Sheyan,

470
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,060
is the first hall leader.

471
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,890
He's tried his best.

472
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,940
Boss, that's my duty.

473
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,050
Xiayi Hall

474
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,100
means chivalry and justice,

475
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,890
responsible for helping the people

476
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,300
and training newcomers.

477
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,370
Rong is also the first leader.

478
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,250
When we chose you,

479
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,370
many people disagreed.

480
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,650
But I insisted anyway.

481
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,450
Do you know why?

482
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,020
You said I spent a few more days

483
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,050
in school than others did.

484
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,130
Not just a few days.

485
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,770
Some of our brothers

486
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,340
can't even read or write,

487
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,890
but you went to a normal college.

488
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,340
That's right.

489
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,450
If Shanhai Gang wants to grow,

490
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,580
we need more

491
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,650
educated people.

492
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,880
Otherwise, how could we

493
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,930
trust you with

494
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,970
training newcomers?

495
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,500
I haven't done well these years.

496
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,020
No need to be so modest.

497
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,520
Weiyuan Hall

498
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,020
means good reputation,

499
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,340
responsible for socializing

500
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
and defending our group in battles.

501
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,660
Heihu.

502
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,210
You're the third hall leader.

503
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,650
Your predecessors

504
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,270
both died

505
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,210
for us.

506
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,050
I suggest

507
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,500
we use tea instead of wine

508
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,730
and toast to everyone

509
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,100
who died for us.

510
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,310
Master Cheng,

511
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,020
you seem a bit down today.

512
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,340
Got something to say to us?

513
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,820
Nothing serious.

514
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,650
I'm not down either.

515
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,610
A big meal every ten days

516
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,680
has always been our tradition.

517
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,820
First,

518
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,740
it brings us together

519
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,890
and helps us catch up.

520
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,160
Second,

521
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,370
whether it's good news

522
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,490
or bad news,

523
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,540
we can discuss it

524
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,860
openly.

525
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,620
So today,

526
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,770
who wants to start?

527
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,680
Boss,

528
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,620
let me go first.

529
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,730
Guys,

530
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,260
Zhendong recruited Qinglong Gang.

531
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,350
He's a brave

532
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,290
and talented young man.

533
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,060
I believe

534
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,170
no one else can do this

535
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,820
except for Master Cheng.

536
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,820
Boss,

537
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,920
like you said,

538
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,590
Rong is well-education.

539
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,350
So is Zhendong.

540
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,990
He even studied abroad.

541
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,580
My leg is broken now,

542
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,200
and I've been the leader

543
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,140
for decades.

544
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,570
I'm more than willing

545
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,830
to hand it over to Zhendong.

546
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,730
Are you okay with that?

547
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
Of course.

548
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,910
If it was someone else,
I wouldn't do it.

549
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,500
But Zhendong is our late leader's son.

550
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,560
Obviously,

551
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,300
he's loyal to our group.

552
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,610
As for filial piety,

553
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,500
he took down Wu A'nan himself.

554
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,310
He's a loyal member and a filial son.

555
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,450
I truly admire him.

556
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,140
Liuliu,

557
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,260
what do you think?

558
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,890
It's too soon

559
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,380
to make him the leader.

560
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Yes.

561
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,070
After all, he just left the police.

562
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,410
