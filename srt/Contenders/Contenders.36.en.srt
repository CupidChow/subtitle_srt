00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,520
Nobody move!

4
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,990
Put your weapons down!

5
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,560
Hands in the air!

6
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,520
Officers,

7
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,910
these are the human traffickers.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,070
They've all been handled.

9
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,550
I have eyes. I can see for myself.

10
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,680
How did you find this place?

11
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,750
Who tipped you off?

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,430
It was our colleagues
from Shanhai Storage.

13
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,640
They suspected

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
this warehouse

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
was doing something illegal.

16
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,550
So, we came to check it out.

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,350
I didn't know
they kidnapped so many people.

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,310
Look.

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,190
Everyone, drop your weapons!

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,680
Hands in the air!

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,440
Search them!

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,680
Cuff anyone

23
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,400
with weapons!

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,080
Here's an armed criminal.

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,270
Take his gun

26
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,550
and cuff him.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,710
Dong.

28
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,380
(Liu Zhendong)

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,750
Here's my business card.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
So, it's you.

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,480
I've heard your name.

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
Didn't expect to meet you here.

33
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,270
Except for Officer Liu,

34
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,400
everyone shall be taken back
for interrogation.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,360
Why?

36
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,080
Shanhai Gang came to help.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,280
Why question them?

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,550
They have weapons.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,080
Whether they were
saving people or killing people

40
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,430
is not up to you.

41
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,030
We must interrogate them.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
- Step aside.
- Nonsense...

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
Go back to the station

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,840
and explain

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,200
how you got here.

46
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,390
Take them away!

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,760
Listen,

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,030
James

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,430
is hard to deal with.

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,430
Even Zheng Qiu is no match for him.

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,270
I can tell.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,030
However, these years,

53
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,680
he's been lenient with the gangs.

54
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,990
For small fights,

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,030
he'd just ignore them.

56
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,390
Does he like money?

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,550
Not really.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,760
Women?

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,150
No.

60
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,590
Then it's getting tricky.

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,120
Why are you arresting us?

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,310
Can the police arrest anyone

63
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,710
they want to arrest?

64
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,550
Listen,

65
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,280
they started it, not us!

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,140
You should know this!

67
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,240
Are you serious?

68
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,150
We were there to help!

69
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,200
Understand?

70
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,080
Exactly.

71
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
Gang members who finished interrogation

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,760
can leave now.

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,590
What's the whistle for?

74
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,670
Well...

75
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,960
Sir,

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,920
you can go.

77
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,070
Let's go!

78
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,600
Come on, time to go home!

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,630
Told you it was fine.

80
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,430
Police are so great, huh?

81
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,750
Arresting people for no reason!

82
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,240
Keep your eyes open next time!

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
(Police Station)

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,830
Come on, this way.

85
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,510
Finish the fingerprints, and you can go.

86
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,950
Alright, line up here.

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,910
One at a time.

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,360
Hurry up.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Let's go.

90
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,470
Let's go.

91
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,430
Hurry up.

92
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,570
Zhendong came back

93
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,680
with a different identity.

94
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,830
Come on, keep moving.

95
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,360
James called him Officer Liu.

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,990
He's working for the government.

97
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know if he'd hold a grudge

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,190
for what happened before.

99
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,270
No matter what,

100
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,720
he got there first

101
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,830
and saved Nanping.

102
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,230
Zhongxin!

103
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,590
Step aside.

104
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,680
Don't go over there!

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,600
Back up!

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,560
Get back!

107
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,950
You can't go there!

108
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,910
Move back!

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
It's too dangerous.

110
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,910
Back up!

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,560
Step back!

112
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,120
Congrats.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Zhongxin!

114
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,600
Dad!

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,870
My baby boy!

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
Do you like it?

117
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,310
(Huang Jinhu, Zhongxin's Father)
Yes.

118
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,510
Dad, you try some too.

119
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,920
Move! Let me in!

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,880
You can't come in!

121
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,680
Officer Zheng,

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
he broke in!

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,760
What are you doing?

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,960
Put the gun down.

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,440
Put it down.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,550
He's an old friend.

127
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Huang Zhongxin.

128
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,270
I watched him

129
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,510
grow up.

130
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,720
Get out. Hurry.

131
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,640
Yes, sir.

132
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,270
What's wrong? What do you need?

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
Uncle Zheng,

134
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,240
where is the person?

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
Who are you talking about?

136
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,720
You mean your bride

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,800
Nanping, right?

138
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,280
I just saw her.

139
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,390
She already left.

140
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,510
Didn't you see her?

141
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,480
Sir, I'm not talking about Nanping.

142
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm talking about

143
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
the person you carried

144
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,070
into the car.

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,720
Oh, that's right.

146
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,000
It happened right

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
in front of me.

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,120
He's my dad!

149
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,950
Zhongxin,

150
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,680
is it because your bride disappeared

151
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,950
on your wedding day,

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,680
and now you're losing it?

153
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,390
Your dad is Cheng Hui,

154
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,800
the leader of Shanhai Gang.

155
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
He's also running for the president

156
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,990
of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,630
He's a major figure.

158
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,720
Why would someone like him

159
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,360
show up in my office?

160
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,080
Sir,

161
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,950
I'm talking about my real dad.

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
You mean

163
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
the one in the accident was your dad?

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
Yes. I think he's

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,160
my real father,

166
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
Huang Jinhu.

167
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,070
How's that possible?

168
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,280
Huang Jinhu died in that explosion

169
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,550
20 years ago.

170
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
A lot of people saw it happen.

171
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,360
Back then,

172
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
you were just a kid.

173
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
How could you even remember?

174
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,950
How could I ever forget?

175
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,870
I grew up without a mom.

176
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,390
My dad raised me on his own.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,480
He really struggled

178
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,680
to take care of me.

179
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,430
When we had food,

180
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,760
he always gave it to me.

181
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,310
How could I ever forget that?

182
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,830
Sir,

183
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,030
Uncle Zheng,

184
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,270
I'm begging you.

185
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,390
Please tell me.

186
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Where is he now?

187
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,390
You almost

188
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,120
convinced me.

189
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,510
I saw that person

190
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,870
have a car accident.

191
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,370
That guy...

192
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,080
Though he's badly injured,

193
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,670
I think he'll survive.

194
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,000
Look, just go back

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
and take care of your bride.

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll help you find out

197
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,600
which hospital he's in.

198
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,550
Once I know,

199
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,630
I'll tell you in person.

200
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,680
Okay?

201
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,280
Don't worry.

202
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,350
Zhendong!

203
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,630
Nanping.

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,920
Thank you.

205
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
You saved me again.

206
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,280
It's nothing.

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
But how

208
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,790
did you know I was in trouble?

209
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I was supposed to be at

210
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
your wedding.

211
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
After all,

212
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,790
me, you, and Zhongxin,

213
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,670
we all grew up

214
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,630
together.

215
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,870
Why didn't you tell me

216
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,040
you were getting married?

217
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
How could I tell you?

218
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,990
You disappeared for four years.

219
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
So now it's my fault?

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
By the way, you haven't

221
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,440
seen Zhongxin, right?

222
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,200
I picked out a gift and asked him

223
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,400
to give it to you.

224
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,910
I want to talk to you.

225
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,440
Can we talk here?

226
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,670
I came back with my mom.

227
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,200
Then come with me.

228
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
Nanping.

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,320
This time, I won't leave.

230
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,750
Let's talk about it later.

231
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,200
No.

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,990
This is your new home.

233
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,150
My photo's also here.

234
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
I looked pretty cool

235
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
back then.

236
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,920
Thanks.

237
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,350
Why?

238
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,830
What?

239
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,320
You did it on purpose.

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
You used that girl

241
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,350
just to push me away.

242
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,990
Did I?

243
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,670
I really don't remember.

244
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,550
Back then, you knew

245
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,630
that I liked you.

246
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Don't say that.

247
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,840
You're married now.

248
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,800
Not yet.

249
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,560
When you left Lion City,

250
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,870
you didn't take her with you.

251
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,270
I'm a reporter.

252
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,750
I've discovered

253
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,960
the truth.

254
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,360
You saved her life,

255
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,150
and that's all.

256
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Is that so?

257
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,120
So, why did you avoid me?

258
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
You were away for 4 years.

259
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,470
I was still young

260
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,080
and couldn't figure out many things.

261
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,470
I got upset

262
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,080
and wanted to leave Lion City.

263
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm not talking about Lion City.

264
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,840
It's about you and me.

265
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,630
When you saved me

266
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,990
at the warehouse,

267
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,720
I suddenly realized

268
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,480
you must've had your reasons.

269
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,200
Who forced you to leave?

270
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,600
Tell me.

271
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,390
Right here,

272
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,870
we're alone.

273
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,150
I'll give you a chance to explain.

274
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,120
If you're not honest with me,

275
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
from now on,

276
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,670
let's never see each other again.

277
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,990
It's kind of funny.

278
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,560
I was tricked back then.

279
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,200
All this time, I thought

280
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,960
you were my real sister.

281
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,440
I've never seen a father like this.

282
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,080
He's made a statement.

283
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,630
He's not my father.

284
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,990
I can't believe he did this

285
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,960
for that woman.

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,960
Woman?

287
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,510
Zheng Qiu?

288
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
Zheng Qiu lied to you.

289
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,870
A year after I left Lion City,

290
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
I finally got the courage

291
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,840
to ask my mom about it.

292
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,630
I ended up getting slapped.

293
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,390
So, at that time,

294
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,600
why didn't you just return to Lion City?

295
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,560
I told you I had things to do.

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,720
You've never loved me.

297
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
Nanping.

298
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,480
I always see you as my sister.

299
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,030
But now you know

300
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,750
I'm not your sister.

301
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,670
And I've never

302
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,320
seen you as my brother,

303
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,870
unlike Zhongxin.

304
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,800
Isn't this good between us now?

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,390
Just see me as your brother.

306
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,870
Coward.

307
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,270
You think you're brave,

308
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,390
but deep down, you're just scared.

309
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,510
But I'm

310
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,160
not.

311
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,920
Gui.

312
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,670
You're really something.

313
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,790
You've already

314
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,240
tidied up the entire house.

315
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,320
After we went to Paris,

316
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,980
Gui's nephew

317
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,320
came to take care of our house.

318
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,480
What's his name again?

319
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,600
Xiang.

320
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,630
Yes.

321
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,910
He did a great job.

322
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,400
Look, our house looks great.

323
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,600
My Lady, don't praise him.

324
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,790
I just asked him.

325
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,270
Turns out he didn't do it.

326
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,150
He didn't?

327
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,030
Then who did it?

328
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,910
Well, I told him

329
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,240
to clean up every week.

330
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,750
He said

331
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,750
every time he came,

332
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,270
there'd always be a girl
waiting outside.

333
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,990
She came in and started cleaning

334
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,630
and left right after finishing up.

335
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,270
Who is it?

336
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,560
I know who she is.

337
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,120
My Lady, you've seen her too.

338
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,320
She's the one

339
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Young Master gave a name to.

340
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,080
Liu Suibian?

341
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,750
There's something else.

342
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,870
I'm not sure

343
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,960
if I should say this.

344
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,910
It's about Liu Suibian.

345
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,840
Please don't say it in front of me.

346
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I've got things to do.

347
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,200
I'll be back later.

348
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,470
Young Master!

349
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,750
What is it?

350
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,080
I don't know if I should congratulate you

351
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,280
or...

352
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:48,220
(Suibian Teahouse)

353
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,350
Mr. Wang,

354
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,600
see you next time.

355
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,870
Okay.

356
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,960
Take care.

357
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,910
Okay.

358
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,150
Fresh tea just arrived.

359
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,990
Come and try.

360
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,840
Fresh tea just arrived.

361
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,160
Come...

362
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,480
Sir, sir!

363
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,750
Looking for some fun?

364
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
You're in the wrong place.

365
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,840
It's no longer a brothel.

366
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,480
It's a teahouse now.

367
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,390
If you want some nice girls,

368
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,670
just come with me.

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,670
Many new faces!

370
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,030
You can try something new.

371
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's go, come on.

372
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,960
Get lost.

373
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,240
Fine, I'll go.

374
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
No need to be so rude.

375
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,100
(Suibian Teahouse)

376
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,440
Sir, can I get you anything?

377
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,360
Come on in.

378
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,320
This way, please.

379
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,360
Be careful. Come in.

380
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,630
Okay, please have a seat.

381
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,550
Come on, call him Dad.

382
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,510
Dad.

383
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,350
He...

384
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Who is he?

385
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,790
He's your son.

386
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,630
He's three years old.

387
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,440
He doesn't have a name.

388
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,310
Mr. Liu, please

389
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,440
give him a name.

390
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,560
I've got things at home.

391
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,920
I have to go.

392
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,320
Come on,

393
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
go home with your dad.

394
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,550
Mom,

395
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,720
why are you here?

396
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,870
This child?

397
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,990
Yes.

398
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Mom...

399
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,350
Do they look alike?

400
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,800
Yes. Exactly the same.

401
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,470
How old are you?

402
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,040
Three years old.

403
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,320
What's your name?

404
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,950
No name.

405
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,840
Waiting for Dad.

406
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,470
His voice is so sweet.

407
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,430
He's just like
Zhendong when he was a kid.

408
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,550
Stop.

409
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,870
Can you leave here now?

410
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,840
We have staff.

411
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,080
Come home with Grandma.

412
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,030
Okay?

413
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,040
Grandma.

414
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,510
Let's go.

415
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,640
Get them in the car.

416
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
Okay, come on.

417
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,520
Hurry up and go home.

418
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,880
Look.

419
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,470
He must be Ms. Liu's man.

420
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,400
Ms. Liu is so lucky.

421
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,360
Yes.

422
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,710
Let's go.

423
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,820
(Happiness)

424
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,600
Come on, take a look.

425
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
Ping.

426
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,670
We had so many guests yesterday.

427
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,360
Downstairs was packed.

428
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,810
It was really lively.

429
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,790
These are

430
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,080
the wedding gifts from everyone.

431
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,750
Sorry.

432
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,480
It's okay.

433
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,600
I've listed

434
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,910
all the guests.

435
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,280
When we have time,

436
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,560
we'll treat them in return.

437
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
But we can't gather everyone together.

438
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,950
After all, having two weddings

439
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,440
would be a bit awkward.

440
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,550
Why don't you

441
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,800
check out the bridal chamber?

442
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,270
Do you like it?

443
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,220
Return the gifts.
