3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
Ever since Xiongwu

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,270
became the leader,

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,040
he often got drunk

6
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,390
and beat people.

7
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,390
Ms. Hong Yan

8
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,720
was born into a rich family.

9
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,310
Even after getting married,

10
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,830
she was always treated well.

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,960
She held a grudge and wanted revenge.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
That makes sense.

13
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,720
But Zhendong

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,960
would never poison his own dad.

15
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,230
Zhendong,

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,710
why don't you explain?

17
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,520
I did this. My son is innocent.

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,520
If you won't do it,

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,320
then I'll do it myself!

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
- My Lady!
- Mom!

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
My Lady!

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,960
Boss.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,240
Zhongxin.

24
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,070
Kneel and apologize.

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,470
Why, Dad?

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,750
Stop defending them!

27
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,950
And I'm sure

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
the words written on it

29
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,000
were Liu Zhendong's work.

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,510
If I'm wrong,

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,510
I'll cut off my hand!

32
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,750
Besides,

33
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,070
Killer Chapon

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,590
hid in a crate

35
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,230
and sneaked into the warehouse.

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,230
Liu Zhendong helped him do it!

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Liu Zhendong,

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
if you're a real man,

39
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,880
explain everything today!

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,470
What do you want me to say?

41
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,470
Hand me the poison.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,000
Let me check it.

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,320
Okay.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
I really wrote it.

45
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,440
You didn't write it!

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,510
It's all my fault.

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,750
Just let me die.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,750
This has nothing to do with my son!

49
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,440
It's not just your fault.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,440
Since childhood, Zhongxin

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,720
has been jealous

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,910
of my good handwriting.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,160
You can't deceive him.

54
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,190
Besides,

55
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,160
you've always taught me

56
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,120
to be honest.

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,350
I can't lie.

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
I gave these

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
ten packs of medicine to you.

60
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,950
Can't you tell?

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,670
These people

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,000
want us dead!

63
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,470
- Stop!
- Zhendong!

64
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,350
What are you doing?

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
It's too sweet.

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,750
Thankfully,

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
you didn't put this in the soup.

68
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,630
Otherwise,

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
dad would blame you for

70
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,550
adding too much sugar.

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,920
You...

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,800
You what?

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Why don't you try some?

74
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,510
Uncle Sheyan,

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,880
I remember

76
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,270
you love sweet food.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,790
You can try this.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,870
Boss!

79
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,750
Dad!

80
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,680
Dad!

81
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,430
I told you to apologize.
Didn't you hear?

82
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,430
You swore before Lord Guan,

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,070
and is this how you treat your elders?

84
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,430
Do you want to die?

85
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,270
Mom!

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,960
Zhongxin's never good at talking,

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
but he's kind-hearted.

88
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,070
And he said

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
he was doing

90
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,830
everything

91
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,830
to honor

92
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,520
Dad's soul.

93
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,200
Please forgive him.

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
Zhongxin.

95
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,720
You were right.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,270
I did think about

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,160
killing Liu Xiongwu.

98
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,270
It's not your fault.

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
Dad shouldn't have beat anyone,

100
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,040
but Mom also lost it

101
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,910
and said she'd kill him.

102
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,150
So,

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
I could only mix sugar

104
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,310
and some nutrients

105
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
together

106
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,160
to make this so-called poison.

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,600
Mom,

108
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,270
you're the closest person to me

109
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,160
in this world.

110
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,000
Whatever you decide,

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,990
I'll stand by you.

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,670
But think it over.

113
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,470
Once you use it,

114
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,160
all ties will be gone.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,110
Mom's not part of the gang,

116
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,950
but

117
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,960
she's loyal and righteous.

118
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
Even though they divorced,

119
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,470
she'd never hurt him.

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,910
I'm sure about that.

121
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,150
Cheng Hui.

122
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,720
I messed up first.

123
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,470
According to the rules,

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,480
you can decide

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,360
how to punish me.

126
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,510
Zhongxin really cares for Xiongwu.

127
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,160
And that's not easy.

128
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Enough.

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,990
Stop defending him.

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
Aunt,

131
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,390
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,430
I deserve to die!

133
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,910
I shouldn't have
doubted you and Zhendong.

134
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,360
I really messed up!

135
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,790
Please forgive me!

136
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
Get up now.

137
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,800
Master Cheng,

138
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,110
the police are here!

139
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,800
Officer Zheng, Cheng Hui, Sheyan,

140
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
Heihu, and Rong are here.

141
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,910
They kidnapped someone.

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,000
It's dangerous.

143
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,040
We must be decisive.

144
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,990
Whoever uses a weapon or fights back

145
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
shall be executed!

146
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,080
Yes, sir!

147
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,070
Uncle Zheng,

148
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,950
my dad is inside.

149
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,430
He'd never kidnap Zhendong!

150
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,910
No one may obstruct official duties.

151
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,070
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,750
Move!

153
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,160
(Fengyun Hall)

154
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,270
- Uncle Zheng!
- Don't move!

155
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,390
Zhongxin,

156
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,310
you invited such important guests.

157
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,710
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,230
Seems like they're not here
for the meal.

159
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,710
Search everyone!

160
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,400
Lackeys!

161
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,670
It's just a meal. Why search our place?

162
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,310
How dare you talk like that?

163
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
This is our territory,

164
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,910
yet you charged in like wild dogs.

165
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,910
You deserve this!

166
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,400
Yes, I said it.

167
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,760
Why don't you shoot me?

168
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,630
Put it away.

169
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,030
Let's go.

170
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,480
Are you having tea?

171
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,510
Yes.

172
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,910
Zhongxin became the hall leader,

173
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,910
and Zhendong survived the incident.

174
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,790
It's worth celebrating.

175
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,710
They both call you Uncle.

176
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760
Now that you're here,

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,670
sit down and have a drink.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,630
- Gui.
- Yes.

179
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,510
Bring a set of dishes.

180
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
Okay.

181
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,150
Zhongxin.

182
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,910
Where's the food

183
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,910
you ordered from Zhongxing Tower?

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,550
I'm getting hungry.

185
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,240
Almost here.

186
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,960
Fei, check the food.

187
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay.

188
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,220
(Fengyun Hall)

189
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
Ping?

190
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
Nanping called the police.

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,430
For Lion City's safety,

192
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,670
especially from gang trouble,

193
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,670
kidnappings, and attacks,

194
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,750
I had to respond.

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,430
Nanping,

196
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,880
they're having tea here.

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,830
They invited Zhendong, not you.

198
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,200
So, you thought

199
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
they kidnapped him?

200
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,400
Seems staying with gangsters

201
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,790
really keeps you on edge.

202
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,240
I feel sorry for you.

203
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,510
So,

204
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,070
I won't blame you for

205
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,550
this false report.

206
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,390
Zhendong,

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
are you alright?

208
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,150
Nanping.

209
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,070
You were worried,

210
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,960
so you told Zheng Qiu

211
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,870
and called the police

212
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,750
instead of asking me,

213
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,960
right?

214
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
Get out!

215
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,960
- Nanping!
- Stop.

216
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,750
Don't think you can

217
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,150
get away with this just because

218
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,160
Hong Yan defended you.

219
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,240
Think about it,

220
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,310
are you still fit to lead Fengyun Hall?

221
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,480
No bodyguards today.

222
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,910
And she's in our territory.

223
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,480
What are we waiting for?

224
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,200
Elder Zhuang,

225
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,590
right now, only you

226
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,280
can speak up for Zhongxin.

227
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,430
He's a filial kid.

228
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,950
He'll remember your kindness forever.

229
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,710
You really care about Zhongxin.

230
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,950
I watched him grow up.

231
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,670
No other reasons?

232
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,160
I remember

233
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,790
you and Huang Jinhu
were from the same place,

234
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
even the same village,

235
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,390
right?

236
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,880
Yes, the same village.

237
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,000
We even sailed across the sea

238
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,400
and came here together.

239
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,760
Since Huang Jinhu passed away,

240
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,760
in my heart,

241
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,950
Zhongxin has always been
like my own son.

242
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,670
That's touching.

243
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,790
These days,

244
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,520
that kind of bond

245
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,830
is truly rare to see.

246
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,160
Honestly, I really want to help you.

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
But...

248
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,910
I'm also in trouble right now.

249
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,190
Elder Zhuang, no kidding.

250
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
Zhao,

251
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,550
an old member,

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,120
may have

253
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,880
made mistakes,

254
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,190
but we need people right now.

255
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,760
So, it's reasonable

256
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,240
to rehire him.

257
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
However,

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,280
he brought Xu Guangrong

259
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,320
to our big meal.

260
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,200
What does that mean?

261
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,430
Rong, you're smart.

262
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,190
Can't you tell?

263
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,590
He learned accounting abroad.

264
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

265
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,790
He doesn't trust me anymore,

266
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,080
understand?

267
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
It's not like that.

268
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Didn't he just

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
praise your work

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,040
a couple days ago?

271
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
At most,

272
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
he thinks you're getting older

273
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,430
and wants to help you.

274
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,390
Do I seem old?

275
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,950
I feel full of energy!

276
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,480
Xu Guangrong

277
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,190
knows Nanping's mom.

278
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,430
He keeps calling her Shuzhen.

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,670
He just doesn't trust me.

280
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,480
He trusts his brother-in-law!

281
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Elder Zhuang.

282
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,280
Among the elders,

283
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,000
you're the closest to me.

284
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,390
I'm

285
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,000
begging you.

286
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,040
Please speak up for Zhongxin.

287
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,390
Sit down.

288
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,390
Cheng Hui

289
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,750
is suspicious.

290
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,160
We can't rush.

291
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,270
After all,

292
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,710
Zhongxin is his godson.

293
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,430
When he cools off,

294
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,160
we'll figure out our next step.

295
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,390
Understand?

296
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,620
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

297
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,790
How did you know
Xiongwu was poisoned?

298
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,430
I...

299
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,640
I figured it out.

300
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,070
Say that again.

301
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,310
I saw it on your desk.

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,910
This is a big deal.

303
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,190
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

304
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,120
All right, I'm telling you now.

305
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,790
Hong Yan means a lot to Shanhai Gang.

306
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,520
She always keeps her word.

307
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,240
Back then, we helped her

308
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,510
got her family business back,

309
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,670
and she donated half of it!

310
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,120
Thanks to her investment,

311
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,840
we built Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet

312
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
and rented the yard.

313
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,430
She and Xiongwu

314
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,190
had a deep bond.

315
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,000
They'd risk everything for each other.

316
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,240
There's no way she'd poison Xiongwu!

317
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,630
Besides,

318
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,480
they'd got a divorce,

319
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,950
and Xiongwu hardly ever ate at home.

320
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,190
How could she get the chance?

321
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,120
Dad, I...

322
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
I really didn't know that!

323
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,550
Even Little Tail knows,

324
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,480
how could you not know?

325
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Master Cheng,

326
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,240
are you here

327
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,670
because you think
he was poisoned at home?

328
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,510
What's wrong?

329
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,070
No way.

330
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,520
Leader Xiongwu rarely came home.

331
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,550
He only came back when he was drunk.

332
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,040
Plus, he often beat his wife.

333
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,670
She wouldn't cook for him.

334
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,910
How do you know all this?

335
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,640
Leader Xiongwu told me himself.

336
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,150
However,

337
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,790
he wanted to apologize to her,

338
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,400
so he even asked me to deliver pastries.

339
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,480
It's such a big deal,

340
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
yet you jumped to conclusions without

341
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,670
a thorough investigation.

342
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,910
Two lives!

343
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,880
Tell me,

344
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,160
why are you after Hong Yan?

345
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,070
I'm not targeting Hong Yan!

346
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,910
So, it's Zhendong, right?

347
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,150
Zhongxin.

348
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,040
You're so narrow-minded.

349
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm so disappointed.

350
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
You've lost

351
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,480
my trust.

352
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,390
Step down as the hall leader

353
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,280
and leave Shanhai Gang.

354
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,470
Dad!

355
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,390
Dad, I'm sorry!

356
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,040
Please don't kick me out!

357
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,520
Dad!

358
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,800
Boss,

359
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
you should try the club.

360
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,200
No need.

361
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,160
Alright.

362
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,830
Tomorrow, get to the court by 10 a.m.

363
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,200
and take a few swings to warm up.

364
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,920
Usually, Charles shows up

365
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,760
at 1 p.m.

366
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,590
That's when the sun's the strongest.

367
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,350
Actually, he plays golf

368
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,830
just to sunbathe.

369
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,080
Got it.

370
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,430
You can head back.

371
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,950
Master Cheng,

372
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,830
what did Zhongxin do?

373
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,630
I saw him kneeling outside.

374
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,280
Let him go.

375
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Wait.

376
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,590
Draft a statement for me.

377
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,830
I'll cut ties

378
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,440
with Nanping.

379
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,840
What?

380
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,840
Boss.

381
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,910
Bin Langxiong is here.

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
He wants to see you.

383
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,200
With the Four Heavenly Kings

384
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,760
and the two brats,

385
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,320
Master Cheng.

386
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,680
Are you shutting everyone out now?

387
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,120
Bin Langxiong.

388
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,550
Who's a brat?

389
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,000
When you started out,

390
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,070
I even guided you!

391
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,720
You ungrateful brat!

392
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
Do you want to die?

393
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,840
We welcome our guests.

394
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,840
Master An.

395
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,230
What do you want?

396
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,310
He led Shanhai Gang before,

397
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,870
but I'm also Qiankun Society's leader.

398
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,790
This is the entrance hall.

399
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,270
Who do you

400
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,720
think you are?

401
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,120
I'll kill you!

402
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,390
Master An,

403
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,950
please come inside.

404
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,040
Qiankun Society is nothing.

405
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,280
How dare he argue with Master Cheng?

406
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,040
I wish I could kill him.

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,520
He's been acting so bold lately.

408
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,550
Did he find a supporter?
