=Episode 35=

3
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,230
He developed the photos himself

4
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,240
and stayed up all night.

5
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,910
He grabbed the photos

6
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,760
and rushed out.

7
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,440
Is the roll here?

8
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,470
He left in a hurry.

9
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,470
He probably didn't take it.

10
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,470
That's great.

11
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,390
Where's the roll?

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,640
Let's look for it.

13
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,760
Found it.

14
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,640
Sir,

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,120
could you help me develop

16
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,190
these photos?

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,360
Okay.

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,870
Boss,

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
we found a lead.

20
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,680
The Xiangfu people

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,990
showed up at those places.

22
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,670
Could it be Xiangfu Gang?

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,270
What Xiangfu Gang?

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,000
20 years ago,

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
we kicked them out

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,740
for kidnapping and robbery.

27
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,710
Boss,

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
they aren't the same people.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,150
This is a new gang.

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,870
They started with petty crimes,

31
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,280
but lately,

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,240
they've gotten bolder.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,190
That's right.

34
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,150
It's definitely them.

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,200
Dad.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,870
Calm down. Tell me,

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,480
have you found anything?

38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,640
It seems the kidnappers
are from Xiangfu Gang.

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,240
We went to their base,

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
but no one was there.

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,280
Nanping must be

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,240
tracking down the news.

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,270
She told me about

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,480
the missing people,

45
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,590
but the police did nothing.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,120
What should we do?

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
How could she

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
try to track down human traffickers

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,150
for the news?

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,270
She's so bold.

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,200
Does Xiangfu Gang

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,830
have other business?

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,200
Besides their base,

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
do they have any other spots,

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
such as

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,120
caves,

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,000
warehouses,

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
or factories?

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,240
Zhao's right.

60
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,680
Nanping

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,870
found a dozen missing cases.

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,150
There are so many people.

63
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,150
There must be a place.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
Brothers,

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,040
let's do what Boss said.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,270
Go out and check everywhere.

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,550
Don't miss any spot

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
that can hide people.

69
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,590
- Yes!
- Let's go!

70
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,550
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,190
Hello.

72
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,150
Have you seen these people?

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,520
No, I haven't.

74
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,310
Excuse me,

75
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,310
have you seen them?

76
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,030
Excuse me,

77
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,960
have you seen these people?

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
No.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,430
Guys, can you help me

80
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,830
- check a place?
- What's wrong?

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
Sorry for the trouble.

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,240
Come on.

83
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,200
Check this place.

84
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,520
Come on, check this out.

85
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,360
If anyone knows this place,

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,750
late-night snack

87
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,710
is on me tonight.

88
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,750
This spot feels familiar.

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,950
I've been there before.

90
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,750
I think...

91
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,190
We've got newcomers.

92
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,680
Everyone, stay sharp.

93
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,750
Okay.

94
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,070
Give me another one.

95
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,920
Hurry up, play your card.

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,990
I won again.

97
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,870
So lucky.

98
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,800
I lost again.

99
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,760
New stuff today.

100
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,310
Yes.

101
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,630
She looks so pretty.

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
Xiaojie.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,000
Xiaojie?

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,300
(Han Xiaojie, Reporter)
Xiaojie?

105
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,220
(Four days ago)

106
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,030
Hold on!

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,760
What are you doing?

108
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,160
There's a woman inside.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,870
She's my wife.

110
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,770
Your wife?

111
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,630
What's wrong with her?

112
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,590
She's sick.

113
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
She's unconscious.

114
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,240
I'm taking her to the hospital.

115
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,720
Why cover her with cloth?

116
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,830
She can't breathe.

117
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,120
It's contagious.

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
None of your business!

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,320
Let's go.

120
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,830
Wait a second.

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm going to the hospital.

122
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,070
Mind your own business!

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
Stop!

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,320
Don't run!

125
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,870
I wandered on the street you chose

126
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,870
all day.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
Someone else went missing.

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
Did you report it?

129
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,030
Yes, I did.

130
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,990
But police said it was not long enough

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,390
to call it missing.

132
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,040
So, no case was filed.

133
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,470
An hour ago,

134
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,160
I spotted a pedicab.

135
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,920
It looked suspicious.

136
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm sure

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,480
there was someone alive on it.

138
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,790
Here.

139
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,080
At this intersection.

140
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,630
I lost them here.

141
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,240
They got rid of me

142
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,200
here too.

143
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,830
The place it leads

144
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,990
rarely has people.

145
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,040
Listen,

146
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,000
let's go and look for

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,040
the places in this area

148
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
that can hide people.

149
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,720
No, Nanping.

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,440
It's too late.

151
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,680
If we go now,

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,750
we won't see anything.

153
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,440
Besides,

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,430
your wedding's coming.

155
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,550
If I knew this would happen,

156
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,870
I should've postponed it.

157
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,870
You can't delay your wedding.

158
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
If Zhongxin knows about this,

159
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,950
he'll definitely hit me.

160
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,030
Look,

161
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,070
I'll check the area tomorrow.

162
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,710
Don't worry.

163
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,830
Just focus on the wedding.

164
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,910
Alright.

165
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,190
If you find any leads,

166
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,150
let me know right away.

167
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,230
Okay.

168
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,310
Another one.

169
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,160
Give me a hand.

170
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,190
Come on, help me out.

171
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,520
Be careful.

172
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,830
Nanping,

173
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
look.

174
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,320
Should we call the police?

175
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,910
From the photos,

176
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,790
they don't look like

177
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,960
human traffickers.

178
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,550
But I saw

179
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,750
those sacks moving.

180
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,630
There must be people inside.

181
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,270
Will the police believe us?

182
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
We've called the police before.

183
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,030
This place is really remote.

184
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
If we want the police's help,

185
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,670
we'll need a high official

186
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,480
to approve a special operation.

187
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,360
It's not that simple.

188
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,200
Then let's ask Shanhai Gang.

189
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,150
Why?

190
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,030
Since I was a kid,

191
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,240
I've heard they uphold justice.

192
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,600
They handle

193
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,560
what the police can't.

194
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,670
Zhongxin used to be

195
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,960
a hall leader of Shanhai Gang, right?

196
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,510
Tell him about it,

197
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,840
and they'll definitely help us.

198
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,790
Think about it. If there are

199
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,200
really dozens of kidnapped victims,

200
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
and Shanhai Gang saves them,

201
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,720
we'll get breaking news.

202
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
No.

203
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,150
A gang's many actions

204
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,240
aren't even legal.

205
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,080
The government wants to shut them down.

206
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,720
As the most trusted
Chinese paper in Lion City,

207
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
how can we use gangs

208
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,150
for stories?

209
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,630
Besides,

210
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,150
we don't have real evidence.

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
If we take photos of them,

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,990
and the police ignore it,

213
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,390
then we can go to Shanhai Gang.

214
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
How about this?

215
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,870
We'll wait there.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,910
We have to get

217
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,120
stronger evidence today.

218
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
Nanping,

219
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,390
it's your wedding day.

220
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Is this really more important

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,990
than dozens of lives?

222
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,630
It's a deal.

223
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,680
We'll go together.

224
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,080
Once we get the evidence,

225
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,350
one of us will stay there,

226
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,670
and the other will call the police.

227
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,630
Nanping.

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,040
You drink it.

229
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,270
It's been quiet all day.

230
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Nanping,

231
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
I made the wrong call.

232
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,990
Let's just head back.

233
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,470
Let's go to the wedding.

234
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,560
And I'll clear my head.

235
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,750
Look,

236
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,870
I'll go in and check it out.

237
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,560
Those guards

238
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,750
look really fierce.

239
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,910
If there's nothing illegal,

240
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,750
no matter how fierce they look,

241
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,800
what could they do?

242
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,240
If anything goes wrong,

243
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,350
just call the police.

244
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,750
Find an officer surnamed Gou.

245
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
If he won't help you,

246
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,750
just mention this name,

247
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,030
Liu Zhendong.

248
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,270
Nanping,

249
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,230
let me handle this.

250
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,590
You stay here.

251
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,750
You can run fast.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,150
That's why I'm counting on you.

253
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,870
Hi.

254
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
I work for Hengtai Company.

255
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,630
We have a lot of goods to store.

256
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,150
I'm looking for a warehouse.

257
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,910
Can I look around?

258
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,870
Okay?

259
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,830
Thank you.

260
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,990
Miss.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,150
Can you untie me?

262
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,590
I'll figure something out.

263
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,680
I'll get you all out of here.

264
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,990
We're in trouble.

265
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,390
All the docks are locked down.

266
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,920
It's fine.

267
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,600
The pirates agreed to help out.

268
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,080
We'll use small boats
to reach international waters.

269
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,800
We only need to

270
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,910
give them a few pretty girls.

271
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,270
If anything goes wrong,

272
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,960
kill them.

273
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,990
Don't leave any evidence.

274
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,120
You're drunk.

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,390
You're totally drunk.

276
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,720
This is hilarious.

277
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
Xiaojie.

278
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,710
Xiaojie.

279
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,320
Wake up.

280
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,630
Nanping.

281
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,470
Untie me.

282
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,710
Hey!

283
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,960
They're two troublemakers.

284
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,960
Then we'll bury them alive.

285
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,110
No, wait.

286
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,200
We'll cut off their ears

287
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,840
to scare the others.

288
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
Do it!

289
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,270
Come at me!

290
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,270
