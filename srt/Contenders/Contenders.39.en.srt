3
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
Alright.

4
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,880
I'll do my best to help Zhendong,

5
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,430
as long as he cooperates.

6
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,720
Got it.

7
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,230
Just wait.

8
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,270
Once I get enough evidence,

9
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,870
I'll definitely

10
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,790
avenge Shuzhen.

11
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,040
Did you ever suspect

12
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,070
Zheng Qiu?

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,190
Now that I think about it,

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Zheng Qiu must've leaked

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,710
the information to Long Shiqi.

16
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,030
I might as well

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,880
tell you everything.

18
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,910
When Zhendong was a kid,

19
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,240
Zheng Qiu always lied to him,

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,150
just so he would believe

21
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,640
that you were his dad.

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,590
Really?

23
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,080
Zhendong was naive,

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,400
and Xiongwu was careless.

25
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,080
He often said

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Zhendong looked like you,

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,310
and Zhendong believed him.

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,240
No wonder.

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,270
Last night, he...

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,760
I came back this time

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
because I want to

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,200
settle this whole thing.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Shuzhen deserves answers.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,560
But Zhendong said

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,920
Zheng Qiu's got deep roots in Lion City.

36
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,990
Taking him down won't be easy.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
We need to be absolutely sure.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,920
So,

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,820
he became an anti-crime agent.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,870
Zhendong's not stupid at all.

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,480
Zheng Qiu's just too cunning.

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,270
He went all out

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,800
to avenge his dad.

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
You know,

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,200
I've never liked violence.

46
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,240
But if I got the chance,

47
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,750
I'd kill Zheng Qiu myself.

48
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,120
Grandma,

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,200
who are you going to kill?

50
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,400
I won't hurt anyone.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm just telling your grandpa a story.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,550
Come here, give me a hug.

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,920
Who is this?

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,240
Why didn't you tell me
she had a child?

55
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,590
Well, you didn't ask.

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,550
I...

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,530
Sir,

58
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,150
she came from a brothel.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,590
It's normal to have a child.

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
Nonsense!

61
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,170
She was never a courtesan.

62
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,270
It's over.

63
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm totally trapped.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,150
Wait, sir,

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
is that

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
your child?

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,690
Yes.

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,560
Sir,

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
I can't believe you did this.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
You won't get away with it.

71
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,830
You became a dad

72
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,990
without a wedding.

73
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
No.

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,120
You must treat us to a banquet!

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,520
Host your own banquet!

76
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,680
Sir, you like Nanping.

77
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,990
It's okay.

78
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,920
Give that woman some hush money

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
and tell her to keep quiet.

80
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,510
If you don't want to go, I can.

81
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,630
I'll threaten her.

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,750
I'm an anti-crime agent.

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,310
If you're corrupted,

84
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,870
I'll arrest you!

85
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,320
Come on.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,750
I'm counting on your promotion.

87
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,590
Sir.

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,550
Get on with what you've been assigned.

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Yes, sir.

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,510
Should I call you Agent Liu?

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Call me whatever you want.

92
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,230
I heard you were back.

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,800
I was so happy that I couldn't sleep.

94
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,430
You look a lot more mature now.

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,390
I haven't stirred up
trouble these years,

96
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,240
so it must've been easier for you.

97
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,800
You even look younger.

98
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,830
Back then,

99
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,160
I always said you'd make it big.

100
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,640
Guess I was right.

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,280
You came back for work?

102
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,390
I used to work here,

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,240
so I'm here to see some old friends.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
You grew up in Shanhai Gang,

105
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,280
so you value friendship.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,960
Let's grab a meal together

107
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,190
to welcome you back, okay?

108
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,150
Okay.

109
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,270
Come on.

110
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,240
You came back

111
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,190
and became the governor's favored aide,

112
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,160
holding real power.

113
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,480
It seems I need to

114
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
rely on you now.

115
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,360
No problem.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,320
No problem.

117
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,840
The pier was sealed,

118
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,070
and I thought Shanhai Gang

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
had connections with the new governor.

120
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,240
Turns out it was you

121
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,240
who helped them behind the scenes.

122
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,630
That's just

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,720
what I should do.

124
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,870
Nanping is my real sister.

125
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,590
If you

126
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,720
hadn't told me

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,680
about it,

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,310
I'd still be in the dark now.

129
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,160
Well, that person

130
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,910
is really ruthless.

131
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,800
To become the gang leader,

132
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,310
he even forced you to leave.

133
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,240
He's so heartless.

134
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,950
Uncle Zheng, you're right.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
I hate him.

136
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,950
I'll always hate him.

137
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,780
Then why did you

138
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,070
come back?

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,850
Uncle Zheng, don't you know

140
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,830
why I came back?

141
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,140
I became an

142
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,390
anti-crime agent.

143
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,510
Isn't the goal obvious enough?

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,830
I just want to

145
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,920
take back

146
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,480
everything I've lost.

147
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,920
Have you forgotten

148
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,950
our promise?

149
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,390
If we team up,

150
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,630
Lion City will be at our feet.

151
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,680
Uncle Zheng,

152
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,270
you're not

153
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,510
backing out now, are you?

154
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,910
No, I'm not.

155
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,150
Of course not.

156
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,600
But after all,

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,750
I made some mistakes

158
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,040
in the past.

159
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,190
I'm just worried

160
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,360
you have doubts about me.

161
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
What?

162
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,190
Uncle Zheng, what mistakes

163
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,150
did you make?

164
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,430
It's been four years.

165
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,830
Why don't you

166
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,990
remind me?

167
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,720
For example,

168
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,430
I failed your mother.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,190
Oh, I know that.

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,680
You two were once engaged.

171
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
That wasn't your fault.

172
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,950
It was the older generation.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,960
My grandpa's

174
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
family fell,

175
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,190
so your dad canceled the engagement.

176
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,120
You didn't really have a choice.

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,870
I'm so glad

178
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,510
to hear this from you.

179
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm just worried Hong Yan

180
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,630
might say bad things about me.

181
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,630
I'm worried your misunderstanding

182
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,590
about me might get worse.

183
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,750
No way.

184
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,150
My mom often says

185
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,240
good things about you.

186
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,300
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,670
And Xiongwu.

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
I'm also responsible for his death.

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
After all,

190
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,870
I'm the chief.

191
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,240
We still haven't caught the culprit.

192
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,160
Uncle Zheng,

193
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,150
this really isn't your fault.

194
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,000
Back then,
I always gave you a hard time.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,480
You had no choice.

196
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,440
I used to be a cop,

197
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,510
so I get it.

198
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,470
You're not being

199
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,440
sarcastic, aren't you?

200
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
No, I'm not.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,960
Uncle Zheng.

202
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,270
Even if I once held grudges against you,

203
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,510
that's all in the past now.

204
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,990
Compared to how Cheng Hui hurt me,

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,390
those things mean nothing.

206
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,110
Besides,

207
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,320
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

208
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,120
We're in this together now.

209
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,560
Are you really willing

210
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,630
to go against Shanhai Gang?

211
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,590
Of course.

212
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,480
Cracking down on crime

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,030
is my duty, right?

214
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,510
Both of us work

215
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,390
for the government,

216
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,350
don't we?

217
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,030
Still don't trust me?

218
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,830
Uncle Zheng,

219
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,080
I've been away for four years.

220
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,960
I've figured out

221
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,030
what I should do.

222
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,110
This drink is for you.

223
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,030
To our collaboration.

224
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,680
To our collaboration.

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,160
Will Liu Zhendong

226
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,080
hamper your plan?

227
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,320
He claimed he wouldn't stop me.

228
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,240
Sometimes he's easy to fool,

229
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,200
but sometimes he can be very sly.

230
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,710
What should we do?

231
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,510
Why don't we stop

232
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
and kill that person?

233
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,360
That'd be a shame.

234
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,510
It was god that

235
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,200
helped me find that person.

236
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,560
How can I miss

237
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,270
such a great chance?

238
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,480
I really don't get it.

239
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,510
How come you couldn't

240
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,320
find him?

241
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,990
Zhongxin.

242
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,320
I was just looking for you.

243
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,230
Zhongxin.

244
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,230
Zhongxin.

245
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,560
Where are you going?

246
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,230
Zhongxin.

247
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,030
I know you're upset.

248
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,080
When Boss

249
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,750
asks you questions...

250
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,470
I know what to say.

251
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,830
Don't come with me.

252
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,150
You're here.

253
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,510
I talked to Ping.

254
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,240
That kid...

255
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,590
Honestly,

256
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,870
her actions are hard to take.

257
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,510
She's so stubborn.

258
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Don't be mad at her.

259
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,270
Give her a bit more time.

260
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,750
Besides,

261
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,260
everyone knows how you feel

262
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,560
about each other.

263
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm not here

264
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,270
to talk about Nanping.

265
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
Sit down.

266
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,150
Do you need money?

267
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,960
President Zhang called me.

268
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,320
He said you reached out to him.

269
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,350
Yes.

270
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
Also,

271
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,720
Xu Guangrong said

272
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,440
someone broke into

273
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,670
his house this morning.

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
That was me.

275
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,670
But I didn't wear a mask to steal

276
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,390
but to help Shanhai Gang

277
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,440
investigate

278
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,390
your private account

279
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,480
in Chase Bank.

280
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,670
President Zhang also confirmed

281
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,480
the time with me.

282
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,910
You opened the account

283
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,240
the year my dad died.

284
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,910
I have an account.

285
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,040
So what?

286
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,350
You admit it?

287
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,080
My dad caught you

288
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,270
moving company money,

289
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,870
so you set him up

290
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,830
to kill him.

291
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
What are you talking about?

292
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,390
That's nonsense.

293
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Your dad did it

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,720
to save all of us.

295
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,750
He's our hero.

296
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,840
Stop lying!

297
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,150
You're a liar!

298
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,800
Huang Zhongxin.

299
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,280
Watch your words.

300
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,200
Where are your manners?

301
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,040
Zhao.

302
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,830
Step outside.

303
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,710
Zhongxin.

304
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,030
I know you got worked up

305
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,990
about Nanping.

306
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,630
Just give her some time.

307
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,750
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

308
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,120
She'll change her mind.

309
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,280
I told you

310
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,400
it has

311
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,120
nothing to do with Nanping!

312
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,630
You admitted

313
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,790
you opened a private account,

314
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,550
so why not just admit

315
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,150
you caused my dad's death?

316
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,910
I caused his death?

317
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
Who's slandering me?

318
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,680
Slandering?

319
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,670
You're such a hypocrite!

320
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,560
Who taught you all that?

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,030
Listen carefully.

322
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,150
Even though
your dad's been gone for years,

323
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,390
I won't allow anyone

324
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,790
to tarnish

325
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,840
our brotherhood.

326
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
Brotherhood?

327
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,750
Yes.

328
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,440
It was your brother,

329
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Huang Jinhu,

330
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,270
my father,

331
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,600
who told me this.

332
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,350
Huang Zhongxin,

333
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,320
are you out of your mind?

334
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,550
You had a dream,

335
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,870
and now you're blaming Master Cheng.

336
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,030
It's not a dream!

337
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,510
It was your brother,

338
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,990
Huang Jinhu,

339
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,600
who told me himself.

340
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,960
No way.

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,960
Where's your dad now?

342
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,080
Take me to see him.

343
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,600
Don't do anything reckless.

344
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,960
I should've taken revenge

345
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,320
for my father.

346
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,510
But you

347
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,510
raised me.

348
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,510
Zhongxin!

349
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,400
Cheng Hui,

350
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,590
I've paid

351
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
my debt to you.

352
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,320
From now on,

353
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,750
we're even.

354
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,670
Let's never meet again.

355
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,780
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

356
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,590
Zhongxin,

357
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
are you okay?

358
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,350
What happened?

359
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,440
Let's go.

360
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,710
Nanping,

361
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,400
I saw your husband.

362
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
Don't call him that.

363
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,120
Don't you have work to do?

364
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,000
- He...
- Have you finished

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,910
the rescue report?

366
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,240
He looks injured.

367
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,800
Where is he?

368
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,600
Zhongxin.

369
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,360
They said you got hurt.

370
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,670
Let's go to the hospital.

371
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,480
Dad.

372
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,560
Let's get out of here.

373
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,840
I'll take you away.

374
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,950
Where?

375
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,470
Let's go

376
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,550
to Sishui.

377
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,150
The view's great over there.

378
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,350
Or maybe

379
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,310
we can go to Qingmai.

380
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,080
I've got friends over there.

381
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,280
Or maybe Malacca.

382
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,270
Dad,

383
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,510
last year, I bought

384
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,560
a small house over there.

385
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,360
It's a loft with a bedroom.

386
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,120
I was thinking when the lease ends,

387
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,280
we'll take it back

388
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,080
and start our own business.

389
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,470
I'm good at cooking.

390
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,310
Dad,

391
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
all these years,

392
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,950
I've saved some money.

393
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,310
I'll let you live

394
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,390
a carefree life.

395
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,600
Just come with me.

396
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,950
I can't walk.

397
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,960
I can't walk.

398
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
I can't walk.

399
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Well,

400
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,120
I'll carry you.

401
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,600
Out...

402
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,920
Car...

403
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,830
Car, car...

404
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,790
I get it.

405
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,630
You want to use a car.

406
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,230
Car...

407
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,270
Dad,

408
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,800
that's easy. Leave it to me.

409
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,790
I'll go get a car right now.

410
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,320
Wait for me, Dad.

411
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,000
Wait here, okay?

412
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Car crash...

413
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,030
Car crash...

414
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,960
No.

415
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,040
Car crash...

416
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,280
He just came out of the hospital.

417
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,710
Tell Master Cheng now.

418
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,670
- Go.
- Yes.

419
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,680
- Boss.
- Why are so many people here?

420
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,550
- Boss.
- Go back.

421
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,510
Boss.

422
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,080
Everyone, go back.

423
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,120
Go on, get going.

424
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,670
Who are you?

425
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,230
