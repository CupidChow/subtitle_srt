3
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,870
You old gangster,

4
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,240
this is too much.

5
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,550
I did

6
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,710
everything by myself.

7
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,430
Come on,

8
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,390
arrest me.

9
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,750
No one arrests people like this.

10
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,310
And no one acts like you either.

11
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,310
You agreed so quickly,

12
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,400
but what did you do?

13
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,550
Yes,

14
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,080
I just did what I had to.

15
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,120
I didn't inform

16
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,520
the anti-crime agent in advance.

17
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,270
Sorry, sir.

18
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,590
Why did you do that?

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
Does there always have to be a reason?

20
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,710
You did all this,

21
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,910
so what should I do?

22
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,030
There's so much you have to do.

23
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,150
Make more money,

24
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,990
build better homes,

25
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,170
run great restaurants,

26
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,640
build wider roads,

27
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,560
expand the pier,

28
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
and if possible,

29
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,640
build a new airport.

30
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,870
Anyway,

31
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,120
you need to let everyone
in Lion City live well,

32
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,990
even better than the westerners.

33
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,800
Do you know what price

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,990
you have to pay?

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm just an old man.

36
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,960
I have nothing to lose.

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
You...

38
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,150
Enough.

39
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,710
Don't be angry.

40
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
Sir,

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,950
just arrest me,

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,070
so that you can

43
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,070
report back to your leader.

44
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,760
Have you finished it?

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
Yes.

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Got more to do?

47
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,750
Nothing for now.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,510
What do you mean for now?

49
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,870
Keep your voice down.

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,190
It's just nothing for now.

51
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,240
If something comes up again,

52
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,870
perhaps I won't be able to deal with it.

53
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
You won't arrest me?

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll spare your life this time.

55
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,190
After all, I've been

56
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,310
calling you Dad all these years.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
You should be hanged.

58
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,560
No,

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,830
you should be shot.

60
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Listen,

61
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
don't think no one knows

62
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
what you've done.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Not just you,

64
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,920
Heihu,

65
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,790
Zhao,

66
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,080
and Sheyan,

67
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,600
all of you are involved.

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,680
It's my fault that I got them into this.

69
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,630
I hope you can clear their names.

70
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,380
Get ready to go to jail.

71
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,630
Put it over here.

72
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,790
Okay.

73
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Be careful.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,480
Easy, put it here.

75
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,280
Move that over here.

76
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,150
Here you go.

77
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,270
Okay, next one.

78
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,720
Uncle Heihu,

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,950
we've been informed

80
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,680
that if you hand over your weapons,

81
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,280
we won't record your names.

82
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,080
183.

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,630
682.

84
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,240
Master Cheng.

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,830
This... This is just a fruit knife.

86
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,750
No need to hand it in.

87
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,710
It's a weapon.

88
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,150
Thanks.

89
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,510
Many gangs
have handed over their weapons.

90
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,590
Everyone's saying

91
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,720
Cheng Hui has set a good example.

92
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,730
This news really helps Shanhai Gang.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,390
But there have been several murders.

94
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,430
We still need an explanation.

95
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
Even though there's no proof,

96
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,520
this old man

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
still has to serve time.

98
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,510
This is the best outcome.

99
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,270
Mom, do you know?

100
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,330
Many people

101
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,240
defended him

102
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
in front of the governor,

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,680
and they're all important people,

104
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,310
including Chinese people, westerners,

105
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,450
Manzhou people,

106
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,290
and even Fanbang people.

107
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,250
Why?

108
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,040
Maybe because not long ago,

109
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
they took down

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,850
several

111
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,870
notorious criminals,

112
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,390
and that's a good thing.

113
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,790
Son,

114
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,480
what do you think the verdict will be?

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,040
Well,

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
I thought

117
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
my uncles would spend

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,160
the rest of their lives in prison.

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,630
But now it seems

120
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,600
it won't be that long.

121
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,680
I think they'll

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,640
be released before they die.

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,120
Mom,

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,550
there's more good news.

125
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,360
Tell me about it.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,680
The governor will visit

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,870
the Shanhai Warehouse at the pier.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,240
He wants to see Cheng Hui

129
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,280
and give him a medal

130
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,720
for

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
answering the call,

132
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,270
turning the gang into a company,

133
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,510
and helping Lion City grow.

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,150
I think

135
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,750
you must've played

136
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,320
a big part in this,

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
right?

138
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
Everyone has played a part.

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
Thank you for

140
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,080
doing all this for Shanhai Gang.

141
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,200
After all, I'm also part of the gang.

142
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,510
I was born a Shanhai Man.

143
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,390
Do you know?

144
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,030
That was actually my idea.

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,360
Wait,

146
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,320
wasn't it Dad's decision?

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,910
They saved my life

148
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,360
and got back my family's assets.

149
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
I know

150
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,390
I can always trust

151
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,560
and rely on them.

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't worry, Mom.

153
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,870
I understand.

154
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,030
Though the gang is gone,

155
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,750
but its spirit still lives on.

156
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
I'll find a new way

157
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,720
to pass on the spirit of Shanhai.

158
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,990
However,

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,960
I never become the gang leader.

160
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
It's still a pity.

161
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,750
Your son wants to go to Shanhai Gang.

162
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,990
Really?

163
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,390
I'll take him there later.

164
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,910
Mom,

165
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,200
do you remember the swing

166
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,080
Nanping and I played on
when we were kids?

167
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,920
Kid,

168
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,280
hey kid,

169
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,510
- come here.
- Look,

170
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,200
your dad made something for you.

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
Come here.

172
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,600
Let's swing.

173
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,320
Sit tight, okay?

174
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,990
Sit tight.

175
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,200
Hold on tight.

176
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,470
Kid,

177
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,960
this is a swing.

178
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,120
In Chinese, it's called Qiuqian.

179
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,830
From now on,

180
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,320
you need to learn both

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
English and Chinese,

182
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,350
okay?

183
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,710
Where did you go?

184
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,360
Mom said we're eating here tonight.

185
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,390
Gui and I will cook.

186
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,870
Master Cheng will join us.

187
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,470
That's great.

188
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,150
He can't drink much.

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
One sip, and he's drunk.

190
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,030
Look,

191
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,510
toast to him a few more times tonight.

192
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,670
Let him make a fool of himself.

193
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,110
Okay.

194
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,670
Dear distinguished guests and friends,

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,080
(Welcome Governor Wilson)
Today, we're here

196
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,030
not only to present a special medal

197
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,560
but also to commemorate the owner,
an outstanding leader,

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,610
our esteemed founder
of Shanhai Gang and Corporation,

199
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,840
Mr. Cheng Hui.

200
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,150
In conclusion,

201
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
for the bright future

202
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,360
of Lion City,

203
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,360
let's all work harder

204
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,560
and be more united.

205
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,790
The governor
will give Cheng Hui a medal.

206
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,560
Watch for my signal.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,480
We'll shoot together.

208
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,510
You'll shoot the governor,

209
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
and I'll kill Cheng Hui.

210
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,670
Shanhai Gang will think

211
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
the police are

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,390
using this chance to kill their leader,

213
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,910
and the police

214
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
will think they're making trouble

215
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
and attacking the governor.

216
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,840
There will be a big fight.

217
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,720
Things will get out of control,

218
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,150
and we'll escape.

219
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,480
In the end,

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,750
Shanhai Gang will be gone

221
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,840
for good.

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
Sir,

223
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,560
do we really have to take the risk?

224
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,030
It's my mission

225
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
to kill Cheng Hui
and destroy Shanhai Gang.

226
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,360
I gave you

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,150
a second life over 20 years ago.

228
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,910
Do you want

229
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,270
to betray me now?

230
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
No.

231
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,920
I'm all in.

232
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,270
Let's all work

233
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,630
harder

234
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,360
and be more united.

235
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,270
Great!

236
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,240
- Okay!
- Yes!

237
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
What's wrong, Zhao?

238
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,360
The guy on your right

239
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
looks really familiar.

240
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,870
He's one of us.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,960
Of course he looks familiar.

242
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,160
No.

243
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,120
It seems he's the one

244
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
who killed Nanping's mom.

245
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
He's Long Shiqi.

246
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
What?

247
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,200
Keep it down.

248
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,160
Mr. Cheng Hui,

249
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,910
although you won this medal,

250
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,320
you're still going to jail.

251
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,750
Okay.

252
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,240
We're working on a way

253
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,120
to make your jail time

254
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,080
a little easier.

255
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,900
(Welcome Governor Wilson)
Great!

256
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,240
Run!

257
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,200
Run!

258
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,720
Watch out!

259
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Run! Run!

260
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,510
Mom,

261
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,560
Dad hasn't named me yet.

262
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,750
I'll make the call.

263
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,030
You're Liu Shanhai.

264
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,510
You finally have a name.

265
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,990
You're Liu Shanhai.

266
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,230
Do you like it?

267
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,200
- Zhendong!
- Zhendong!

268
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,160
Zhendong!

269
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,470
Zhendong!

270
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,390
- Zhendong!
- Zhendong, wake up!

271
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,090
- Zhendong!
- Zhendong!

272
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,440
Zheng Qiu...

273
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,790
You, get him! That way!

274
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,720
Long Shiqi.

275
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,360
I've finally caught you!

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,960
Don't move!

277
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,840
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

278
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,800
Don't move!

279
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,320
Don't move!

280
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,030
Boss!

281
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,090
Go away!

282
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,350
Boss.

283
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,080
He's dead.

284
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,710
Zhendong...

285
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,560
Boss!

286
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,630
I believe people are good in nature.

287
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,390
Many gang members

288
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,960
had no choices

289
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,750
but to resort to violence.

290
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,750
To give them

291
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,080
a chance to start over,

292
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,240
we'll launch the Rebirth Island Project.

293
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,200
And I'm

294
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,240
the chief coordinator of this project.

295
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,790
Because of the location

296
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,120
of Rebirth Island,

297
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
no one can escape.

298
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,560
So on the island,

299
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,360
the prisoners won't be locked in cells.

300
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,910
We'll let them

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,630
build a new life

302
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,840
- on their own
- Rebirth Island?

303
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,720
and learn a useful skill

304
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,630
to get ready for returning

305
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,270
to normal life.

306
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,870
In a few days,

307
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,560
the first group of prisoners,

308
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,870
mainly gang leaders,
will go to Rebirth Island.

309
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,820
(He Yaohui)

310
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,470
Uncle Heihu,

311
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,350
take care.

312
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,500
(Zhao Tiehan)

313
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,160
Uncle Tiehan,

314
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,350
your stomach isn't well.

315
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
Be careful on the island.

316
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
Once I get there, it'll get better.

317
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,670
Remember to visit us.

318
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,700
(She Xingwang)

319
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,710
Uncle Sheyan,

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,960
take care.

321
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,620
(Huang Zhongxin)

322
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,670
Your name's not on the list.

323
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,560
I admitted to a few things myself.

324
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
Why?

325
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,230
Dad's getting older

326
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,840
and needs someone to take care of

327
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,520
and protect him.

328
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,470
I can't leave him alone.

329
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,310
Nanping,

330
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,600
I'm sorry for everything.

331
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,750
I think

332
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,400
if I stay in Lion City,

333
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,360
you won't be happy

334
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,090
to see me around.

335
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,080
I'll wait for you.

336
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,470
Cheng Hui.

337
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,950
Ping?

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,710
I'm here to assist the police.

339
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,710
No, she's here to see you off.

340
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,790
Ping,

341
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,710
I remember you said

342
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,360
you really missed the yard.

343
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,600
You can give it

344
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,680
a new look.

345
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,620
(Cheng Hui)

346
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,820
(Cheng Hui)

347
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,120
(Their era)

348
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,910
(has come to an end.)

349
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,760
(The ups and downs)

350
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,910
(will become memories
for their generation.)

351
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,270
(Shanhai Primary School)
(How will the old legacy carry on)

352
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,760
(Shanhai Kindergarten)
(in the light of a new era?)

353
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,040
(Nanping found the answer.)

354
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,230
(With her dedication,)

355
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
(Shanhai Is Our Home)
(the schools)

356
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,080
(were built on the headquarters
of Shanhai Gang.)

357
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,080
(They teach Chinese)

358
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,680
(and pass down the cultural traditions)

359
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,320
(to the next Shanhai generation.)

360
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,000
(Shanhai Gang)

361
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,600
(is just a legendary tale,)

362
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,030
(yet its spirit)

363
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,040
(will never fade.)

364
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,430
(They work hard,)

365
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,950
(help each other,)

366
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,430
(fight for themselves,)

367
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,150
(and stand up to oppression.)

368
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,950
(This is the spiritual foundation)

369
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
(that enables the Chinese people)

370
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,150
(to stand tall across the world.)

371
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,840
Okay, one, two, three.

372
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,920
Good.

373
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Shanhai,

374
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,200
who are you drawing?

375
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,630
Dad.

376
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
Your dad.

377
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,040
Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li.

378
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,350
