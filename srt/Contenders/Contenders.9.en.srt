3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,980
Liuliu,

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,340
what do you think?

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,880
It's too soon

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,220
to make him the leader.

7
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,510
Yes.

8
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,890
After all, he just left the police.

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,250
So what?

10
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,940
I wanted to make him my deputy,

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,500
yet you said it was ominous.

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,300
It's indeed too soon.

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,780
Rong.

14
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,500
Each of you

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,300
has a deputy

16
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,070
and three valiant warriors.

17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,010
Yes.

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,700
I still

19
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,170
need a valiant warrior.

20
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,250
If Zhendong wants to work for me...

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,020
It's up to you, Boss.

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,180
Here, sir.

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,900
Serve the food now?

24
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,340
Can't you see the situation?

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,590
- Get out!
- Sorry!

26
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,690
Perfect timing.

27
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,870
I'm starving.

28
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,030
Let's eat and chat.

29
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,970
Let me do it.

30
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,570
Come on.

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,340
Sorry, sorry!

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,850
What are you doing?

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,340
Sorry!

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,780
You scared him.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,970
Sit down.

36
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,690
Boss, what's it got to do with me?

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,890
Your brother-in-law

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,560
likes drinking, right?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,870
Yes.

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,810
He got drunk

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,500
and went to collect fees.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,520
Well, Lin is about

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,620
to get married.

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,630
He didn't pay,

45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,010
so they smashed his shop.

46
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,290
They even asked him
to leave this street.

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,970
Really?

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,020
Heihu,

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
how old were you

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,500
when you came here?

51
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,900
15 or 16?

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,430
16,

53
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,280
nominal age.

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,340
You were tall, strong,

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,500
and pretty brave.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,130
That year,

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
we fought Xuanhu Sect on Mayou Street

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,220
when they had more people than us,

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,570
and we lost because

60
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,690
they ambushed us.

61
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,410
All of us got injured.

62
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,710
We even hid in

63
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,180
Mr. He's ice cave.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,220
Yes.

65
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,570
It was so cold.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,900
Not just cold,

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,220
we were hungry too.

68
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,430
Do you remember

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,460
someone brought us food?

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,500
Of course.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,300
A little cart

72
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,780
with a huge pot of chicken rice.

73
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,010
I finished three big bowls at once.

74
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,250
It was so tasty!

75
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,340
I still remember it now.

76
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,500
Eat.

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,300
Eat it now.

78
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,620
It still tastes the same.

79
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,380
The ones who brought the food

80
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,570
were his grandpa and his dad.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,940
Heihu.

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Every street in Lion City

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,970
belongs to the government.

84
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,040
Since when

85
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,510
did your brother-in-law own them?

86
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,450
Boss,

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,060
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,510
Tomorrow, I'll teach him

89
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,450
a great lesson

90
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,780
and let everyone know

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,290
his wrongdoings

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,340
have nothing to do with us.

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,020
He isn't young anymore.

94
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
Since your wife died,

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,170
he's been by your side, right?

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,170
He didn't join us,

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,220
but I can't get rid of him.

98
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,240
How can he wander around

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,180
all day?

100
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,070
The fish market in Penang

101
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,270
is doing well.

102
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,390
Tomorrow, ask Liuliu to

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,330
write a letter to him.

104
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,770
Take him there

105
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,020
to learn to run a business.

106
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,380
Teach him how to be a good man.

107
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,920
Only then can your wife

108
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,670
rest in peace.

109
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,130
Lin,

110
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,330
wait a minute.

111
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,530
I apologize to you

112
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,850
for my brother-in-law.

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,980
No...

114
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,370
I wouldn't dare.

115
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,420
I wouldn't dare.

116
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,800
If anyone comes here

117
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,740
to cause trouble again,

118
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,370
just mention my name.

119
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,500
Okay.

120
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,660
(Hainanese Chicken Rice)

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,950
Sir, this way.

122
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,900
Take care.

123
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Be careful. Goodbye.

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,620
Goodbye, sir.

125
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,900
Goodbye, sir.

126
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,700
Goodbye, sir.

127
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,390
Thanks, sir.

128
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,490
Have a good day.

129
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,160
Goodbye, sir.

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,100
Lin.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,980
Cheng, I can't accept this.

132
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,920
I treat my brothers.

133
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,240
If you don't take it,

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,410
I'll be embarrassed.

135
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,510
But, this...

136
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,460
If you don't accept it,

137
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,660
I won't host your son's wedding.

138
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Everyone, listen,

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
his son will have a wedding.

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,170
You all should come.

141
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

142
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,220
Thanks, Cheng.

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,430
- Heihu.
- Boss.

144
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,900
I gave you a hard time

145
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,160
in front of everyone.

146
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,610
Will you blame me?

147
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,690
What are you talking about?

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,740
I'm totally fine.

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,740
Alright, let's go back.

150
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,850
Why didn't you take action?

151
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,700
I was planning to,

152
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,140
but then I realized

153
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,530
Officer Zheng and he

154
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,170
are close friends.

155
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,900
So, you've been following him

156
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,530
to wait for the right time?

157
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,580
In our line, timing is the key.

158
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,730
If I acted rashly and killed him,

159
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,050
I might've ended up dead.

160
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,970
So, I must be careful.

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,100
That old fox is so sly.

162
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,660
If we're lucky,

163
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,780
tomorrow will be our chance.

164
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,370
What are you doing?

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,660
Trying to make the most of it.

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,980
Young Master.

167
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,060
Wait.

168
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,660
My mom's asleep.

169
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,810
Don't wake her up.

170
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,020
Young Master,

171
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,600
are you really going to

172
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,660
kneel here all night?

173
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,890
I'm fine.

174
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,930
Go pack her things.

175
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,970
Take her to Paris tomorrow.

176
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,620
I'm a humble servant.

177
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,050
I don't deserve a ticket.

178
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,370
All these years,

179
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,560
you've been taking care

180
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,500
of her.

181
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,250
We've already seen you as family.

182
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,850
Why would you say that?

183
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,620
If you don't get moving,

184
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,050
you won't make it in time.

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,300
By the way,

186
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,570
as for Xiang,

187
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,770
I'll talk to him.

188
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,370
Hurry up.

189
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,370
Okay, it's done.

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,620
Let me try.

191
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,650
You're a good mentor.

192
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,650
Well done.

193
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,010
Let's put in some extra hours tonight

194
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,210
and finish this up.

195
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,650
I'll ride it tomorrow.

196
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,610
Mom,

197
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,570
good morning.

198
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,140
My Lady,

199
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,700
Young Master knelt all night.

200
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,250
He didn't want you to know.

201
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,750
You'd rather die

202
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
than come with me, right?

203
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,220
You'll go to Europe,

204
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,180
and I'll stay here.

205
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,610
What's so special about Lion City?

206
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,340
My uncle, my dad,

207
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,810
and their peers

208
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,820
fought hard

209
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,970
for Shanhai Gang.

210
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,250
Someone's got to take over.

211
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,010
When I was a kid,
they called me Young Master.

212
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,730
I was pretty proud of that.

213
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,820
Mom, you told me

214
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,180
if a man

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,700
wants to earn respect,

216
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,370
he has to make something big

217
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,010
and make a name for himself.

218
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,490
Mom, you're right.

219
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,180
I'll prove it to you.

220
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,220
With Shanhai Gang?

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,540
Why not?

222
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,060
Son,

223
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
do you know why people

224
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,820
call them a criminal group?

225
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,180
Because they all

226
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,850
fear Shanhai Gang.

227
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,890
Not just that.

228
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,580
If you make a mistake there,

229
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,250
you'll be punished

230
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,100
according to the rules.

231
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,610
No one can save you then.

232
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,010
I learned the rules

233
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,970
as a kid.

234
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,610
Some rules don't make sense.

235
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,210
Someday,

236
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,690
I'll change them.

237
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,820
I only have one question!

238
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,320
Did you forget what you did

239
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,460
to Liu Xiongwu?

240
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,180
Mom,

241
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,600
I did do some things

242
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,540
I shouldn't have done,

243
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,250
but if you stay silent,

244
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,060
who else will ever know?

245
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,850
I'm his son.

246
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,420
Who'd ever suspect me?

247
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,540
Mom,

248
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,060
it's hard to get tickets these days.

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,630
Let Gui

250
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,570
go with you.

251
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,300
Just give me some time.

252
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,550
Two years.

253
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,490
Only two years.

254
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,060
When you return,

255
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,610
I'll be Shanhai Gang's leader.

256
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,180
What's the point?

257
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,730
What's the point?

258
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,140
Mom,

259
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,850
your family was once

260
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,370
the most powerful in Lion City.

261
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,090
It was the westerners

262
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,370
that tricked you and took everything.

263
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,130
They killed my grandpa and my uncle!

264
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,610
Even you

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,270
almost got kidnapped

266
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,210
and sold to San Francisco.

267
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,850
If it weren't for the gang,

268
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,340
how could you have reclaimed
your family assets?

269
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,180
I've always wanted to be a hero

270
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,460
because I hope that one day,

271
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,250
I can protect you.

272
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,770
Chinese people

273
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,180
shouldn't be bullied by others.

274
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,210
Dad.

275
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,940
Good.

276
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,440
(Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet)
This shirt is ironed so well.

277
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,140
Not a big deal.

278
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,970
You're not only a good fighter

279
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,130
but a good cook

280
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,370
and tailor.

281
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,130
Looks good.

282
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,490
Dad,

283
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,940
are you really heading out like this?

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,940
What's wrong?

285
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,180
Be careful.

286
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,340
Look, I've never seen this.

287
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,490
Interesting.

288
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,840
Let me try it first.

289
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,780
Alright.

290
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,860
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

291
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,420
Ping?

292
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,020
Did you ask her to come?

293
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,260
No.

294
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,530
- Ping.
- Give it to me.

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,140
Ping.

296
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,650
You left without a word.

297
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,030
I need to write an article

298
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,970
about Shanhai Gang

299
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,700
and interview you.

300
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,300
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

301
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,730
Look how scared you are.

302
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,250
Then you shouldn't leave.

303
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,850
You haven't interviewed me.

304
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,140
No need.

305
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,650
This photo is enough.

306
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,460
Riding a pedicab

307
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,970
on the street,

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,650
the new version of the gang leader.

309
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,090
Do you like this title?

310
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,140
No, I don't.

311
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,150
Look,

312
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,090
you're angry again.

313
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,820
Fine, just write it as you want.

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,940
Anyway, I'm

315
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,130
doing business.

316
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Doing business?

317
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,380
Yes.

318
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
Okay,

319
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,030
then I'll be

320
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,970
your passenger.

321
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,630
Ping,

322
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,570
get off.

323
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,730
Don't let others see this.

324
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,700
Don't say
you're worried about my safety.

325
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,630
The Lion City police can protect me.

326
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,580
I'm quite safe.

327
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,670
Come on, Nanping.

328
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,550
Come over.

329
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,550
I'll give you a ride.

330
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,340
I prefer this

331
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,080
weirdly modified rickshaw.

332
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,260
Well,

333
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
does Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,940
pick passengers?

335
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,390
I'm already sitting here.

336
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,240
Are you kicking me out?

337
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,650
I'll write about it in the news.

338
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,140
Nanping.

339
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,770
Sit tight then.

340
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,060
I'll take you for a ride.

341
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,140
When I

342
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,180
first came here,

343
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,100
my first job was rickshaw pulling.

344
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,850
The rickshaw belonged to someone else.

345
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,460
I worked for him.

346
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,900
By the end of the day,

347
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,340
I could make ends meet.

348
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,750
Later on,

349
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,250
I wanted to own a rickshaw,

350
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,650
so I joined a rickshaw race.

351
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,480
Each rickshaw puller got a number,

352
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,080
and rich people and westerners

353
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,100
would bet on us.

354
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,370
Isn't that like horse racing?

355
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,660
Yes, pretty much the same.

356
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,130
To reach the destination,

357
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,210
I was allowed

358
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,120
to take shortcuts.

359
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,540
I learned every shortcut quickly.

360
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,060
However, on that day,

361
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,010
someone scattered broken glass

362
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,010
all over the road I chose.

363
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,260
Later, I found out

364
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,700
they all bet on

365
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,220
Gao Jiaohan

366
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,490
from Fanbang,

367
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,170
so they tried to

368
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,940
trip me up.

369
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,490
Back then, rickshaw pullers

370
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,850
were all barefoot, right?

371
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,970
I was barefoot too.

372
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,420
However, I still won the race

373
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,490
and earned a new rickshaw.

374
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,130
Wait, were your feet

375
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,730
all cut up?

376
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
That's how I met your mom.

377
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,080
Back then, your mom

378
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,070
was a student

379
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,460
who worked part-time
as a nurse at a small clinic.

380
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,120
Were you good-looking

381
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,060
when you were young?

382
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,720
Did she fall in love at first sight?

383
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,220
She didn't fall in love.

384
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,300
She just felt bad for me.

385
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
She was worried that the injuries

386
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,180
might cost me my life.

387
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,770
Before that,

388
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,420
she met a female worker

389
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,370
who died because

390
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,220
she stepped on a nail

391
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,630
but didn't get it treated

392
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,610
in time.

393
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,220
But why didn't you

394
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,240
tell me any of this

395
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,220
when I was a kid?

396
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,180
By the time you grew up,

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,240
Shanhai Gang already had

398
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
its own fleet.

399
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,120
Whenever

400
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,960
we got hurt or injured,

401
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
we could get treatment.

402
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,120
Why would I tell you that?

403
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,030
So that you'd worry about me

404
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,970
and pity me?

405
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,720
Since I was a kid,

406
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,700
you've been the leader,

407
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,780
always looking so powerful.

408
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,220
No one would ever pity you.

409
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
You might not know this.

410
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,570
The day you were born,

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,240
me, your second uncle,

412
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,490
and over 20 brothers

413
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,250
were trapped by pirates in a warehouse.

414
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,050
We didn't have proper weapons,

415
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,720
but they had guns.

416
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,610
How did you offend the pirates?

417
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,160
We provoked the drug dealers.

418
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,720
Back then,

419
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,650
someone was smuggling bad opium,

420
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,930
targeting poor workers
from our hometown.

421
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,500
After we heard about it,

422
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,170
we surrounded that warehouse,

423
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,590
but they

424
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,690
hired pirates to help.

425
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,740
Huang Jinhu, Fengyun Hall Leader

426
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,580
and Zhongxin's dad,

427
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,020
pushed a cart full of explosives

428
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,060
and took them all down.

429
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,340
That's how we survived.

430
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,290
So, Zhongxin

431
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,100
has called you Dad like I do.

432
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,980
So back then,

433
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,340
you were always doing good.

434
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,290
Why did you become a criminal gang?

435
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,260
We're never criminals.

436
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,350
The "gang" means

437
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,890
helping each other

438
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,100
and supporting one another.

439
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,680
We couldn't afford protection fees,

440
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,060
so we got picked on a lot.

441
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,170
All we could do was stick together

442
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,290
to protect ourselves.

443
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,820
But later, you began to

444
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,650
fight against
the government and the police.

445
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,740
That's not true.

446
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,200
We never went against

447
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,510
the government or the police.

448
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,500
But some people played

449
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,650
nasty tricks.

450
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,860
Forget it, I won't argue with you.

451
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,020
You always have a reason.

452
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,500
But this ride

453
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,930
has been quite smooth.

454
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,820
Not just that, I can ride fast.

455
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,590
I know every street

456
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,850
in Lion City.

457
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,690
Ping,

458
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,480
are more people doing business
in Lion City lately?

459
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,350
Yes.

460
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,210
Up by 50 percent this year.

461
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,130
The pier must be bustling.

462
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,130
I will take you there to see.

463
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,320
Okay.

464
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:43,340
(Customs House)

465
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,900
(Franklin Pier)

466
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,490
Mom,

467
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,690
don't worry about me.

468
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
When you get back,

469
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,210
I'll be just fine.

470
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,290
Gui,

471
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,730
I'm counting on you.

472
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,580
Don't worry, Young Master.

473
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,340
(Entrance)

474
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,100
Mom,

475
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,690
with you gone,

476
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,930
I'll be safer.

477
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,820
Go on.

478
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,960
Look,

479
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,900
isn't that Master Cheng?

480
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,060
No way, that's nonsense.

481
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,440
Hey, guys!

482
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,550
Zhongxin is right behind.

483
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,490
That's Master Cheng.

484
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,100
It really is Master Cheng.

485
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,960
Master Cheng.

486
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,900
This...

487
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,730
Can you see this?

488
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,610
Zhongxin is young and strong,

489
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
but he still can't catch up with me.

490
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,310
You know why?

491
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,850
I'm riding a tricycle,

492
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,400
while he only has two legs.

493
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,340
How could he ever catch up?

494
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,720
Master Cheng,

495
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,020
honestly, this isn't new to us.

496
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,610
However, we're the best

497
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,610
rickshaw pullers in Lion City.

498
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,030
Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet's

499
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,970
reputation can't fall.

500
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,340
Who told you

501
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,370
Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet will fall
once we use pedicabs?

502
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,820
This pedicab

503
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,410
was modified from a rickshaw.

504
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,370
I bought an old rickshaw

505
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,020
and a scrapped

506
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,340
bicycle,

507
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,100
and I made it at home.
