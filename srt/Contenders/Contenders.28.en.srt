3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
Alright.

4
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,360
Just some terrible food.

5
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,530
Just help yourself.

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,810
Mr. Liu.

7
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,510
Okay.

8
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,460
Today's dishes

9
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,500
look decent.

10
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,100
Maybe you were trying to piss me off,

11
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,940
but you really

12
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,260
got me this time.

13
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,940
But because of that,

14
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,260
I've realized even more clearly

15
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,460
that I have feelings for you.

16
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,230
If that girl is a rival,

17
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,740
fine,

18
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,860
I'll compete fairly.

19
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,140
You've become a nerd.

20
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,580
And Dad

21
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,740
has protected you so well.

22
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,140
Nanping.

23
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,140
What's so great

24
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,420
about gangsters,

25
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,270
especially someone like me?

26
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,820
I studied in Europe when I was a kid,

27
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,380
and my favorite city

28
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
was Paris.

29
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,380
You know why

30
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,940
Paris is called the city of romance?

31
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,220
You know nothing!

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,190
When I was there,

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,630
I dated so many girls

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,260
that a whole ship

35
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,200
couldn't fit them.

36
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,940
I don't care.

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,780
You can say harsh words

38
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,620
as you want.

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,980
I've been ready for this.

40
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,220
Nanping, you're so naive.

41
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm worried about you.

42
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,060
But you're not naive.

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,780
You've seen so much.

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,260
You're a gangster,

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,700
and you used to be a cop.

46
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
If we get together,

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,540
you'll offset my childishness.

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,380
We...

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,950
We can't be together!

50
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,010
Why?

51
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,460
Am I really that bad?

52
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,780
No!

53
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,740
It's because of

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
our identities.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,580
What's wrong?

56
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,540
Aren't we actually

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,580
pretty well matched?

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,860
Our dads were both

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,060
the leaders of Shanhai Gang.

60
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,020
And our moms were friends

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,170
and locals.

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,620
I still remember my mom

63
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,540
told her friends

64
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,740
that when I grew up,

65
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,510
she'd let you marry me.

66
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,780
That was because your mom

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,060
didn't know who I was.

68
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,700
You grew up in the yard.

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,260
Everyone knows who you are!

70
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm...

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,620
I heard you arguing.

72
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,380
Is this a bad time?

73
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,330
- Yes.
- Right on time.

74
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
What's your name?

75
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,020
My surname is Liu.

76
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,020
What should I call you?

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,380
You need to ask him.

78
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
Call her Mrs. Liu.

79
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,300
You found a Mrs. Liu

80
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,500
just to reject me?

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,140
It's not like that.

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
It's been a while.

83
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,700
Do you take me for a fool?

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,260
How long have you been here?

85
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,220
Not so long.

86
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,980
But I'm already his woman.

87
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,380
Okay.

88
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,980
Mr. Liu, Mrs. Liu,

89
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,580
wish you both happiness.

90
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,700
You're impressive.

91
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,940
I thought you'd want me

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,060
to say that.

93
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,460
Looks like I was right.

94
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,060
It's not like that.

95
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,580
Whatever.

96
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,820
She's a good girl.

97
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,780
Why turn her down?

98
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
None of your business.

99
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,100
Don't ask.

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,700
I'll be a good servant,

101
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,700
as long as I have food to eat.

102
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,580
If you don't want me at your place,

103
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,340
I can live elsewhere.

104
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
She's really a good girl.

105
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,660
You're overthinking this.

106
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,540
You're not the reason

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,060
I turned her down.

108
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm just using you.

109
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,500
Are you an idiot?

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,380
I've told you I'm just using you.

111
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,540
Why are you so happy?

112
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,860
Well, I'm useful to you.

113
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,800
It's still a good thing, right?

114
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,580
Come on.

115
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,020
Have a taste.

116
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,940
I made some hometown dishes.

117
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,100
Come on.

118
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,500
I'm so lucky.

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,340
She just left,

120
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
and you're here.

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,180
Mr. Liu, you haven't

122
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,100
given me a name.

123
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,380
Whatever.

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,060
Thanks.

125
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,820
Who is it?

126
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Come out!

127
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,420
Nanping.

128
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,900
Sorry.

129
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,460
I was too careless.

130
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,500
I'll protect you from now on.

131
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,060
I'll stay with you every day.

132
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,570
Zhongxin...

133
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,100
Zhongxin...

134
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,020
Are you still hungry?

135
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,340
Let's get another char kway teow.

136
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,700
Okay.

137
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,590
Sir, char kway teow.

138
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,900
Sorry.

139
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,020
The chef's wife had a baby.

140
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,860
He's off today.

141
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,020
I can make noodles

142
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
but not char kway teow.

143
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,110
I'll cook.

144
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,010
You'll cook?

145
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,890
Okay.

146
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,340
Go ahead.

147
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,780
Sir,

148
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,500
- any green onions?
- Right here.

149
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,860
Here you go.

150
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,370
Try it.

151
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,100
How is it?

152
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,860
This is the best
char kway teow I've had.

153
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,860
Have more.

154
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,420
Thanks, Zhongxin.

155
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,780
Actually, I should thank you.

156
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,460
Why?

157
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,860
I was dismissed.

158
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,900
My brothers asked me to have a drink,

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,380
but I don't want to

160
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,540
because I know

161
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,740
it can't solve anything

162
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,900
but

163
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,580
make things worse.

164
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Besides,

165
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,020
if I get drunk,

166
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,940
who's going to protect you?

167
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,680
Did he

168
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,260
dismiss you?

169
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,460
I made a mistake.

170
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,700
I should be

171
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
punished.

172
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,060
Why don't you

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,220
leave Shanhai Gang

174
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,260
and open a kway teow restaurant?

175
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,020
I'll eat it every day.

176
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,380
I won't leave Shanhai Gang,

177
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,180
even if I have to be

178
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
a lackey all my life.

179
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,420
Why are you

180
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,660
so stubborn?

181
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,060
It's not like that.

182
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,380
They raised me.

183
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,460
It's a debt I can't repay.

184
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,140
Anyway, I don't want to argue today.

185
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,220
Plus, your char kway teow is so good.

186
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,020
You should try it too.

187
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,780
It smells so good.

188
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,940
No one else on this street

189
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,780
can be this good.

190
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,500
Have a bite.

191
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,460
I'll help myself.

192
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,300
You don't like me?

193
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,860
It's not like that.

194
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,780
How is it?

195
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,540
It's good.

196
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,380
I'll share it with you.

197
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,980
Alright, you should eat more.

198
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,820
Just a tiny bit.

199
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,060

204

that Nanping is your daughter.

for your paper.

Today, I just want to

211
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,860
ask you to publish

212
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,260
this statement.

(Xiao Shaofeng, Founder of Nanyang News)

214
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,260
I guess

215
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,940
you're a good father.

But I can't

219
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,980
publish this.

but you still haven't

226
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,340
got enough money for

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,420

238

not have it.

239
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,660
I can even

240
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,580
give up the newspaper.

241
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,500
Mr. Cheng, please think it through.

242

This is

243
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,820
too much

244

why I'm doing this.

249

Once I finish,
whether to publish this statement

250
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,340
or not is totally up to you.

Thanks for walking with me.

Actually,

257

you don't have to protect me every day.

- No, it's not.

don't know I'm his daughter.

271

And I don't want

272
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,900
others to find out.

273
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,020
I'll keep the secret, okay?

274
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,700

I just can't

278
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,980
bring a bodyguard everywhere I go.

282
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,380

If I catch you,

289
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,660
I won't talk to you.

who has the same name.

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,660
But

388
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,900
you don't have to do this.

389
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,020
You didn't make the statement,

390
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,860
right?

391
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,260
I'll figure out

392
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,540
who's really behind this!

393
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,340
In Lion City,

394
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,580
who dares to impersonate me?

395
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,340
What?

396
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
You really published it?

397
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,980
You love her so much.

398
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,300
Are you really going to
cut ties with her?

399
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,460
I'm not only her father

400
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,580
but a member of Shanhai Gang.

401
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,700
She brought

402
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,140
too much trouble to us.

403
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
From now on,
she's no longer my daughter.

404
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,420
No, Dad.

405
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,500
Pleading for her?

406
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,100
I can cut ties with my own daughter,

407
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,940
so I can do

408
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,580
the same thing to my godson.

409
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,780
Get out.

410
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,300
Boss.

411
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,100
Isn't that a bit harsh?

412
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,700
Extra copies!

413
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,900

420

cuts ties with Cheng Nanping!

421
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,060
I can't believe it.

422
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,180
Oh, it's impossible.

423
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,140
Nanping,

424
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,340
are you alright?

425
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,860
As a reporter,

426
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,420
you have to be a tough fighter

427
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,300
who can face any storms.

428
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,340
Whether it's society or your family,

429
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,860
don't let it break you down.
