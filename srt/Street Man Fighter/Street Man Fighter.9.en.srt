00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,035
Thank you.

327
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:58,234
And now, here is the score Bank 2 Brothers received...

328
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:00,564
from the special panel of judges.

329
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:01,905
- What? - What?

330
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,135
There's the score.

331
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,005
Will it be disclosed? Really?

332
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:08,204
Right away?

333
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:11,015
(What's the score for Bank 2 Brothers with PROWDMON?)

334

What is the score for Muse of Bank 2 Brothers?

335
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,684
(Curious)

(The score from the special panel of judges)

337
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,854
The score is 91.36 points.

338
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:26,365
(Bank 2 Brothers get 91.36 points from the special panel of judges)

339
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,224
That's a lot.

340
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:31,094
The special panel of judges gave...

341
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:34,804
an average of 91.36 points to Bank 2 Brothers.

342
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,074
They got 91 points.

343
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:39,775
Hey, 91 points?

344
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:43,175
I'm not sure if that is a high score or a low one.

345
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,214
- No, it's a high score. - I think so too.

346
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:47,745
At karaoke rooms, you get that when you're a pretty good singer.

347
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:49,915
The machine goes, "You're a pretty good singer."

348
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,415
Since we're too close,

349
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,125
we never got to say this as we practiced.

350
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,584
That we're grateful they joined us,

351
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,925
and it's an honour to do this with PROWDMON.

352
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,395
I was too embarrassed to bring that up.

353
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:02,295
But at this point in time, I'd like to thank PROWDMON...

354
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,464
for joining us today, and that we love them.

355
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:07,464
Thank you.

356
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:09,974
Bank 2 Brothers and their muse, PROWDMON.

357
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,035
You've done well.

358
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,974
You may leave the stage now. Great job.

359
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:15,145
- Thank you. - That was great.

360
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,545
Great job!

361
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:20,415
(They all leave the stage as flames.)

362
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:24,084
It was a lot of fun.

363
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,125
- This one? - It's 91.36 points.

364
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,454
- It's okay. - Is that high or low?

365
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,824
- I have no idea. - You did well.

366
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,554
- I wanted to get at least 90. - Me too.

367
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,054
- It was higher. - What a relief.

368
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,165
I'm so glad.

369
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,694
What's important is that you're all glad.

370
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,964
We all got to enjoy the performance,

371
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:38,964
so I was grateful for everything.

372
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:40,104
I was happy.

373
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,734
So I do not regret anything after that performance.

374
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,745
Let's continue the semifinal of SMF, Muse of SMF.

375
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:49,615
This crew formed together only because of their ambition...

376
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:51,074
in dancing.

377
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,885
- It's us. - Let's go.

378
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:54,944

Then let's see what Mbitious has prepared.

382
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,155
Mbitious, ready? Fight.

To be honest, I still have a tough time looking at Gabee.

00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:17,704
- Yes, right. - Oh my.

388
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,204
- The first encounter is important, - I can't look at her.

389
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,815
but we met as a judge and a participant.

390
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:24,145
- Come on. - I still remember...

391

The mission is titled Muse of SMF.

401
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,805
So I want lots of suggestions from Mbitious,

402
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:48,405
and I want to know your ideas.

403

How do you want to make use of us as mercenaries?

404
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,635
Please tell us.

405
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,274
Tarzan is...

406
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,274
Just as Simeez is the golden youngest member,

407
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:58,744
we have the gold guy here.

408

- Gold. - He's just gold?

409
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:01,145
He's just gold.

410
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,454
He has a unique street name, right?

411
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:05,454
- Yes. - Yes.

412
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,585
So I wanted to make use of that.

413
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,055
I thought of "Tarzan" the film.

414
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,355
- I see. - I looked it up.

415
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,794
- I like it. - Is it...

416
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,665
- like the jungle? - I love it.

417
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,234
I like it.

418
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:18,095
I recently saw a video of you with snakes...

419
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:19,734
- around your neck. - You're right.

420
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,635
- That's right. - Were they real?

421
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:22,835
- They were. - I see.

422
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,234
I can cast them again.

423
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:25,905
You can cast snakes?

424
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,244
Tarzan, you should put some around your neck too.

425
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:30,615
I'm even scared of a fly.

426
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:31,645
(He looks like he'd beat up ghosts, but he's too soft.)

427

- This is why he's gold. - What?

428
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:37,315
I watched your mixed-gender mission when you competed in "SWF."

429
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:38,984
- Okay. - And your performance...

430
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,325
was message-oriented.

431
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:46,055
So instead of us taking the role of Tarzan,

432
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,694
- we want you to take the role. - Us?

(LACHICA as Tarzan)

434
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:52,165
- We'll take the role of Jane. - Gosh.

435
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,504
- So the roles will be reversed. - With that,

436
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:56,004
we can break down the concept of gender.

437
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,305
That's a great idea. This is so original.

438
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,544
- I think we can mix well with this. - Thank you.

439
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,575
- Good job. - I can't stop feeling like...

440
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,014
we're receiving feedback from the judges.

441
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:07,885
- Will you give us Respect Stickers? - I'll give you Respect Stickers.

442
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,784
I totally respect your idea.

443
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,315
- Totally. - At last! We did it.

444
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,085
- Goodness. - It hits the spot.

- Hello. - Hi.

451

They looked really fancy.

- We're fancy. - We were pretty amazing.

453
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,305
- We're amazing. - They were shocked earlier...

454
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:31,734
- Right. - after seeing us.

455
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,875
We live in the jungle.

- Same here. - Me too.

They said they would follow my lead.

But that...

466
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:00,534
made me a little upset.

467
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:04,605
(Tarzan seems dejected.)

468
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,744
- That's cool. - I was really worried.

469
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,944
This performance worried me the most.

470
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:11,815
I don't know. It might have been because I was under pressure.

471
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:15,284
I had never been in the center during our previous missions.

472
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:18,585
They noticed that and put me in the middle.

473
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:22,055
When I was directing them and teaching them the choreography,

474
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:24,095
I kept walking on eggshells around them.

475
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,395
- You have to stand here. Yes. - Here?

476
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,724
We'll make a V.

477

Let's stand in a V shape.

478
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,595
You should go and talk to them.

479
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,004
- You... - We should do this first.

480
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,034
- Can you make the form wider? - Sure.

481
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,704
I was in front of an amazing crew.

482
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,605
And this young guy was bossing them around.

483
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:43,615
That scared me too.

484

You can stand in the center. Then you can do this. After that...

Is this your spot?

486
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,184
Jinwoo, you can stand here.

487

Can you go over there?

488
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:53,254
Is it hard for you to move too?

489
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,184
- Wootae. Tarzan... - I'm fine.

490
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,825
- I'm fine. - I'm fine.

491

Let's try again slowly.

492
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:02,095
- Let me learn the moves first. - Okay.

493
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,365
It's embarrassing to bring this up myself.

494
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,704
I might look tough on the outside, but despite my looks,

I'm softhearted inside.

First of all, we had never dealt...

with this many setups for our performances on the show.

501

00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,464
LACHICA was removing my clothes.

507
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,504
But the outfit was too tight which wasn't what we had in mind.

(His shirt didn't come off smoothly.)

509
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,905
And I had to lift Rian at the end too,

510
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:50,014
but by then, I was out of energy.

511
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:53,784
And I had to look strong when I lifted her on camera.

512
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,044
So my arms couldn't shake.

513
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,855
I'm worried about that too.

514
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:01,655
All right. That's it. Good work.

515

You have to make a bigger facial expression.

519
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:10,994
You might not stand out because Rian's expression is eye-catching.

520
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:14,534
I'm not comfortable with making facial expressions.

(Tarzan seems unhappy as he checks the rehearsal footage.)

522
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:20,805
Tarzan must have felt more pressure compared to previous missions.

523
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,774
It seemed he felt responsible for this mission.

524
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:27,514
This burden that I must do well is so heavy.

525
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,415
So I was stressed out that...

526
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,214
this burden might actually be the cause of my fall.

That's how I felt.

Gosh. LACHICA has a pretty strong impression too.

the performance is meaningful.

for the things that people...

1320

find sad and painful.

Yes. Immediately.

This is a meeting.

1324
01:01:16,575 --> 01:01:18,004
I thought of...

1325
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:20,774
an emotional performance with a message.

1326
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:23,115
I want to include the emotions.

1327

I see.

1328
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:28,584
I actually had a meeting before...

1329
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,524
about a topic of desire.

1330
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:33,155
It's totally different.

1331

- Yes, totally the opposite. - Yes, it is.

(He's so stubborn.)

1337
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:48,944
Considering the music, it should be heavy, dark...

1338
01:01:48,944 --> 01:01:51,444
so that we can show strong moves.

1339

01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:57,044
The Stubborn Young Jay is here again.

1342
01:01:57,044 --> 01:01:58,615
He kept explaining.

1343
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:01,785
He was full of confidence so no one could stop him.

1344
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:03,484
Are you convincing me?

1345
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:05,455
- Yes. - Already?

1346
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,925
I want this...

1347
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:08,964
You wanted to do this so much?

1348
01:02:08,964 --> 01:02:10,825
Yes. I really wanted to because...

1349
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,865
Because even...

1350
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:15,334
He was full of desires.

1351
01:02:16,004 --> 01:02:18,135
It might be a challenge for you.

1352
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:19,905
- Yes, right. - Right?

1353

Because...

1354
01:02:21,234 --> 01:02:22,374
She's never tried this.

1355
01:02:22,374 --> 01:02:23,745
I loved that even more.

1356
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:26,515
Dark and fast beats...

1357

She's never tried them.

1358
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:30,515
If I said that I've done it before,

1359
01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:32,214
he would've been sad.

1360
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:34,615
So I said I hadn't tried it before.

1361
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:36,624
But there's no such thing that I haven't done before.

1362
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:38,794
It's necessary to match his energy.

1363
01:02:38,794 --> 01:02:40,694
He'll then be confident...

1364
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:42,055
and not find us uncomfortable.

1365

I'm here to help.

1366

- JustJerk. - Yes!

1922
01:27:11,395 --> 01:27:15,135
JustJerk got a total score of 299 points.

1923
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:17,435
It was an almost perfect score.

1924
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,765
Gosh, I was so happy.

1925
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,404
This is why we dance.

1926
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:26,244
"They brought out the concept well, and we got sucked into it."

1927
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:28,975
With that high praise, they received an almost perfect score.

1928
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:31,985
1MILLION will automatically be in second place.

1929
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:35,055
1MILLION got a total score of 288 points.

1930
01:27:35,485 --> 01:27:38,225
Eunhyuk gave you 100 points, BoA gave you 93 points,

1931
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:41,254
- and Woo Young gave you 95 points. - Gosh.

- Thank you. - Thank you.

1933
01:27:44,725 --> 01:27:48,935
Now, all that's left of Muse of SMF is the public's online evaluation.

1934
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:52,334
The Muse of SMF's online popularity votes...

1935
01:27:52,404 --> 01:27:54,904
were tallied from October 19th after the show ended...

1936
01:27:55,034 --> 01:27:58,504
until October 19th 3:53pm.

1937
01:27:58,504 --> 01:28:00,975
They were counted by The CHOOM, the official channel of SMF...

1938
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:03,685
and Mnet Plus.

1939
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:06,114
The first place of the public's online evaluation...

1940
01:28:06,685 --> 01:28:10,015
will receive a whopping 1,000 points.

1941
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:11,525
It's not that I expect it,

1942
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:15,025
but I don't think we have a chance if we don't get this.

1943
01:28:15,025 --> 01:28:16,824
I'm placing my hope...

1944
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:19,695
on the number of likes and scores from the Fight Judges.

1945
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,834
Let me reveal the final ranking of the semifinal which is...

1946
01:28:23,395 --> 01:28:26,235
a combination of the Muse of SMF and the public's online evaluation.

1947
01:28:26,464 --> 01:28:27,735
First of all,

1948
01:28:28,635 --> 01:28:30,775
I'll announce the crew that will go directly to the final,

1949
01:28:30,775 --> 01:28:33,305
the long-awaited first place.

1950
01:28:33,544 --> 01:28:34,544

(He'll announce 1st place already?)

1952
01:28:35,574 --> 01:28:38,445
- I think it's JustJerk. - I think so too.

1953
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:42,985
To be honest, I believe we deserve to win first place.

1954
01:28:43,784 --> 01:28:46,624
This crew will proudly put down their names as finalists.

1955
01:28:46,624 --> 01:28:48,454
First place goes to...

First place of the semifinal goes to Mbitious.

1966

and 136,982 likes.

1968

Mbitious was ranked third place of the online popularity vote.

1969

They received 900 points out of 1,000 points.

1970
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:28,364
I felt really bad for my crew and LACHICA.

1971
01:29:28,494 --> 01:29:30,834
The fact that we weren't eliminated...

1972
01:29:30,834 --> 01:29:33,935
Instead of feeling happy, I was sad.

I felt burdened by this mission.

I felt like I couldn't meet their expectations and failed them.

1983
01:30:05,164 --> 01:30:07,435
I want to thank LACHICA.

1984

To be honest, we thought that if things went our way,

1985
01:30:12,004 --> 01:30:15,574
we'd have a chance to participate in the Dropout Battle.

1986
01:30:15,815 --> 01:30:19,885
We'll consider this a chance for us to work harder next time.

Your crew will either advance to the final...

or participate in the Dropout Battle.

what would that be?

2071

I don't know. I can feel my blood drying up every episode.

01:40:38,978 --> 01:40:41,318
KINKY, do the knife dance!

(His knife dance of resentment)

2234
01:40:42,648 --> 01:40:44,047
Good work.

2235
01:40:44,047 --> 01:40:45,447
Let's do it all together.

2236
01:40:45,547 --> 01:40:46,718
EO-DDAE...

2237
01:40:46,718 --> 01:40:49,388
- Is great! - Is great!

2238
01:40:50,957 --> 01:40:52,587
Don't cry. It's okay.

2239
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:55,928
I sobbed in the back because you cried.

2240
01:40:56,228 --> 01:40:58,928
- Goodness, our little Minseo. - I'll message you.

2241
01:40:59,228 --> 01:41:00,627
We have to meet up soon.

2242
01:41:01,068 --> 01:41:02,638
The winning crew in my heart is...

2243
01:41:02,638 --> 01:41:05,268
EO-DDAE has always been first for JustJerk.

2244
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:06,468
Yes, seriously.

2245
01:41:06,468 --> 01:41:09,077
- Thank you so much. - Good luck.

2246
01:41:09,308 --> 01:41:11,447
I felt like our crew...

2247
01:41:11,447 --> 01:41:15,178
was being acknowledged within the dance scene.

2248
01:41:15,318 --> 01:41:18,047
I feel like we broke the stereotypes...

2249
01:41:18,047 --> 01:41:20,518
that the other crews may have had about us.

2250
01:41:21,148 --> 01:41:24,018
I feel like we have proved ourselves...

2251
01:41:24,018 --> 01:41:25,358
to the public...

2252
01:41:25,358 --> 01:41:27,188
and to the dancers here...

2253
01:41:27,188 --> 01:41:28,898
by creating stages that are like us.

2254
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,858
I feel relieved.

2255
01:41:30,858 --> 01:41:32,428
I don't think I'm going to cry again for at least a year.

2256
01:41:32,428 --> 01:41:34,268
I know, right? I let it all out today.

2257
01:41:34,737 --> 01:41:35,737
(There's still some left.)

2258
01:41:35,737 --> 01:41:36,837
What?

2259
01:41:36,837 --> 01:41:39,268
What? Didn't you say we cried enough for a year?

2260
01:41:39,308 --> 01:41:40,608
Enough for four years.

2261
01:41:40,608 --> 01:41:42,638
Now it's five years' worth of tears.

2262
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:44,537
- I wanted to battle. - Me too.

2263
01:41:44,537 --> 01:41:45,778
We really wanted to.

2264
01:41:45,778 --> 01:41:48,917
I'm a battler, but I never got to battle.

2265
01:41:49,778 --> 01:41:52,447
I want everyone to be curious about our battles.

2266
01:41:52,888 --> 01:41:53,987
Our crew, EO-DDAE...

2267
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,617
(He cries only after saying the name.)

2268
01:41:57,758 --> 01:41:59,787
I can't help but love my members.

2269
01:42:00,087 --> 01:42:01,428
They're all so lovely.

2270
01:42:01,428 --> 01:42:02,997
You have to stick your nose into the sticks.

2271
01:42:02,997 --> 01:42:04,728
It's so fun when I'm around them.

2272
01:42:05,297 --> 01:42:07,268
And sometimes, I get annoyed because they're so funny.

2273
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:09,867
From beginning to end, I feel like...

2274
01:42:09,867 --> 01:42:13,608
we went through the whole process with one mind and one goal.

2275
01:42:13,608 --> 01:42:15,508
So I want to say, "You worked hard..."

2276
01:42:15,508 --> 01:42:17,037
"and thank you so much."

2277
01:42:17,438 --> 01:42:20,447
Since we'll have a lot more opportunities in the future,

2278
01:42:20,447 --> 01:42:24,247
I hope we can happily dance together for a long time.

2279
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:26,247
We have to take DDAE-DDAE.

2280
01:42:26,247 --> 01:42:29,087
(EO-DDAE's 7th member, DDAE-DDAE, is leaving too.)

2281
01:42:29,258 --> 01:42:30,917
Thank you for not getting hurt.

2282
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,487
- Of course. - For not getting scarred.

2283
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:33,758
It's okay as long as we didn't get hurt.

2284
01:42:33,758 --> 01:42:35,657
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2285
01:42:35,657 --> 01:42:37,997
- Bye. - Bye, Street Man Fighter.

2286
01:42:37,997 --> 01:42:40,327
- Goodbye. - And bye.

(We look forward to EO-DDAE's new future.)

The first dropout crew of the semifinal round,

EO-DDAE, has left.

2290
01:42:45,737 --> 01:42:48,178
The crew in fifth place that will compete in an elimination battle...

2291
01:42:48,308 --> 01:42:51,608
with 1MILLION to obtain the last ticket to the finals...

2292
01:42:52,447 --> 01:42:54,308
is Bank 2 Brothers.

2293
01:42:54,648 --> 01:42:56,377
Bank 2 Brothers, who placed 5th,

2294
01:42:56,377 --> 01:42:59,648
received a number of 610,293 views...

2295
01:42:59,718 --> 01:43:02,518
and 96,602 likes.

2296
01:43:02,518 --> 01:43:04,688
They ranked fourth in The Public's Online Evaluation...

2297
01:43:04,688 --> 01:43:07,728
and received 850 points out of 1,000.

2298
01:43:07,728 --> 01:43:12,028
Their total score is 2,055.36

2299
01:43:12,528 --> 01:43:14,167
It is now a battle between these two crews.

2300
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:17,638
I will tell you the rules of the Semifinal Dropout Battle.

2301
01:43:17,638 --> 01:43:20,167
It will be a best of five battle.

2302
01:43:20,508 --> 01:43:22,077
The first round is a Hidden Battle.

2303
01:43:22,077 --> 01:43:25,207
It is a free-for-all routine battle...

2304
01:43:25,207 --> 01:43:28,008
that places no limits on the number of people, props, or music.

2305
01:43:28,148 --> 01:43:30,848
The second round is the return of the Call-out Battle.

2306
01:43:30,848 --> 01:43:34,117
A dancer from the crew that the bottle points to...

2307
01:43:34,117 --> 01:43:36,987
will be able to call out a dancer from the opposing crew.

(Call-out Battle?)

2309
01:43:38,058 --> 01:43:41,127
- It is a Call-out Battle. - Oh, no.

2310
01:43:41,558 --> 01:43:42,957
Gosh. That sounds like fun.

2311
01:43:42,957 --> 01:43:44,627
We have to decide on the dancer.

2312
01:43:45,197 --> 01:43:47,068
The waddle, I mean, bottle.

2313
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:48,438
What am I saying?

2314
01:43:48,537 --> 01:43:50,537
Round Three is also...

2315
01:43:50,537 --> 01:43:53,337
a Call-out Battle.

2316

(Round 3 is also a Call-out Battle.)

Round Three too?

2318
01:43:56,278 --> 01:43:59,278
For Round Three, the crew that was called out...

2319
01:43:59,377 --> 01:44:02,547
in Round Two will get to call out a dancer instead...

2320
01:44:02,547 --> 01:44:04,247
- to compete in the battle. - Okay.

2321
01:44:05,148 --> 01:44:06,888
- Who is at an advantage then? - Bank 2 Brothers.

2322
01:44:06,888 --> 01:44:08,787
- Energy versus energy. - That's a fact.

2323
01:44:10,388 --> 01:44:13,358
All of them are strong battlers, so I felt nervous.

(Shivering)

2325
01:44:16,157 --> 01:44:18,367
- This is... - It's so scary.

2326
01:44:18,367 --> 01:44:20,968
Round 4 is a 5 versus 5 group battle.

2327
01:44:20,968 --> 01:44:23,037
Each crew will compete...

2328
01:44:23,037 --> 01:44:25,537
in a routine battle with their best five members.

2329
01:44:25,537 --> 01:44:28,337
The final battle, Round Five, will be...

2330
01:44:28,337 --> 01:44:30,508
the boss versus the boss, the Leader Battle.

2331
01:44:30,638 --> 01:44:32,308
Bank 2 Brothers versus 1MILLION.

2332
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:34,207
1MILLION versus Bank 2 Brothers.

2333
01:44:34,207 --> 01:44:35,547
The two crews...

2334
01:44:35,547 --> 01:44:38,188
should now get prepared for the Dropout Battle.

2337
01:44:48,358 --> 01:44:50,258
The format of the rounds are not what I expected.

2338
01:44:50,258 --> 01:44:51,327
I know.

2339
01:44:51,528 --> 01:44:53,797
What do we do for the Call-out Battle?

2340
01:44:54,268 --> 01:44:56,398
We're not battlers.

2341
01:44:56,398 --> 01:44:59,608
And we're more powerful when it comes to choreography.

2342
01:44:59,837 --> 01:45:03,108
I thought I should grit my teeth and work extremely hard.

2343
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:06,148
Let's put our faith in the bottle.

2344
01:45:06,747 --> 01:45:09,178
The bottle will be on our side.

2345

Gosh.

(Each crew is in their hideouts after hearing about the rounds.)

2347
01:45:13,617 --> 01:45:16,218
I don't think it's necessarily an advantage for Bank 2 Brothers.

2348
01:45:16,218 --> 01:45:17,258
Think about it.

2349
01:45:17,457 --> 01:45:19,558
If everything flows naturally, I think...

2350
01:45:19,558 --> 01:45:21,358
each crew will earn a win for the Call-out Battles.

2351
01:45:21,657 --> 01:45:23,858
- Since whoever goes first will win? - Yes.

2352
01:45:23,858 --> 01:45:26,098
I don't think it'll end after just three rounds.

2353
01:45:26,098 --> 01:45:28,297
We have to believe that we're going to win Round 1 and 4 no matter what.

2354
01:45:28,297 --> 01:45:30,638
Then for the other rounds, we just have to...

2355
01:45:30,638 --> 01:45:33,167
trust that one of us will do amazing.

2356

- We should support each other. - Let's trust each other.

2357
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:37,508
The winner will be 1MILLION.

Today is going to be our last battle.

It's our last battle regardless of...

01:46:41,337 --> 01:46:42,737
It's real hip-hop.

2388
01:46:43,737 --> 01:46:44,808
Go!

2389
01:46:44,808 --> 01:46:46,247
- Yes! - Good luck.

2390
01:46:46,247 --> 01:46:49,148
This long journey started since the hot summer.

2391
01:46:49,148 --> 01:46:51,518
Tonight, one crew will have to...

2392
01:46:51,787 --> 01:46:54,688
leave Street Man Fighter with the finals right before their eyes.

2393
01:46:54,688 --> 01:46:57,188
- Let's send them off. - Let's have fun until the end.

2394
01:46:57,188 --> 01:46:58,587
Let's go.

2395
01:46:58,587 --> 01:46:59,587
Just do as we always did.

2396
01:46:59,587 --> 01:47:01,928
We're just getting more airtime in Episode 9.

2397
01:47:02,428 --> 01:47:05,468
Everyone's so determined today. They're all in black.

2398
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,797
When a dancer wears black,

2399
01:47:08,028 --> 01:47:09,438
it means they're serious.

2400
01:47:09,997 --> 01:47:11,537
A battle is just a battle.

2401
01:47:11,707 --> 01:47:13,037
It's our last battle.

2402
01:47:13,037 --> 01:47:14,237
I knew we were going to do great...

2403
01:47:14,237 --> 01:47:15,678
but I still braced myself.

2404
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,178
Before the Dropout Battle,

2405
01:47:18,178 --> 01:47:20,008
I will go ahead and introduce...

2406
01:47:20,008 --> 01:47:21,818
the Fight Judges who will judge the battles.

2407
01:47:21,818 --> 01:47:23,978
BoA, Eunhyuk, and Woo Young.

2408
01:47:24,318 --> 01:47:26,747
(Cheering)

2409
01:47:26,818 --> 01:47:27,917
(The Fight Judges join the dancers for the last bit of the semifinal.)

2410
01:47:29,018 --> 01:47:31,157
For Bank 2 Brothers, this is their...

2411
01:47:31,157 --> 01:47:32,258
Second Dropout Battle.

2412
01:47:32,258 --> 01:47:33,858
It's 1MILLION's first time though.

2413
01:47:35,258 --> 01:47:36,898
We need to move to the back.

2414
01:47:36,928 --> 01:47:38,428
We need to make sure we're in sync.

2415
01:47:38,428 --> 01:47:40,598
Just do as what we practiced.

2416
01:47:40,598 --> 01:47:43,768
With the routine we prepared, we can beat anyone.

2417
01:47:43,768 --> 01:47:46,308
First, Bank 2 Brothers.

2418
01:47:46,308 --> 01:47:47,768
Please come to the fight zone.

2419
01:47:47,768 --> 01:47:49,478
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2420
01:47:50,237 --> 01:47:51,308
Let's go!

2421
01:47:51,308 --> 01:47:53,407
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2422
01:47:53,407 --> 01:47:55,978
- Let's go. - Good luck.

2423
01:47:56,377 --> 01:47:59,688
1MILLION. Please come to the fight zone.

2424
01:47:59,688 --> 01:48:01,518
Raise our energy!

2425
01:48:02,758 --> 01:48:04,617
(Other crews that used to compete cheer for them.)

2426
01:48:04,617 --> 01:48:05,957
- Good luck. - Go for it.

2427
01:48:05,957 --> 01:48:07,228
Good luck.

2428
01:48:07,457 --> 01:48:08,627
Good luck.

2429
01:48:08,627 --> 01:48:10,398
- Go for it. - Good luck.

2430
01:48:10,457 --> 01:48:12,598
- Okay. - Let's go.

2431
01:48:12,627 --> 01:48:16,667
I never imagined these two crews.

2432
01:48:17,797 --> 01:48:19,907
Bank 2 Brothers. 1MILLION.

2433
01:48:19,907 --> 01:48:22,678
The last battle of Street Man Fighter.

2434
01:48:22,678 --> 01:48:24,778
After this battle,

2435
01:48:24,778 --> 01:48:26,747
one of you must leave the fight club.

2436
01:48:26,747 --> 01:48:28,718
That could've happened to me.

2437
01:48:28,718 --> 01:48:29,947
They must be nervous.

2438
01:48:30,318 --> 01:48:32,047
Among all battles, this is the most...

2439
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:33,287
Nerve-racking?

2440
01:48:33,287 --> 01:48:35,587
This is the last battle before the final.

2441
01:48:35,657 --> 01:48:37,457
It's more pressuring.

2442
01:48:38,558 --> 01:48:40,457
(Sighing)

2443
01:48:40,457 --> 01:48:42,657
Tell me how you feel before the battle.

2444
01:48:42,657 --> 01:48:45,167
Thank you so much for your evaluation.

2445
01:48:45,167 --> 01:48:46,797
You gave us good advice.

2446
01:48:46,797 --> 01:48:48,867
It'll help us a lot...

2447
01:48:48,867 --> 01:48:50,598
to move forward.

2448
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:54,638
Now, the atmosphere has changed.

2449
01:48:55,877 --> 01:48:57,407
Let's go!

2450
01:48:57,577 --> 01:48:59,108
- That's crazy. - It's changed.

2451
01:48:59,108 --> 01:49:00,407
That guy's scary.

2452
01:49:00,577 --> 01:49:02,577
I can't watch this.

2453
01:49:02,818 --> 01:49:04,947
This is the last battle.

2454
01:49:06,247 --> 01:49:09,657
I want to look really cool.

2455
01:49:09,758 --> 01:49:13,058
Let's play fair.

2456
01:49:14,627 --> 01:49:15,627
That's cool.

2457
01:49:15,627 --> 01:49:18,058
- He's cool. - He's cool and scary.

2458
01:49:18,327 --> 01:49:20,728
Like JRoc said,

2459
01:49:20,928 --> 01:49:22,867
we'll also do our best...

2460
01:49:22,867 --> 01:49:25,308
to leave a good impression...

2461
01:49:25,367 --> 01:49:27,308
which could be our last chance.

2462
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:33,108
I'm sure this won't be the end.

2463
01:49:34,547 --> 01:49:36,417
- Good. - Good luck.

2464
01:49:36,447 --> 01:49:37,978
We're real battlers.

2465
01:49:38,148 --> 01:49:39,487
Let's make sure.

2466
01:49:39,587 --> 01:49:41,787
We won four Group Battles and lost once.

2467
01:49:41,888 --> 01:49:43,987
We're not bad at battles.

2468
01:49:44,457 --> 01:49:46,487
The final battle...

2469
01:49:46,487 --> 01:49:48,087
for the last ticket to the final.

2470
01:49:48,428 --> 01:49:51,697
Who will be the sole winner?

2471
01:49:51,797 --> 01:49:53,968
Now, let's begin...

2472
01:49:53,968 --> 01:49:56,667
Street Man Fighter's last Dropout Battle.

2473
01:49:56,667 --> 01:49:58,398
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2474
01:49:58,398 --> 01:49:59,737
Let's go!

2475
01:49:59,737 --> 01:50:01,237
Kill them!

2476
01:50:01,508 --> 01:50:02,877
Good luck to you both.

2477
01:50:02,877 --> 01:50:04,407
Let's do this.

2478
01:50:04,438 --> 01:50:06,707
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2479
01:50:06,978 --> 01:50:09,547
(Also getting nervous)

2480
01:50:09,648 --> 01:50:11,318
For Dropout Battle Round One,

2481
01:50:11,318 --> 01:50:13,818
each crew will show their hidden fatal move.

2482
01:50:13,818 --> 01:50:17,258
There's no limit to the number of people, music, or props.

2483
01:50:17,258 --> 01:50:18,627
It's the Hidden Battle.

2484
01:50:18,627 --> 01:50:19,928
Let's go.

2485
01:50:19,987 --> 01:50:21,388
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2486
01:50:21,688 --> 01:50:24,457
They're very good at performances.

2487
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:27,167
I'm worried.

2488
01:50:27,228 --> 01:50:31,197
It seems the necklace is their prop.

2489
01:50:31,568 --> 01:50:33,367
- For them, it's the jacket. - The jacket, and...

2490
01:50:33,367 --> 01:50:35,377
I think they're holding a camera.

2491
01:50:35,508 --> 01:50:37,377
Gof wants to remember this moment.

2492
01:50:37,938 --> 01:50:40,577
The leader of Bank 2 Brothers, JRoc.

2493
01:50:40,577 --> 01:50:43,247
Who's participating in the Hidden Battle?

2494
01:50:43,547 --> 01:50:47,318
The Hidden Dancer that will beat 1MILLION is...

2495
01:50:47,587 --> 01:50:50,758
Whatever they have, they can't beat us.

2496
01:50:51,087 --> 01:50:52,127
And?

2497
01:50:52,327 --> 01:50:53,957
I can't predict it.

2498
01:50:55,497 --> 01:50:56,758
All of us.

2499
01:50:56,758 --> 01:50:57,928
(All Bank 2 Brothers members are participating.)

2500
01:51:00,098 --> 01:51:01,797
- That's right. - Bank 2 Brothers.

2501
01:51:01,797 --> 01:51:02,968
That's right!

2502
01:51:03,068 --> 01:51:05,037
- Yes. - Let's go!

2503
01:51:05,207 --> 01:51:08,468
That doesn't intimidate me.

2504
01:51:08,577 --> 01:51:09,907
Leader Baek Koo Young.

2505
01:51:09,907 --> 01:51:12,508
Who's participating in the Hidden Battle?

2506
01:51:13,747 --> 01:51:15,818
For the Hidden Battle...

2507
01:51:15,848 --> 01:51:18,148
They probably prepared something similar.

2508
01:51:18,148 --> 01:51:21,747
They should be combatant from the start.

2509
01:51:21,957 --> 01:51:23,917
- Everyone? - Everyone?

2510
01:51:25,018 --> 01:51:27,428
From the rookie to the leader, it's everyone.

2511
01:51:27,428 --> 01:51:28,827
Yes.

2512

(Expectant)

2513

(Whole crews are playing against each other for the Hidden Battle.)

2514
01:51:34,528 --> 01:51:36,697
- Let's go. - This is it.

2515
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:38,337
Team battle.

2516

01:51:40,608 --> 01:51:42,278
Dropout Battle, Round One.

2518
01:51:42,407 --> 01:51:44,108
It is...

2519
01:51:44,108 --> 01:51:45,978
crew versus crew.

2520
01:51:46,648 --> 01:51:48,547
I'll spin the bottle...

2521
01:51:48,547 --> 01:51:50,848
to decide who'll go first.

2522
01:51:52,747 --> 01:51:55,087
1MILLION will go first.

2523
01:51:55,617 --> 01:51:58,487
And Bank 2 Brothers will go second.

2524
01:51:58,728 --> 01:52:00,127
Do what you always do.

2525
01:52:00,487 --> 01:52:03,398
Everyone in the crew will show what they got for this battle.

2526
01:52:03,928 --> 01:52:06,297
Every member is hidden.

2527
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:08,028
I'm not worried about Round One.

2528
01:52:08,167 --> 01:52:09,898
We already won.

2529
01:52:10,068 --> 01:52:12,237
I feel confident about the Hidden Battle.

2530
01:52:12,337 --> 01:52:14,008
Gof. Get ready.

2531
01:52:14,008 --> 01:52:15,707
- The music may start right away. - Yes.

2532
01:52:16,138 --> 01:52:17,178
I'm sorry,

2533
01:52:17,178 --> 01:52:19,678
but I'm going to leave the camera here.

2534
01:52:19,678 --> 01:52:21,707
Can I come here after the battle?

2535
01:52:21,707 --> 01:52:23,247
- Yes. - I'm going to leave it here.

2536
01:52:23,377 --> 01:52:24,518
Okay.

2537
01:52:24,877 --> 01:52:27,818
I think Gof's filming it for his personal use.

2538
01:52:27,818 --> 01:52:31,417
He wants to record it like a vlog.

2539
01:52:31,558 --> 01:52:34,157
Bank 2 Brothers didn't...

2540
01:52:34,157 --> 01:52:36,398
really use the props.

2541
01:52:36,898 --> 01:52:39,568
Your hidden moves and your energy that can't be hidden.

2542
01:52:39,568 --> 01:52:40,867
Let's begin the Hidden Battle...

2543
01:52:40,867 --> 01:52:42,638
of two crews running for victory.

2544
01:52:42,638 --> 01:52:44,337
You guys ready?

2545
01:52:44,337 --> 01:52:45,907
- Ready! - Fight.

2546
01:52:45,907 --> 01:52:47,968
(1MILLION performed as the backup dancer for "Growl.")

BUSYBE.

2689
01:59:18,898 --> 01:59:21,997
My style might not work on him.

2690
01:59:21,997 --> 01:59:23,797
We're both like octopuses.

2691
01:59:23,797 --> 01:59:26,837
But Yumeki is an octopus...

2692

with moves that are more mainstream. So I felt anxious.

2693

You feel this pressure when it's a surprise attack.

2705
02:00:01,367 --> 02:00:04,037
I don't think he can show off his full skills.

2709
02:00:09,818 --> 02:00:12,718
What are your plans for the battle?

2710
02:00:12,917 --> 02:00:16,087
Because I couldn't be a part of the last Dropout Battle,

2711
02:00:16,117 --> 02:00:18,518
I've been dying to dance.

2712
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:20,127
He's having another cramp.

2713
02:00:20,688 --> 02:00:26,167
(As Giseok got injured, he could only watch the Dropout Battle.)

2714
02:00:26,697 --> 02:00:29,768
I really wanted to do a 1-on-1 battle.

2715
02:00:30,068 --> 02:00:32,297
I will show you everything I've got.

2716
02:00:32,297 --> 02:00:34,667
- I can do it! - Yes!

2717
02:00:34,867 --> 02:00:36,278
Let's go.

2718
02:00:36,337 --> 02:00:38,808
(It's so going to be entertaining.)

2719
02:00:38,808 --> 02:00:41,207
Giseok was injured.

2720
02:00:41,848 --> 02:00:45,478
So he couldn't dance much compared to the others.

2721
02:00:45,787 --> 02:00:48,148
He must be dying to dance.

2722
02:00:48,388 --> 02:00:49,688
I told you he would pick you.

2723
02:00:49,818 --> 02:00:52,587
Show them what you've got. Okay?

2724
02:00:52,957 --> 02:00:56,258
He will regret choosing Giseok as his battle opponent.

2725
02:00:56,758 --> 02:00:59,528
Yumeki of 1MILLION will go first,

2726
02:00:59,528 --> 02:01:01,268
then Giseok of Bank 2 Brothers.

2727
02:01:01,367 --> 02:01:02,737
Let's go!

2728
02:01:03,598 --> 02:01:04,968
They're in battle mode.

2729
02:01:05,167 --> 02:01:06,667
It's scary.

2730
02:01:07,367 --> 02:01:08,768
I will win no matter what.

2731
02:01:08,768 --> 02:01:12,808
I've been dancing for years. Freestyle dancing is my forte.

2732
02:01:13,278 --> 02:01:15,047
Don't look down on me.

2733
02:01:15,207 --> 02:01:17,978
We may not be battlers, but we're still good at them.

2734
02:01:18,478 --> 02:01:20,287
We'll begin the battle of the two dancers...

2735
02:01:20,287 --> 02:01:22,117
who have returned to the start line.

2736
02:01:22,117 --> 02:01:23,287
You guys ready?

2737
02:01:23,558 --> 02:01:25,157
- Let's get it! - Fight!

2738
02:01:25,617 --> 02:01:29,297
I will take responsibility and lead our crew to the finals.

(Yumeki is cool!)

2740
02:01:55,388 --> 02:01:56,718
It looked like he had a lot in mind.

2741
02:01:56,718 --> 02:01:59,627

The last part was nice.

2745
02:02:28,518 --> 02:02:31,587
Switch! Giseok of Bank 2 Brothers.

2746
02:02:31,718 --> 02:02:33,028
I showed him everything.

2747
02:02:33,487 --> 02:02:35,528
Let's see how good you are.

2748

I will show you what I've got.

He killed it. Hey!

- Giseok's good. - He's crazy.

Meki's amazing at taking over the mood of the song.

2773

Yes. He makes it into his. That's high quality.

How did you hold back that urge to dance, Giseok?

02:05:09,047 --> 02:05:10,577
You should've let him dance.

2786

It felt as if you came...

- to exorcise... - To exorcise?

You looked crazy.

2790

The battle made me realize you had a lot of repertories.

When it came to the variety of battles,

2792
02:05:26,827 --> 02:05:29,997
Giseok was naturally the winner.

2793
02:05:29,997 --> 02:05:32,707
You showed off your body control...

2794

and good balance...

2795
02:05:34,638 --> 02:05:37,737
when you used your ankles multiple times.

2796
02:05:37,737 --> 02:05:39,978
You kept controlling your body...

2797
02:05:39,978 --> 02:05:42,877
and balanced yourself throughout those moves.

2798
02:05:42,947 --> 02:05:45,148
That was truly remarkable.

2799
02:05:45,278 --> 02:05:47,947
Honestly speaking,

2800
02:05:47,947 --> 02:05:50,188
I personally love your style too, Yumeki.

2801
02:05:50,188 --> 02:05:53,087
But maybe you were tensed up too much.

2802
02:05:53,157 --> 02:05:56,598
It looked as if you weren't using your body fully.

2803
02:05:56,598 --> 02:05:58,297
It must have been a lot of pressure.

2804
02:05:58,358 --> 02:06:01,367
And as the song progressed,

2805
02:06:01,867 --> 02:06:05,468
you kept using similar moves.

2806
02:06:05,468 --> 02:06:08,367
That was what I felt, which was a bummer.

2807

- Will it be BUSYBE? - It's Gof.

2817
02:06:38,037 --> 02:06:39,907
Gof's nuclear warhead is ready.

2818

2819

Yes?

2820
02:06:46,178 --> 02:06:48,608
Feeldog.

2821
02:06:48,907 --> 02:06:50,417
Feeldog.

Wow, Feeldog!

2823
02:06:55,417 --> 02:06:57,188
They're stepping out with a different style.

2824
02:06:57,457 --> 02:06:59,928
I thought it was either going to be...

2825
02:06:59,928 --> 02:07:02,928
Gof or BUSYBE. So it was a surprise.

2826
02:07:02,997 --> 02:07:06,697
I think they're preparing to go up against us two.

2827
02:07:07,028 --> 02:07:08,327
What about you, Feeldog?

2828
02:07:08,468 --> 02:07:10,438
Everyone's battle qualities are similar.

2829
02:07:10,438 --> 02:07:12,697
- We should show them your new side. - I'm...

2830

- Aren't you ready? - Yes, I am.

2831
02:07:15,608 --> 02:07:17,938
- Feeldog's amazing. - He's got great energy.

2832
02:07:18,037 --> 02:07:19,478
I had faith in Feeldog.

2833
02:07:19,478 --> 02:07:23,377
What were your criteria in choosing your opponent?

2834
02:07:23,978 --> 02:07:25,778
- I'll be honest. - We trust you.

- There was an unforgettable moment. - I see.

Nino of 1MILLION.

2844
02:07:52,237 --> 02:07:54,907
As soon as Feeldog walked out, I knew it right away.

2845

"It's me."

2846
02:07:57,318 --> 02:08:00,617
During the Class Mission, Nino and Yumeki...

2847
02:08:00,617 --> 02:08:02,787
put me and Hyu in the back.

2848
02:08:02,917 --> 02:08:04,617
We didn't even have to check our footage.

2849
02:08:04,617 --> 02:08:06,287
We stayed in the back the whole time.

2850
02:08:06,287 --> 02:08:08,188
I was humiliated that day.

2851
02:08:08,327 --> 02:08:10,528
So I wanted to take revenge with this battle.

2852
02:08:11,228 --> 02:08:13,127
(Feeldog versus Nino)

2853
02:08:13,228 --> 02:08:14,797
This is a revenge match.

2854
02:08:14,928 --> 02:08:16,568
There's a backstory.

2855

Gosh. This is coming back now?

2856

Gosh. I'm looking forward to this one.

2857
02:08:21,308 --> 02:08:22,737
I can't wait.

2858
02:08:22,877 --> 02:08:24,508
There's been bad blood between them since the Class Mission.

2859
02:08:24,508 --> 02:08:26,138
I wonder how he will get even.

2860
02:08:26,138 --> 02:08:28,008
Let's see if Feeldog will be able to take his revenge.

2861
02:08:28,407 --> 02:08:29,917
And will 1MILLION be able to come back from the loss...

2862

in the previous round?

If we lose this round,

we'll end up going home without making it to Round Five.

So just having fun won't be enough to beat us.

Will they win three points and end the battle here?

JustJerk.

3511
02:39:20,061 --> 02:39:24,000
Which of these four crews will become the winner?

3512
02:39:26,131 --> 02:39:28,071
The first of the final missions is...

3513
02:39:28,071 --> 02:39:29,741
the SMF Cheers Mission.

3514
02:39:29,741 --> 02:39:30,770
What?

3515
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:33,541
For this mission, you must make your happy moment...

3516
02:39:33,541 --> 02:39:35,411
into the key choreography to complete your performance.

3517
02:39:35,411 --> 02:39:37,510
Our happy moment. I like it.

3518
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:38,510
It's hard.

3519
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:40,651
I think we could show a new side of us.

3520
02:39:40,651 --> 02:39:43,481
(The second mission of the final is revealed.)

It's the Last Dance Mission.

3524
02:39:47,891 --> 02:39:49,420
(The Last Dance Mission will be a free performance.)

3525
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:54,231
(It will be an opportunity to show the crew's colour and identity.)

3526
02:39:54,231 --> 02:39:55,731
We can just do what we wanted to do.

(Nervous)

3528
02:39:57,561 --> 02:39:59,700
With our current mindset, we can never lose.

3529
02:39:59,700 --> 02:40:00,971
We can never lose.

3530
02:40:00,971 --> 02:40:02,901
We will show you what street power is all about.

3531
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:06,141
I want to do what Mbitious really wanted to do,

3532
02:40:06,141 --> 02:40:08,110
and I want to win.

3533
02:40:08,241 --> 02:40:10,641
I came on this show to be acknowledged by everyone.

3534
02:40:10,641 --> 02:40:12,881
So my only thought is that I must win, no matter what.

3535
02:40:12,881 --> 02:40:13,911
I won't lose.

3536
02:40:13,911 --> 02:40:16,680
If we perform for the final as We Dem BOYZ has always done,

3537
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:18,750
I think we will finish Street Man Fighter...

3538
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:20,791
without any regrets.
