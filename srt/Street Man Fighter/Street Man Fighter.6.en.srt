It's tight.

it will be an easy win for us.

486

They are a crew of battlers.

487

I've never seen them do choreography.

488

In my opinion,

495

BigBang is closer to a hip-hop team...

496

than a choreography team.

497

Giseok and Deegun of Bank 2 Brothers...

641
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,426
obtained 100 points...

642
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,597
for becoming the main dancers of Middle Two Class.

643
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,867
Giseok did something big for his team.

644
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:26,436
I feel proud.

645
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,837
Those 100 points are big.

646
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,837
As for EO-DDAE, the leader, TED,

647
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:32,906
became the worst dancer of the Leader Class...

648
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:36,107
which resulted in a deduction of 50 points for the crew.

649
00:30:36,777 --> 00:30:40,317
I deducted 50 points for my crew...

650
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:41,876
so I felt ashamed.

651
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:45,017
The difference in their points is 150 points.

652
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:48,117
It is the largest gap among all the rounds.

653
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,027
A 150-point gap is so big.

654
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,626
After seeing the 150-point gap in front of my own eyes,

655
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:56,126
I thought maybe we could lose.

656
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:57,297
However,

657
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,236
the number of views...

658
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:02,807
for Bank 2 Brothers' video is 404,765.

659
00:31:02,936 --> 00:31:04,436
On the other hand,

660
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:07,476
EO-DDAE has 769,280 views.

661
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:11,007
It's almost twice the amount.

662
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:12,507
The difference is quite big.

663
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,277
- Does B2B have the least views? - I think so.

664
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:16,686
Last.

665

For this round, one crew...

668
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:29,567

That means the Fight Judges...

672
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:37,607
considered one crew to be a lot better than the other.

673
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,277
They're probably so nervous.

674
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,847
Which crew received a higher score...

675
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:45,376
and will get one step closer to winning the round?

676
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:46,547
It must be EO-DDAE.

677
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,247
I think it's EO-DDAE.

678
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,686
Because their additional points can make up for it.

679
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:57,456
Then we will now reveal the scores from the Fight Judges as well as...

May we be the winners.

I knew we were in last place for the number of views,

687
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:13,037

And most importantly, they should've had the choreography memorized.

But they didn't have all three.

It's not that we deserved that score,

I bet they are going to crush this.

Those guys are such softies off stage.

and give it our all before we move on to the next round.

1253
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:44,652
It's hip hop versus krump.

1254
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:47,422
Those are the crews I really don't want to battle.

1255
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:48,893
This doesn't feel like a TV show.

1256
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:51,992
They look like they are here to battle it out for real.

00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:54,262
- Isn't this the final match? - Yes, in terms of battling.

1258

I think both crews will give it their all.

I can sense that they are a lot more serious.

They must battle for survival this time.

1278
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:40,072
(Dropout Battle)

1279
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:41,742
Bank 2 Brothers...

1280
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:43,413
versus PRIME KINGZ.

1281
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:45,842
One of these crews...

1282
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,652
will be the first one to leave the Fight Club tonight.

1283
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:50,253
Why am I getting sad?

1284
00:55:50,253 --> 00:55:53,422
- I can't imagine how they feel. - Right. They must be so nervous.

1285
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,052
I'm already tearing up.

1286
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,853
- What do I do? - Me too. I might tear up already.

1287
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,092
Crybabies.

1288
00:55:58,092 --> 00:56:00,692
I hate that 1 of the 2 crews will be leaving.

1289
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:03,032
I don't want to get eliminated. It will never happen.

1290
00:56:03,032 --> 00:56:06,132
You saw in the first episode why we're the kings.

1291
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:07,762
There's no way we'll get eliminated.

1292
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:09,472
Who will it be?

1293
00:56:09,472 --> 00:56:11,703
Both crews focus on battling.

1294
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:14,072
But PRIME KINGZ is...

1295
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:16,012
- too good at battles. - Right.

1296
00:56:16,413 --> 00:56:18,882
Maybe, there will be a twist with Bank 2 Brothers.

1297
00:56:18,882 --> 00:56:19,942
- Right. - They might come out...

1298
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:21,012
all determined and put on a great battle.

1299
00:56:21,012 --> 00:56:22,152
They have to.

Please give a word of encouragement to these two crews...

who will soon put on their final battle.

1303
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:31,862
This is the first Dropout Battle. And we didn't expect to see...

1304
00:56:31,862 --> 00:56:33,692
these two crews so soon.

1305
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:36,862
I hope you will have no regrets after this battle.

1306
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:39,132
This will be your last chance...

1307
00:56:39,132 --> 00:56:41,532
to show us what your crews are all about.

1308
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:44,873
I really hope you guys have a lot of fun at this battle.

1309
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:46,572
- Nice. - Let's go!

- Let's go. - Rip it! Do it.

1312
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:56,152
I will now tell you the rules of the Dropout Battle.

1313
00:56:56,152 --> 00:57:00,183
The Dropout Battle will be a best of five.

1314
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,722
As for Round One which will start off the battle,

1315
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,362
it will be a 1-on-1 Ace Battle.

1316
00:57:05,362 --> 00:57:08,163
Round 2 will be a 2-on-2 Duo Battle.

1317
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,862
Round Three will be a 1-on-1 Leader Battle...

1318
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,833
where their pride is at stake.

1319
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,733
Round Four will be a round of power.

1320
00:57:14,733 --> 00:57:16,833
You can show us a group choreography.

1321
00:57:16,902 --> 00:57:18,342
As for the final round, Round Five,

1322
00:57:18,342 --> 00:57:21,612
it will be the Rookie Battle. Rookies of each crew will battle.

1323
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:23,942
Gosh. Best of five is too much.

1324
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:25,643
Ace Battle. Leader Battle.

1325
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,313
Gosh. It depends on the rookie.

1326
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:28,683
This is so scary.

1327
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:32,282
I hoped that it wouldn't last until Round Five.

I really don't know who's going to win.

1331
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:40,793
- You may proceed. - We're going to stick to our pace.

1332
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:42,192
So have as much fun as you can.

- Okay. - Let's not get hurt.

1335
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,603
Okay. We totally ruined the Class Mission.

1336
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:51,603
You know that, right? We lost the Global K-dance Mission.

1337
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:52,643
Yes.

1338
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,873
- But still. We're desperate to win. - Yes.

1339
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:57,072
We're not here to get eliminated.

1340
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:59,282
- We're here to win. Right? - Yes.

1341
00:57:59,282 --> 00:58:01,612
Let's do what we've been doing. But let's do our best.

1342
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:02,882
- Yes. - Okay?

1343
00:58:02,882 --> 00:58:04,623
Let's do our best and have fun.

1344
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:05,683
Okay.

1345
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,882
It's time to decide...

1346
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:10,523
the first crew to be eliminated from Street Man Fighter.

1347
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:13,663
Round One is the Ace Battle.

1348
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:15,632
Each crew will decide on their ace...

1349
00:58:15,632 --> 00:58:18,003
excluding their leader in advance...

1350
00:58:18,003 --> 00:58:19,902
and proceed with the first battle.

1351
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,873
We will now choose the dancers for the first round.

1352
00:58:23,873 --> 00:58:25,773
I wonder who their ace dancers are.

1353
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:27,342
Won't they be BUSYBE and Knucks?

1354
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:29,572
Aces. It's excluding their leaders.

1355
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,273
So it might be the sub leaders.

1356
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:34,143
(Will it be a battle of two sub leaders?)

1357
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,483
Who will come out for the Ace Battle? BUSYBE?

1358
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:37,583
BUSYBE?

1359
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,152
- I see. It will be BUSYBE. - Yes.

1360
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,253
Knucks will probably come out for the Ace Battle.

1361
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:42,492
You should go out then.

1362
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,552
Our strategy was to send out the best dancers...

1363
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:46,063
and to win three battles first.

1364
00:58:46,063 --> 00:58:47,963
With that in mind,

1365
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:49,333
we put him down as our ace.

1366
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:52,762
Bank 2 Brothers. Name the ace dancer...

1367
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,733
who can get your first win against PRIME KINGZ.

1368
00:58:56,072 --> 00:58:57,503
- BUSYBE? - BUSYBE.

1369
00:58:57,503 --> 00:58:58,543
BUSYBE.

1370
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:00,972
The ace dancer of Bank 2 Brothers...

1371
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,313
is BUSYBE.

1372
00:59:03,313 --> 00:59:05,083
(The ace dancer of Bank 2 Brothers BUSYBE, the sub leader)

1373
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,242
- Let's go. - BUSYBE!

1374
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:10,882
(Everyone cheers at the mention of a strong battler.)

1375
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:12,683
- It has to be Knucks. - Let's go!

1376
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,023
I want to battle against BUSYBE.

1377
00:59:15,023 --> 00:59:18,322
I want to battle him and have fun on stage.

1378
00:59:18,563 --> 00:59:20,893
All right. Trix of PRIME KINGZ.

1379
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:22,762
Name the ace dancer...

1380
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,592
of PRIME KINGZ...

1381
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:27,233
who can get your first win against Bank 2 Brothers.

1382
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:30,402
The ace dancer of PRIME KINGZ...

1383
00:59:30,402 --> 00:59:33,003
who will beat Bank 2 Brothers is DOOR.

1384
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:36,672
- The ace dancer is DOOR. - Knucks.

1385
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:41,782
(Even Bank 2 Brothers didn't see that coming.)

1386
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:42,983
- DOOR. - DOOR.

1387
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,652
(DOOR will open the door of the Dropout Battle.)

1388
00:59:45,922 --> 00:59:47,152
Let's get it.

1389
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,992
I thought it would be Knucks.

1390
00:59:49,992 --> 00:59:51,052
- Right. - This is unexpected.

1391
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:53,463
I went out there, ready to battle Knucks.

1392
00:59:53,463 --> 00:59:56,893
But another dancer came up. So I was a bit flustered.

1393
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,132
This is the Ace Battle.

1394
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:00,862
"How come the sub leader didn't come out?"

1395
01:00:00,862 --> 01:00:04,773
I don't think BUSYBE knows a thing about DOOR.

1396
01:00:04,842 --> 01:00:06,472
DOOR is really good.

1397
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:07,773
Of course, Knucks is our ace dancer.

1398
01:00:07,773 --> 01:00:10,043
But they already saw him battle. So Knucks stepped back this time.

1399
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:11,742
Let's see. The Ace Battle.

1400
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,442
It has to be either Knucks or DOOR.

1401
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:15,583
You should battle it this time. Show them, DOOR.

1402
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:17,052
- Do it. - You can do it.

1403
01:00:17,052 --> 01:00:18,683
- Let's start with a win. - You can do it.

1404
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:20,683
During the other missions,

1405
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,052
I didn't stand out.

1406
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,063
And I couldn't even participate in the Class Mission...

1407
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:26,322
because I was injured.

1408
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,963
(DOOR couldn't participate because of his injury.)

1409
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:32,663
Since I'm the sub leader,

1410
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:35,873
I wanted my member to have another chance to dance.

1411
01:00:35,873 --> 01:00:38,373
I thought it was time for them to see DOOR's dance.

1412
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:39,503
Don't get too excited. Just have fun.

1413
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:40,902
- Okay. - You'll win if you have fun.

1414
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:43,273
If you have nothing to do, I'll throw you a hat.

1415
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:44,442
Trust us, and have fun.

1416
01:00:44,442 --> 01:00:45,612
- He'll give you the hat. - Okay.

1417
01:00:45,612 --> 01:00:48,853
Well, I think I'm great at battles.

1418
01:00:48,882 --> 01:00:50,253
DOOR is really good.

1419
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:52,552
He hasn't had a chance to show his talent yet.

1420
01:00:52,652 --> 01:00:53,853
This is great.

1421
01:00:53,853 --> 01:00:55,552
- This is going to be fun. - Go crazy.

1422
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:57,793
We weren't going to worry about our opponent.

1423
01:00:57,793 --> 01:01:00,092
We decided to stick to our pace.

1424
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,422
So we believed in BUSYBE.

1425
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:03,092
Round One of the Dropout Battle.

1426
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,963
It's BUSYBE of Bank 2 Brothers...

1427
01:01:04,963 --> 01:01:08,603
versus DOOR of PRIME KINGZ. Their battle has been set.

1428
01:01:08,603 --> 01:01:11,873
I'll spin a water bottle to decide who goes first.

1429
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:13,103
(Which crew did the water bottle decide?)

1430
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,572
Let's go!

1431
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:17,012

DOOR will go next.

- Let's go! - Let's go!

1435
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:23,282
Gosh. I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?

1436
01:01:23,282 --> 01:01:25,052
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1437
01:01:25,353 --> 01:01:29,253
BUSYBE of Bank 2 Brothers versus DOOR of PRIME KINGZ.

1438
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:31,563
A crew will survive. And a crew will be eliminated.

1439
01:01:31,793 --> 01:01:33,362
The first elimination of Street Man Fighter...

1440
01:01:33,362 --> 01:01:34,893
- is at stake! - Let's go.

The fierce battle between them will begin now!

Oh, no!

You guys ready?

- Fight! - Fight!

I warmed up enough.

1447
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:49,472
And I braced myself too. So I was ready to have fun.

I haven't done any solo dancing on this show,

his first solo battle on Street Man Fighter.

- I know. - He seemed relaxed though.

This is impossible to judge.

They both danced well.

- Them both. - They both did well.

The first round of the Dropout Battle is now over.

01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,393
about competing in the battle.

1510
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:30,592
Right before the result announcement...

1511
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:33,063
was when I was the most nervous.

1512
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:35,773
Losing the first round...

1513
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:39,043
might affect the other crew members in the following rounds.

Let's see who won this round.

DOOR will win for sure. There's no doubt about it.

1516
01:05:45,213 --> 01:05:47,313
Losing didn't seem like an option.

do an exceptional job.

1538

But we still have to choose a winner.

1539

- Of course. - BUSYBE...

1540

kicked off the battle with a great show.

1541
01:06:37,032 --> 01:06:40,762
It seemed like DOOR had to perform magic...

1542
01:06:40,762 --> 01:06:44,203
to turn the tables and get my vote.

1543
01:06:44,203 --> 01:06:46,572
When the music started to play, I could tell that...

1544
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:48,342
it was one you have been listening to a lot.

1545
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,112
You easily set the tone.

1546
01:06:50,342 --> 01:06:54,643
My vote went to the dancer who had the move...

1547
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:56,453
that wowed me.

1548
01:06:56,453 --> 01:07:00,382
I thank you both for delivering a great battle.

1549
01:07:00,552 --> 01:07:03,592
I believed that it just came down to a preference...

1550
01:07:03,722 --> 01:07:06,692
when talking about...

1551
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:09,563
the different styles of both crews.

1552
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:13,503
The moves shown by BUSYBE today...

1553
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,803
was enough to make me a fan...

1554
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:18,772
of the style Bank 2 Brothers have built as a group.

1555
01:07:18,772 --> 01:07:20,503
And then there was DOOR.

1556
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:24,513
You properly expressed the beat in which the song was in.

1557
01:07:24,572 --> 01:07:27,013
That musicality...

1558
01:07:27,013 --> 01:07:29,383
is what I particularly loved.

1559
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:31,453
It's why I couldn't choose a clear winner.

1560
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:33,352
I was impressed by both of you.

1561
01:07:34,522 --> 01:07:36,692
And just like that, PRIME KINGZ managed...

1562
01:07:36,692 --> 01:07:37,892
to win the first round.

1563
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:39,192
They were able...

1564
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:40,663
to get the drop on Bank 2 Brothers.

1565
01:07:40,663 --> 01:07:43,333
That's when I was finally able...

1566
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:46,062
to lay down the weight I had been carrying around.

1567
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:50,303
It's not easy to win a battle...

1568
01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:54,043
against an opponent who does krumping.

1569
01:07:54,402 --> 01:07:56,213
You can't outshine that dominant style.

1570
01:07:56,213 --> 01:07:58,883
I know. Since you only get a short amount of time...

1571
01:07:58,883 --> 01:07:59,883
Exactly.

1572
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:01,413
Krumping is the style...

1573
01:08:01,413 --> 01:08:03,053
that immediately grabs your attention.

1574
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,982
- Who's up next? - The Ace Battle.

1575
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:07,682
- PRIME KINGZ wins the first round. - The Duo Battle.

1576
01:08:08,053 --> 01:08:11,692
The next round is the 2-on-2 Duo Battle.

1577
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:13,492
This'll be a lot of fun.

1578
01:08:13,892 --> 01:08:16,263
This one will be hard to predict.

1579
01:08:16,362 --> 01:08:18,093
- Right. - The Duo Battle, I mean.

1580
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,203
- If they run with it... - It's about...

1581
01:08:20,203 --> 01:08:24,203
who has better teamwork.

1582
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:27,373
PRIME KINGZ's leader, Trix.

1583
01:08:27,543 --> 01:08:29,843
Which two dancers will dance as a duo...

1584
01:08:29,843 --> 01:08:33,013
in order to take down Bank 2 Brothers?

1585
01:08:33,713 --> 01:08:35,782
The two dancers to compete in the Duo Battle...

1586
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,253
are DOOR and Kyoyung Jr.

1587

1588

One more time.

Once more.

1593
01:08:53,532 --> 01:08:55,303
- Go, Kyoyung Jr. - Once more!

1594
01:08:55,303 --> 01:08:56,973
Will DOOR be able to win twice in a row?

1595
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:58,473
The Ace Battle?

1596
01:08:58,473 --> 01:08:59,873
DOOR, you show them.

1597
01:08:59,873 --> 01:09:01,772
Will you still be up for the Duo Battle afterward?

1598
01:09:01,772 --> 01:09:03,013
- Sure. - Of course.

1599
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:05,213
- You can do this. - I'll give you my energy.

(With the crew's support, DOOR competes in both rounds.)

1601
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:09,753
DOOR was going to compete in two rounds in a row.

1602
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:12,322
I thought, "Wouldn't he need some time to rest?"

1603
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,753
I was relieved once I heard his name.

1604
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,593
I'm going to win back to back.

Which two dancers will dance as a duo...

1607
01:09:21,593 --> 01:09:24,532
in order to take down PRIME KINGZ?

1608

The two dancers to compete in the Duo Battle...

1609
01:09:28,973 --> 01:09:30,473
Next is the Duo Battle.

1610
01:09:31,402 --> 01:09:33,942
I bet BUSYBE will compete. The sub leader and someone else.

1611
01:09:33,942 --> 01:09:36,772
Judging by their hairstyle today,

1612
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,942
- they must have something planned. - Right.

1613
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:40,213
All right.

1614
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:42,053
Aren't we like a nuclear weapon?

1615
01:09:43,682 --> 01:09:45,482
That's what we'll be like today.

1620

They look like twins.

1621
01:09:56,562 --> 01:09:59,232
No wonder their styles match today.

1622
01:09:59,532 --> 01:10:00,732
I like that.

1623
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,703
I doubt they're here to play.

I wasn't really nervous.

If they lose this round,

1629

the air will shift in PRIME KINGZ's way.

1630

We'll spin the bottle...

Don't get carried away, okay?

1638
01:10:33,703 --> 01:10:35,572
- I'll come back to you soon. - I'll be waiting for you.

1639
01:10:36,173 --> 01:10:37,173
Good luck.

1640
01:10:37,473 --> 01:10:39,803
We were going to win. All I have is confidence.

1641

Let's sway the boat back our way.

Trix, the leader of PRIME KINGZ, you lost last time.

Can you change the tide in favor of your team again?

I'll show you why an Asian became the first world champion...

He is unbeatable. He's totally unbeatable.

I wasn't in a good state mentally.

Only the last round of destiny remains.

2181

Would they win and move onto the next mission?

2182
01:37:02,953 --> 01:37:07,263
Or would they lose and leave with the title...

of the first dropout crew?

2184

The last round that will determine their destiny is...

Who's their rookie? It's Kyoyung Jr.

It's highly likely...

It'll be Gof versus you for the rookie battle.

2203
01:37:54,642 --> 01:37:56,703
One can never predict the result of battles.

We might lose,

2205

so we should prepare for Round Five.

is up to the rookies.

01:46:39,616 --> 01:46:42,815
will take on PRIME KINGZ's share and work hard.

2389
01:46:43,256 --> 01:46:46,385
And Bank 2 Brothers,

2390
01:46:46,385 --> 01:46:50,055
please don't make us think your heart is not in this.

2391
01:46:50,256 --> 01:46:52,696
Even from now on, show us that desperation...

2392
01:46:52,696 --> 01:46:56,235
you had today for PRIME KINGZ in every stage.

2393
01:46:56,366 --> 01:46:58,265
In the battle between rookies,

2394
01:46:58,866 --> 01:47:02,435
the youngest Gof saved the crew.

2395
01:47:02,605 --> 01:47:05,046
After the Dropout Battle,

2396
01:47:05,046 --> 01:47:08,746
PRIME KINGZ became the first crew to leave Street Man Fighter.

2397
01:47:08,746 --> 01:47:11,416
- No, it's okay. - Good job.

2398
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:13,416
- We're okay. - We're really okay.

2399
01:47:13,485 --> 01:47:15,116
- You did great. - It's okay.

2400
01:47:15,116 --> 01:47:17,326
- Good job. - Right.

2401
01:47:17,525 --> 01:47:19,456
After the Dropout Battle, PRIME KINGZ...

2402
01:47:19,456 --> 01:47:20,555
Great work.

2403
01:47:21,895 --> 01:47:26,666
(Feeling terrible, Kyoyung Jr. can't even lift his head up.)

2404
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:33,666
(The dancers are crying at the news of the first dropout crew.)

2405
01:47:33,706 --> 01:47:35,376
Jong Pil, you were fantastic.

2406
01:47:36,376 --> 01:47:38,675
(The dancers are sincerely showing respect to Kyoyung Jr.)

2407
01:47:38,675 --> 01:47:40,746
- The sect leader. - Good job.

2408
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:42,145
Nice, Sect leader.

2409
01:47:42,746 --> 01:47:44,946
Awesome job.

2410
01:47:45,586 --> 01:47:47,385
You did great. It's okay.

2411
01:47:47,756 --> 01:47:50,756
- Trix left. - Gof, the youngest...

2412
01:47:51,156 --> 01:47:53,425
He can't control himself or sort things out.

2413
01:47:54,055 --> 01:47:55,355
"If only I had won."

2414
01:47:55,355 --> 01:47:56,996
"If only we had ended it at the 5-on-5 battle."

2415
01:47:56,996 --> 01:47:58,395
(If only I had won and ended it at the 5-on-5 battle...)

2416
01:47:59,166 --> 01:48:02,635
(As their leader, Trix is feeling bad for the whole crew.)

2417
01:48:02,635 --> 01:48:03,765
That's what I thought.

2418
01:48:04,536 --> 01:48:06,006
I guess I'm not qualified to be a leader.

2419
01:48:07,235 --> 01:48:08,576
I'm not.

2420
01:48:09,336 --> 01:48:14,775
(Leader Trix can't look at his crew nor lift his head up.)

2421
01:48:15,116 --> 01:48:16,416
Why am I getting emotional?

2422
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:19,216
It really does make you emotional.

2423
01:48:20,515 --> 01:48:24,185
(Sad that a crew has to leave, the Fight Judges remain speechless.)

2424
01:48:24,256 --> 01:48:28,595
Thank you for showing all those performances...

2425
01:48:28,595 --> 01:48:30,425
throughout the missions.

2426
01:48:30,425 --> 01:48:33,725
Thank you so much. You did a great job,

2427
01:48:33,725 --> 01:48:36,866
and you fought well.

2428
01:48:37,966 --> 01:48:40,036
Like you have now,

2429
01:48:40,036 --> 01:48:43,536
please keep up the cool work.

2430
01:48:47,175 --> 01:48:49,946
I had a lot of mixed emotions.

2431
01:48:50,175 --> 01:48:54,855
The thought that I could no longer see...

2432
01:48:54,855 --> 01:48:56,256
PRIME KINGZ's performances...

2433
01:48:56,385 --> 01:49:00,956
made me question why this crew had to get dropped out first.

2434
01:49:01,126 --> 01:49:02,626
It made me awfully sad.

2435
01:49:04,696 --> 01:49:08,496
(Leader Trix can no longer hold back his tears.)

2436
01:49:08,796 --> 01:49:11,605
If we think about it positively,

2437
01:49:11,605 --> 01:49:14,836
we have gained a lot of attention from many people.

2438
01:49:15,175 --> 01:49:20,246
And we were able to show how cool krumping was.

2439
01:49:20,916 --> 01:49:25,246
Even from now on, we will walk toward a bright path.

2440
01:49:25,586 --> 01:49:28,286
(Counter always did all he possibly could in silence.)

2441
01:49:31,225 --> 01:49:32,885
It's a huge bummer.

2442
01:49:34,395 --> 01:49:35,696
But I learned a lot...

2443
01:49:37,626 --> 01:49:38,866
during this show.

2444
01:49:40,496 --> 01:49:42,095
Thank you very much.

2445

The leader of PRIME KINGZ, Trix,

2446
01:49:45,836 --> 01:49:47,775
please say a few final words.

2447
01:49:51,506 --> 01:49:54,116
It was short but long at the same time.

2448
01:49:55,315 --> 01:49:57,645
(Remembering the past, Trix can't continue his words.)

2449

While preparing for SMF for one month and a half,

2450
01:50:02,456 --> 01:50:05,225
I had a wonderful time...

2451

practicing with my crew members,

2452

laughing and crying together.

2453
01:50:11,095 --> 01:50:12,595
Thank you so much.

(Sympathizing with him, everyone claps and sheds tears.)

2455
01:50:19,065 --> 01:50:22,506
And I guess I was unqualified as a leader.

01:50:24,175 --> 01:50:28,275
(The leader blames himself for the unbelievable result.)

(The sadness of not being able to continue their journey)

(Relating to those feelings, the dancers shed tears together.)

2460

There's something I want to say to Trix.

2461
01:50:48,565 --> 01:50:50,635
You're the best battler...

2462
01:50:50,765 --> 01:50:52,366
and the best leader.

2463
01:50:52,735 --> 01:50:54,975
You're the leader...

2464
01:50:55,105 --> 01:50:58,645
who introduced PRIME KINGZ to the whole world.

2465
01:50:59,475 --> 01:51:00,946
I'd like to thank you for that.

2466
01:51:01,345 --> 01:51:05,616
And I hope you can show PRIME KINGZ to a lot more people.

2467
01:51:05,786 --> 01:51:07,855
I wanted to tell you this no matter what.

2468
01:51:08,815 --> 01:51:09,916
Great job!

I was upset.

They all look like they have a bad temper.

They all talked bluntly too.

But they all liked me and saw me in a good way.

2490

The fact that...

2491

there were people who cried for us when we were leaving...

We were very happy.

When I first entered,

my heart was pounding a lot.

(They joined Street Man Fighter with a pure passion for dancing.)

2520
01:53:17,246 --> 01:53:20,286
It was heart-fluttering, and I wondered...

2521
01:53:20,286 --> 01:53:22,685
if the public will like our dance.

2522
01:53:22,685 --> 01:53:24,586
We were always in the underground scene.

2523
01:53:25,685 --> 01:53:28,796
But now, we're out in the world.

2524

- Hello. - Hello.

2525
01:53:31,196 --> 01:53:34,536
A krump dancer becoming the main and getting noticed by people...

2526
01:53:34,536 --> 01:53:37,265
makes me think that the culture of krumping and the value of it...

2527
01:53:37,366 --> 01:53:39,006
are recognized.

2528
01:53:39,105 --> 01:53:42,275
So it's very meaningful.

2529
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:45,546
I felt like reaching my limit.

2530

I got to know that we could make it.

01:53:57,015 --> 01:53:58,485
I think...

2535
01:53:58,485 --> 01:54:00,826
I did my best to show what I had done for 14 years.

Regardless of the result,

2537
01:54:03,956 --> 01:54:06,225
if the public took notice of our dance,

2538

Weren't we cool?

(A stage that showed the crew, PRIME KINGZ)

2540
01:54:09,296 --> 01:54:10,496
then that's good enough.

There's no regret.

I did my best to come up with it, but he fixed everything.

2706
02:00:49,171 --> 02:00:51,600
That's how I feel.

2707
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:56,241
- I don't think... - Yes.

2708
02:00:57,411 --> 02:00:59,110
you're willing to take feedback.

2709
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:02,881
I couldn't put up with it anymore. I was very angry.

2710
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,921
Put yourself in my shoes.

2711
02:01:05,150 --> 02:01:06,491
I don't understand it.

2712
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:10,220
There's something I want to tell you. I was very upset.

2713
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:12,661
I was racking my brain for it.

2714
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:16,331
But why did everyone just go there?

2715
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:18,261
To be honest, you looked more like helpers.

2716
02:01:18,261 --> 02:01:20,671
They were my members, not helpers. But they were just sitting there.

2717
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:24,640
I really didn't understand what I was looking at.

2718
02:01:24,841 --> 02:01:26,110
Seriously.

2719
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:28,911
(The most-voted crew, YGX)

2720
02:01:31,541 --> 02:01:33,680
It feels like we're always standing at a cliff.

02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:34,980
