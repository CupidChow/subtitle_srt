- The last part was the best. - Way to go, Deukie.

326
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:18,578
(The clip of the Mega Crew Mission is available at The CHOOM.)

327
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,947
Hyunse!

328
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,677
- Hyunse. - Say "ho!"

329
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:23,917
Hyunse.

330
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:25,187
Well done!

331
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,687
We still did a great job!

332
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,088
- Great work. - Good job.

333
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:30,387
Right.

334
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,187
- But we really did a great job. - Right.

335
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,857
- Well done. - Great work.

336
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:40,468
Toward the end, everyone came out.

337
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,238
- Yes. - That hit the spot.

338
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:45,607
So this is the part Deukie directed, right?

339
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:50,377
He's the leader for a reason.

340
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,008
What I liked about their performance was...

341
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:55,647
that their choreography matched their outfit.

342
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:57,147
Right?

343
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,387
- It was conceptual. - The concept.

344
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:01,357
I really liked that moment. The basketball part.

345
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,588
- When he shot the ball. - Yes.

346
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:06,687
I remember a lot of great moments from this one.

347
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,328
- There were many wow factors. - Yes.

348
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:11,697
Right. They did a great job of bringing their concept...

349
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,228
to life. Look what it says here.

350
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:15,068
"Missions are a mere process leading us to be the winners."

351
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,468
"YGX will score no matter what."

352
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:19,268
When he ran over to the platform and dunked the ball,

353
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:21,937
it exploded that moment and struck a chord with me.

354
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,437
All right.

355
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:27,578
I will now reveal YGX's scores...

356
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:28,748
from the Fight Judges.

357
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:32,518
They must be so nervous. Oh, no.

358
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,588
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

359
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:38,028
I'm sorry. But could I say something?

360
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:40,728
Sure.

361
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,157
(The atmosphere turns cold at his sudden request.)

362
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,228
Actually, I lacked...

363
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:48,038
in many areas when we were preparing for this mission.

364
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,538
Despite knowing my weaknesses,

365
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:53,508
my crew members did an amazing job.

366
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,778
So I'm very proud to present our performance.

367
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:01,218
Whatever result we may face, I will respectfully accept it.

368
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:02,647
That's so cool.

369
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:03,988
You have my respect.

370
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:07,957
That was so cool!

371
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,117
You did a great job!

372
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,328
(He finally smiles as other crews cheer for him.)

373
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,828
You're the boss!

374
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,697
(He finally smiles as other crews cheer for him.)

375
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,828
All right. I will now reveal the director...

376
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:22,538
with the highest score from YGX first.

377
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,508
Why am I getting nervous?

378
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,038
I'm so nervous for other crews. How will I check our crew's scores?

379
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:29,278
Gosh. I'm so nervous.

380
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:30,437
(Holding hands)

381
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,647
I'm so nervous.

382
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:32,877
(YGX is extremely nervous.)

383
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:35,447
Here's the score.

384
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,417
I think it might be Hyunse.

385
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:42,457
(Scores from the Fight Judges, Hyunse: 365)

386
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:44,758
- Hyunse! - Hyunse!

387
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:47,228
Hyunse! Let's go!

388
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,998
This dancer, Hyunse,

389
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:52,028
changed the mood of the choreography at opportune times.

390
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:54,867
Deukie and Dony have strong styles.

391
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,897
He's like a bridge between them,

392
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,968
so both of them can shine. I think that's his role.

393
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,538
I see. His part included the running and making a shoot.

394
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,907
- He directed that part too. - Yes.

395
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,677
He must have had a clear picture of what he wanted...

396
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,578
- Right. - and what his role was.

397
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,318
Gosh, Hyunse.

398
00:20:11,318 --> 00:20:12,917
I told you. Hyunse is the real deal now.

399
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:17,288
I don't believe that I got the highest score...

400
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:18,657
all on my own.

401
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:21,927
The rest of our crew did an amazing job.

402
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:24,197
And they definitely helped me stay strong.

403
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:26,728
So I think that might be why...

404
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:29,738
I was able to get the highest score.

405
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:30,937
Thank you.

406
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,707
You did well.

407
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:34,677
(Hyunse faces a rather intense celebration from his crew.)

408
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:36,637
But he really did well. Right?

409
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:37,778
You were amazing.

410
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:39,947
He knew when to go strong and take a breather.

411
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,417
- Right. His formation was good too. - And it was clear. Yes.

412
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,748
(Even other crews recognize Hyunse's directing skills.)

413
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,387
As for the next scores,

414
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:49,058
we will reveal Dony and Deukie's scores...

415
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,687
at the same time.

416
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:52,957
Why them, of all people?

417
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:54,998
They are twin brothers.

418
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:57,927
The scores of the three directors, Dony, Hyunse, and Deukie,

419
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,328
were combined.

420
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,867
We will now reveal YGX's final score from the Fight Judges.

421
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,738
(Their final score will be revealed.)

I can't breathe.

426
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,847
It would be crazy if their scores are the same.

427
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:18,788
- Then they are total twins. - Yes. If their scores are the same.

428
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,857
Please.

431

The sub leader, Dony, received 304 points.

434
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:42,937
Gosh. The intro was weak.

435
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:44,808
To be honest, I didn't know...

436
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,347
- what they were doing. - This was...

437
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:49,677
For the intro,

438
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:53,018
he wanted to add a lot of stuff. It would have been better...

439
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:54,387
if he made it neat.

440
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,288
The concept was basketball. And as for mime dancing,

441
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,687
it was difficult to pick up details from the moves.

442
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:02,528
I hope their dance moves were neater.

443
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,697
Then the intro would have stood out. That's a bit disappointing.

444
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,798
Hyunse of YGX received...

445
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:10,637
the highest score.

446

And the sub leader, Dony, received the lowest score.

The difference between two scores is 61 points.

I'm the one ranked last.

Dony did a great job.

I don't think I failed him as a leader.

I felt a sense of guilt.

So I don't want Dony...

461

I don't want him to feel bad...

about getting the lowest score.

During the last mission, the Global K-dance Mission,

466
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:08,697
they withdrew from competing. So they received...

a humiliating score of 35 points from the Fight Judges.

- That was humiliating. - With that mission,

470

we disappointed a lot of people including the judges.

471

So I don't think anyone looked forward to our performance.

But we tried our best to raise your expectations.

473
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,778
With the Global K-dance Mission, we weren't able to showcase...

our style.

475
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:33,947
I wanted to show them who we were with this mission.

476

I wanted to show them what real hip-hop was.

for their Hidden Cards, I'm really getting excited.

00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,107
I started dancing when I was in fourth grade...

486
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:00,748
after watching Rivers Crew perform.

487
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,917
Physicx does this Drag the Waist move.

488
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:04,988
It's his signature move.

489
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:06,748
No one can copy that.

490
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:10,117
They're the best b-boying crew everyone acknowledges.

491
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,228
They marked a new era in the hip-hop scene.

492
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:16,397
And these OG dancers are still actively performing too.

493
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:19,028
I'm sure a lot of people recognize OHBODY...

494
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:20,597
from "Be Mbitious."

495
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,137
(OHBODY performed on "Be Mbitious.")

496
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:25,538
I got a call from Wootae too. But when JRoc told me their concept,

497
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:26,607
I could feel my heart getting warm.

498
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,437
I have never performed with this many hip-hop dancers...

499
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:30,847
on the same stage like this.

500
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:32,847
Being a part of the first was meaningful to me.

501
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,518
We're writing history now.

502
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:36,218
Having them on our team is like having an entire army.

503
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:39,018
I wanted to show a real hip-hop performance with them.

504
00:24:41,617 --> 00:24:42,687
Nice to meet you.

505
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:44,758
Nice to meet you.

506
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:47,157
We had to divide the songs into different parts.

507
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:49,298
The three of us will direct a part each.

508
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,328
I'll be directing the intro.

509
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,268
- Okay. - And JRoc will be directing...

510
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:54,538
the middle part.

511
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:56,798
- He'll be directing the last part. - BUSYBE.

512
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,308
We'll begin with my intro.

513
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,637
It's what we do best.

514
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:02,607
That is how I made the choreography.

515
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:06,347
So it will be nice if you all can feel that hip-hop vibe.

516
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,218
(Everyone feels enthusiastic after hearing Feeldog's plan.)

517
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:09,617
(Proud)

518
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,947
I wasn't worried about Feeldog.

519
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:14,488
I knew he would have no problem preparing something cool.

520
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:16,617
But I was a bit worried about BUSYBE.

521
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:19,328
(When the crews were deciding their directors)

522
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:21,927
I'm not sure about this part.

523
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:23,758
This is what we want to show.

524
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,127
- The next part is brand new. - Right.

525
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,568
Let me think a little bit more for that part.

526
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:32,407
(JRoc thought long and hard about the important ending part.)

527
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,167
I'm torn about this part.

528
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:37,978
(Glancing)

529
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,248
- Do you think you can do it? - Yes.

530
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,377
Then the Kid Milli part will go to BUSYBE.

531
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:44,488
(BUSYBE becomes a director.)

532
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,917
He doesn't have a lot of experience directing.

533
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,218
So I felt bad for giving him pressure...

534
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,788
by putting him in charge of the ending.

535
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:56,427
But I also wanted him to grow through this mission.

536
00:25:56,697 --> 00:26:00,568
It's my first time preparing something for a mega crew...

537
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:03,568
and I also felt pressure because it was the ending part.

538
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:08,207
But I will still do my best to create something that is like me.

539
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,177
- Are you next? - Yes.

540
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:14,177
We're going to start by doing the jack.

One, two, three, and then it ends.

00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,427
(Eyes shaking)

547
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,097
I think you need to organize it.

548
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,397
- This was "one." - Yes.

549
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:32,127
Then it should be "7 and 8."

550
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:33,828
- But this is "2." - If this is "1."

551
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,137
Hold on. One, two...

552
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:36,637
I was just listening to the music...

553
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:38,268
so I didn't really count.

554
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:40,768
That is why I just used onomatopoeias.

555
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,207
You just said you didn't count...

556
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,308
so I don't think you know what you even did.

557
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:49,478
I'm not good at counting and teaching others the numbers.

558
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:51,417
And because of that, nothing was really that organized.

559
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:55,258
For the part where we move forward,

560
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:56,617
there are a lot of things that are offbeat...

561
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:57,988
but you didn't explain any of them.

562
00:26:57,988 --> 00:26:59,328
Everything is on the beat right now...

563
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,457
but it should be off the beat.

564
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:03,127
That is how everyone understood it.

565
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:08,238
Since everyone around me kept pressuring me,

566
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:09,538
I had a meltdown.

567
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:12,667
He was sweating because he was flustered.

568
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,637
How much did you guys do?

569
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:17,008
He taught us all the moves, but we still need to...

570
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,607
memorize everything and it needs to be more organized.

571
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:21,218
- Can we organize the first part? - Yes.

572
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:23,748
It was looking pretty dangerous for us.

573
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:26,347
The other members also felt worried.

574
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,357
My head felt like it was going to burst.

575
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,417
To be honest, everything's not completely organized even now.

576
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:31,988
So I need to keep working.

577
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:36,097
(The day of the final rehearsal)

578

(Who is Bank 2 Brothers' worst director?)

580
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:47,637
The worst director?

581
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:49,607
- The last song, for me. - Me too.

582
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:50,907
The last part felt slightly lacking.

583
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:53,207
They weren't in sync for the third part.

584
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,318
It looks like they were in a rush while preparing that part.

585
00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:56,778
It has the least number of formations.

586
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:58,387
So then it's BUSYBE.

587
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:02,318
I think we should say the worst director is BUSYBE.

588
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:03,518
(BUSYBE received 4 votes as the worst director.)

589

I felt sorry to my crew members.

I'm the sub leader, but was that really the best I could do?

I was ashamed to face my members.

594

I was only a nuisance.

And I wasn't of any help.

596

Everyone in that room...

00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,008
was probably well aware of why...

we received those 4 votes.

607

and that the hidden cards were used well in the middle part.

609

It was just another reminder, in an official way,

that everything happened because of me.

it was probably harder on the other members.

Why is he trying to overcome everything on his own...

We're all making the performance together.

Honestly, compared to the other parts,

640
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:24,127
the ending was hard because everyone had to be in one place...

641

and it had a lot of formations.

00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:13,787
I'm jealous.

807
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:17,388
We better be prepared. You never know what's going to happen.

808
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:18,857
You never know. Just in case.

809
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:22,557
In the last Global K-dance Mission,

810
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:25,667
this crew ranked high in the online public evaluation.

811
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:30,497
I will now reveal 1MILLION's scores from the Fight Judges.

812
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:32,107
The time has come.

813
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:34,638
- 1MILLION! - 1MILLION!

814
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:37,537
1MILLION's directors are their two suns.

815
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:40,178
Leader Baek Koo Young. Sub leader Choi Young Jun.

816
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:41,377
Two suns?

817
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:42,848
Dangun of choreography.

818
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:44,647
And Yumeki.

819
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:48,218
1MILLION's executive director Baek Koo Young.

820
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,118
I heard you had a rough passage across the Mega Crew Mission.

821
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,127
Really?

822
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:58,868
With the sub leader Young Jun...

823
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:01,598
- Well... - A conflict?

824
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,198
Really?

825
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:04,767
Is that what happened?

826
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,678
My pride hit rock bottom.

827
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,377
I'm in pain.

828
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,718
I'm at risk.

829
00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:17,948
This has never happened before.

830
00:41:18,888 --> 00:41:21,287
(What happened to 1MILLION?)

831
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:24,488
It's the Mega Crew Mission.

832
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:26,287
Mega Crew.

833
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,557
- Cast at least 30 people. - A hidden card?

834
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:29,557
You confident?

835
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:31,397
- Okay. - Yes.

836
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:33,327
I feel confident.

837
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,537
Just a year ago, I performed with 99 people.

838
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:40,267
(Baek Koo Young directed 99 people's performance.)

839
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:42,437
I've even directed 101 people.

840
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:46,747
Performing with a large group is normal to me.

841
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:48,548
I think it won't be a problem.

842
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:51,247
I'm Part Director Yumeki.

843
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:52,417
Nice to meet you.

844
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:54,618
Yumeki has...

845
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:58,827
a high dancing quality.

846
00:41:59,528 --> 00:42:02,557
It may not be difficult for him,

847
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:06,127
but it may be difficult for helpers to follow.

848
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:11,238
(The choreography isn't in sync.)

849
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:15,678
I think I should fix that.

850
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:18,437
If people...

851
00:42:18,437 --> 00:42:21,948
can be in sync like a machine, you should keep it.

852
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:24,818
If not, you should change it.

853
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:28,147
I should change it to something easier.

854
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:31,658
He helped me understand with accurate feedback.

855
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:35,528
With the help of experienced dancers,

856
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:38,997
I'll be able to make a nice group choreography.

857
00:42:39,897 --> 00:42:42,397
Let's rehearse from the top.

858
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:43,968
One, two, three, four.

859
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:45,738
(Koo Young watches Young Jun's choreography carefully.)

860
00:42:45,738 --> 00:42:48,577
(The group choreography continues in perfect order.)

861
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:54,348
Young Jun has a lot of experience.

862
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:55,917
He has brilliant ideas.

863
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,548
He came up with the choreography I wanted.

864
00:42:59,448 --> 00:43:01,687
I thought the part before the dance session...

865
00:43:02,017 --> 00:43:04,158
should be fixed.

866
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:08,997
Before you start the choreography,

867
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:11,557
you should add rough moves...

868
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:14,167
to go with the song.

869
00:43:14,368 --> 00:43:16,267
- Do you mean small details? - Yes.

870
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:18,198
- Yes. Rough moves. - So...

871
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:21,607
I agree with Koo Young's opinion...

872
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:23,537
that there could be a better way.

873
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,178
If he tells me to change it, I'll change it.

874
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:26,807
One must obey his leader.

875
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:30,017
Let's practice the intro.

876
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:32,088
I'm going to pile a tower of dead bodies.

877
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:35,287
When I first listened to this song, I thought of the outlaw in the wild.

878
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:37,758
But how do I express the outlaw in the wild?

879
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:40,327
I wanted the last man...

880
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:44,497
standing on top of a lot of dead people.

881
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,497
Stay down like this.

882
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,738
You look like a real dead body.

883
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,068
Nice.

884
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:54,638
It's magnificent.

885
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:56,178
Thank you, everyone.

886
00:43:56,707 --> 00:43:58,008
We can add a few more people.

887
00:43:58,008 --> 00:44:00,377
(Koo Young approaches the dancers.)

888
00:44:00,548 --> 00:44:02,747
I want to change this.

889

(Koo Young suggests a revision in Young Jun's intro.)

890
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:07,647
If he faces down instead of looking at the ceiling,

891
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:09,457
it'll look more like he's standing on dead bodies.

892
00:44:09,457 --> 00:44:10,787
You're right.

893
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:15,057
Only people on top of the dead body tower will rehearse.

894
00:44:15,057 --> 00:44:18,098
Put your body here and stay like this.

895
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:19,667
(He reflects Koo Young's opinion and revises his intro.)

896
00:44:19,997 --> 00:44:21,897
Everything is ready.

897
00:44:22,238 --> 00:44:23,468
Let me take a video of it.

898
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:26,037
It's gotten bigger.

(Inhaling)

901

I know you're working very hard,

902
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:34,548
but let's try it again.

903
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:37,678
(Young Jun is exhausted by continuous revision.)

904
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,787
Guys. Can you get up for a moment?

905
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,488
Can you move over here?

906
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:42,888
Okay. Good.

(Koo Young starts rebuilding the dead body tower.)

908

While experimenting,

909
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:48,798
it consumed a lot of time.

910
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:51,227
I think I changed the intro like ten times.

911
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:55,327
It was frustrating to death.

912
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:59,838
Can people at the back show me?

913
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:02,607
The dancers at the back should come to the side.

914
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:03,707
Okay.

915
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:09,247
I thought long and hard about it.

916
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:12,417
"Am I being ignored? Am I not being respected?"

917
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:15,488
Every opinion I made got cut off.

918
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:18,118
So it was hard for me to proceed,

919
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,528
nor did I want to.

920

You know, I just had an idea.

921

If we are coming out from the piles of bodies,

922
00:45:23,627 --> 00:45:26,428
how about we break through them?

923
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:29,437
Oh, isn't that realistically impossible?

(Nodding)

925
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:33,508
How about we wear the hat and slide?

926
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:35,437
How about putting the head this way?

927
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:39,207
After those beats,

928
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,678
should I take Meki with me?

929
00:45:40,678 --> 00:45:42,278
- No. - No? So without him?

930
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:44,548
If it was going to be like this,

931
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:48,388
he shouldn't have made me a director.

932

I have a limit to how much I can accept it,

933
00:45:53,388 --> 00:45:55,287
but not that day.

934
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:58,658
Let me drop out as the director of the Mega Crew Mission.

935
00:45:58,658 --> 00:46:00,428
I can assist you or something.

936

Honestly, I'm terribly upset.

I'm walking on eggshells after every move.

938

It's wearing me out.

939

Please don't get it the wrong way.

940
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:17,577
I had no bad intentions.

941
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:20,147
I'm the type to bluntly say...

942
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:23,218
what's not good and wouldn't work.

943

It's only natural Young Jun would have been offended.

944
00:46:26,428 --> 00:46:28,158
I would have been, too, if I were him.

945
00:46:28,557 --> 00:46:31,897
But just because Young Jun would get upset,

946
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:36,098
I couldn't give him the thumbs up and proceed with it.

947
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:40,307
That was how much I wanted to pull off the performance...

948
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:41,638
and practice well.

949
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:44,838
Something like this.

950
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:49,077
I tried hard to be cold-headed when making judgements.

951
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:52,077
In a way, those moments...

952
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:55,718
would have made the members uneasy.

First off, I'm sorry if I made you upset.

954

I'll be more careful from now on.

955
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:07,968
As you meet and team up with many people,

956
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:10,298
you are bound to have conflicts.

957
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:15,468
I feel bad expressing my feelings,

958
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:17,178
and it sure makes us uncomfortable.

959

961

It's because we have different wavelengths,

not because we're bad people.

I think it'll be very high.

I'm guessing 1,100.

Maybe even until 1,200.

but it was seamless.

I think the formation...

1472
01:10:59,598 --> 01:11:02,167
Because it came from the corner, and then they changed...

to a front line and a back line,

If we get eliminated now, I might regret it a lot.

I want to see where this could lead us.

By the way, We Dem BOYZ seemed pretty shocked.

I doubt We Dem BOYZ even thought about going to the Dropout Battle.

01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:09,280
You can do it, Hyunse.

1916
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,250
I know I keep saying this.

1917
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:14,820
Let's stick to our style.

1918
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,420
- Our style. - Let's just do what we do.

1919
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,259
On second thought, why can't we beat We Dem BOYZ?

1920
01:30:21,389 --> 01:30:23,929
I couldn't wait to dance. I couldn't wait to battle them.

1921
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,729
I'm about to tear up all of a sudden.

1922
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:27,130
- If we lose, then we lose. - Right.

1923
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:28,630
We're We Dem BOYZ.

1924
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,500
- Right. - Let's do what we do.

1925
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,570
I love you.

1926
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:33,000
Let's do our best.

1927
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:36,200
Let's show them, beat them, and prove it to everyone.

1928
01:30:37,009 --> 01:30:38,410
Before we begin the Dropout Battle,

1929
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:41,380
let me introduce the judges who will evaluate the battle...

1930
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:42,639
that these two crews' fate depends on.

1931
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,880
I give you BoA, Eunhyuk, and Woo Young.

1932
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:47,880
(Fight Judges, BoA, Eunhyuk, and Woo Young enter.)

1933
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,219
We get to see them up close.

1934
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,349
She's beautiful as always.

1935
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,420
The day has come again.

1936
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,689
Yes, it has.

1937
01:30:57,889 --> 01:30:59,389
- Good luck. - Let's go!

1938
01:30:59,389 --> 01:31:00,700
The first crew, YGX.

1939
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,399
- Let's go! - Go for it!

1940
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:03,429
(Cheering)

1941
01:31:03,429 --> 01:31:04,469
(Screaming)

1942
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,729
Hey!

1943
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:07,269
X!

1944
01:31:07,269 --> 01:31:08,339
Good luck.

1945
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:12,370
The second crew, We Dem BOYZ. Come up to the fight zone.

1946
01:31:13,839 --> 01:31:16,040
Who are we? We Dem BOYZ!

1947
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,679
- Good luck! - Let's go!

1948
01:31:17,809 --> 01:31:18,979
You got this!

1949
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,580
YGX versus We Dem BOYZ.

1950
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,519
As soon as the battle is over,

1951
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:27,120
one of the crews will leave the Fight Club.

1952
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,219
(One of the crews must leave the Fight Club.)

1953
01:31:28,219 --> 01:31:29,920
Gosh. This is breaking my heart.

1954
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,929
Oh, my gosh.

1955
01:31:32,429 --> 01:31:33,830
Fight Judge BoA.

1956
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,460
These two crews are on the verge of getting eliminated.

1957
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,099
Please say a word of encouragement.

1958
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:40,299
Here's what I think.

1959
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:43,139
No crews can stay strong or weak.

1960
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:45,769
With this Dropout Battle,

1961
01:31:45,769 --> 01:31:49,639
no one can anticipate the variables and how they will change the result.

1962
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:51,809
That's the nature of the Dropout Battle on our show.

1963
01:31:51,979 --> 01:31:56,420
I hope you can put on a great battle that leaves no regrets.

1964
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:57,420
Good luck.

1965
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:58,519
- Good luck. - Okay!

1966
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:00,990
Let's do this!

1967
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:03,860
This is a battle between choreography crews.

1968
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:07,259
These two crews were in the center of spotlight.

1969
01:32:07,259 --> 01:32:09,099
I never thought we would be seeing them so soon.

1970
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,130
Street Man Fighter.

1971
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:14,439
I will now announce the rules of the Dropout Battle.

1972
01:32:14,969 --> 01:32:18,410
The Dropout Battle will be a best of five.

1973
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:20,740
As for Round One which will start off the battle,

1974
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,880
it will be a 3-on-3 battle, the Triple Battle.

1975
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:24,610
Round 2 will be a 1-on-1 Leader Battle...

1976
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:26,009
where their pride is at stake.

1977
01:32:26,009 --> 01:32:28,620
Next, Round Three will be the Hidden Battle.

1978
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:30,450
There's no limit...

1979
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:32,089
on the number of dancers, the songs, or use of props.

1980
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:34,290
They can freely battle it out with their dance routines.

1981
01:32:34,519 --> 01:32:36,860
Round Four is the Ace Battle.

1982
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:40,500
Round 5 is a 5-on-5 Group Battle.

1983
01:32:40,559 --> 01:32:44,429
The 2 crews can show us group performances for 40 seconds.

1984
01:32:45,299 --> 01:32:47,370
The 1st battle is 3-on-3?

1985
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,899
We've never seen a 3-on-3 battle yet.

1986
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:51,469
I guess there's no Duo Battle now.

1987
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:54,339
All right. We will now begin...

1988
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,149
the second Dropout Battle of Street Man Fighter!

1989
01:32:57,149 --> 01:32:59,649
(It's time to eliminate a crew for the second time.)

1990
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:00,979
They must be nervous.

1991
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:04,349
- Good luck! - You can do it!

1992
01:33:04,349 --> 01:33:05,849
You can do it!

1993
01:33:05,849 --> 01:33:07,089
Looking good!

1994
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:09,219
This isn't the last time.

1995
01:33:09,689 --> 01:33:11,490
Just think of it as a chance to showcase what we do.

1996
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:12,559
Yes.

1997
01:33:12,559 --> 01:33:15,259
- YGX. Yes! - YGX. Yes!

1998
01:33:15,259 --> 01:33:16,530
(YGX gets ready as they encourage each other.)

1999
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,630
- Let's be cool. - Don't lower your guards.

2000
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:19,929
It's okay even if we mess it up.

2001
01:33:20,299 --> 01:33:22,000
- Let's just have some fun. - Okay.

2002
01:33:22,099 --> 01:33:23,769
In 1, 2, 3.

2003
01:33:24,009 --> 01:33:25,070
Good luck!

2004
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,380
Round One's battle has gotten intense...

2005
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,479
three more times than before.

2006
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,809
It's the 3-on-3 Triple Battle.

2007
01:33:32,849 --> 01:33:34,620
The two crews already decided on the order of the dancers.

2008
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:36,920
They will proceed with the 3-on-3 battle.

2009
01:33:37,019 --> 01:33:39,549
(Which 3 dancers will participate from each crew?)

2010
01:33:39,549 --> 01:33:41,019
Vata, you're the leader of We Dem BOYZ.

2011
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,519
Tell us the trio of dancers...

2012
01:33:43,519 --> 01:33:45,630
who will beat YGX on behalf of your crew.

2013
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:50,870
The first round is really important.

2014
01:33:51,099 --> 01:33:52,170
In Gyoo and Kamel?

2015
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,439
I think they will do everything they can do to beat YGX.

2016
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:59,009
For the Triple Battle, I think it will be Vata, In Gyoo, and Kamel.

2017
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:00,910
Vata, In Gyoo, Kamel.

2018
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:03,710
They are the three main members of their team.

2019
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:06,479
They could also take the responsibility...

2020
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,179
because they were the directors.

2021
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:13,549
The triple combination that will win for We Dem BOYZ is...

2022
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:18,990
Vata, Insun, and Hae Sung.

2023
01:34:20,429 --> 01:34:23,700
(We Dem Boyz's triple combination: Vata, Insun, and Hae Sung)

2024
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,269
A popper and a b-boy.

2025
01:34:25,269 --> 01:34:26,530
Is the b-boy coming out?

2026
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,969
Insun used to be a b-boy,

2027
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:31,670
and Hae Sung can also imitate those moves...

2028
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:34,380
so I think they were trying to use those techniques.

2029
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:37,009
I don't think people would've expected that combination.

2030
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:39,179
We have to take the offensive...

2031
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:40,920
for the first round...

2032
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,450
so it'll be those who have larger physiques and can create big moves.

2033
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:44,849
Me, Insun,

2034
01:34:44,849 --> 01:34:46,320
- and Hae Sung. - Okay.

2035
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,490
Let's go.

2036
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,820
- We'll go old school. - And kill it.

2037
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,589
For the Triple Battle,

2038
01:34:51,589 --> 01:34:54,500
I wanted to show old school hip-hop.

2039
01:34:54,729 --> 01:34:58,030
I wanted to show that we can do original hip-hop.

2040
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:00,000
These two haven't been shown a lot thus far.

2041
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,269
You're right.

2042
01:35:01,269 --> 01:35:04,670
I wish they could make an impact this time.

2043
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,910
Okay, YGX's leader, Deukie.

2044
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:10,009
What is YGX's triple combination...

2045
01:35:10,009 --> 01:35:12,549
that will make We Dem BOYZ lose?

2046
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,679
I thought the twins would come out...

2047
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:19,719
and maybe Hyunse would join them.

2048
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,960
Their character as twins is strong.

2049
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,130
And I think it will look more fascinating...

2050
01:35:24,259 --> 01:35:26,330
when there are less people.

2051
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,929
I think their triple combination will be...

2052
01:35:28,929 --> 01:35:31,030
Deukie, Dony, and Hyunse.

2053
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,670
That's exactly what I thought too.

2054
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:36,439
For YGX, it'll probably be Hyunse and the Deuk-Don twins.

2055
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:37,839
That's the most probable.

2056
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:43,040
The three people who will start our winning streak for us are...

2057
01:35:45,979 --> 01:35:47,880
- Deukie, Hyunse, and DOW. - Yes.

2058
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:51,849
(YGX's triple combination: Deukie, Hyunse, and DOW)

2059
01:35:51,849 --> 01:35:52,849
(That's surprising.)

2060
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:55,990
I don't think I've seen DOW a lot up until now.

2061
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:57,889
- I did not expect that. - Seriously.

2062
01:35:57,889 --> 01:35:59,790
- An unexpected combination. - That's a surprise.

2063
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:02,460
I know how good Hyunse and DOW are.

2064
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,000
I wanted to show everyone that we can do a good job...

2065
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,500
even if the twins are not together.

2066
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,700
I wanted to lead the battle with them...

2067
01:36:09,799 --> 01:36:12,110
and show proper dancing.

2068
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,880
The combinations for the Triple Battle are now complete.

2069
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,280
The bottle...

2070
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,920
will decide who goes first.

2071
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,149
YGX will go first. We Dem BOYZ will go next.

2072
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,719
I'm nervous for them.

2073
01:36:27,049 --> 01:36:29,019
I feel more nervous than I was for our battle.

2074
01:36:29,019 --> 01:36:30,660
Watching makes me more nervous.

2075
01:36:31,089 --> 01:36:34,030
We wanted to have the most fun...

2076
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,299
during the Triple Battle...

2077
01:36:35,299 --> 01:36:37,160
so I thought we should win the round.

2078
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,330
We'll win no matter what.

2079
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:40,370
Let's not be shaken and stay calm throughout.

2080
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,769
They are standing at a crossroads of survival or elimination.

2081
01:36:42,769 --> 01:36:45,939
We'll go ahead and get started with the Triple Battle.

YGX's routine was super tight.

But since it's a routine, it will probably affect the results.

If it was freestyle, there would be no messing up.

We Dem BOYZ...

- The rest... Okay. - They won one for us.

2182
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:27,450
- It's okay. - It was just a mistake.

- We have to accept it. - It's okay. Seriously.

I felt so sorry.

2185
01:41:32,089 --> 01:41:33,490
Since there are five rounds,

2186
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:35,899
I should've helped create a winning atmosphere.

2187
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:38,670
If I danced without feeling pressure,

2188
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:40,370
I think we could have won.

2189
01:41:41,769 --> 01:41:45,610
The most important aspect of the Triple Battle...

2190
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:48,179
is the teamwork between the three dancers.

2191
01:41:48,179 --> 01:41:51,710
Getting a move wrong is a big factor that needs to be considered.

2192
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:54,149
Just considering the overall performance,

2193
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:57,149
I had no choice but to side with We Dem BOYZ for this round.

2194
01:41:57,149 --> 01:42:00,349
More than any round, I was able to feel...

2195
01:42:00,349 --> 01:42:03,660
the heavy burdens and pressure of the dancers.

2196
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:07,559
I couldn't help but vote for We Dem BOYZ...

2197
01:42:07,559 --> 01:42:09,700
because they did a lot of floor work.

2198
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:12,299
It could've affected them in a negative way...

2199
01:42:12,299 --> 01:42:14,399
because it's easy for floor moves to look messy.

2200
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:15,769
But it was so clean.

2201
01:42:15,769 --> 01:42:18,740
That is what grabbed my attention more.

2202
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,710
We Dem BOYZ beat YGX...

2203

It is a battle that he can't just enjoy.

2230
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,630
He's probably feeling so much pressure.

2231
01:43:20,729 --> 01:43:23,339
Deukie has to do a good job, so he probably feels pressure.

2232
01:43:23,339 --> 01:43:24,740
We'll find out who will probably win after this round.

2233
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:26,910
If We Dem BOYZ wins,

2234
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,740
- YGX... - Is in danger.

2235
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,009
Deukie's hands are trembling.

2236
01:43:31,809 --> 01:43:33,009
He's trembling.

2237
01:43:33,009 --> 01:43:34,519
(Deukie's hands are trembling from the anxiety.)

2238
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:36,320
How do you feel about the Leader Battle?

2239
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,589
- I'm honestly nervous. - Well, of course.

2240
01:43:38,589 --> 01:43:41,219
But I feel like this nervousness will disappear...

2241
01:43:41,389 --> 01:43:42,990
once I step on the stage.

2242
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:46,389
Don't worry. I will do my part as the leader this time.

2243
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:49,030
Vata could never lose.

2244
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:51,700
I can't let my guard down. I practiced freestyle yesterday...

2245
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,729
and if I become stiff, I can't do much.

2246
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:55,240
So I need to relax.

2247
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,570
But I'm not sure what will happen.

2248
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:58,269
Don't feel pressure. Just have fun.

2249
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,040
It's pressuring me.

2250
01:44:00,969 --> 01:44:02,979
(Under tension and pressure, who will go first in the Leader Battle?)

2251
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:07,080
Vata of We Dem BOYZ will go first.

2252
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,750
And Deukie of YGX will go second.

2253
01:44:11,189 --> 01:44:13,490
It's my responsibility...

2254
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:14,889
for dragging my team to the Dropout Battle.

2255
01:44:14,889 --> 01:44:17,160
So I felt a lot of pressure about the Leader Battle.

2256
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,130
I wanted to win badly.

2257
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:21,599
Now, let's begin...

2258
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:23,729
the breathtaking Leader Battle.

2259
01:44:23,729 --> 01:44:25,170
Let's go, Vata.

2260
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:27,500
- Let's go. - Go.

2261
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,839
Okay.

2262
01:44:28,839 --> 01:44:30,240
Go, Vata.

2263
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,509
- You can do it. - Let's go!

01:44:31,509 --> 01:44:32,870
Let's go!

2265

You guys ready?

how he broke down the rhythm...

or the way he moved according to the sound.

2348

That was very witty.

is unbelievable.

The taller you are,

the harder it is to control your body.

2353

He was also good at...

expressing the music.

2358
01:49:12,219 --> 01:49:14,089
And the way you trembled in the middle of the music.

2359
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:17,259
I bet it wasn't easy to dance to the song...

2361

I liked your expressions.

I got the feeling...

2365
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,839
you were out of the routines.

01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:31,269
After trembling,

2367
01:49:31,269 --> 01:49:32,870
your moves overlapped quite a lot.

2368
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:35,040
If you had a more diverse routine,

2369
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,309
it would've lasted to the end.

2370

I agree with her.

2372

I approve of you.

- You were great. - You were wonderful.

2384

We Dem BOYZ won again in Round Two.

Out of five rounds, We Dem BOYZ got two wins.

the Dropout Battle ends immediately.

2389

will become the second worst crew...

2390

The next round must be...

2392
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:25,059
so much pressure.

2393
01:50:25,059 --> 01:50:26,660
- It's a Hidden Battle. - That's close.

2394
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:27,929
This could be their last round.

2395
01:50:27,929 --> 01:50:29,099
They must turn the tables in the Hidden Battle.

2396
01:50:29,099 --> 01:50:30,530
If they don't turn the tables in the Hidden Battle...

2397
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:31,670
- It's over. - Exactly.

2398
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:33,969
Round Three is...

2399
01:50:33,969 --> 01:50:35,500
the Hidden Battle.

2400
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:37,899
It'll be a free routine battle...

2401
01:50:37,899 --> 01:50:41,339
where you can use anyone, any music, and any props.

2402
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,910
Vata. Who's going to participate...

2403
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:45,750
in the Hidden Battle from your crew?

2404
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:50,049
The members participating in the Hidden Battle are...

2405
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:52,790
Vata will be in the lead.

2406
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:56,219
Everyone except for me.

2407
01:50:56,219 --> 01:50:57,559
(Everyone in We Dem BOYZ except for the leader is participating.)

2408
01:50:57,559 --> 01:50:59,089
I didn't expect that.

2409
01:50:59,189 --> 01:51:00,389
That's a good strategy.

2410
01:51:00,389 --> 01:51:01,799
- I know. - They prepared the Hidden Battle...

2411
01:51:01,799 --> 01:51:03,059
without Vata.

2412
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:05,870
If they lose, they'll become Vata and the boys.

2413
01:51:05,899 --> 01:51:07,030
A lot of people say...

2414
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:09,000
Vata and the boys or Vata BOYZ.

2415
01:51:09,099 --> 01:51:11,399
You'll all join the Hidden Battle without me.

2416
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:12,469
Okay.

2417
01:51:12,469 --> 01:51:14,210
We'll get a spotlight after a while.

2418
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:17,080
We're second to no one.

2419
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,210
The seven of us are outstanding.

2420
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:21,950
The leader of YGX, Deukie.

2421
01:51:22,019 --> 01:51:25,750
Who's going to participate in the Hidden Battle from your crew?

2422
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:29,019
The members participating in the Hidden Battle are...

2423
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:32,429
I think the whole crew will participate.

2424
01:51:32,429 --> 01:51:33,729
- All seven? - Yes.

2425
01:51:33,929 --> 01:51:36,200
I can't wait to find out who's going to participate.

2426
01:51:36,759 --> 01:51:39,200
The members participating in the Hidden Battle are...

2427
01:51:39,729 --> 01:51:41,399
Junsun, DOW,

2428
01:51:41,399 --> 01:51:43,399
Hyunse, and Junho.

2429
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:44,910
They're four Middle Class members.

2430
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:48,110
I wanted to show...

2431
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:50,679
that my Middle Class members are good.

2432
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:53,509
I was nervous...

2433
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,380
because I didn't know what they prepared.

2434
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:58,620
Let's decide who'll go first.

2435
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:02,219
YGX will go first.

2436
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,360
We Dem BOYZ will go second.

2437
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,630
YGX has...

2438
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:09,830
a lot of performance experience.

2439
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:11,870
If they're free...

2440
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:12,969
to use any props,

2441
01:52:12,969 --> 01:52:15,240
you never know.

2442
01:52:15,299 --> 01:52:16,339
I can't wait.

2443
01:52:16,339 --> 01:52:18,469
I wonder what YGX will use for their prop.

2444
01:52:19,139 --> 01:52:22,110
Although we can use props, we prepared a dance.

2445
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:24,009
Don't be swayed...

2446
01:52:24,009 --> 01:52:25,580
in the Hidden Battle.

2447
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,950
Let's do what we're good at.

2448
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:31,049
We wanted to stick to nature of the battle.

2449
01:52:31,179 --> 01:52:33,219
We wanted to show our dance.

2450
01:52:33,219 --> 01:52:34,689
The props don't matter.

2451
01:52:34,689 --> 01:52:35,960
It may backfire.

2452
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,259
Let's begin the unyielding men's battle.

2453
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:40,790
You guys ready?

2454
01:52:41,799 --> 01:52:43,000
Fight.

2455
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,559
- Don't be nervous. - Good luck.

2456
01:52:44,559 --> 01:52:46,099
Go, YGX.

2457
01:52:46,429 --> 01:52:48,099
No three losses.

2458
01:52:48,339 --> 01:52:50,399
We must win this time.

2459
01:52:54,839 --> 01:52:56,240
(This is it.)

2460
01:52:58,349 --> 01:53:00,110

2464

I never wanted to end it here.

2465
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:16,599
I clenched my teeth.

2466
01:53:17,299 --> 01:53:19,070
Okay. Go.

2467
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,870
There was nothing but choreography.

2468
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:23,439
There was no killing move.

2469
01:53:34,979 --> 01:53:39,349
Two, one. Switch. We Dem BOYZ.

2470
01:53:39,389 --> 01:53:41,189
- What's that? - What's that prop?

2471
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:42,589
They brought a tape measure.

2472
01:53:42,589 --> 01:53:43,960
(We Dem BOYZ prepared a prop.)

2473

What are they doing?

2478
01:53:52,099 --> 01:53:54,229
Don't be shaken by it.

2479
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:56,500
This is what you do in the Hidden Battle.

2480
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,099
Let's show them. Let's prove ourselves.

2481
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:00,170
We're this good even without Vata.

2482
01:54:01,469 --> 01:54:02,479

Their idea was great.

2497
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,349
The energy the number of people gives is different.

- You're right. - Personally,

this was still a battle.

2500
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:25,729
So facing the front wasn't that great.

2501
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:28,290
We should have faced the front too.

- No. - We did good.

Currently, We Dem BOYZ is two wins ahead of YGX.

The Dropout Battle is the best of five.

So if We Dem BOYZ wins this round as well,

YGX has to leave.

your choreographies.

02:05:02,366 --> 02:05:05,137
Actually, I'm very excited and nervous at the same time.

2713
02:05:05,137 --> 02:05:08,847
I can't wait to see the choreography you come up with.

2714
02:05:08,907 --> 02:05:10,147
Keep trying to the end.

2715
02:05:10,147 --> 02:05:13,746
And I hope you can do everything you guys want to do with this song.

2716
02:05:14,017 --> 02:05:17,487
I can create a routine no one can come up with.

2717
02:05:17,487 --> 02:05:19,216
That's what 1MILLION does best.

2718
02:05:19,216 --> 02:05:22,727
It might be between us and We Dem BOYZ.

2719
02:05:23,057 --> 02:05:25,697
Creating choreography for songs is our expertise.

2720
02:05:25,697 --> 02:05:26,826
We should win first place.

2721
02:05:27,466 --> 02:05:29,937
Who knows? We might surprise them and win this mission.

2722
02:05:30,397 --> 02:05:33,567
The crew that gets chosen by the artist...

2723
02:05:33,567 --> 02:05:36,407
will get a chance to direct the music video of the new song.

2724
02:05:36,536 --> 02:05:39,407
And the crew Rain chooses...

2725
02:05:39,746 --> 02:05:44,116
and the crew the public chooses will receive bonus points.

2726
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:48,546
Which crew of the six crews will earn the bonus points?

2727
02:05:51,116 --> 02:05:53,286
(The semifinal mission begins at last.)

2728
02:05:53,286 --> 02:05:55,956
(Which crew has won over Rain's heart?)

2729
02:05:56,097 --> 02:05:57,357
(It's right up his alley.)

2730
02:05:57,357 --> 02:06:01,897
(Their pride is at stake on this choreography mission.)

2731
02:06:01,897 --> 02:06:04,237

2732

2733
02:06:12,876 --> 02:06:14,506

2734
02:06:14,506 --> 02:06:16,517

2735
02:06:16,517 --> 02:06:18,176
(Reacting right away)

2736
02:06:18,777 --> 02:06:20,216
"Octagonal Pavilion."

2737
02:06:20,347 --> 02:06:22,017
I see. He's describing himself as domestic?

2738
02:06:22,017 --> 02:06:23,857
- He's Korean. - He's Korean.

2739
02:06:23,956 --> 02:06:25,586
Something about the song reminded me of our country.

2740
02:06:25,586 --> 02:06:27,487
Wouldn't it look cool if we dress up like noblemen?

2741
02:06:27,487 --> 02:06:28,956
The noblemen who have fun in the Joseon Dynasty?

2742
02:06:29,326 --> 02:06:32,057
What about this for our concept? A king and his subjects.

2743
02:06:32,157 --> 02:06:34,796
I don't think he will like the choreography...

2744
02:06:34,796 --> 02:06:36,137
unless it's really interesting.

2745
02:06:36,137 --> 02:06:37,697
We need a dance move that stands out.

2746
02:06:37,937 --> 02:06:39,836
How should we describe Octagonal Pavilion?

2747
02:06:40,137 --> 02:06:41,666
Octagonal Pavilion.

2748
02:06:41,836 --> 02:06:43,107
Like this.

2749
02:06:44,006 --> 02:06:45,237
"Domestic blood."

2750
02:06:45,237 --> 02:06:46,376
He must love blood.

2751
02:06:46,546 --> 02:06:48,447
Why don't we start with this? Since blood is mentioned.

2752
02:06:48,807 --> 02:06:49,876
(Pounding)

2753
02:06:50,046 --> 02:06:52,017
The blood is dripping.

2754
02:06:52,176 --> 02:06:54,546
No other crew but us can pull this off.

2755
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:57,116
None of the crews will take this approach.

2756
02:06:58,416 --> 02:07:00,387
Our choreography will be a hit.

2757
02:07:03,496 --> 02:07:04,597
Hello, guys.

2758
02:07:04,597 --> 02:07:06,426
- Hello. - Hello.

2759
02:07:06,426 --> 02:07:09,666
Every crew will show me their dance moves for the highlight.

2760
02:07:09,666 --> 02:07:10,996
I can't wait to find out...

2761
02:07:10,996 --> 02:07:13,807
about the kind of weapon you brought for this mission.

2762
02:07:13,807 --> 02:07:17,506
I think every crew's choreography will have a different style.

2763
02:07:17,506 --> 02:07:18,706
So I'm so excited.

2764
02:07:18,777 --> 02:07:20,307
We're excited too.

2765
02:07:20,746 --> 02:07:23,116
I was really nervous to get feedback from him.

2766
02:07:23,176 --> 02:07:25,176
I want him to check out our routine and give us helpful feedback.

2767
02:07:25,216 --> 02:07:28,847
All right. We will begin now.

2768
02:07:28,847 --> 02:07:29,987
(Rain will now give feedback for the highlight part.)

2769
02:07:30,256 --> 02:07:31,557
Just have fun.

2770
02:07:31,786 --> 02:07:32,926
I'm so nervous.

2771
02:07:32,926 --> 02:07:33,987
I'm nervous.

2772
02:07:33,987 --> 02:07:35,357
Today is really important.

2773
02:07:35,926 --> 02:07:38,826
(The first crew to present their choreography is EO-DDAE.)

2774
02:07:38,926 --> 02:07:41,267
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2775
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:45,937
The overall lyrics sounded confident and bold and reminded us...

2776
02:07:45,937 --> 02:07:46,937
of self-esteem.

2777
02:07:46,937 --> 02:07:49,036
So we did our best to express these ideas through our moves.

2778
02:07:50,477 --> 02:07:51,637
(The day when Rain's new song was disclosed)

2779
02:07:51,637 --> 02:07:55,407
(EO-DDAE listens to Rain's new song.)

2780
02:07:55,407 --> 02:07:59,546
His song didn't sound like it belonged to a specific genre.

2781
02:07:59,546 --> 02:08:02,746
I thought we could make it look cool by incorporating our style.

2782
02:08:02,746 --> 02:08:05,857
Considering all the choreographies he's done so far,

2783
02:08:05,857 --> 02:08:08,557
it included a lot of jazz moves.

2784
02:08:08,557 --> 02:08:10,597
And that matches our style.

2785
02:08:10,657 --> 02:08:13,727
I think our choreography might suit his style the best.

2786
02:08:13,866 --> 02:08:15,597
Our style and his style might match well.

2787
02:08:15,597 --> 02:08:17,836
(How did EO-DDAE interpret Rain's new song?)

2788
02:08:17,937 --> 02:08:19,937
- I'm curious about their routine. - Yes.

2789
02:08:20,067 --> 02:08:21,206
Let's see.

2790
02:08:36,046 --> 02:08:37,357
I think he'll like that.

2791
02:08:39,826 --> 02:08:41,626
That's totally their style.

2792
02:08:51,866 --> 02:08:53,237
(They crushed it.)

2793
02:08:53,437 --> 02:08:55,067
That was neat

2794
02:08:55,407 --> 02:08:56,607
They did well. It was clean.

2795
02:08:56,676 --> 02:08:58,036
Their movements are so graceful.

2796
02:08:59,076 --> 02:09:00,176
(Rain shares his feedback.)

2797
02:09:00,176 --> 02:09:03,876
I think you guys did the formation and movements...

2798
02:09:03,876 --> 02:09:05,416
you knew how to do best.

2799
02:09:05,416 --> 02:09:07,017
Things you guys had always been good at.

2800
02:09:07,017 --> 02:09:08,786
But...

2801
02:09:08,947 --> 02:09:11,216
I wish you guys followed the lyrics a bit more.

2802
02:09:11,517 --> 02:09:15,326
I wanted to see some kind of key movement during your routine.

2803
02:09:15,326 --> 02:09:16,756
That was a bit disappointing.

2804
02:09:17,557 --> 02:09:20,727
Actually, we stayed away from taking that approach.

2805
02:09:20,727 --> 02:09:22,326
It's not that we didn't know how to do that.

2806
02:09:22,326 --> 02:09:24,296
So we can give him what he wants.

2807
02:09:24,296 --> 02:09:28,807
I think it will be easier for us to revise our choreography.

They looked like neat-looking office workers.

2812
02:09:40,616 --> 02:09:43,956
Let me tell you what we focused on when we created the choreography.

2813
02:09:44,786 --> 02:09:45,887
(They watched Rain's past videos and analysed his preferences.)

2814

- This part. Totally. - Right.

2815
02:09:48,326 --> 02:09:50,357
When you look at his performances, you can tell he focuses more...

2816
02:09:50,357 --> 02:09:51,897
- The choreography. - on choreography than formation.

2817
02:09:51,897 --> 02:09:53,067
- Right. - Yes.

2818
02:09:53,166 --> 02:09:54,626
From watching his videos, we learned that...

2819
02:09:54,626 --> 02:09:56,126
he liked expressing the lyrics as they were.

2820
02:09:56,437 --> 02:09:58,697
We watched the parts where his choreography...

2821
02:09:58,697 --> 02:10:00,506
expressed the lyrics in a one-dimensional manner.

2822
02:10:00,666 --> 02:10:02,036
Octagonal Pavilion.

Other than mentioning of Octagonal Pavilion,

2828
02:10:12,176 --> 02:10:13,487
the lyrics go, "A, B, O, AB."

2829
02:10:13,487 --> 02:10:15,746
I thought about how we could express "blood."

2830
02:10:15,887 --> 02:10:18,887
So I put my fingers on where the artery runs.

3035
02:19:26,966 --> 02:19:29,237
To be honest, if Rain does our dance,

3036
02:19:29,237 --> 02:19:32,936
he'll look very cool.

3037
02:19:32,936 --> 02:19:35,106
- That'll be the new style. - Right.

3038
02:19:35,106 --> 02:19:37,446

"That's incredible. I want to do that."

Put on gloves, and dress sexy yet hip.

3046
02:19:52,257 --> 02:19:53,427
With our choreography,

3047

you'll look cool and witty.

I'm looking forward to it.

That's why he's wearing red.
