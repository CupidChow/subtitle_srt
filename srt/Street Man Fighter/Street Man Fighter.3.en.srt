They switched up a lot of things...

825

so it made me so confused.

826
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,529
There was a lot of movement in the formations and the choreography...

took away a lot of our stamina,

This situation itself is just tough.

833

We should've chosen Mbitious's choreography.

It would've been more comfortable for everyone.

835

837

I think we're going to become the main dancers no matter what.

838

01:08:29,129 --> 01:08:31,969
I was already on edge, but he added on to that stress.

1606
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,799
Fumbling the stick left me traumatized.

1607
01:08:36,669 --> 01:08:39,739
I was telling the others about the moves and formation...

1608
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,638
and about how we should dance as a group,

1609
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:43,878
but he kept twirling the stick which got on my nerves.

On and on.

1611
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:47,478
It almost drove me crazy.

1612
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:49,378
My head was close to exploding at the time,

1613
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:52,189
and he stressed me out to the maximum.

1614
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,249
I could see the stick twirling inside my head.

Enough is enough, right?

1626
01:09:20,549 --> 01:09:23,979
Twirling this is a blast. What do I do?

I put it back down thinking I could be wrong.

1634
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:43,098
Then, a lot of things went through my mind.

1635
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:45,139
Why was I chosen as a potential worst dancer?

I first took his choreography, and now this.

Of course I was angry.

- Of course it drove you crazy. - I mean...

1653
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,709
It really stressed me out.

1654
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:27,409
It seemed wiser to choose the ones that are in my way...

He should've been less cheeky. That was his problem.

The entire choreography seems different though.

A lot of the moves were modified.

1707

MOOD DOK must've changed them up a lot.

MOOD DOK is allowed to stay in the center, right?

He was in charge of the formations.

I feel like he was considerate of others.

Jung Woo, you're entering a little too early.

First of all, I don't think I am the worst dancer.

1768
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,849
It's either because they are...

1769

Then I can look down on everybody here.

1773

I'll prove myself in the battle.

(That he's not the worst dancer)

1775

Okay, let's take it easy and beat him,

1776
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:55,799
but keep your guard up.

1777

The main dancer Mood Dok has chosen...

1778

Kamel of WDBZ and Kim Jung Woo of Mbitious.

1779
01:17:02,379 --> 01:17:04,508
The two dancers will prepare for the battle.

1780

We thank everyone from the Rookie class.

1781
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,349
I did feel a little wronged,

1782

but I thought this was for the better. I'll dance well.

1783
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,418
I have a chance to beat this opponent.

1784

In many ways, I knew...

1785
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,159
that Jung Woo would become the worst dancer.

1786
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,799
I truly think that I will win.

I'm not sure of the beat...

1798

Everyone was dumbfounded.

They didn't even know...

how to count the beat or what they were saying!

"Let's just freestyle by doing this."

1805
01:18:02,169 --> 01:18:03,900
That's how they made that.

1806

One, two, three, and four.

1807

That's why it was hard for all of us to follow along.

Then, shall we go straight into the sequence?

1814

- Yes. - Okay.

(Everyone is flustered because of the main dancer who seems lost.)

1820

Because they are battlers,

they can't help but lack in their ability...

1822

to do performances...

1823

Two, six...

1825
01:18:49,849 --> 01:18:52,250
It was difficult to construct...

Honestly, it was so frustrating.

1829

How should we do this?

1835

He just had to come up with a sequence, right?

1836
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:19,049
If it were Jinwoo and me, we would've done it in ten minutes.

for mega crews with over 30 members.

That's why it was frustrating. It was so frustrating.

Can we try that move a little slower?

Can Quanz move to the front row?

1854

Yes, I think you can move forward.

Where should we start?

- Shall we start from here? - Let's do that.

01:22:21,259 --> 01:22:22,400
Don't be upset.

1922
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:27,129
I'm going to answer diligently.

1923
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,740
To be honest, I was dumbfounded by the result.

1924
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:31,669
I was really dumbfounded.

1925
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:32,740
(Deegun and Giseok are listening to everything.)

1926
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,210
It's okay.

1927
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,250
Then, we'll monitor the Middle 2 Class' dance video.

1928
01:22:39,349 --> 01:22:41,209
- I'm looking forward to this. - I'm curious!

1929
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:42,378
I wonder how it turned out.

1930
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:44,349
- I'm so nervous. - I don't think I can watch it.

1931
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:45,718
(He closes his eyes.)

1932
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:47,489
Let's go!

1933
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:50,219
(How does the Middle 2 Class' dance video look?)

1934
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,839
("100 Degrees Celsius" produced by Giriboy)

1935
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,919
(The Middle 2 Class performance song is available on Melon.)

1936
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,798
(They all pause.)

1937
01:24:38,799 --> 01:24:41,628
How can they not have any dance sequence?

1938
01:24:41,629 --> 01:24:44,199
They have hardly any choreography or dance sequence.

1939
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,008
I think they have never done this before.

1940
01:24:47,009 --> 01:24:48,709
That's why they really struggled.

1941
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:49,910
I can see that.

1942
01:24:50,179 --> 01:24:52,949
If you don't have a lot of experience in choreography,

1943
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:54,848
- Right. - it can be a real headache.

1944
01:24:54,849 --> 01:24:56,279
Even so,

1945
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,049
something should have stood out in their dance moves, then.

1946
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:01,019
This move is disappointing.

1947
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:04,518
After they came down, I was so frustrated.

1948
01:25:04,519 --> 01:25:06,629
Why couldn't I see them?

1949
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:08,728
Who is the one with red hair?

1950
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,728
- He's from Mbitious. - Oh, Jin Woo.

1951
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:14,798
There was one person who stood out despite what was going on,

1952
01:25:14,799 --> 01:25:16,499
and that was Jin Woo.

1953
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,369
- It wasn't his hair color? - No, it wasn't.

1954
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,070
He had excellent body control.

1955
01:25:20,309 --> 01:25:22,268
But it's very disappointing.

1956
01:25:22,269 --> 01:25:24,110
It is disappointing.

1957
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,179
(After watching the dance video where all the dancers participated)

1958
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,410
They definitely struggled with their facial expressions.

1959
01:25:28,509 --> 01:25:30,219
They struggled with their facial expressions.

1960
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:33,718
Since they're street battlers, they lacked in their expressions.

1961
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:36,289
You can definitely tell that...

1962
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:39,429
Deegun and Giseok haven't done many music videos.

1963
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:40,759
Good job.

1964
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,598
(Deegun can't raise his head because of the bad performance.)

1965
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:45,329
It felt a little dull to us.

1966
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,900
Maybe it's because of our directing.

1967
01:25:47,129 --> 01:25:49,570
When I saw the video, I was very disappointed in it.

1968
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,668
Giseok and Deegun must discuss with your crew members...

1969
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:57,339
to decide the second worst dancer.

1970
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,309
Show me the board. Don't we have a board?

1971
01:26:03,019 --> 01:26:04,519
(The members of Bank 2 Brothers discuss carefully.)

1972
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,388
Gosh.

1973
01:26:06,389 --> 01:26:08,888
They won't pick us, will they?

1974
01:26:08,889 --> 01:26:11,460
That would mean they want to fight against other street dancers.

1975
01:26:12,019 --> 01:26:14,159
I don't think it'll be you two.

1976
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,558
They won't choose you.

1977
01:26:15,559 --> 01:26:17,159
If they choose you guys,

1978
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,929
- Call them out? - we have to call them out.

1979
01:26:19,169 --> 01:26:22,569
Giseok and Deegun of B2B, please announce...

1980
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:26,210
the second potential worst dancer of Middle 2 Class.

1981
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:29,839
The second potential worst dancer is...

1982
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,178
There was nothing that really made me feel...

1983
01:26:32,179 --> 01:26:33,649
like any crew is deserving of the worst dancer title.

1984
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,619
Because everyone worked hard...

1985
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,320
- not to become the worst dancer. - Not to become the worst dancer.

1986
01:26:39,389 --> 01:26:41,219
If I were to think of one more crew...

1987
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:44,019
I'm not sure who they'll choose.

1988
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:48,088
There was no one who did poorly.

1989
01:26:48,089 --> 01:26:51,329
Anyone can be chosen.

1990
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:54,329
I think B2B will be clean about it.

1991
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,939
They'll probably choose who they actually think was the worst.

1992
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:59,098
All of the B2B members are pretty honest.

1993
01:26:59,099 --> 01:27:02,878
But B2B could've thought of it in an innocent way at first...

1994
01:27:02,879 --> 01:27:05,308
and then thought of a strategy later.

1995
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:07,409
If they pick a team that is good,

1996
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:09,979
it'll probably be us or Mbitious.

1997

- I think so too. - No, it's not.

But even if they do choose us, we'll beat them.

We can beat them.

But honestly, they weren't even able to organize the choreography...

I can't think of any other reason...

why he chose Dony other than him being afraid...

- of Dony. - Right.

2044

Because Dony never even made a mistake.

This is what I thought when he chose you.

Did he choose you...

2047

And there's a chance that they will choose us.

2052
01:29:22,179 --> 01:29:26,048
I considered the possibility of MOOD DOK picking Jung Woo...

2053
01:29:26,049 --> 01:29:29,389
so I picked YGX as the potential worst dancer.

They picked each other.

2055

And in the Sub Leader Class, Wootae of Mbitious...

chose Dony of YGX.

Wootae kept pausing because his choreography wasn't finished.

2071

He made us stand there...

01:30:24,139 --> 01:30:25,280
Well...

2078
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,649
We will stand...

2079
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:28,910
(He keeps buffering because he didn't finish his choreography.)

2080
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:30,619
- For this part, - Yes.

2081
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:33,388
Should the people on this side use our left foot first?

2082
01:30:33,389 --> 01:30:34,519
Well...

2083
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:37,159
One, two...

2084
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,859
He didn't have his counts organized,

2085
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:40,359
and he taught it differently every time.

2086
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,790
I was worried about the quality.

2087
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:45,160
Doing everything quickly doesn't mean good results.

2088
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,529
- After we do this part, - Yes.

2089
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:49,939
Are there any moves with the hands?

2090
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,968
I think I'll probably lower them slightly.

2091
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:54,939
I think it'll be better for you to clearly decide right now.

2092
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,678
Are we facing forward at the end or at an angle?

2093
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,308
Three and four and.

2094
01:30:59,309 --> 01:31:01,749
In Gyoo and Knucks should come in, counting 1 and 2.

2095
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,119
- Yes, you should come in earlier. - When you walk.

2096
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,048
You need to count from one in order to come in correctly.

2097
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:07,819
Honestly, any teacher...

2098
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:09,619
can just teach the moves.

2099
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:11,218
You have to teach more stuff.

2100
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:13,628
Kick and step. The right foot seems better.

2101
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:15,289
- Just do this together. - Let's just take this out.

2102
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:17,428
One, two, move, seven, and eight.

2103
01:31:17,429 --> 01:31:19,570
(Boom and stop)

2104
01:31:19,629 --> 01:31:21,168
Yes. I like this.

2105
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:22,298
- I like it as well. - Okay.

2106
01:31:22,299 --> 01:31:24,899
What do you think of moving in like this?

2107
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,239
Let's organize it like this.

2108
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,008
- Then we're doing it like this. - Okay.

2109
01:31:29,009 --> 01:31:30,879
I organized everything when he wasn't there.

2110
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:33,808
I mean, he didn't even have his choreography prepared.

2111
01:31:33,809 --> 01:31:36,320
Will he really feel upset for me helping him out a little?

2112
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:41,218
(Choi Young Jun leads the practice with his counting.)

2113
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:43,190
Nice. We got it down.

2114
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,258
Yes. It looks better now.

2115
01:31:46,259 --> 01:31:47,489
The main dancer...

2116
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,798
- should be Young Jun. - I know, right?

2117
01:31:49,799 --> 01:31:53,529
I took on his responsibility, so I guess...

2118
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,299
he could feel upset about that.

2119
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,739
This is just my honest opinion.

2120
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:01,138
When choreographers want to do well, they become slow.

2121
01:32:01,139 --> 01:32:04,008
We all know Wootae has a lot of experience.

2122
01:32:04,009 --> 01:32:06,308
So the fact that he wasn't able to finish his choreography...

2123
01:32:06,309 --> 01:32:07,749
just shows how desperate he was to do well.

2124
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,478
Because he has to make decisions...

2125
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:12,449
from the many options that he made to do well.

2126
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:16,460
To be honest, I'm a huge fan of Yoon Mi Rae.

2127
01:32:16,519 --> 01:32:19,790
So it was such an honor for me, and I was excited.

2128
01:32:19,889 --> 01:32:22,329
"I can't take this lightly. I need to do well," is what I thought.

2129
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,258
That is why I needed more time.

2130
01:32:24,259 --> 01:32:26,029
Does In Gyoo not act up?

2131
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:27,500
No, I'm the villain right now.

2132
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,000
We can't be chosen as the worst dancer.

2133
01:32:31,099 --> 01:32:33,339
- We can't. - We can't be chosen.

2134
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:37,009
Even if you have a problem, you have to keep it in.

2135
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:40,449
Young Jun keeps... I like how he has a lot of ideas, but...

2136
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,848
- He expresses his own ideas? - He keeps acting like the leader.

2137
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,049
Really?

2138
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,820
Say goodbye to him then.

2139
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:51,219
Who will Wootae of Mbitious, the main dancer...

2140
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:54,389
of the Sub Leader Class, pick as the potential worst dancer?

2141
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,699
Please decide after watching the dance video...

2142
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:58,229
and discussing it with your crewmates.

2143
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,468
Then we will now watch the dance video...

2144
01:33:01,469 --> 01:33:02,598
of the Sub Leader Class.

2145

Let's go! Sub Leader Class!

2146

Let's go. I'm excited.

2147

- I'm excited. - Let's go!

2148
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,638
I'm curious.

2149
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:14,249
- I'm excited. - I know. How sexy will they be?

2150
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,579
I'm excited to see your abs.

- I can never guess. - We'll have to see.

2206

I have a feeling they'll choose In Gyoo.

2207

- Oh, In Gyoo... - I think they'll choose In Gyoo.

2208
01:36:57,570 --> 01:36:59,439
Would they just rule him out because they have a bad relationship?

2209
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,268
Wootae gave In Gyoo a good position.

2210

- That was a fake. - It's a fake.

If they have to pick two,

2212

one of them might be In Gyoo.

2213
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,178
You'll be one of the two.

2214
01:37:10,179 --> 01:37:12,119
- I'll be one of them. - Just relax.

2215
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,388
You might as well get ready for the battle.

2216
01:37:13,389 --> 01:37:15,289
You'll be the potential worst dancer for sure.

2217
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:16,689
They'll pick you because they hate you.

2218
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:18,620
I was getting ready for it.

2219
01:37:19,019 --> 01:37:20,189
I have no idea.

2220
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,959
I don't know what's in Wootae's head.

01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,659
No one can read what Wootae's thinking.

So, J HO was like, "I can never predict that darn guy."

(I can never predict that darn guy.)

I'd better warm up.

I think I'll have to do a freestyle.

2226
01:37:35,339 --> 01:37:37,040
We narrowed it down to...

2227

In Gyoo?

2228
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:42,049

I'm nervous.

We'll see.

Both the directing and choreography are amazing.

Hoya, look at the camera.

and totally focused on it.

2419

And he's the type to dance powerfully.

2420
01:46:47,364 --> 01:46:49,364
So he can be unnoticeable.

was for everyone to enjoy it together.

- as the worst crew. - Yes.

to eliminate us first.

I want to eliminate Mbitious as soon as possible.

2460
01:48:24,494 --> 01:48:27,903
Because of the previous show, they have many fans.

2461
01:48:27,904 --> 01:48:31,204
So during the popularity vote, they will get a good score.

You can even make us push the car from behind.

I'm serious.

Think of me as your friend.

I don't want to become the worst dancer,

- Let's go. - Let's go.

2500
01:49:57,693 --> 01:49:59,153
If he moves to the side,

2501
01:49:59,154 --> 01:50:01,092
take a step to the side in this formation.

2502

Keep that in mind. I'm leaving you guys again.

2510
01:50:21,183 --> 01:50:22,643
I made the latter part.

01:50:22,784 --> 01:50:24,414
- What? - You're fast.

2512

- "Here and here." - "Here and here."

2514
01:50:28,523 --> 01:50:30,893
He taught us as soon as he made the choreography.

2515
01:50:31,193 --> 01:50:33,392
He smartly divided it...

2516
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:34,893
and sorted it out quickly.

2517
01:50:35,093 --> 01:50:38,463
Confidence is the most important when directing others.

2518
01:50:38,464 --> 01:50:41,503
So I led them smoothly with confidence.

2519
01:50:41,504 --> 01:50:44,273
That was why the choreography came out quickly.

2520
01:50:44,834 --> 01:50:48,143
And I'm the youngest. Everyone is older than me.

2521
01:50:48,343 --> 01:50:50,704
But they listened to me well and didn't have any complaints.

2522
01:50:50,843 --> 01:50:53,213
- That's it. - Okay.

2523
01:50:53,214 --> 01:50:55,783
- Let's speed it up a bit. - Okay.

2524
01:50:55,784 --> 01:50:57,714
- Should we start at three? - Okay.

2525
01:50:57,784 --> 01:50:59,353
- Should we try again? - Okay.

2526
01:50:59,954 --> 01:51:01,154
I need to listen to Vata.

2527
01:51:01,383 --> 01:51:02,954
If not, he'll pick me as the worst dancer.

2528
01:51:03,584 --> 01:51:07,023
Because Mr. Vata is the main dancer.

2529
01:51:07,223 --> 01:51:10,023
When he told me to stand at a spot, I did right away.

2530
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:12,392
I tried my very best not to...

2531
01:51:12,393 --> 01:51:14,263
get on Vata's nerves.

2532
01:51:14,864 --> 01:51:18,534
I can't see any flaws. Everyone's giving them their best.

2533
01:51:18,803 --> 01:51:21,504
So it's going to be hard to pick the worst dancer.

Everyone's great. It's a close call.

2537
01:51:28,983 --> 01:51:31,583
Everyone's attitude during the practices is amazing.

2538
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,213
- Right. - The leaders are all humble.

2539
01:51:33,214 --> 01:51:36,823
So I tried to find a dancer who didn't fit our vibe.

- We're backup dancers. - It's nice.

2544
01:51:43,223 --> 01:51:45,593
- Okay. - There are even blankets.

2545
01:51:45,893 --> 01:51:47,534
- Okay. - I have this.

2546

"Potential worst dancer."

It came out of nowhere. I don't know the reason either.

2550
01:51:55,643 --> 01:51:58,043
I don't think I didn't memorize the choreography...

2551
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:00,674
or danced weirdly.

2552

02:00:13,973 --> 02:00:15,503
- Gosh. - Of course.

2710
02:00:15,504 --> 02:00:17,543
- He's scary. - 2face is amazing.

2711
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:20,272
- 2face rips people off. - Right.

2712
02:00:20,273 --> 02:00:22,243
PRIME KINGZ rips people off.

2713
02:00:22,244 --> 02:00:24,483
He rips faces into two.

2714
02:00:24,983 --> 02:00:28,382
The battle to decide the worst dancer...

2715
02:00:28,383 --> 02:00:30,723
will start now.

2716
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:35,262
Each potential worst dancer of each crew in the worst dancer battle...

2717
02:00:35,263 --> 02:00:39,533
will dance for 40 seconds.

2718
02:00:39,534 --> 02:00:42,503
The worst dancer who loses in this battle...

2719
02:00:42,504 --> 02:00:45,732
will drive his crew to be eliminated...

2720
02:00:45,733 --> 02:00:48,244
by getting 50 points deducted.

2721
02:00:49,074 --> 02:00:50,703
(The Fight Judges' seats are empty.)

2722
02:00:50,704 --> 02:00:51,874
The judges aren't here.

2723
02:00:52,244 --> 02:00:54,373
Let me introduce the Fight Judge of today.

2724
02:00:54,374 --> 02:00:55,383
Is there a judge?

2725
02:00:55,784 --> 02:00:56,784
There seems to be a judge.

2726
02:00:57,383 --> 02:00:59,254
Today's special judge is...

2727
02:00:59,454 --> 02:01:00,512
Drum roll.

2728
02:01:00,513 --> 02:01:01,824
(Who's the special judge?)

2729
02:01:02,254 --> 02:01:03,254
Rain?

2730
02:01:03,883 --> 02:01:05,994
(Drum rolling)

2731
02:01:08,794 --> 02:01:09,823
You all.

2732
02:01:09,824 --> 02:01:11,423
(The special judges are you all.)

2733
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:13,193
- What? - It's us.

2734
02:01:13,433 --> 02:01:15,932
After the battle, get your Worst Chip...

2735
02:01:15,933 --> 02:01:20,773
and vote for the crew who you think as the worst dancer on the board.

2736
02:01:20,973 --> 02:01:23,972
But the two crews that participated in the battle...

2737
02:01:23,973 --> 02:01:25,414
have no voting rights.

2738
02:01:25,513 --> 02:01:28,743
The dancer of the crew who gets more Worst Chips...

2739
02:01:28,744 --> 02:01:31,783
will be the final worst dancer.

2740
02:01:31,784 --> 02:01:33,812
This might be unfair.

2741
02:01:33,813 --> 02:01:35,923
People might vote for the crew that they're checking in.

2742
02:01:35,924 --> 02:01:38,324
- Strategically, the votes... - Yes.

2743
02:01:38,454 --> 02:01:41,494
It might get strategic and not depend on their skills.

2744
02:01:42,063 --> 02:01:45,132
The worst dancer battle to determine...

2745
02:01:45,133 --> 02:01:47,692
the real worst dancers will start now!

2746
02:01:47,693 --> 02:01:52,102
The worst dancer in Middle 1 Class will be determined first.

2747
02:01:52,103 --> 02:01:54,703
PRIME KINGZ versus Mbitious.

2748
02:01:54,704 --> 02:01:56,203
It's a two-on-two battle.

2749
02:01:56,204 --> 02:01:57,743
Enjoy it.

2750
02:01:57,744 --> 02:01:59,544
- Tease them. - You're shameless.

2751
02:01:59,744 --> 02:02:01,942
For Middle 1 Class of PRIME KINGZ...

2752
02:02:01,943 --> 02:02:04,544
the crew member will participate with 2face...

2753
02:02:04,914 --> 02:02:07,382
instead of mercenaries...

2754
02:02:07,383 --> 02:02:10,124
in this two-on-two battle.

2755
02:02:10,424 --> 02:02:12,624
- Who will participate? - Who will it be?

2756
02:02:13,093 --> 02:02:15,164
I think Knucks will come out.

2757
02:02:15,624 --> 02:02:17,263
If Trix comes out, Mbitious is doomed.

2758
02:02:17,994 --> 02:02:19,932
- That's cheating. - A big cheat.

2759
02:02:19,933 --> 02:02:21,464
It's a fraud.

2760
02:02:21,864 --> 02:02:26,233
2face, who will fight with you at the fight zone?

2761
02:02:26,574 --> 02:02:28,904
The crew member who'll fight with me is...

2762
02:02:29,044 --> 02:02:30,074
Counter?

2763
02:02:30,473 --> 02:02:31,642
There's no rule,

2764
02:02:31,643 --> 02:02:34,873
but it's a battle of the Middle Class.

2765
02:02:34,874 --> 02:02:37,283
It will be right for Counter to participate.

2766
02:02:37,284 --> 02:02:41,382
A mercenary instead of Volly.

2767
02:02:41,383 --> 02:02:42,383
He'll participate.

2768
02:02:42,384 --> 02:02:44,052
I never imagined that he'll be the mercenary.

2769
02:02:44,053 --> 02:02:46,592
You didn't expect this, right? You're all doomed.

2770
02:02:46,593 --> 02:02:47,924
You're dead.

2771
02:02:48,664 --> 02:02:50,863
The crew member who'll fight with me is...

2772

(Who's the new mercenary of PRIME KINGZ?)

02:02:57,834 --> 02:02:59,773
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my.

- This is great. - Yes!

02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:09,382
Oh, gosh.

He's coming to hit the back of your head.

2781
02:03:10,714 --> 02:03:14,312
If our next mission is a group mission, Mbitious...

2782
02:03:14,313 --> 02:03:15,552
will have a good score.

2783
02:03:15,553 --> 02:03:16,982
Since the public will evaluate too.

2784
02:03:16,983 --> 02:03:20,593
They were on live first so I think they have their fandom.

2785
02:03:20,794 --> 02:03:24,063
The team that's strategically causing trouble for us is Mbitious.

2786
02:03:24,164 --> 02:03:26,133
I want to make them drop out by deducting their points.

2787

He's coming to hit the back of your head.

The back of the head is mine.

I just gave up on everything.

2794
02:03:44,883 --> 02:03:49,723
How well do they want to perform for 40 seconds?

2795
02:03:50,124 --> 02:03:53,324
They're even making their leader to come out.

2796
02:03:53,924 --> 02:03:56,663
Choose either to be a middle or a leader.

2797

Seriously, for goodness' sake.

It's a battle. It's something to win.

2799

It's a fight and a war.

2800
02:04:03,464 --> 02:04:06,073
We need to choose a weapon to kill the opponent.

Trix is so scary.
