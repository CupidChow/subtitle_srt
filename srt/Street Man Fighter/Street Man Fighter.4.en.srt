In the end,

325

I failed...

326

to make the best of all the moments.

327
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,955
I think it's my fault.

328
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:05,864
Wootae worked really hard to win these additional points.

we've gone through several missions so far.

338
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:44,805
I feel that I didn't contribute...

339
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:49,205
to our crew with my performances.

340
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,445
- So things like this... - No. You don't have to be sorry...

341
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:54,185
- about that. No one thinks that. - Don't be sorry.

This... Gosh.

343
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,384
As for the next mission,

344
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:01,884
I'll root for you guys from the back.

345
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,624
And I need some time to think.

346
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,195
I'm sorry, guys.

347
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:12,165
No one here ever thought...

348
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,634
that you weren't good enough to be here.

349
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:15,864
So I don't want you...

350
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,634
to spend this time, thinking about that at all.

351
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:23,045
I hope you will spend the time wisely to improve yourself.

352
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,815
It was sad.

353
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,545
And my feelings were complicated too.

354
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,744
Whatever decision he makes,

355
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:31,555
I should believe in him and watch him.

356
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,555
That's the only thing I can do as his fellow dancer.

357
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,654
Put aside Street Man Fighter or "Be Mbitious."

358
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:36,955
Aren't you going to keep dancing?

359
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:37,994
- Right. Yes. - Right?

360
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:41,364
I hope you can nourish your inner strength...

361
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,724
with this opportunity.

362
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:44,435
I think this had been tough on him.

363
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:47,364
But I believe that he will get through this well.

(Additions for the Main Dancer, Deductions for the Worst Dancer)

All right. Being chosen as the worst dancers...

366
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:58,514
brought a painful deduction of 50 points to some crews.

Being chosen as the main dancers...

brought 100 precious points to the crews.

We don't know what Vata will decide.

In my opinion, giving that song to 1MILLION might be good too...

because that way, Koo Young has to come up with something new.

Right. He must make a new routine...

None of these songs scare me. I'm fine with any song.

00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:40,414
where they can make the opposing crew be backup dancers.

643
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:42,255
My gosh. That's crazy.

00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,305
I didn't even imagine this.

650
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,845
I don't want to be a backup dancer.

651
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:06,515
It's funny because that is our job.

652
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,714
But if we're backups for other dancers, then we become sensitive.

653
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,414
No one came out on this show...

654
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:16,124
because they wanted to stand behind other dancers.

655
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:17,924
It will hurt our pride.

656

Also, the choreography for the backup penalty part...

657

created by the losing crew...

658
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:25,634
will not be revealed to the world. It will just disappear.

660
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:30,505
- It will disappear? No video? - That's crazy.

00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:32,775
- That's harsh. - That's so harsh.

662
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:35,045
It'll be so annoying if we lose...

663
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:36,805
because we have to practice the backup part and stand in the back.

664
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,674
And our choreography will disappear.

665

This time, for real...

666
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,985
We have to work really hard.

667
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:46,454
So we have to make the choreography impossible for the other crew...

668
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,354
to copy, so that we can win and make them backup dancers.

669
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:51,555
We have to do that. "Go stand in the back."

670
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,424
I'm putting my life on the line.

671
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:57,565
This is crazy. This mission is not easy.

To be honest, for Young Jun and me,

we don't care which section we do.

- Part A, right? - Yes, honestly.

Should we say which part we want after 1, 2, 3?

00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,414
In 1, 2, 3.

- Part B. - Part B.

This won't be easy.

697
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:59,194
Part A is "BANG BANG BANG"...

698

and Part B is "GOOD BOY."

699
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,434
We thought Part B would be better...

for us to showcase our choreography.

701

It's the widest gap including all the other crews.

714

- The widest gap, seriously. - We know.

715
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:49,644
It doesn't look like you guys are willing...

to give us the part.

717
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,444
Not even a bit?

718
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:58,555
The way that they said it...

719
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:01,085
was so heartbreaking.

720
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:02,725
We earned those points with our strategy.

721
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:06,225
But they suddenly said, "You guys have 150 more points,"

722
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:07,525
so I became speechless.

723

But if we were to take Part B on top of that,

724

I felt like I wouldn't be able to sleep comfortably.

What should we do? Are we going to go with Part B?

726
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:18,775
I think we can just give them the part.

- To be honest. - That's what I think too.

728

You guys can have Part B.

(Bank 2 Brothers end up giving Part B to EO-DDAE.)

- We will give it to you. - You guys will be blessed.

00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,444
Since they gave up the part for us,

- "Blood Sweat and Tears"? - Yes.

734

- This song needs more choreography. - Yes.

We can't krump to this song.

(Part B, "Fire")

(This is it.)

740
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:45,795
From the way I see it, we have to win Part B.

741
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:47,035
- Okay. - That's the best option.

742

We have to do what we're good at.

743
00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:49,934
We have to do Part B.

744
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,735
Can any of them do a backflip?

745
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:55,775
I think we should add a breakdancing skill.

746
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,914
I think we should add it to the end.

747

- A weapon. - A weapon.

751
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:11,394
- Should we talk first? - Yes.

752
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:12,894
- Go ahead. - We want Part B, of course.

753
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:15,065
- Part B? - We want Part B as well.

754
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:16,065
What?

755
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:18,134
- We want Part B as well. - Isn't it obvious?

756
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:21,565
We can do well, whether it's Part A or B.

757
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:23,065
- Then do Part A. - But,

758
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,104
- the problem is... - It's settled.

759
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,505
Let's say you guys learn Part B from us.

760
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:30,775
If you guys can do that part better than us,

761
00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:33,245
I think it'll be a huge plus for you guys.

762
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:35,345
I want to do a good job at copying Part A.

763
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:40,614
Then Part A could be extremely hard for you guys to copy.

764
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:42,325
We're okay with that. Shall we do that then?

765
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:43,654
No, that's not what I mean.

It's ours.

771
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:56,565
But he was so firm, so I thought it won't be easy.

772
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:58,874
Then since we can't reach an agreement...

773
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:00,975
- Come by after five minutes. - We'll visit your hideout.

774
00:32:00,975 --> 00:32:02,444
- The two of you. - Okay.

775
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:03,975
We talked about it...

776
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,374
and you know how BTS got popular...

777
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:08,914
because of their synchronization?

778
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:11,585
I think we can do a good job with that.

779
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,684
People would have expected us to take on Part A.

780
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:17,055
Under the assumption that PRIME KINGZ...

781
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:20,095
will do a good job during Part B...

782
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,595
What they were saying didn't make any sense...

783
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,124
and we weren't able to communicate.

784
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:26,595
They were as stubborn as a mule.

785
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:28,565
I don't understand why they're being so stubborn.

786
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:31,704
I am extremely stubborn.

787
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:34,545
JustJerk exists now...

788
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,045
because of my stubbornness.

789
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,845
So we went back and forth about three times.

790
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:42,345
No matter how hard I think,

791
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:44,684
No matter how objective I'm trying to be,

792

in Part A...

793

For over an hour or two,

they kept arguing and persuading.

795
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,095
Like an innocent bystander getting hurt in a fight,

796
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,464
I sat there quietly.

(What's the conclusion of the BTS' round?)

798
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,464
I have to express my opinion.

799
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:02,434
Right. Then...

Raise your hands, guys.

2231
01:39:32,484 --> 01:39:35,455
We don't have much time left.

2232
01:39:35,455 --> 01:39:36,825
- Shall we start? - What's this?

2233
01:39:36,825 --> 01:39:37,955
Are we practicing together?

2234
01:39:38,495 --> 01:39:40,194
- What's going on? - Let's hurry up.

Don't pay attention to them.

Oh, I stand here.

2237
01:39:44,564 --> 01:39:46,434
I think I'm between them.

2238
01:39:46,434 --> 01:39:48,064
- I'm in the middle. - But the line...

2239
01:39:48,064 --> 01:39:49,764
That's not it.

2240
01:39:49,764 --> 01:39:51,264
They were standing diagonally.

2241
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:54,135
They were standing in the diagonal direction.

2242

- What's the matter? - What's the issue?

You're standing back right.

"What on earth is going on?"

2246
01:40:04,014 --> 01:40:06,854
We weren't originally a crew.

2247
01:40:06,854 --> 01:40:10,425
We're still learning about each other.

2248
01:40:10,425 --> 01:40:12,694
Let me get this straight. Look at me.

2249
01:40:12,694 --> 01:40:14,425
On the beat, back to your positions.

2250
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:17,224
I have an opinion. Why don't we do that same move...

2251
01:40:17,224 --> 01:40:19,564
and come in like this, not like this?

2252
01:40:19,835 --> 01:40:21,234
- I think that's better. - I think...

2253
01:40:21,234 --> 01:40:24,705
For this move... Boom, boom.

2254
01:40:24,904 --> 01:40:26,205
- We all move forward. - Yes.

2255
01:40:26,205 --> 01:40:27,934
Instead of everyone moving...

2256
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:30,545
Should we stand in the same line?

2257
01:40:30,545 --> 01:40:32,045
- Hang on. - Can we change it?

2258
01:40:32,045 --> 01:40:33,774
- No. - MOOD DOK was standing in the back.

2259
01:40:34,215 --> 01:40:36,045
- He's in the back? - He comes forward.

for YGX.

2263
01:40:42,925 --> 01:40:45,925
We were in the same space, but things were completely different.

2264
01:40:45,925 --> 01:40:48,054
We were stimulated by them.

2265
01:40:48,054 --> 01:40:51,165
I didn't know YGX were in perfect sync.

2266

"How is that possible? It's as if they practiced it in advance."

2267
01:40:54,665 --> 01:40:57,035
That really stirred me up.

to take the lead.

2280

I'm the leader,

2284

but all I'm doing is sitting down.

2285

I have not once fulfilled my duty as a leader...

since the battle mission,

it wouldn't have impacted me much...

no matter what had happened next.

2292

The constant sense of responsibility and pressure...

2293

made it hard for him.

2294

The more missions we did,

2304
01:42:50,844 --> 01:42:53,615
the smaller 5000 became. And he kept walking on eggshells,

2305
01:42:53,615 --> 01:42:55,255
which we started doing too.

2306
01:42:56,825 --> 01:43:00,295
5000 became weak, and so did we. And that's a fact.

I might have a breakdown too.

2311

And that made me falter a bit too.

2312
01:43:11,505 --> 01:43:14,835
Honestly, I told 5000 that it was a mess right now,

2313
01:43:14,835 --> 01:43:16,104
which was harsh.

2314

The person we think...

is our pillar doesn't think he is one.

but he knew the sub leader shouldn't.

2318
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:34,955
So I could tell he was suppressing it.

I'm sorry.

2321

What should we do first?

2322
01:43:48,304 --> 01:43:51,974
We experienced how all of us can break down when our pillar does.

2323
01:43:52,075 --> 01:43:54,514
So if that pillar holds us tight,

2324
01:43:54,675 --> 01:43:57,045
we could become one.

2325
01:43:57,285 --> 01:43:59,085
I should pull myself together...

2326

we're at an advantage...

2544
01:55:47,854 --> 01:55:49,865
because we learn faster than them.

2545
01:55:49,865 --> 01:55:52,564
Let's memorize the choreography within an hour.

2546
01:55:52,564 --> 01:55:54,495
- First, let's copy exactly. - Yes, exactly.

2547
01:55:54,495 --> 01:55:56,005
There are the hand moves.

2548

2553
01:56:07,545 --> 01:56:09,785
Our choreography must've been really difficult.

2554
01:56:09,814 --> 01:56:10,944
I think so.

2555
01:56:11,045 --> 01:56:12,644
Why does the choreography made by Mbitious feel so easy?

2556
01:56:12,755 --> 01:56:14,755
(After one hour of copying choreography)

How can they copy it within the same given time?

2561
01:56:29,165 --> 01:56:32,465
How is it possible for them to copy it...

2562
01:56:32,465 --> 01:56:34,274
as if it's customized for them?

2563
01:56:35,335 --> 01:56:37,604
Honestly, they were a bit annoying.

2564
01:56:39,104 --> 01:56:40,615
I felt too good.

2565
01:56:40,615 --> 01:56:42,675
They looked down on us.

and something like chocolate?

2582
01:57:13,844 --> 01:57:16,215
Yes, they're hungry.

2583
01:57:16,545 --> 01:57:17,785
- Let's try this. - This looks delicious.

2584

What is it?

2591

Nowadays, you can easily pay without your card.

You chose this photo.

Yes, but I'll change it to one with six packs.

We saw earlier...

2602
01:57:48,314 --> 01:57:51,415
how Mbitious changed the choreography.

2603
01:57:51,684 --> 01:57:53,785
(During the dance video rehearsal)

2604

(Dumbfounded)

2606

I think they were influenced a lot by our choreography.

01:58:05,325 --> 01:58:06,934
The whole flow.

2608

(YGX made the concept of the song clearly visible.)

2609
01:58:09,394 --> 01:58:13,104
We thought the concept of the song should be clearly visible.

2610
01:58:13,104 --> 01:58:15,875
After showing the humorous and exciting side,

2611
01:58:16,104 --> 01:58:18,604
then we danced like we were having fun.

(Enjoy it!)

2613
01:58:21,545 --> 01:58:24,444
For Mbitious, it was just a cool performance.

2614
01:58:25,415 --> 01:58:26,885
It didn't go along with the song.

2615
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:30,755
The first choreography by Mbitious that we saw...

2616
01:58:31,054 --> 01:58:33,825
was totally different.

2617

("VERY NICE" choreography that's remade by Mbitious)

2618
01:58:40,795 --> 01:58:42,264
Didn't they copy ours too much?

2619
01:58:43,434 --> 01:58:44,965
They copied our concept.

2620
01:58:44,965 --> 01:58:47,304
They saw our choreography and realized something.

2621
01:58:47,304 --> 01:58:49,404
They focused a lot on their facial expressions too.

2622
01:58:49,604 --> 01:58:51,344
What's this? Are they copycats?

2623
01:58:51,444 --> 01:58:52,474
(YGX practices before the video shoot.)

2624
01:58:52,474 --> 01:58:53,545
One, two, and facial expression.

2625
01:58:53,545 --> 01:58:55,644
Facial expression.

2626
01:58:56,814 --> 01:58:58,944
One, two, three.

2627
01:58:58,944 --> 01:59:02,684
In the video, our facial expressions,

2628
01:59:02,684 --> 01:59:05,285
vibes and teamwork will be shown.

2629
01:59:05,654 --> 01:59:09,154
I don't think we'll lose on these.

2630
01:59:09,625 --> 01:59:11,094
Don't look at the ground.

2631
01:59:11,894 --> 01:59:14,295
Look at the camera and lip sync...

2632
01:59:14,295 --> 01:59:16,535
or constantly show your facial expressions.

2633
01:59:16,535 --> 01:59:18,705
- Don't let your guard down. - Yes.

2634
01:59:18,865 --> 01:59:20,474
I hope we win at all costs.

2635
01:59:20,934 --> 01:59:24,175
Honestly, I hope we win significantly.

2636
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:25,444
It's our turn.

2637
01:59:26,675 --> 01:59:29,075
It's a given that we must do well with our dancing,

2638
01:59:29,075 --> 01:59:30,245
but the humorous elements...

2639
01:59:30,245 --> 01:59:34,554
are what we're most confident about for this mission.

2640
01:59:34,615 --> 01:59:36,385
I think we'll win.

2641
01:59:36,755 --> 01:59:37,885
We must win.

2642
01:59:38,224 --> 01:59:40,255
We have to beat Mbitious.

2643
01:59:40,255 --> 01:59:42,354
We should win neatly...

2644
01:59:42,594 --> 01:59:45,125
and end the bad relationship.

2645
01:59:45,365 --> 01:59:47,094
That'll be a clean battle.

2646
01:59:47,365 --> 01:59:49,394
Next, let's see YGX's dance video,

It's a mirror.

2652
02:00:08,455 --> 02:00:09,625
They're good-looking.

Oh, my. Who's that?

2654
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:14,860
Let's go.

2655
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:16,600
I'll really do my best.

2656

- Me too. I'll do my best. - Thank you.

2657

Anyway, we have one stage.

2658
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:23,039
- Let's do this. - We can do it.

2659
02:00:23,610 --> 02:00:26,140
It's a performance in the end.

2660
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:29,379
I'll do my best as a crew member.

2661
02:00:29,379 --> 02:00:31,209
They're ten years older than me.

2662
02:00:31,209 --> 02:00:33,419
So I was thankful as they really did their best.

2663
02:00:33,419 --> 02:00:36,989
I also thought about not being a cheater.

2664
02:00:36,989 --> 02:00:39,089
I think we should just think of it as another performance of ours...

2665
02:00:39,089 --> 02:00:40,119
and show them what we got.

2666
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:43,459
We had to work together for this performance.

2667
02:00:43,459 --> 02:00:46,390
I wanted to harmonize with PRIME KINGZ.

2668
02:00:46,659 --> 02:00:49,900
We should pay more attention to the side when we do this move.

2669
02:00:50,169 --> 02:00:51,999
- It was fun. - It was fun.

2670
02:00:51,999 --> 02:00:54,499
We wouldn't have done that in real life.

2671
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,739
(A crew will be eliminated for the first time next week.)

2672
02:00:57,839 --> 02:01:00,579
The Dropout Battle will begin...

2673
02:01:00,579 --> 02:01:02,980
to decide a crew that will be eliminated first.

2674
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:05,310
- Please. - We have to battle it again here?

2675
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:08,079
We feel great about the battle. Our battle will be amazing.

2676
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:09,720
I want to stop losing.

2677
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,390
We won't be eliminated.

2678
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:13,360
There's no way we will be. And we won't.

2679
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:16,730
You can all watch and learn how a battle should be.

2680

I plan to give it my all.

2681
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:22,299
PRIME KINGZ never loses.

The first crew to be eliminated...

2686

is...

2687
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:36,209
What was that?

2688
02:01:38,549 --> 02:01:39,709
This makes no sense.

2689
02:01:40,419 --> 02:01:44,320
I was shocked after hearing the results.

2690
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:48,520
"Why does this crew have to get eliminated..."

2691
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,360
"after the first Dropout Battle?"

2692
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:55,199
It wasn't easy to make this decision.

2693
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:58,070
I would like to thank both crews...

2694
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:59,869
for putting on great performances.

2695
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:06,610
The first crew to be eliminated from Street Man Fighter...

2696
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:09,039
You may leave the fight zone.

2697
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:11,049
This is so cruel.
