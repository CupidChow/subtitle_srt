It's called the Choreography Mission.

if we're not being us, it's not fun.

for the people dancing to be having fun.

Then I can't focus on the key choreography.

You should add some relaxing steps here and there.

- It's too strong. - But...

847

We need to choose when to relax.

It was pretty tough for 30 seconds.

Mbitious had you in mind as they made the choreography.

Ho Won may be my junior,

but his passion and moves were fabulous.

958
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,266
Because he was a singer,

959

he knew exactly what I wanted.

960

00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:36,836
he could have loosened up a bit.

We Dem BOYZ felt as if they had come to hang out.

00:53:03,956 --> 00:53:05,766
They're on. Let's go.

1133
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,095
I'm curious about Bank 2 Brothers' choreography.

1134
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,865
(What's Bank 2 Brothers' choreography like?)

1135
00:53:11,135 --> 00:53:14,235
Hip hop originator, Bank 2 Brothers.

1136
00:53:16,436 --> 00:53:17,805
(Here's the lord.)

1137
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:19,945
He's the only lord.

1138
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:21,305
I love that.

1139
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:22,646
I love their gat.

1140
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:25,416
Here comes Lord Feeldog.

1141
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:30,215
Let's go.

1142
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:32,555
("Domestic" by Rain, choreography by Bank 2 Brothers)

1143
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:34,626
(Concept: We will show you how real nobles have fun.)

1144
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,235
- They're in sync now. - Yes.

1145
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:45,396
How cool.

1146
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:05,016
(JustJerk is surprised.)

1147
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:07,786
They added a lot of formations.

1148
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:09,996
The verse choreographies are all nice.

1149
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,025
Right?

1150
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:27,146
Did you see how he drank soju and then threw it away?

1151
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:28,405
- Yes. - Nice, wasn't it?

1152
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:30,416
His acting skills are great.

1153
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:31,715
He's like a real singer.

1154
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,046
But he is a singer.

1155
00:54:53,805 --> 00:54:55,405
(Amazed)

1156
00:54:55,536 --> 00:54:56,836
That part was the bomb.

1157
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:59,546
This choreography feels like an actual performance.

1158
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,965
(Focused)

1159
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:29,305
He's really good.

1160
00:55:29,305 --> 00:55:30,735
Feeldog is doing most of the job.

1161
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:32,206
This solo part is fantastic.

1162
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:44,686
(Rain's new song, "Domestic," is available on Melon.)

1163
00:55:48,255 --> 00:55:50,896
(They approve of them.)

1164
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:53,126
- They prepared a lot. - Yes.

1165
00:55:53,126 --> 00:55:55,465
It's completely different from what they've shown so far.

1166
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:58,095
I love them being conceptual.

1167
00:55:58,095 --> 00:56:00,166
It's a concept that suits the crew well.

1168
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,206
The noblemen.

1169
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:03,376
Seriously, they did so well.

1170
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:05,805
Bank 2 Brothers has definite strengths and weaknesses.

1171
00:56:05,805 --> 00:56:08,546
Their strength is the props.

1172
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:11,146
They were all wearing gats.

1173
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:14,046
But the main dancer, Feeldog, wore a lord's...

1174
00:56:14,046 --> 00:56:15,445
(Laughing)

1175
00:56:15,445 --> 00:56:17,615
A lord's gat.

1176
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:19,925
The intro was clearly visible.

1177
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:21,456
It was freely composed.

1178
00:56:21,456 --> 00:56:22,755
It was very good.

1179
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,925
But there weren't many movements that were impactful.

1180
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:26,365
- It was a bit lacking. - Right.

1181
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:28,396
I want to praise...

1182
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:30,465
the part that goes, "up the stakes."

1183
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:32,965
They visualized the game board.

1184
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:34,436
Also, in the middle,

1185
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,436
they included some step moves that I wanted.

1186
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,836
I think if they danced that...

1187
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:40,646
with more power and structure...

1188
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,675
in a group choreography, it would've been better.

1189
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:44,775
Bank 2 Brothers, thanks for your hard work.

1190
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:46,586
Their strengths and weaknesses are distinct too.

1191
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:48,385
The mission that I'll reveal is...

1192
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:50,786
Rain Choreography Mission.

1193
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:52,626
(Give me the mission.)

1194
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,086
I knew it was coming.

1195
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:55,796
- This is for us. - It's for 1MILLION.

1196
00:56:55,796 --> 00:56:57,296
- It's for 1MILLION. - It's for us.

1197
00:56:57,296 --> 00:56:59,365
The wow factor for the lyrics.

1198
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:01,825
The factors that you consider...

1199
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:03,936
even for a small beat.

1200
00:57:03,936 --> 00:57:05,595
That's what I love the most.

1201
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:08,836
I've been doing this my whole life.

1202
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:10,805
Snap, thump, bang.

1203
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:12,106
Expressing the lyrics.

1204
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:14,046
Adding the visual points.

1205
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:16,146
We can customize...

1206
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:18,075
whatever our clients want.

1207
00:57:18,075 --> 00:57:19,345
I have no worries.

1208
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:21,445
Doesn't our crew have...

1209
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:23,086
the most experience in creating choreographies?

1210
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:25,186
I've created 15 in a month once. It was my record.

1211
00:57:25,186 --> 00:57:26,825
It means you created one every two days.

1212
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:30,555
I make seven to eight per month regularly.

1213
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:32,325
The two eldest dancers are very experienced.

1214
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:34,996
Others have experience in creating choreographies too.

1215
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:36,365
I have a lot of experience too.

1216
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:39,505
Such as SHINee, ITZY, NCT,

1217
00:57:39,505 --> 00:57:43,106
ONEUS, ONF, and PURPLE KISS.

1218
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:45,606
It's an environment in which only the skilled dancers survive.

1219
00:57:45,606 --> 00:57:47,405
The fact that we have a lot of experience...

1220
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:49,215
can be proof...

1221
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,115
of our skills.

1222
00:57:51,115 --> 00:57:54,516
Our center is our leader, Koo Young.

1223
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:55,686
Yes.

1224
00:57:55,686 --> 00:57:56,715
(A deep sigh)

1225
00:57:56,715 --> 00:57:58,485
The end of the 20-year narrative.

1226
00:57:59,655 --> 00:58:03,126
I've been working and dancing for 20 years.

1227
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:06,666
But I was always at the back.

1228
00:58:08,226 --> 00:58:10,735
"I created choreographies for 20 years."

1229
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:13,005
I'll do my best for another 20 years!

1230
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:14,735
It should end like this.

1231
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:17,235
Right.

1232
00:58:18,436 --> 00:58:19,775
I'll be Rain.

1233
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,075
It feels strange...

1234
00:58:21,106 --> 00:58:22,876
because I didn't want to at first.

1235
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:27,945
Since I'm short and small in size.

1236
00:58:28,016 --> 00:58:30,985
Physical appearance is important for performances.

1237
00:58:31,286 --> 00:58:33,025
I'm slightly pressured.

1238
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:36,456
I added some height.

1239
00:58:36,456 --> 00:58:39,055
The strength of our Rain is...

1240
00:58:39,055 --> 00:58:40,865
that he has a lot of experience in dancing just like Rain.

1241
00:58:40,865 --> 00:58:43,235
He knows too well what artists...

1242
00:58:43,235 --> 00:58:44,735
want and like.

1243
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:48,305
Firstly, our concept...

1244
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,905
was made while thinking of Rain.

1245
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,505
I wondered why Rain never ages.

1246
00:58:52,546 --> 00:58:54,206
Why is he the same as before?

1247
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:57,675
So we have a keyword, "Vampire."

1248
00:58:58,445 --> 00:59:00,786
- Oh, the key choreography. - The key choreography.

1249
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:03,385
"Instead of Saying Goodbye."

1250
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:04,856
What's that?

1251
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:07,055
If you leave me

1252
00:59:07,055 --> 00:59:08,325
When were you born?

1253
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:09,956
December, 2003.

1254
00:59:09,956 --> 00:59:11,296
This song was released in 2002.

1255
00:59:11,296 --> 00:59:12,456
Right.

1256
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:14,226
Root, you know this, right?

00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:21,066
I listened to this song so many times.

1261
00:59:22,135 --> 00:59:23,536
"Hip Song."

1262
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:25,976
His physical appearance is great.

1263
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:27,775
It doesn't make sense that he's in his 40s.

1264
00:59:28,275 --> 00:59:30,215
Looking back at his work,

1265
00:59:30,215 --> 00:59:33,016
- I think Rain likes being sexy. - Yes.

1266
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,956
I don't think he'll like the choreography...

1267
00:59:35,956 --> 00:59:38,186
if it isn't beyond interesting.

1268
00:59:38,186 --> 00:59:39,425
I think he has high standards.

1269
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:41,286
In order to collect data,

1270
00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:43,126
each of us should make one choreography.

1271
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:44,956
We make one each...

(Angry Koo Young is back.)

1273
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:48,825
Like the main dancer tryout.

1274
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:50,766
I saw him like that on TV.

1275
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,095
"After each of us come up with one,"

1276
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:53,805
"let's have a main dancer tryout."

1277
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:56,075
I tried out the big agency style.

1278
00:59:56,376 --> 00:59:59,675
Our members are all good at creating choreographies.

1279
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:01,445
We create it quick.

1280
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:03,546
It was good to include all of our opinions.

01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:01,533
Shall go straight into our meeting?

1611
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:03,972
- The third verse is all dance. - Yes, dancing.

1612
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:06,203
We'll divide the dance teams into A, B, C, D, E, and F.

1613
01:15:06,203 --> 01:15:07,342
Shall we just do freestyle?

1614
01:15:07,342 --> 01:15:10,113
We'll do the first part in freestyle though.

1615
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:12,113
We should start with 1MILLION.

1616
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:13,882
Shall we put JustJerk here?

1617
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:18,252
We'll make it perfect so that the final version would be the best.

(The long-awaited D-Day of the music video shoot)

The place we are at is...

called Mungyeongsaejae.

Mungyeongsaejae is so nice.

- It's so nice. - So nice.

1626

They're experts.

They're hip-hop experts.

"Jeon Woo-chi." Nice!

1674
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:21,302
Since we're in a hanok, the fan and the hat look cool.

You guys totally look like experts.

Ahem.

1677

I think our look went well with this space the most.

1678
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:31,012
No matter how well the other teams have dressed up,

1679

I think we'll look the coolest.

I think our costume looks much better.

Ours is so pretty.

1682
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:38,792
The concept of our pants were taken from hanboks.

1683
01:17:39,052 --> 01:17:40,323
The pleats are so awesome.

1684

If we're cold, we can do this.

1685
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:44,762
Just your fingers.

1686
01:17:45,363 --> 01:17:47,462
But we can't abandon our identity.

1687
01:17:47,533 --> 01:17:48,703
We're wearing no sleeves.

That looks cool.

1693
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:01,443
It's a mix of hanbok and a suit.

1694
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:05,453
I think the stage and our costume go well together.

1695
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:07,823
We're wearing mosquito nets,

1696
01:18:08,153 --> 01:18:10,292
so I don't think mosquitoes will be biting us.

The best thing out there is mesh.

- This place is so pretty. - I know.

1924
01:29:30,863 --> 01:29:31,972
Everyone, raise your hands.

- Do it. Everyone, pound it. - Like this.

- Is this for a puffy face? - Yes. For your face.

(Pounding)

1928
01:29:40,243 --> 01:29:42,212
I watched our last episode.

1929

And all of us looked so puffy.

1930
01:29:43,613 --> 01:29:45,212
- What are we going to do? - I'm scared.

1931
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:48,382
An important-looking shrine is set up outside.

1932

(This is called the Muse Road.)

1933
01:29:51,622 --> 01:29:55,023
The guests must be so important that they needed a red carpet.

1934
01:29:56,493 --> 01:29:57,493
You were right.

1935
01:29:57,493 --> 01:30:01,233
- "Muse of Street Man Fighter." - "Muse of Street Man Fighter."

1936
01:30:01,233 --> 01:30:02,262
What does "muse" mean?

1937
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:04,703
"Muse of Street Man Fighter." What is that?

1938
01:30:04,703 --> 01:30:05,832
- "Muse?" - What does that mean?

1939
01:30:05,972 --> 01:30:08,943
People who inspire you are called muses.

1940

People who inspire artists.

1941

They're not going to battle against us on the show, right?

That's enough.

1944
01:30:17,983 --> 01:30:19,353
Will women join us?

1945
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:21,222
We'll battle against them.

1946
01:30:21,222 --> 01:30:22,922
We should get them to sit in the back.

"They are our spots."

1948

"I can't give them the spots."

1949

"No way. I can't let them have our spots."

1950
01:30:28,193 --> 01:30:32,292
If we have a chance to work with women, will we get to choose?

1951
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:35,802
We have never invited female dancers for our performances.

1952
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:37,502
Gosh.

1953

- I'm excited. - I'm excited too.

I can't be happy. What do I do?

1967
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:19,042
I can neither take off my ring or act happy.

1968

Why am I getting excited?

- Of course, I'm shy. - This isn't a blind date.

Hey, what are we going to do once they arrive?

1973
01:31:29,752 --> 01:31:32,622
We're a bunch of guys who just goof around.

1974
01:31:32,622 --> 01:31:36,063
Personally, it's more comfortable to perform with just my crew.

1975
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:38,933
It's more comfortable that way. So I like that.

1976
01:31:39,332 --> 01:31:41,063
When J HO heard about the female dancers,

- his heart started to beat fast. - No.

1978

I wonder who chose us.

1979

On "Be Mbitious,"

1980

two crews came to teach us the choreography for "Hey Mama."

Time for LACHICA.

(Is it LACHICA from "Be Mbitious?")

"Hey!"

all the genres women can execute.

2000

No one in our crew is scared to try out a new genre.

2001
01:32:34,252 --> 01:32:36,552
We can help them in coming up with a concept or choosing the outfits.

2002

They can improve with our help.

And we've been to the semifinal.

2004

So we can give them a lot of feedback.

We'll find what we can excel in...

Gabee was blinding my eyes.

- Should we get going? - Let's go. We have no choice.

2048
01:34:03,472 --> 01:34:05,143
A lot of people might assume...

2049
01:34:05,143 --> 01:34:07,243
that we might choose EO-DDAE because our styles might match.

2050

But wouldn't that be too predictable?

- It will be too predictable. - Yes.

No. They won't join EO-DDAE.

Hello.

I am Choi Soo Jin, and I'm a contemporary dancer.

2250
01:41:26,382 --> 01:41:29,353
I started dancing through ballet...

2251
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:31,653
and transitioned into contemporary dancing.

2252
01:41:31,922 --> 01:41:34,453
I was in Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet,

2253
01:41:34,453 --> 01:41:37,162
and I also competed in "Dancing 9."

2254
01:41:37,162 --> 01:41:39,233
(She is a veteran dancer who won "Dancing 9 Season 2.")

2255
01:41:39,233 --> 01:41:42,203
I want to be able to comfort a lot of people...

2256
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:44,903
through a performance that has a story...

2257
01:41:44,903 --> 01:41:47,002
that tugs on people's heartstrings.

2258
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:51,073
The shape of their bodies...

2259
01:41:51,813 --> 01:41:53,443
and the energy from their dancing...

2260
01:41:53,443 --> 01:41:56,882
are what I think will match me and my team.

2261
01:42:00,313 --> 01:42:02,582
Do I just need to go to them?

2262
01:42:03,052 --> 01:42:05,493
I don't think she's going to walk around a lot.

2263
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:07,693
She's probably going to head straight to her choice.

2264
01:42:07,693 --> 01:42:09,693
- She's going to go right away. - What?

2265
01:42:09,693 --> 01:42:11,733
Do I just need to go to them?

2266
01:42:11,733 --> 01:42:12,792
She came right away.

2267
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:14,893
We can do a contemporary dance.

2268

- What? - What? She's coming.

Then the two people at the top have met.

2274

They're both world-class. They're meeting each other.

- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

- Thank you. - Thank you.

2278
01:42:34,953 --> 01:42:37,023
There was a solid reason...

2279
01:42:37,023 --> 01:42:38,422
why I chose JustJerk.

2280
01:42:38,422 --> 01:42:41,592
Their attitude towards dance, their energy, and their passion.

2281
01:42:41,592 --> 01:42:44,493
Those things made me want to create a performance with them.

2282
01:42:44,493 --> 01:42:47,393
We might be able to come in first place again...

That's what people fall for.

2554
01:52:19,235 --> 01:52:20,275
I can't wait to see JustJerk.

2555
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:21,834
I can't wait to see their performance.

2556
01:52:23,275 --> 01:52:25,674
I expected it to be flashy. Did I expect too much?

2557
01:52:25,674 --> 01:52:27,374
The only thing I remember is the blood.

2558
01:52:27,374 --> 01:52:29,044
- It should've been intenser. - Right.

2559
01:52:29,044 --> 01:52:31,615
That's it for the semifinal?

2560
01:52:31,615 --> 01:52:34,185
I'm not sure about that.

2561
01:52:34,185 --> 01:52:35,924
I think We Dem BOYZ will come first.

2562
01:52:35,924 --> 01:52:37,554
That combination shouldn't be legal.

2563
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:40,124
Two crews with great ideas got together.

2564
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,664
Their formations were great. But...

2565
01:52:42,664 --> 01:52:44,695
- Worst-case scenario... - It's not a worst-case scenario.

2566
01:52:44,695 --> 01:52:46,035
They might get eliminated.

2567
01:52:46,765 --> 01:52:48,895
It shouts LACHICA too much.

2568
01:52:48,895 --> 01:52:50,535
Mbitious isn't there.

2569
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:52,634
I think Mbitious will get eliminated.

2570
01:52:52,674 --> 01:52:54,204
- The last is... - 1MILLION.

2571
01:52:54,204 --> 01:52:55,775
- Me too. - 1MILLION?

2572
01:52:56,674 --> 01:52:59,315
- They're not dancing. - Blending in must have been hard.

2573
01:52:59,374 --> 01:53:01,714
I bet even the dancers gave them the lowest score.

2574
01:53:01,714 --> 01:53:04,815
The team I thought was our rival was EO-DDAE.

2575
01:53:04,815 --> 01:53:06,084
EO-DDAE's score is going to be high.

2576
01:53:06,185 --> 01:53:09,254
- We have to keep them in check. - They're on a roll.

2577
01:53:09,725 --> 01:53:13,254
Which four crews will get the tickets to the finals?

2578
01:53:14,054 --> 01:53:15,195
I don't want to look.

2579
01:53:15,494 --> 01:53:17,765
- Oh, please. - Let's go.

2580
01:53:17,825 --> 01:53:18,865
We must advance to the finals.

2581
01:53:19,634 --> 01:53:21,134
Here it is.

2582
01:53:21,535 --> 01:53:22,634
(For real?)

2583
01:53:24,004 --> 01:53:26,834
- No way. - So this is how it goes.

2584
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:27,834
That's ridiculous.

2585
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:29,975
Out of all the scores, this one annoys me the most.

2586
01:53:30,075 --> 01:53:32,615
It was the biggest shame of my life.

2587
01:53:32,815 --> 01:53:34,874
(The 4 crews to advance to the finals will be revealed next week.)

2588
01:53:35,214 --> 01:53:39,015
The popularity vote for Muse of SMF will begin tonight after the show...

2589
01:53:39,015 --> 01:53:41,485
and end at 5pm on October 19.

2590
01:53:41,485 --> 01:53:43,039
