- Yes, it will. - That was pretty intense.

1130
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:58,214
You must beat each other...

1131
00:43:58,214 --> 00:44:01,185
to become the winning crew on Street Man Fighter.

1132

I will now reveal...

your first mission.

1134
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:11,464
It's the signature mission of the Mnet original dance series.

1135
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:13,935
No-Respect Underdog Battle.

and come back to the fight zone.

1148
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,825
I thought Roh Tae Hyun was going to shut his trap here.

1149
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:41,394
- He's acting too arrogant. - Right.

He's too short. He has to act tough to stand out.

1151
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:47,504
I think We Dem BOYZ are going to get crushed...

1152
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:49,604
because of that guy. Their vice leader.

1153
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,604
In Gyoo should have been on "Show Me the Money."

1154

He came to the wrong show.

I knew he was arrogant in school.

Gosh. Battlers are going to have a field day.

1159
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:03,185
Look at the number of prey here.

(The 8 crews gather in the fight zone.)

1161

Look at Trix's face. He's going to kill someone today.

1162
00:45:12,354 --> 00:45:13,964
He will kill Roh Tae Hyun for sure.

1163
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,425
He's only glaring at YGX.

of No-Respect Underdog Battle.

1171
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:31,975
Once the battle begins,

1172
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:35,984
you will each have 40 seconds.

1173
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:39,214
When the battle is over, the Fight Judges will hold up cards.

1174
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:42,854
The dancers who get chosen by at least two judges will win.

1175
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:46,464
However, if two or more judges request a rematch,

1176
00:45:46,694 --> 00:45:49,635
both dancers will dance at the same time...

1177

to determine the winner.

1178

Do you see the fist in front of you?

1179
00:45:55,064 --> 00:45:56,064
Yes.

1180
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:59,774
If you lose the battle, No-Respect Stickers...

1181

I see. That will be humiliating.

Not the fist.

1185
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:08,814
The defeated crew...

1186
00:46:08,814 --> 00:46:12,084
will be the biggest underdog and named No-Respect Crew.

1187
00:46:12,254 --> 00:46:14,925
That will be their title as Street Man Fighter begins.

1188

I really don't want this.

1189
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:18,425
Right. This is the worst.

1190
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:20,124
This is about men's pride.

1191
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,365
Last place? They will look down on that crew.

1611
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:19,223
had discord.

1612
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:21,493
They copied about four counts...

1613
01:04:21,534 --> 01:04:24,163
of Vata's choreography.

1614
01:04:24,163 --> 01:04:25,264
JustJerk did that?

1615
01:04:25,264 --> 01:04:26,304
(There was a choreography issue between two crews.)

1616
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:29,234
It was a sensational choreography.

1617
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:31,873
He danced to rhythm and blues...

1618
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:33,243
as if it was hip hop.

1619
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,373
Then they copied it...

1620
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:36,643
exactly the same.

1621
01:04:38,413 --> 01:04:40,384
The style, song, clothes.

1622
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:42,614
They copied all moves.

1623
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:45,754
One of the members...

1624
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:47,023
in my crew...

1625
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:49,924
was highly inspired by Vata.

1626
01:04:49,924 --> 01:04:53,424
I think that's how he got the similar moves.

1627
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:55,663
I hate copycats.

1628
01:04:55,694 --> 01:04:57,804
If you call yourself an artist, if you're a dancer,

1629
01:04:57,804 --> 01:04:59,134
make your own.

1630
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:00,804
He put so much effort and sweat into it,

1631
01:05:00,804 --> 01:05:02,304
but as soon as it was posted,

1632
01:05:02,304 --> 01:05:04,373
they stole it.

1633
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:06,344
Vata doesn't like...

1634
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,114
fighting.

1635
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,643
He's a peace keeper.

1636
01:05:10,643 --> 01:05:11,884
But In Gyoo can't watch that.

1637
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:12,884
He's the opposite.

1638
01:05:12,884 --> 01:05:15,853
I tend to sound aggressive.

1639
01:05:15,853 --> 01:05:17,924
I'm kind of aggressive.

1640
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,984
I kept asking Vata if he was okay. If he didn't mind.

1641
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:21,353
I asked him for days,

1642
01:05:21,353 --> 01:05:22,393
then I posted it.

1643
01:05:22,393 --> 01:05:26,123
I uploaded it so that only JustJerk could see it.

1644
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,293
If he was upset about something,

1645
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:29,534
he should have said it to the person himself.

1646
01:05:29,734 --> 01:05:31,404
But he uploaded it onto his social media...

1647
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:33,103
and publicly called him out.

1648
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:35,574
He uploaded a video of one of our members...

1649
01:05:35,574 --> 01:05:36,773
as if he was ridiculing him.

1650
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:39,643
So to us, it was like, "Look at this punk."

1651
01:05:39,804 --> 01:05:41,773
J Ho gave me a call...

1652
01:05:41,913 --> 01:05:45,784
and told me publicly calling someone off wasn't a great idea.

1653
01:05:45,784 --> 01:05:47,254
It was immature.

1654
01:05:47,313 --> 01:05:50,214
So I told him to be more careful about it...

1655
01:05:50,353 --> 01:05:51,523
the next time.

1656
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:53,424
They should've said,

1657
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:55,424
"It was our fault. We won't do it again."

1658
01:05:55,594 --> 01:05:58,793
They could have handled it better.

1659
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:01,163
Since he called out to us, we should comply with it.

1660
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:04,134
They made such an evaluation about us...

1661
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,004
and pointed us out.

1662
01:06:06,404 --> 01:06:07,433
We'll show them.

1663
01:06:07,873 --> 01:06:10,103
(J HO gets the drop on We Dem Boyz's seat.)

1664
01:06:10,234 --> 01:06:11,543
I didn't even consider him my opponent.

1665
01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:13,973
It's annoying to lose against someone...

1666
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:15,043
I felt was wrong.

1667
01:06:15,043 --> 01:06:17,384
I'm on the stage, so I'm going to beat him.

1668
01:06:17,743 --> 01:06:20,114
The battle between the two dancers is about to begin.

1669
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:23,254
Let's go!

1670
01:06:23,254 --> 01:06:25,384
Ready? Fight!

1671
01:06:25,984 --> 01:06:27,654
(In Gyoo from WDBZ is up first.)

1672
01:06:28,023 --> 01:06:29,154
This song, for real?

1673
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:30,964
This song is hard.

1674
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:32,324
It's a hard song.

1675
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:36,333
That song was good enough.

1676
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:37,964
It was one that JustJerk couldn't dance to.

1677
01:06:38,234 --> 01:06:41,373
I thought I should create a vibe while enjoying it.

1678
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,804
Go for it!

1679
01:06:46,574 --> 01:06:48,574
He looks relaxed. Nice!

1680
01:06:50,714 --> 01:06:51,784
(That's weak.)

1681
01:06:57,924 --> 01:06:59,554
He's only as good as his height.

1682
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:03,594
Yes.

1683
01:07:12,163 --> 01:07:13,163
Bam!

1684
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:24,514
(Look closely.)

1685

(What a provocation!)

1686
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:27,884
What?

1687
01:07:31,024 --> 01:07:32,653
I thought, "So you're provoking me?"

1688
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,354
"You're dead meat now."

1689
01:07:37,464 --> 01:07:39,224
Four, three,

1690
01:07:39,224 --> 01:07:41,663
- two, one. - "Annoyed? Then bring it on."

1691
01:07:41,693 --> 01:07:44,004
Switch. J HO from JustJerk.

1692

No.

(The full battle clip is available at The CHOOM.)

1707
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:04,913
J HO has strong energy.

1708

You killed him.

1709
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:08,983
No, In Gyoo won.

1710
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:10,924
- He so did. - In Gyoo won.

1711
01:09:10,924 --> 01:09:11,983
(The two crews are still getting on each other's nerves.)

1712
01:09:13,184 --> 01:09:15,924
It's fun to watch others fight.

1713
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:20,193
During your moves, In Gyoo,

1714
01:09:20,193 --> 01:09:23,333
you didn't miss any beat and did it easily.

1715
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:27,233
(In Gyoo added moves to every beat.)

1716
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:28,903
So I thought you were listening to the music properly.

1717
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,974
Your moves were very witty.

1718
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:32,743
(In Gyoo, the first to dance, showed witty moves.)

1719
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:35,743
I would have flipped out if you had danced in front of me.

1720
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:38,943
- I would lose my temper. - Me too.

1721
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:41,583
And even in that situation, you kept calm,

1722
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:44,453
controlled yourself, and showed all you got.

1723
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:45,583
I like that. Honestly,

1724
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:50,224
I loved J HO's battle. It was like an attacking lion.

01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:52,993
Now then, let's check the result...

of the battle.

1727

- We did a great job. - Yes. He was relaxed.

J HO's going to get the first win.

Fight Judges, card open.

1730

I had no regrets about my moves...

1731

and never thought of losing.

1732

Don't worry. You did well.

I felt so upset that he lost.

They have Baek Koo Young and Choi Young Jun.

I never imagined they would show up as dancers.

I thought they were going to appear...

1761

as judges or something. But showing up like this...

1762
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:17,684

Both are famous as K-pop choreographers.

They're in the top class.

Yes, totally.

1771
01:11:35,733 --> 01:11:38,004
Koo Young and Young Jun are no joke.

1772
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:40,974
Choi Young Jun and Baek Koo Young both have...

1773
01:11:40,974 --> 01:11:42,573
the No-Respect sticker.

1774
01:11:42,573 --> 01:11:45,073
(Baek Koo Young and Choi Young Jun got pointed out as underdogs.)

Hold on a second.

1777
01:11:49,413 --> 01:11:51,613
- I feel awful. - Who would point you two?

(He's in a bad mood.)

1779
01:11:54,814 --> 01:11:56,314
I'm going to stick it on my chest.

1780
01:11:57,214 --> 01:11:59,684
- Oh, my gosh. - So this does flip you out.

1781
01:11:59,724 --> 01:12:01,823
How can someone point us out as underdogs?

1782
01:12:02,254 --> 01:12:05,394
The underdog I can beat is...

1783
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:06,863
It's 1MILLION!

He's coming on stage already?

1791
01:12:27,714 --> 01:12:30,083
The dancer who picked 1MILLION's sub leader,

1792
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:33,524
Choi Young Jun, as a No-Respect dancer was...

1793
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:38,193
EO-DDAE's sub leader, KINKY.

1794
01:12:39,163 --> 01:12:40,363
He's here.

1795
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:42,863
- He's here. - The star is here.

Who will win?

1797
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,903
I think he's the toughest dancer in EO-DDAE.

1798
01:12:47,064 --> 01:12:50,833
In a freestyle battle, waacking dancers are really strong.

1799
01:12:51,474 --> 01:12:53,743
And KINKY is seriously good in waacking.

1800
01:12:53,743 --> 01:12:55,443
If you go against him in an all-genre competition,

1801
01:12:55,443 --> 01:12:57,174
he might beat you badly.

1802
01:12:57,514 --> 01:12:59,083
He's got great energy,

1803
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,754
and nobody can win against his talent.

1804
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,483
- That scared me. - Oh, my gosh.

1805
01:13:03,483 --> 01:13:04,783
(When you face KINKY's charms...)

1806
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:06,854
- Oh, my. - That was KINKY?

1807
01:13:08,623 --> 01:13:10,123
He's amazing.

1808
01:13:10,293 --> 01:13:12,594
He's like the male version of Gabee.

1809
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:14,394
That was a shocker from the sub leader.

1810
01:13:14,464 --> 01:13:15,663
- We're doomed. - He's strong.

1811
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:18,663
(Where did the other crews predict EO-DDAE will rank?)

1812

- What? - 1MILLION?

1813
01:13:21,073 --> 01:13:22,703
They're not comfortable with the exposure.

1814
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:25,104
I bet that was because of KINKY's video.

1815
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:26,504
They don't know what performance is.

1816
01:13:26,804 --> 01:13:29,073
Back then, I felt bad for my team members.

1817
01:13:29,144 --> 01:13:31,314
During my video, he said, "I can't watch it."

1818
01:13:31,684 --> 01:13:33,014
I can't watch it.

1819
01:13:33,144 --> 01:13:35,314
I find those uncomfortable to watch.

1820
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:37,754
EO-DDAE? Their exposure makes me uneasy.

1821
01:13:37,884 --> 01:13:39,483
Having fewer clothes on isn't sexy.

1822
01:13:40,384 --> 01:13:42,123
What he thought about me made me angry.

1823
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:45,293
But judging my crew based on that made me madder.

1824
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:48,233
And I couldn't control my emotions at that moment.

1825
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:50,134
(It's flipping me out.)

1826
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:53,264
I'm so angry. I want to slice all of them up.

1827
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:56,403
I thought I had to win this for my team members.

1828
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:58,644
I bet he's going to win at all costs.

1829
01:13:58,644 --> 01:13:59,774
We're scared of him too.

1830
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,644
He's nowhere as good as Young Jun.

1831
01:14:01,913 --> 01:14:03,344
He's got great confidence.

1832
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:05,543
How dare he pick me?

1833
01:14:06,144 --> 01:14:08,913
Choi Young Jun is also good at female choreographies.

1834
01:14:09,014 --> 01:14:10,684
Should I dance girlish to win him?

1835
01:14:10,783 --> 01:14:14,054
Young Jun, you're going to kill him with girlish dance.

1836
01:14:14,054 --> 01:14:16,293
You're a girl group yourself than a girlish dancer.

1837
01:14:16,554 --> 01:14:17,823
It's in his body.

1838
01:14:18,064 --> 01:14:19,793
Out of all the girlish dancers,

1839
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:22,493
Young Jun ranks first when it comes to femininity.

1840
01:14:22,764 --> 01:14:24,264
He's superb in girlish dance.

I wonder what moves Young Jun will pull off.

1848
01:14:39,714 --> 01:14:41,754
Will he return the favour with the same girlish dance...

1849
01:14:41,913 --> 01:14:43,054
or with a choreography?

It's the first battle for B2B.

2408
01:39:33,872 --> 01:39:35,743
I'm curious.

2409
01:39:35,743 --> 01:39:37,273
They're totally hip hop.

2410
01:39:37,773 --> 01:39:39,842
Every member has won a battle competition.

2411
01:39:40,212 --> 01:39:41,712
They'll probably be good battlers.

2412
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:44,012
We are confident in freestyle dancing.

2413
01:39:44,012 --> 01:39:45,252
We won't lose...

2414
01:39:45,252 --> 01:39:47,353
even if it's against PRIME KINGZ.

2415
01:39:47,552 --> 01:39:49,752
They don't have any No-Respect stickers.

2416
01:39:49,823 --> 01:39:51,622
They don't have any?

2417
01:39:51,953 --> 01:39:53,663
They're the kings when it comes to...

2418
01:39:53,663 --> 01:39:54,962
freestyle dancing and battles.

2419
01:39:54,962 --> 01:39:56,432
Who would want to go against them?

2420
01:39:56,832 --> 01:39:58,233
I don't want to battle them.

2421
01:39:58,292 --> 01:39:59,962
The underdog I can beat is...

2422
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:03,332
(The dancers are nervous before BUSYBE's choice.)

2423
01:40:03,332 --> 01:40:04,432

2425
01:40:07,872 --> 01:40:09,143

01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:11,813
No, Brother. Don't come here.

2428

2431

- Let's go! - Let's go!

2432
01:40:26,292 --> 01:40:27,393
I expected it.

2433
01:40:27,393 --> 01:40:28,962
(Just earlier)

2434
01:40:28,962 --> 01:40:30,493
You could be called out.

2435
01:40:30,493 --> 01:40:31,863
I think it's going to be me.

2436
01:40:32,432 --> 01:40:33,733
He's getting prepared.

2437

(S.ONE had already stood up from his seat.)

2439
01:40:37,672 --> 01:40:38,903
They have a history.

2440
01:40:39,403 --> 01:40:40,943
A lot of people bad-mouthed S.ONE...

2441
01:40:41,273 --> 01:40:42,542
for various reasons.

2442
01:40:43,042 --> 01:40:45,712
(BUSYBE versus S.ONE. What happened between them?)

2443
01:40:45,943 --> 01:40:47,512
Let's choose S.ONE from JustJerk.

2444
01:40:47,512 --> 01:40:49,042
Everyone chooses Seo Won.

2445
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:50,552
We need to get revenge.

2446
01:40:50,552 --> 01:40:52,752
(We need to get revenge.)

2447
01:40:53,052 --> 01:40:55,252
S.ONE used to be...

2448
01:40:55,252 --> 01:40:56,592
a part of our crew.

2449
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:58,993
We took a lot of dance lessons together...

2450
01:40:58,993 --> 01:41:01,893
and had the same teachers, so I relied on him a lot.

2451
01:41:02,063 --> 01:41:04,033
But while we were dancing together,

2452
01:41:04,092 --> 01:41:07,403
he switched over to choreography.

2453
01:41:07,533 --> 01:41:10,132
As the choreography scene was starting to emerge,

2454
01:41:10,332 --> 01:41:13,842
I started to like choreography more.

2455
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:16,143
So I switched teams.

2456
01:41:16,243 --> 01:41:18,542
- Street dance includes... - Hip hop,

2457
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:19,813
krumping, popping.

2458
01:41:19,813 --> 01:41:22,012
The genre is sharply defined.

2459
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,653
Choreography is taking the styles of street dance...

2460
01:41:24,653 --> 01:41:26,783
that you like and creating a dance.

2461
01:41:26,953 --> 01:41:28,552
With choreography,

2462
01:41:28,552 --> 01:41:30,893
I was able to express multiple emotions...

2463
01:41:30,893 --> 01:41:32,823
because there was no set genre for the music.

2464
01:41:32,893 --> 01:41:35,222
I thought that was the right choice for me to take...

2465
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:37,462
if I wanted to grow and do what I like.

2466
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:39,292
So that is how I left my crew...

2467
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:40,632
and started...

2468
01:41:40,632 --> 01:41:42,502
doing choreography with Young Jay and J HO.

2469
01:41:42,903 --> 01:41:45,972
I resented him back then.

2470
01:41:46,203 --> 01:41:48,643
It made me hate people who did choreography.

2471
01:41:49,342 --> 01:41:51,943
And after that, there were some...

2472
01:41:52,813 --> 01:41:54,113
bad rumours.

2473
01:41:54,283 --> 01:41:56,953
"Why did you betray the hip hop scene?"

2474
01:41:57,283 --> 01:42:00,353
People called him and swore at him.

2475
01:42:00,422 --> 01:42:01,783
People swore at him.

2476
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:02,922
That's right.

2477
01:42:03,052 --> 01:42:05,393
"Did you leave to do choreography?"

2478
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:08,092
The rumours got out of hand...

2479
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:09,523
so I apologized.

2480
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:12,533
I went to the people who started spreading the rumours...

2481
01:42:12,533 --> 01:42:14,163
and apologized, but...

2482
01:42:15,533 --> 01:42:17,033
I'm sorry.

2483
01:42:17,033 --> 01:42:18,302
I feel bad.

2484
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:20,872
So he did nothing wrong...

2485
01:42:20,872 --> 01:42:22,773
- Why did you apologize? - but he still apologized.

2486
01:42:22,773 --> 01:42:23,972
- I see. - Yes.

2487
01:42:24,113 --> 01:42:27,313
(JustJerk's S.ONE went through a tough time.)

2488
01:42:29,012 --> 01:42:31,413
This conflict has existed for a long time.

2489
01:42:31,413 --> 01:42:33,052
Choreographers on TV...

2490
01:42:33,082 --> 01:42:34,953
and dancers on the street...

2491
01:42:35,122 --> 01:42:37,893
are like water and oil. We despise each other.

2492
01:42:39,993 --> 01:42:42,092
When we first started choreography,

2493
01:42:42,393 --> 01:42:45,063
a lot of dancers...

2494
01:42:45,063 --> 01:42:47,462
in the street scene talked bad about us.

2495
01:42:47,603 --> 01:42:48,832
"Do you call that dancing?"

2496
01:42:49,033 --> 01:42:53,143
When I watch choreographers dance,

2497
01:42:53,403 --> 01:42:56,042
they don't specialize in one area, so there's no depth.

2498
01:42:56,172 --> 01:42:58,342
It doesn't look like dancing to me.

2499
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:01,243
I feel like they think...

2500
01:43:01,243 --> 01:43:04,052
choreography is commercial.

2501
01:43:04,113 --> 01:43:05,483
The thing is,

2502
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,082
we don't sell our routines for money.

2503
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,092
They were just jealous of our success.

2504
01:43:10,193 --> 01:43:11,752
That's why they won't acknowledge it.

2505
01:43:11,823 --> 01:43:13,363
I want a street crew to win.

2506
01:43:13,363 --> 01:43:14,922
It's called "Street Man Fighter" after all.

2507
01:43:15,092 --> 01:43:16,092
You bad-mouthed choreography...

2508
01:43:16,092 --> 01:43:17,663
and now you're trying to do it?

2509
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,592
Don't make me laugh.

2510
01:43:19,703 --> 01:43:21,203
There's no individuality to choreography.

2511
01:43:21,203 --> 01:43:22,563
Petty hip hoppers.

2512
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:23,972
Street versus choreography.

2513
01:43:23,972 --> 01:43:25,372
It's a battle of pride.

2514
01:43:25,733 --> 01:43:28,172
I can never lose to a choreography team.

2515
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:29,403
Freestyle dancing...

2516
01:43:29,403 --> 01:43:31,773
is not only for street dancers.

2517
01:43:31,773 --> 01:43:33,143
I need to show them.

2518

(They have to have a rematch to decide the winner.)

2571

This is for the better.

2572

I wasn't entirely sure.

2573

- Let's go! - Let's go!

2576

You can do it.

2577
01:46:37,993 --> 01:46:40,762
BUSYBE versus S.ONE, S.ONE versus BUSYBE.

2578
01:46:40,932 --> 01:46:42,932
You guys ready? Fight!

Those moves are weak.

Nice.

You won.

2589
01:47:28,983 --> 01:47:30,853
It's been ages since S.ONE danced hip hop.

2590
01:47:30,853 --> 01:47:32,913
They have a similar yet different style.

2591
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:34,853
Their styles are totally different.

2592
01:47:35,082 --> 01:47:39,592
Let's check the result of the rematch.

2593
01:47:39,592 --> 01:47:41,292
Why am I getting nervous?

2594
01:47:41,693 --> 01:47:43,592
- S.ONE won this round, right? - Of course.

2595
01:47:43,932 --> 01:47:46,193
With the rematch alone, it's BUSYBE's victory.

2596
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:49,002
Fight Judges, card open.

2597
01:47:49,403 --> 01:47:51,302
I want to win against him at least once.

2598
01:47:52,002 --> 01:47:53,672
We need to win in freestyle dancing.

2599
01:47:54,542 --> 01:47:56,273
I knew I could win this round.

2600
01:47:56,943 --> 01:47:58,472
- Please. - Please.

(The youngest members pray earnestly.)

(Unfortunately, JustJerk's S.ONE lost.)

2606
01:48:13,693 --> 01:48:15,523
During the rematch,

2607
01:48:15,523 --> 01:48:18,462
the both of you grooved with similar moves...

2608
01:48:18,462 --> 01:48:20,103
and gave off the same vibe.

2609
01:48:20,103 --> 01:48:23,573
So I focused on who was having more fun...

2610
01:48:23,573 --> 01:48:25,733
and enjoying the battle.

2611
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:29,203
BUSYBE didn't really care much about S.ONE.

2612
01:48:29,203 --> 01:48:32,042
But S.ONE cared a lot about BUSYBE.

2613
01:48:33,542 --> 01:48:36,443
(S.ONE paid attention to BUSYBE throughout the battle.)

2614
01:48:37,012 --> 01:48:39,153
And it was so obvious.

2615
01:48:39,153 --> 01:48:41,153
That is why I chose BUSYBE.

2616

(JustJerk loses, Bank 2 Brothers wins)

2617
01:48:43,693 --> 01:48:44,792
He's a great judge.

2618
01:48:44,792 --> 01:48:47,262
Right? That was a good evaluation.

2619

Our punch!

2622
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:56,972
You did great.

2623
01:48:56,972 --> 01:48:59,733
We got the sticker because of me.

2624
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:01,203
So I felt really bad.

2625
01:49:01,443 --> 01:49:03,372
No-Respect Underdog Battle.

2626
01:49:03,372 --> 01:49:05,413
This battle...

2627
01:49:06,243 --> 01:49:07,613
is between leaders.

01:49:07,613 --> 01:49:08,682
(Shocked)

2629
01:49:10,413 --> 01:49:13,113
- It's a leader battle. - Leader battle!

2630
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:16,582
This leader battle is a battle of pride.

The first leader to battle is...

Who is it?

2633
01:49:20,922 --> 01:49:23,693
Battling as a leader is a matter of pride.

2634
01:49:23,693 --> 01:49:25,663
Honestly, it's a lot of pressure.

2635
01:49:25,663 --> 01:49:28,403
The damage is different when the others lose and when I lose.

2636
01:49:28,403 --> 01:49:29,802
But we're leaders.

2637
01:49:29,802 --> 01:49:30,872
We have to do it.

2638
01:49:30,872 --> 01:49:32,002
Let's show them who I am.

2639
01:49:32,172 --> 01:49:34,872
Whoever I'm against, I can't lose no matter what.

The first leader is...

I'm scared.

2648

He's a frightening man.

- First place. - First place.

2650

You're not a dancer...

2651

if you don't know 5000.

2652
01:50:02,103 --> 01:50:03,832
He's at the top of the class.

2653

There's a national competition called KOD.

2654
01:50:06,743 --> 01:50:08,672
He was the Korean representative.

2655
01:50:08,842 --> 01:50:11,313
If you hear 5000 taking part in any battle,

2656
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:12,712
it means he's going to be the winner.

2657

He beat all the dancers in Korea.

2658

I can mess with 5000.

2659
01:50:16,712 --> 01:50:18,212
I don't want to go against 5000.

He's super relaxed.

- He's like an ascetic. - Totally.

2663

Look at his face.

You can do it, 5000!

Good luck, 5000!

2666

Everyone tried to hide it,

The only battler they have is 5000.

There's no one to fight.

2675

It's going to be easy.

I'll beat him. Don't worry.

Rather than picking some other member,

it's better to pick him.

He's a saint. Even his hair is white.

But after the music started,

2790

I could hear the music in his dances.

2791

He was so familiar with the beat and expressed it so well...

I think 5000 did better.

2899
02:01:38,393 --> 02:01:40,363
The reason why my name is Vata...

2900
02:01:40,533 --> 02:01:42,363
is because I look like Avatar.

2901
02:01:43,262 --> 02:01:44,832
Not only my face,

2902
02:01:45,103 --> 02:01:48,443
but my arms and legs resemble Avatar.

2903
02:01:48,502 --> 02:01:50,372
So I named myself Vata.

2904
02:01:50,472 --> 02:01:51,972
- Avatar. - He does look alike.

2905
02:01:52,212 --> 02:01:54,113
His physical and body ratio is too good.

2906
02:01:54,113 --> 02:01:55,842
Yes, I thought he was a model.

2907
02:01:56,012 --> 02:01:58,712
He's tall, but he grooves well.

2912
02:02:05,893 --> 02:02:08,663
than the singers.

2913
02:02:08,663 --> 02:02:10,693
He's a genius choreographer.

2914

He works on many choreographies.

2915

He works with many famous idols.

2916

He creates a lot of choreographies.

2917

He has good reviews from them.

2918
02:02:20,002 --> 02:02:21,372
He is monopolizing the market.

2919
02:02:21,372 --> 02:02:22,672
He earns the most.

2920
02:02:22,672 --> 02:02:25,273
People would usually call me and say they want my work.

2921

2923

2924

They control the trend.

2925

Who's the underdog for Vata of We Dem BOYZ?

2929
02:02:45,693 --> 02:02:47,733
The underdog I can beat is...

2930
02:02:47,863 --> 02:02:50,033
I think he'll choose Young Jay.

2941
02:03:22,363 --> 02:03:25,672
an old and structured performing crew.

2942

WDBZ are the ones who criticized us.

They really have a death wish.

2944

They really don't know about us.

2945
02:03:32,743 --> 02:03:35,842
We are sure that we made a new trend.

2946
02:03:35,842 --> 02:03:38,552
I know Young Jay as OG of choreography.

2947
02:03:38,552 --> 02:03:42,453
When Korea was about to know about choreography...

2948
02:03:42,453 --> 02:03:44,893
they were working on choreographies.

2949
02:03:44,953 --> 02:03:45,993
They are the frontiers.

2950
02:03:45,993 --> 02:03:48,222
They made choreography from the streets.

2951
02:03:48,222 --> 02:03:53,092
Choreography wasn't a thing in Korea before.

2952
02:03:53,233 --> 02:03:56,863
But we started it.

2953
02:03:57,002 --> 02:04:00,002
There was no one who could teach choreographies.

2954
02:04:00,002 --> 02:04:01,002
So I taught myself.

2955
02:04:01,002 --> 02:04:02,903
To become famous,

2956
02:04:02,903 --> 02:04:05,372
we needed to make a record.

2957
02:04:05,773 --> 02:04:09,542
So we started off with Korean competitions.

2958
02:04:09,882 --> 02:04:11,712
Then we moved on to Asian competitions.

2959
02:04:11,953 --> 02:04:14,953
Later on, we made it to the US competitions.

2960
02:04:15,222 --> 02:04:18,193
Then we started winning many championships.

2961
02:04:18,292 --> 02:04:20,922
JustJerk is definitely a national crew.

2962
02:04:20,922 --> 02:04:22,962
They are called the national crew for a reason.

He raised the crew up to that point.
