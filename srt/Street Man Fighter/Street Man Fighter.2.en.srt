00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,611
Our hideout is probably a mess, right?

165
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,611
Let's go.

166
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,810
What?

167
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,051
- Why? - Why is it clean?

168
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,380
- Nothing is here. - Why is it clean?

169
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,020
What? Why is our hideout clean?

170
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,091
I guess we weren't chosen.

171
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,861
No one picked us.

172
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,031
- So no one wants to battle them. - No.

173
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,690
It's not that people are scared.

174
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,301
- They just don't want to. - No.

175
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,661
Their pride was probably crushed.

176
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:12,901
It's scarier to get zero attention.

177
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,130
They're looking down on our crew.

178
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,270
This is making me angry.

179
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,801
Our crew wasn't anybody's interest.

180
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,471
I suddenly felt offended.

181
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,841
We had a chance to show them starting with the duo battle.

182
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,911
- Let's show them waacking. - Waacking.

183
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,510
The underdog crew we consider is...

184
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,221
I hope it's not us.

185
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:32,080
I think it'll be us.

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,520
I think it'll be us. Get ready.

187
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,820
- It's 1MILLION. - Okay.

188
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,260
(My gut feeling was right!)

189
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,200
Yumeki and Root will come out.

(Will 1MILLION send out Yumeki and Root as their duo?)

192
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:49,971
The mighty duo of 1MILLION...

(Who will it be?)

194

(All eyes are on them.)

196
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,741
Yechan and Alexx.

197

Those two?

198
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,881
I don't think that's a wise decision.

199
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:04,950
They're like the junior varsity of 1MILLION.

200
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,151
They aren't the best.

201
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,291
We won.

202
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,220
- They seem easy. Al-Chan. - Al-Chan.

203
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,090
We're called Al-Chan.

204
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,661
You two are wearing matching clothes.

205
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,631
- No. It's a coincidence. - No.

206
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:18,301
I came, and he was like this.

207
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:19,401
That's Al-Chan.

208
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,301
(Young Jun officially said Alexx and Yechan were a lifelong duo.)

209
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,970
(Al-Chan has over ten years of history.)

210

(They were always together ever since they began to dance.)

211
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,310
(Alexx and Yechan danced together from their teenage years until now.)

212
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,840
We spent a long time together,

213
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,411
so there's no need for a long explanation between us.

214
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,850
We're like soulmates. The duo of our souls.

215
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,320
Let's do as we always did.

216
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,490
I was gnashing my teeth.

217
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:46,360
Unfortunately, we lost to EO-DDAE.

218
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,830
They lost both times to EO-DDAE.

219
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,801
EO-DDAE is out to get 1MILLION.

220
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:53,631
1MILLION and EO-DDAE are rivals.

221
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,431
I was really upset.

222
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
I'll seriously get back at them.

223
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,511
We have to get chosen.

224
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:01,710
I could see that he was boiling inside.

225
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,181
I'm sure EO-DDAE picked us. A hundred percent.

226
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,011
Then we want to go out.

227
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,850
I want to get our revenge with Yechan as two friends.

228
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:12,850
I'll destroy them.

229
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:14,990
Wait there. You'll see us win.

230
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,261
Go ahead and try. Give it a go.

231
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:18,590
But it's not going to work.

232
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,031
They're so trustworthy.

233
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,690
I look forward to this.

234
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,700
But really. 1MILLION will have to be groundbreaking.

235
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,171
- Their pattern is too obvious. - Yes.

236
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,671
KINKY and BLACK.Q of EO-DDAE...

237

versus Yechan and Alexx of 1MILLION.

Their duo battle begins now!

He's as tall as PRIME KINGZ.

405
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:40,270
He can go head-to-head with PRIME KINGZ given his height.

We'll make the other crews fear us to the end.

Hey, he's bigger than you guys.

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,911
Fight Judges, card open.

491
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,480
I think our techniques...

492
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,520
were better than Hulk's.

493
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,821
We have a good chance of winning.

494
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:55,250
The name of the song is "Victory Song."

495
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,421
"We'll win no matter what."

496
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,290
Three, two, one.

497
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,730
(JustJerk wins by 3 to 0.)

498
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,760
(Hugging)

499
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,161
(Roaring)

500
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,671
Yejun and Hulk of JustJerk...

501
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,740
will give the first No-Respect Punch to PRIME KINGZ.

502
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,371
It's your first defeat!

503
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:17,581
I think this was a mistake on PRIME KINGZ's part.

504
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,780
I agree.

505
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,480
It looked like...

506
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,151
you weren't fully ready as a duo.

507
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,980
"Since we're good, this will do for this battle."

508
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,891
You might not have taken this battle not as seriously.

509
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,121
So I was a bit disappointed.

510
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,861
Their expectations were too high.

511
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:33,831
(Knucks and DOOR's moves didn't meet their expectations.)

512
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,530
I thought this performance was "JustHulk."

513
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,000
("JustHulk")

514
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,970
(Hulk and Yejun showed perfect teamwork.)

515
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,240
Your moves were very powerful.

516
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,611
And you had great teamwork too.

517
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,311
I could see that you were here to win this time.

518
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,081
We showed it to PRIME KINGZ.

519
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,581
I thought they switched.

520
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,250
I thought they were PRIME KINGZ.

521
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,720
Gosh. Anything can happen.

522
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:01,450
JustJerk, you're the winner of this battle.

523
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,361
Give the No-Respect Punch to PRIME KINGZ.

524
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,460
No.

525
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,591
They put it right in the middle.

526
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,431
Go away, Hulk.

527
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,800
PRIME KINGZ will keep losing from now on.

528
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,000
This isn't everything. We still have a lot to show.

529
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,970
Everyone needs to be on their toes.

530
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,710
I feel like we'll be next.

531
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,480
I hope we're called last.

532
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:28,550
We should go last so we can destroy everyone.

533
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,780
The next dancers are...

534
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,421
1MILLION's Yumeki and Root.

535
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,561
- Yeah! - Let's go!

536
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,431
- Who are they? - Our ace in the hole!

537
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,431
Hey Brothers.

538
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,960
Is Yumeki in the sky blue?

539
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,601
No, the neon.

540
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,401
(I am Yumeki.)

541
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,331
Is he the youngest in 1MILLION?

542
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,000
- No, he's not the youngest. - No, he's not the youngest.

543
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,970
But I feel like choreography teams will only do choreography.

544
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,510
They won't even be able to imitate battle moves.

545
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,381
They have a lot of stickers.

546
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,450
We'll end up becoming the worst crew at this rate.

547
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,121
We have to win now.

548
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,450
That's right. We need to.

549
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,520
To be honest, attacking 1MILLION is the best.

550
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,161
1MILLION does seem like the weakest crew.

551
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:14,661
If we choose 1MILLION, it sort of guarantees a safe spot for us.

552
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,960
Everyone's looking down on us.

553
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,561
It makes me mad.

554
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,901
I was upset, and it got me worked up...

555
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,901
from head to toe.

556
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,641
Honestly, I'm confident you guys will do well...

557
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:27,871
no matter where it might be.

558
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,911
Out of all the dancers in SMF,

559
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:31,911
Yumeki is the best at dancing.

560
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,280
Yumeki is world-class.

561
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,681
His dancing is super impactful.

562
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:41,250
He can make everyone remember his dancing after seeing it once.

563
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,020
The way he moves his body is uncommon in Korea.

564
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,030
He can bend his back and moves his hips like he has no bones.

565
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,161
(Like this?)

566
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,861
How does he do it?

567
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:56,200
Yumeki and Root are the youngest in our crew...

568
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,641
but in terms of skills,

569
00:23:57,641 --> 00:24:00,510
they are superior to any of the other dancers.

570
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,270
- We're going to win no matter what. - Yes.

571
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:03,911
- No matter what. - You need to destroy them.

572
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,510
If we lose right now, we're doomed.

573
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,280
This is not a dance battle. It's war.

574
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,411
- Our ace in the hole! - Hey Brothers.

575
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,621
- Just do what you usually do. - Okay.

576
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,220
Our guys are amazing.

577
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,391
Which crew is 1MILLION's underdog crew?

578
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,460
The underdog crew we can beat is...

579
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,661
Choose us.

580
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Please pick us.

582

They had totally different styles.

(We Dem Boyz wins, JustJerk loses)

1185

You can't win against someone determined to win.

1186

We Dem Boyz had a clear target...

That was the approach they took.

1191

And the teamwork was great.

1192
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,041
I really liked JustJerk's routine too.

1193
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,271
But to be honest, it looked like...

1194
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:27,780
a highlight of all the hits you had before.

1195
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,181
In a way,

1196
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,181
you just satirized the identity of JustJerk.

1197
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,490
It was clever.

1198

It was clever and witty.

1199
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,420
I thought it was impossible to beat a team...

that came after you at full force.

1201
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:45,331
I really believe that you cannot overlook the teamwork...

1202
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:47,260
of people who are on the same wavelengths.

1203
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,670
We really showed everyone how good our teamwork was.

1204
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,871
So it was rewarding. And we were proud of our performance.

1205
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,470
We were thrilled at that moment.

1206

The crew that will kick off this battle is...

1222
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,780
All right. Which crew is it?

1223
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:38,720
It's Mbitious.

1224
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:40,550
- Gosh. - Mbitious.

1225
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,621
- I see. - Nice.

Honestly, I'm not looking forward to Mbitious' teamwork.

It's 5-on-5.

1230

So it's a team battle.

1231
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,101
They had been trying to beat each other up until two days ago.

1232
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,470
I doubt that those guys will have any teamwork.

1233
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,371
I was expecting this.

1234
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:00,470
I knew they would look down on us.

1235
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,771

Overall, they're all pointing out...

1239
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,251
that our teamwork won't be good.

1240
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,550
They never saw us perform.

1241
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,220
We can show them later.

1242
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,590
This is our first performance as a team.

1243
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,891
Since we had just formed our team,

1244
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:20,661
the rest of them assumed that our teamwork would be bad.

1245
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,931
And I want to prove them wrong.

1246
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,461
Okay. They're all dead meat.

1247
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,260
We're going to crush the 5-on-5 battle.

Just pick us.

00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,010
We'll show you what teamwork is.

1252
00:54:38,211 --> 00:54:39,240
We would thank them.

1253
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,340
We would get another win under our belt.

1254

- What? - They need to win a battle.

1260
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,391
They are strategic.

1261
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,760
I realized that...

1262
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,431
we couldn't just sit back and enjoy the battles.

1263

One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven.

(YGX has 8 No-Respect Punches.)

1269
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,311
They have about the same stickers as us.

1270
00:55:15,251 --> 00:55:17,251
Right now, there's a chance that we'll start...

1271
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,880
as No-Respect Crew.

1272
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,581
If we focus on the competition,

1273
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:22,650
we should go after YGX.

1274
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:23,650
It's a strategy.

1275
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,561
- We can't be ranked eighth. - Right.

1276
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:26,920
It's our first mission.

1277
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,961
And everyone thinks we're weak.

1278
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,731
If we can't overturn this,

1279
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,731
we'll be known as the weakest crew.

1280
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,170
"We can't lose. We must win."

1281
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,101
I think we can beat them without a doubt.

1282
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,470
So we chose YGX, the crew with the most stickers.

1283
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:44,670
I was really relieved.

1284
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,840
I became spiteful.

1285
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,681
We need to show them something.

1286
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,481
I don't want to end this with only one win.

1287
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,081
But when we found out that Mbitious was in seventh place,

1288
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,121
we thought it was our chance. It was our golden opportunity.

1289
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:58,791
Shouldn't we battle Mbitious?

1290
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,461
So we have the same number of stickers?

1291
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,990
Mbitious? So we're tied?

1292
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,691
They will be our insurance.

1293
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,570
(YGX watched Mbitious's crew battle.)

1294
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,630
Mbitious' performance isn't that strong.

1295
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:11,630
Right.

1296
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:14,800
With one more win, we might be able...

1297
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,141
to avoid getting placed last.

1298
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,941
Then the table will turn.

1299
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,380
Guys.

1300
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,311
Let's just dance our heads off.

1301
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:25,450
Right. Let's just do our best.

1302

They're not the ones whose videos have ten million views.

We'll show you why you should be called Half-Million.

1464
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:26,800
I didn't get why EO-DDAE saw us as a threat.

1465
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:28,501
We're way out of their league.

1466
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,740
Out of all the crews coming onto this show,

1467
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,780
EO-DDAE was the one that threatened us the least.

1468
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,581
The other crews are so notably strong,

1469
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:37,681
and EO-DDAE has no place among them.

1470
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,220
They're the fun ones.

1471

- You see them as clowns? - I expect them to make us laugh.

1472
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,021
- Half-Million? - EO-DDAE came by.

1473
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,461
"They will not be able to overcome their lack of teamwork."

1474
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:48,090
- Are they talking about themselves? - Lack of teamwork?

1475
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:50,231
There is no limit to our teamwork.

1476
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,360
They don't stand a chance against us.

1477

You're not even on our radar.

- EO-DDAE? - We are great!

No, you're the worst.

Call me scared.

1484

EO-DDAE is a crew with its own unique style.

1485
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,990
Meanwhile, 1MILLION leads the K-pop dancing industry.

01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:06,531
between the two crews who lost the most.

1619
01:11:07,561 --> 01:11:09,000
The number of losses matters.

1620
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,830
The losing crew...

1621
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:13,441
will be named the No-Respect Crew.

1622
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,701
The battle of the low-rankers.

1623
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:17,210
There must be a lot of crews with a lot of losses.

1624
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:19,010
I think it's 1MILLION.

1625
01:11:19,271 --> 01:11:22,141
I couldn't believe how bad I was at battles.

1626
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:24,710
Compared to the others, 1MILLION seems weak.

1627
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,380
EO-DDAE beat 1MILLION 3 times.

1628
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,380
The crews that specialize in choreography...

1629
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,220
are weak when it comes to battles.

1630
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:32,521
Mbitious has a lot of stickers too.

1631
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,090
We have collected quite a number of losses.

1632
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,191
(Mbitious kept on losing.)

1633
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,861
They weren't as strong as I thought they'd be.

1634
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,960
The only member who can battle is 5000.

1635
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,701
But even 5000 lost in the end.

1636
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,701
It's not like they'd have a lot of chemistry.

1637
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:46,771
- YGX started in last place. - What?

1638
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:48,201
They started off being last place.

1639
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,210
The first crew that will be eliminated is YGX.

1640
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,910
YGX is dominating with all its losses.

1641
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,311
- YGX... - It is too much of an underdog.

1642
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:57,781
The fact is that they're not good enough.

1643
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,580
Are they even good enough to be on Street Man Fighter?

1644
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:04,420
(Which crew will compete in the No-Respect Round?)

1645
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:06,561
My pride won't allow our crew being last place.

1646
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,491
The true underdog? I don't even want to think about it.

1647
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,830
Of course, I wanted to avoid it.

1648
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:14,401
Which crew has the most losses?

1649
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,800
This crew had 2 wins and 8 losses.

1650
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:18,170
It's YGX.

1651
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,970
(The first crew YGX has eight losses.)

1652
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,201
It isn't over for us.

1653
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,611
This crew has the same losses as YGX.

1654
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:26,681
This crew and YGX.

1655
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:29,611
- With YGX? - Yes, they're both at minus eight.

1656
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:32,481
Mbitious...

1657
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:33,750
(Mbitious)

1658
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,391

(The second crew Mbitious has eight losses)

1660
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,431
The crew that's in last place is YGX.

1661
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:48,660
and Mbitious is right above them.

1662
01:12:48,861 --> 01:12:53,040
The crew that loses in this match becomes the final No-Respect crew.

1663
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,771
That's cruel!

1664
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:55,941
This is so fun though.

1665
01:12:55,941 --> 01:12:57,241
It's really cruel and fun.

1666
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:01,010
Of the two crews, which crew is weaker?

1667
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,241
I really don't want to lose.

1668
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:03,651
We can't lose.

1669
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:05,981
I didn't think we could be in last place,

1670
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,420
but when I came to realize what was going on,

1671
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:10,090
we were on the edge of a cliff.

1672
01:13:10,991 --> 01:13:13,260
The fact that we're competing against the weakest crew...

1673
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,420
It really hurts our pride.

1674
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,231
Despite that, I think we are so desperate.

1675
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:21,800
We want to win that at the least.

1676
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:27,500
No-Respect round will proceed as a one on one match.

1677
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,141
- One on one? - One on one. That's it.

1678
01:13:29,141 --> 01:13:30,970
Gosh, this is nerve racking.

1679
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,181
This has to be strategic, then.

1680
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:36,040
Either send out their best and risk everything...

1681
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,811
This is really important.

(They discuss how to decide the battler.)

1683

If they want to win, 5000 should go out.

01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:42,781
I would prefer that we choose...

1685

either me or Tae Hyun.

1686

YGX and Mbitious, have you decided?

1687
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,460
Yes.

1688
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:53,401
The member that will pull us out from this pit is...

1689
01:13:54,231 --> 01:13:55,300
Hyunse.

1690

It was really surprising...

Hyunse, you've got good rhythm.

We thought that the person who could have a good rhythm...

1706
01:14:27,901 --> 01:14:31,431
and be good while doing freestyle would be Hyunse.

they're just a one-man team.

and I could see that he was even more determined than me.

1742

He's the leader. I know how he feels.

He probably feels more burdened than me.

I guess 5000 really wants to overcome that.

- He looks really angry. - Yes, he's really angry.

the dancer that shows the first move will kick it off.

And the other dancer will automatically go afterwards.

You felt like a hidden gem.

To be frank, we watched 5000 dance all day long.

Earlier, I said he was like an ascetic.

But it seemed like he became human again.

5000 was never that aggressive...

- during battles. - Okay.

he looked very competitive.

1911
01:23:55,099 --> 01:23:57,470
And I think that backfired.

1912
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:00,979
It was a man who had nothing to lose versus who had something to lose.

(Had nothing to lose versus had something to lose)

1914
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:05,609
5000 kind of worked himself up.

- Contrary to earlier. - Yes.

1916

He lacked composure.

1917

I've never seen 5000 battle like that before.

1918
01:24:12,349 --> 01:24:15,519
I saw 5000's body trembling on its own.

1919
01:24:17,729 --> 01:24:21,399
Our leader was like, "I will kill everyone no matter what."

1920
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:26,069
So that's how 5000 is like when he's desperate.

Can I even call it choreography?

He was basically just freestyle dancing.

He prepared it in his own way.

Young Jay might actually fly up in the air.

2408
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:06,050
If he has something to complain, I hope he can talk to me.

2409
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,580
To me, it felt like he was keeping me in check.

2410

Is there anyone here who can win over me by dancing?

2411

Let me show them what I've got.

- In Gyoo. - The song doesn't suit him.

2416
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,970
I think the choreography will be flowy.

2417
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,170
I'm curious how In Gyoo created the choreography.

2418
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:29,370
I think it would be easy and fun.

2419
01:44:34,939 --> 01:44:37,710
I thought I should look at it cold-heartedly and rationally.

2420
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:40,010
The immersion wasn't bad.

2421
01:44:40,109 --> 01:44:43,180
In Gyoo's choreography was very cool.

2422
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:45,319
It felt like In Gyoo's choreography.

(Choi Young Jun, sub leader of 1MILLION)

2424
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:50,189
I think Choi Young Jun will show great choreography.

2425
01:44:50,189 --> 01:44:51,830
He's done so many K-pop choreographies.

2426
01:44:51,859 --> 01:44:54,029
I'm looking forward to Young Jun's.

2427
01:44:54,029 --> 01:44:55,229
He's the biggest ambush.

2428
01:44:55,229 --> 01:44:56,760
Right. He's an ambush.

2429
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:00,000
I think he made an easy and sensible choreography.

2430
01:45:00,099 --> 01:45:02,340
I think he would have made it too much on the contrary.

2431
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:03,769
I think he'll ruin being too much.

2432
01:45:03,769 --> 01:45:05,340
- Because he put in too much effort? - Yes.

2433
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:12,550
I'm sorry.

I was so nervous. They wanted to find fault with me.

It was natural for me to be nervous.

I'm sorry. I'm going crazy.

Please play the music now.

2442
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:36,599
I was slightly shocked. I've seen him dance for a long time.

2443
01:45:36,599 --> 01:45:39,769
I've never seen him that nervous.

2444
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:42,340
I've practiced about a thousand times.

2445

01:45:50,779 --> 01:45:53,449
But he wasn't like the usual Young Jun that I've known.

2450
01:45:53,449 --> 01:45:56,689
The tension kept going up, and he had a hard time coping.

01:45:56,889 --> 01:45:59,529
So I liked it. Nice.

2452

over the human level.

Wootae, Dony, and J HO.

(J HO, sub leader of JustJerk)

2461
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:31,760
J HO's choreography was a bit rushed.

2462
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,660
The foundation was neat and nice.

2463
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,930
But there was no memorable move.

2464
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:39,430
He made the choreography so boring that he was out of my checklist.

(Dony, sub leader of YGX)

2466

I find him the most in check.

2467
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:48,340
He performed with the artists more than 2,000 times.

2468
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:51,010
So I think he's the most veteran of all.

2469
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:54,510
YGX lost a lot during the battle, but nobody knows.

Whenever the flow changed, it wasn't naturally linked.

2474
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:10,899
It's a choreography for an artist.

2475
01:47:10,899 --> 01:47:13,670
The main dancer of the dance didn't look cool.

(Wootae, sub leader of Mbitious)

2477

Wootae is known to create good choreography.

He knows that he's good at it too.

It was not as good as mine.

I think KINKY made the wrong choreography.

01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:04,849
He mixed with Girlish genre. I didn't want to dance that.

It's really boring.

Wootae's choreography is easy.

I think Young Jun's and my choreography were the best.

I only voted for him because I thought it wouldn't get picked.

And the fact that I was practicing the choreography...

I was practicing for hours.

You asked me why I didn't work hard.

2743

I couldn't work hard because his choreography was boring.

I really didn't want to work hard.

But this choreography is too easy.

2754
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:57,340
In my opinion, this choreography was plain.

02:04:42,041 --> 02:04:45,611
If you work on the choreography until the end,

2885
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:48,251
I think you'll get a more complete version performance...

just for the Sub Leader Class.

2887

So we decided the main dancer...

of the Sub Leader Class to be Wootae.

2889

Young Jay practiced the hardest.

Right.

My first goal is to get the points.

02:11:54,077 --> 02:11:55,936
I knew it was going to be mine.

3045
02:11:59,507 --> 02:12:01,677
(I couldn't make it.)

3046
02:12:01,677 --> 02:12:02,776
(Root of 1MILLION)

3047
02:12:02,776 --> 02:12:03,986
- It's him? - Yes.

3048
02:12:05,047 --> 02:12:06,917
First place goes to PRIME KINGZ.

3049
02:12:10,186 --> 02:12:13,726
PRIME KINGZ is a total disaster.

3050
02:12:14,457 --> 02:12:16,797
(PRIME KINGZ is struggling.)

3051
02:12:16,797 --> 02:12:20,997
(It's best to eliminate them fast.)

3052
02:12:21,037 --> 02:12:22,236
It was embarrassing yesterday.

3053
02:12:22,367 --> 02:12:24,406
Me too. It was humiliating.

3054
02:12:24,406 --> 02:12:27,037
I got mad at my own mistakes.

3055
02:12:27,177 --> 02:12:29,537
The worst dancer candidate among the rookies...

3056

Middle One Class. Middle Two Class.

3057
02:12:33,077 --> 02:12:35,646
Leader Class. Sub Leader Class.

3058
02:12:35,917 --> 02:12:38,917
I'll announce the worst dancer candidate.

3059
02:12:39,117 --> 02:12:41,486
The worse dancer candidate is...

3060
02:12:41,486 --> 02:12:43,726
Please don't pick me.

3061

My goodness.
