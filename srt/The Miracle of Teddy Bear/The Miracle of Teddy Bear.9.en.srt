1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:09,105
You've had him follow me
since we separated.

2
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,105
Are you a psychopath?

3
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:12,305
Why are you doing this?

4
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:16,265
I'm doing all this because I love you.

5
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,305
If I can't be happy, then no one will be.

6
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:21,064
If I wasn't indecisive,

7
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:24,064
if I had been firm…

8
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:28,105
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

9
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:29,785
She didn't really love him.

10
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm just a product of their mistake.

11
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:34,464
Am I supposed to give up

12
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,505
and be a coward like you?

13
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,064
And behave immorally like you?

14
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,505
-I can't do it.
-Tarn!

15
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:45,105
I already have plenty of friends.

16
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:47,265
But now,

17
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:49,344
I want you.

18
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,105
Happy birthday, Nut.

19
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,665
We made you a cake.

20
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:59,505
What decoration do you want
on your cake this year?

21
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:03,824
I want a rainbow.

22
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,824
With these colors please, Mom.

23
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:10,185
That looks hard.

24
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,945
You need to help me then.

25
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,385
All right.

26
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:17,425
You are a boy.
You shouldn't like pastel rainbows.

27
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,065
It's silly.

28
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,704
You should teach him right from wrong.

29
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:34,024
Don't spoil him.

30
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,505
Nut.

31
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:06,865
How about we pick a new pattern?

32
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,385
How about an ocean?

33
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,665
Nut.

34
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:13,065
What pattern would you like
on your birthday cake?

35
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:14,305
Anything is fine, Mom.

36
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,745
Can you put a piece in a box for me?

37
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:22,225
I want my friend to try it.

38
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:23,344
Sure.

39
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,505
Look at the activities you do.

40
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,305
Don't you know how to do
any manly activities?

41
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,425
It might be almost 20 years late.

42
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:53,704
But I still want to do this for you.

43
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,344
I may have made mistakes in the past.

44
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,425
But please know that…

45
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:09,464
you are not one of them.

46
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,704
You are my gift.

47
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,105
Happy birthday.

48
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,385
I'm not too late, am I?

49
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,225
Happy birthday, Nut.

50
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,865
I wish you happiness.

51
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,105
Thank you.

52
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,585
-Sure.
-Let's go inside.

53
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,665
It might seem a little old,

54
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,944
but doesn't it look like
the teddy bear you lost?

55
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,745
Yes, it really does.

56
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:46,424
I didn't think I would find a teddy bear

57
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,025
similar to your last one.

58
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,225
I was lucky, I guess.

59
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,225
Do you know

60
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,625
that I worked really hard to find it?

61
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:15,665
I put in a lot of effort.

62
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,465
The same goes for the feelings

63
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,944
that I have for you.

64
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:31,985
I know

65
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,145
that we haven't known
each other for so long.

66
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:37,865
It might be too early

67
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:40,385
for me to be saying this.

68
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,585
But I can't let any more time pass by.

69
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:51,184
On my first day at work,

70
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:54,544
you scolded those drunks for me.

71
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,985
You looked so damn cool.

72
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,985
I became your fan after that day.

73
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:05,145
Although you pretended not to care,

74
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,184
ignored me,

75
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,265
and had that confused look on your face,

76
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:13,544
your heart was filled with warmth

77
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,665
and I couldn't stop myself
from falling for you.

78
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,304
I didn't know

79
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,585
the best way to confess my feelings,

80
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:32,625
so I bought you this special gift.

81
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,865
Thank you so much

82
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:43,265
for this special gift, Prib.

83
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,465
However, no matter how similar
this teddy bear is to my old one,

84
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,345
I can't accept it.

85
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,265
Prib.

86
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,345
You know that I don't feel the same way.

87
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,705
I understand.

88
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,345
I know

89
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,265
that I can't change your mind.

90
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,585
I just wanted to show you

91
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:32,385
how serious I am about you.

92
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,505
It's okay

93
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:40,824
if you feel differently.

94
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,625
It's okay

95
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,544
if you don't love me.

96
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:58,064
I'm okay.

97
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:03,385
Prib.

98
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,025
I came to wish you a happy birthday.

99
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:18,505
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

100
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,865
Even though
I can't be that someone for you,

101
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:37,465
-we can still--
-Stop.

102
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,064
I know what you are going to say.

103
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,064
You're going to say

104
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,265
that I can be your sister, right?

105
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:03,704
Can you?

106
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:21,225
I'm not ready right now.

107
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:26,145
But I will be.

108
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:08,704
Prib.

109
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,064
Shall we go home?

110
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:17,944
It's okay.

111
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,544
I got here on my own.

112
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,385
I can go home alone as well.

113
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:25,905
I'll be all right.

114
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:38,745
Are you all right?

115
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:40,345
Yes.

116
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:42,465
I'm okay.

117
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,105
You're not okay.

118
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:50,385
You're eating barbecue with a teddy bear.

119
00:15:50,944 --> 00:15:52,824
Are you sure you're okay? Are you?

120
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,345
I'm hungry.

121
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,424
And I'm sad.

122
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,704
I saw her holding the teddy bear

123
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,265
and tripping over

124
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,105
in front of the restaurant,

125
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,584
so I called you.

126
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,025
Prib.

127
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,704
What are you going to do
with that teddy bear?

128
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:26,105
I'm going to donate it.

129
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:28,944
Nut doesn't want it.

130
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:33,625
But I'm sure somebody
will want it one day.

131
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,424
All right then.

132
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,025
Cheer up. Somebody will want you
one day too.

133
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,665
Right?

134
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,304
I'm beautiful, kind, and cute.

135
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,105
Plus, I've got time for him.

136
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:50,385
How can nobody want me?

137
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,424
Why am I so unlucky?

138
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:00,785
I always end up in the friend zone.

139
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,224
Prib, your soulmate might be a foreigner.

140
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:11,545
A foreign creature from another world.

141
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,184
Being his friend

142
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,984
is better than being a stranger.

143
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:22,944
That's right.

144
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,944
You are better off as his friend.

145
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,545
The bond will last longer.

146
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,905
Are you comforting me or rubbing it in?

147
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,744
I'm comforting you.

148
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,385
I love you.

149
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:38,665
Eat this.

150
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:39,825
It will keep you quiet.

151
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:41,984
It's hot.

152
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,705
I love you too, mister.

153
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:47,905
Wait, what?

154
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,865
What a sneaky little bastard.

155
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,264
Stop.

156
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,345
You can drink,

157
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,065
but don't throw up like last time.

158
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:58,305
What are you doing, Nut?

159
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:01,744
Well…

160
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,065
I'm recording this moment like you do.

161
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,225
You're recording it?

162
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:07,585
Then I should be in it too.

163
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:24,945
Thank you

164
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,665
for throwing me a birthday party.

165
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,665
Do you like it?

166
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:33,264
Yes.

167
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:35,705
Do you like the party

168
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,625
or me?

169
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,665
What a cheap shot.

170
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,705
Well…

171
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:46,625
I like both of them.

172
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,264
What about the teddy bear?

173
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,465
Did you not like it?

174
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:55,825
No.

175
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:58,225
It kind of freaked me out.

176
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:01,425
How could they look so similar?

177
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:04,465
But the truth is

178
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,665
their colors,

179
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,105
eyes,

180
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,665
and smells were different.

181
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,385
And most importantly,

182
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:18,504
it wasn't as warm to hug.

183
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,185
That's why you didn't like it.

184
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:26,784
Yes.

185
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:30,945
Despite their similarities,

186
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,145
the teddy bear is irreplaceable.

187
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:39,784
What if

188
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:42,744
it's me?

189
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,905
Am I good enough
to replace your teddy bear?

190
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,185
You are you.

191
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,225
You can't replace anyone.

192
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,425
When you asked me what I wanted

193
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:01,585
for my birthday

194
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:03,905
and I said nothing,

195
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:09,905
that's because

196
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,585
I already have you.

197
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,185
Stay by my side…

198
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:25,705
and don't go anywhere.

199
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,185
What did you do, Tofu?

200
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:54,784
It's how adults make promises.

201
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,425
I promise

202
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,744
to be with you forever.

203
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:04,665
In that case…

204
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:07,465
please stay

205
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:11,585
with me tonight.

206
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,865
What a wonderful night.

207
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:43,024
I've become Nut's special someone.

208
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:47,105
And I'm going back to Nut's room.

209
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,225
Hey.

210
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,145
You weren't sleeping.

211
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,145
I was curious to see

212
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,425
what you were going to do.

213
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,185
Why didn't you wake me up?

214
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:11,465
Well…

215
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,504
I wanted to stay like this.

216
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:20,625
Thank you

217
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:23,585
for coming here.

218
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,705
Thank you for caring about me.

219
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,585
Thank you for everything.

220
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,865
Without you,

221
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,585
I'm not sure
if I would have gotten through it.

222
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:43,145
Your mom said

223
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:46,665
love isn't about doing
something for someone.

224
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:50,744
It's about putting your heart into it.

225
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,625
My heart is all yours.

226
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,345
Yes, I know.

227
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,264
I wish we could stay this way forever.

228
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,665
You smell nice.

229
00:25:18,264 --> 00:25:19,425
So does your hair.

230
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,905
But I think

231
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:44,024
you stink.

232
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:47,744
It's your hair.

233
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,065
Smell it.

234
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:57,225
It doesn't stink.

235
00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:58,385
It stinks.

236
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:03,705
It doesn't.

237
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:05,145
Trust me. It stinks.

238
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,065
Go take a shower.

239
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:12,544
I'll wash your hair for you.

240
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:11,665
Kuenchai.

241
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,984
Kuenchai.

242
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,544
Kuenchai, come eat.

243
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:27,905
I'm leaving, Mom.

244
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:29,544
Okay.

245
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:33,705
I'm leaving.

246
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,264
Did you forget something?

247
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:44,945
What?

248
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:48,185
Your lunchbox.

249
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:13,385
Thank you.

250
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,665
I'll get going then.

251
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,865
I realized

252
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:30,744
why people were yearning for love.

253
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,825
Love is a wonderful thing.

254
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:38,064
It's so wonderful that I don't want
to be a teddy bear again.

255
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:15,784
Prib, are you heartbroken again?

256
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,544
You're drawing men.

257
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,625
Yes, I'm permanently heartbroken.

258
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:25,345
Did you confess your feelings to that guy?

259
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:28,264
Yes, we talked it out.

260
00:29:30,264 --> 00:29:31,385
Are you sad?

261
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,744
It's no use being sad.

262
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,825
I better put my time into something else.

263
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:38,865
I have an important mission.

264
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,585
What are you talking about?

265
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,984
I'm going to find that person for Tarn.

266
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:49,945
Perhaps,

267
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:52,705
I was born for this.

268
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:56,544
You…

269
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:11,425
Kuenchai, come and eat.

270
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:17,544
You already gave him his food.

271
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:20,984
Did I?

272
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:28,385
When?

273
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,905
What's wrong, Tofu?

274
00:31:43,984 --> 00:31:46,665
You were happy this morning.

275
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:49,865
It's Mrs. Na.

276
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:52,705
Lately,

277
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:54,465
she has been forgetful.

278
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,625
She forgot that she had fed Kuenchai
this morning.

279
00:31:58,145 --> 00:31:59,544
And this book,

280
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,984
she has been reading the same page.

281
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:07,945
Maybe it's…

282
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:12,425
The medicine makes her…

283
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,385
Is everyone okay?

284
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,304
Well…

285
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:17,225
I'm sorry.

286
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:19,945
I guess I didn't get enough sleep.

287
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,225
I was going to say

288
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:24,465
maybe it's a side effect of her medicine.

289
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:28,504
The medicine makes her drowsy.

290
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:30,425
I guess so.

291
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:31,625
By the way,

292
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:33,304
are you sure you're okay?

293
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,984
I don't know.

294
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:38,145
I've been feeling sleepy.

295
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,824
I'm sleepy all the time.

296
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:41,784
Sleepy?

297
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,544
Ms. Sofa.

298
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:51,585
Ms. Sofa.

299
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:58,665
Mr. Right Slipper.

300
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:00,465
Can you hear me?

301
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:18,145
Ms. Sofa and Mr. Right Slipper fell asleep

302
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:19,824
since the big fight.

303
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:22,665
I thought they were taking a nap.

304
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:24,984
But it has been too long.

305
00:33:25,544 --> 00:33:28,385
We don't usually fall asleep
for more than two days

306
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:30,304
except…

307
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:32,304
Except what?

308
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,784
Except when we don't ever wake up again.

309
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,024
Don't wake up again?

310
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:41,465
Have there been pieces of furniture
that fell asleep

311
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:43,824
and not woken up again?

312
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,304
Of course.

313
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:47,385
Mr. Sib's chair.

314
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:49,665
It happened after he died.

315
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:52,225
Mrs. Na and Nut barely spoke.

316
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,905
The house was quiet,

317
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:56,225
so were the pieces of furniture in it.

318
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:00,345
Ms. Sofa and Mr. Right Slipper

319
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:01,945
might not wake up again.

320
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:06,024
So, it might happen to me too, right?

321
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,625
What should I do?

322
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:18,145
Do you want to know
where I got the teddy bear?

323
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,304
Yes.

324
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:22,225
It's really important to me.

325
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:24,665
How did you get it?

326
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,505
I drew a sketch of the teddy bear
as you suggested

327
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,585
and posted it on Instagram.

328
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:37,864
After that, someone messaged me
saying she saw it at a store.

329
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:41,505
She sent me a photo
and I saw that it looked really similar.

330
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:45,625
So I reached out to the store's owner.

331
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,744
She said it was still available.

332
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:51,944
She gave me a special discount
because it was old.

333
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,944
I took the offer without even thinking.

334
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:57,265
After I transferred the money,
she shipped it.

335
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:58,665
By the way,

336
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:00,265
what's the name

337
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:01,465
of the store?

338
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:05,665
It's called "Beloved".

339
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,545
It's in an old mall near Nut's house.

340
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:14,185
That's right.

341
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,225
I was hiding from Nut here.

342
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:19,904
This is why everything feels
very familiar,

343
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,825
especially

344
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:23,384
this store.

345
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:52,065
Have I reached a dead end?

346
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:54,585
I must have come from this store,

347
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:56,944
just like the teddy bear Prib bought.

348
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:00,105
But…

349
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:05,705
It can't end like this.

350
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:08,904
BELOVED

351
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,944
The store is closed.

352
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:13,825
Yes, I heard.

353
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,105
I just called the owner.

354
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:21,944
She said she got two teddy bears
at the same time.

355
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,745
She sold one of them a long time ago.

356
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,625
I bought the last one.

357
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,305
Do you want one?

358
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:33,625
No.

359
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:36,105
Did she say

360
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:37,985
who bought the first one?

361
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:40,145
Yes.

362
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:45,785
She said it was a tall male student.

363
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:11,505
Could it be the same teddy bear Nut lost?

364
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:20,025
Yes.

365
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,505
It's the same one.

366
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,464
If I can't find that person,

367
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:44,825
I might fall asleep like Mr. Sib's chair,

368
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,145
Mr. Right Slipper,

369
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,464
and Ms. Sofa.

370
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:52,904
What should I do?

371
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:54,665
I don't want to leave Nut.

372
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:09,105
Here, boss.

373
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:18,985
It's lacking something.

374
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,985
I can't think of it.

375
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:24,185
It's at the tip of my tongue.

376
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,105
Is it character?

377
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:28,105
Yes, it's lacking character.

378
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:29,985
We want to set up a scene like this.

379
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:32,145
This location won't do.

380
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:33,785
Are there other options?

381
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,305
Yes, there are two more.

382
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,225
Show me.

383
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:47,265
Hold on. Go back to the second last photo.

384
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:48,265
Okay.

385
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:52,944
Yes.

386
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:56,545
I like it.

387
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,025
It's perfect for the storyline.

388
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,265
Will this place do, Nut?

389
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,665
Nut.

390
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,265
It's perfect for the script.

391
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:17,384
What do you think?

392
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:20,105
Nut!

393
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:22,545
Yes.

394
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,545
I asked, what do you think?

395
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:29,424
If everyone thinks it's a good location,

396
00:39:29,944 --> 00:39:31,585
we can go with it.

397
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:35,825
Okay, contact the place
and check the price.

398
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,665
I just got off work.

399
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:43,745
Let's go out.

400
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,305
What's wrong?

401
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,464
Where are you now?

402
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:57,305
What?

403
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:59,345
Where?

404
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:38,424
What are you doing here?

405
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,864
I came to buy something for your mom,

406
00:40:43,545 --> 00:40:47,025
then I realized that we had chased
each other here before.

407
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:56,424
Let's go somewhere else.

408
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:00,904
Nut.

409
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:06,545
Why didn't you

410
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:08,944
follow me inside back then?

411
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:18,985
Did you dislike something inside?

412
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:26,065
Why are you asking me that now?

413
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:27,745
Or were you

414
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:30,305
scared of something?

415
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:34,864
No.

416
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:36,705
Get in the car.

417
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,545
If Nut's special someone
bought the bear from that store,

418
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:54,625
why was Nut hesitant to go inside?

419
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,305
Did something happen in there?

420
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:08,424
Why didn't you

421
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:10,065
follow me inside back then?

422
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:11,825
Did you dislike something inside?

423
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,625
Or were you

424
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:15,825
scared of something?

425
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:04,105
Nut.

426
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,825
Nut, hurry up
or we will miss the trailers.

427
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:10,145
Wait a second.

428
00:43:10,225 --> 00:43:11,665
Let me use the toilet first.

429
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,384
Fine.

430
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:33,785
It's cute.

431
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:40,864
It's as warm as a person.

432
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:45,705
It's warmer to hug a person.

433
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:53,464
Don't you need the toilet?

434
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:54,745
The movie is starting.

435
00:44:00,025 --> 00:44:00,944
Let's go.

436
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,345
That scene really impressed me.

437
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:25,265
-Which scene?
-Take a guess.

438
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:27,464
-The book opening scene?
-Yes.

439
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:28,745
When the book was opened

440
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:31,065
and the music started,

441
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,105
I almost cried.

442
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,785
-Were you sucked in?
-Of course.

443
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:38,864
That person had a crush
on the other person for a long time

444
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,424
-but they had to say goodbye.
-Nut!

445
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:01,345
Nut.

446
00:45:07,944 --> 00:45:08,864
You're right.

447
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:11,705
A lot of things happened there.

448
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:15,864
My best and worst memories

449
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,225
happened there at one point in my life.

450
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:22,625
I'll tell you about it

451
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:24,625
when I'm ready.

452
00:45:28,065 --> 00:45:29,505
You went there with him,

453
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:32,785
didn't you?

454
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:39,225
Yes.

455
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:44,505
Are you jealous?

456
00:45:47,705 --> 00:45:49,265
Can I be jealous?

457
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,585
You don't need my permission

458
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:54,225
to be jealous.

459
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,145
You shouldn't be jealous.

460
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:06,145
Right now,

461
00:46:06,904 --> 00:46:08,585
you are my present.

462
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:12,705
Let's go.

463
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:21,505
Although Nut hasn't completely opened
his heart to me,

464
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:23,745
I will keep waiting.

465
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:34,864
Yes, Mom.

466
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:38,025
What?

467
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:39,944
We've run out of it again?

468
00:46:42,105 --> 00:46:43,305
All right, Mom.

469
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:47,025
Let's go.

470
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:57,185
These three, please.

471
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:00,944
Didn't I just buy some last week?

472
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:02,705
Why have we run out?

473
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:07,025
Your mom has been feeding Kuenchai
a lot more often.

474
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,585
Some days she feeds him several times.

475
00:47:25,424 --> 00:47:26,384
Nut.

476
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:29,984
Please send your mother my regards.

477
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:31,505
-It has been a while.
-I will.

478
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:33,424
Oh, my…

479
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:35,505
You're shopping together as a couple.

480
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:36,785
How adorable.

481
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,464
Who?

482
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:44,864
You and Tofu.

483
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:46,825
I mean, who asked you?

484
00:47:49,944 --> 00:47:53,185
Come on, don't be shy. I understand.

485
00:47:53,265 --> 00:47:54,785
The world has changed now.

486
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:57,384
You haven't changed one bit.

487
00:47:58,065 --> 00:47:59,745
You're as nosy as always.

488
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:03,345
We aren't strangers.

489
00:48:03,825 --> 00:48:05,105
You're like a nephew to me.

490
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:07,345
I need to watch over you
on your mom's behalf.

491
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,705
Since your mother is mentally unstable,

492
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:13,545
she doesn't have enough time.

493
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:17,025
By the way,

494
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:20,265
you've been living in that house
for months now.

495
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:21,984
When are you going to come out?

496
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:26,065
Does she know the status

497
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:27,904
Tofu is staying there as?

498
00:48:27,984 --> 00:48:30,464
Her son-in-law or daughter-in-law?

499
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:34,505
His status in my house
does not concern you.

500
00:48:36,384 --> 00:48:39,904
Don't walk away.
You can't even admit you are gay.

501
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:42,464
You're running away from the truth
just like your mom.

502
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:45,145
How are you involved with what happened

503
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:46,705
to Nut and his mother?

504
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,345
Don't pretend like you don't know.

505
00:48:49,984 --> 00:48:51,384
I do know.

506
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:54,745
You're nosy because you're jealous
of Nut's mother, right?

507
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:57,305
Why would I be jealous?

508
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:00,585
Well, everybody loves her.

509
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,345
This includes Mr. Saen too.

510
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,105
Am I wrong?

511
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:08,065
Is it because

512
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,025
you are unhappy?

513
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:13,065
You want other people to be unhappy too.

514
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:15,185
Am I right?

515
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,625
Tofu.

516
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:20,745
Let's go home.

517
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:28,384
Is the food ready?

518
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:24,745
Wait, Nut.

519
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:27,864
Why can't we hold hands?

520
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:30,984
We were holding hands before we saw Jan.

521
00:50:37,864 --> 00:50:39,025
Nut.

522
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:43,585
Nut.

523
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:53,384
I hate being under the spotlight.

524
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:56,464
I don't want everybody talking.

525
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,225
You saw

526
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:01,545
what Jan could do just by herself.

527
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,585
What's wrong

528
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,545
with us holding hands,

529
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,625
living together,

530
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:10,625
and liking each other?

531
00:51:14,384 --> 00:51:15,424
Is it illegal

532
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,305
for two men

533
00:51:17,384 --> 00:51:18,745
to fall in love?

534
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:22,225
No.

535
00:51:23,984 --> 00:51:25,305
If it's not illegal,

536
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:27,424
who is our love bothering?

537
00:51:32,585 --> 00:51:34,305
Men are still human.

538
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:36,785
It's not wrong to fall in love.

539
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:45,025
I want to know why too.

540
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:29,464
I'm sorry

541
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:33,265
for hurting your feelings.

542
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:36,345
It wasn't your fault.

543
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,464
Don't blame yourself.

544
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:43,904
I know how you feel.

545
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,864
You're afraid to hurt your mom's feelings
if she finds out about us.

546
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:02,065
Nut.

547
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:05,944
It's not wrong to love somebody.

548
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:10,145
Love isn't at fault here.

549
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:13,665
You didn't do anything wrong.

550
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:33,384
I'm going to hold your hand like this…

551
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:39,065
until you stop brushing it off…

552
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:44,384
and until you feel comfortable
holding mine.

553
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,864
No matter what happens,

554
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,665
don't let go of my hand.

555
00:54:03,225 --> 00:54:05,305
I'll never let go of your hand.

556
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:08,504
I promise.

557
00:55:10,705 --> 00:55:12,225
Are you doing laundry?

558
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:14,265
Yes.

559
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,265
Do you know how?

560
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:19,225
Let me help you.

561
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:20,225
It's okay.

562
00:55:20,705 --> 00:55:22,185
I can do it.

563
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:37,785
Kuenchai.

564
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:46,305
Kuenchai.

565
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:00,065
I'll help you.

566
00:56:00,145 --> 00:56:01,345
It's okay.

567
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,265
It's not okay.

568
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,145
I'm partly the reason

569
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:07,785
you're doing laundry.

570
00:56:10,185 --> 00:56:11,705
I can't let you do it alone.

571
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:14,745
We used it together,

572
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,944
so let's wash it together.

573
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:31,065
Press the button.

574
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,105
You don't even know how to do laundry.

575
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:52,944
I'm sorry.

576
00:56:53,025 --> 00:56:56,225
-You're sorry?
-Nut.

577
00:56:56,825 --> 00:56:58,145
-Nut.
-Tofu.

578
00:56:58,225 --> 00:56:59,424
Tofu.

579
00:57:38,504 --> 00:57:39,825
I have to shower again.

580
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:44,065
Ask Kuenchai who started the fight.

581
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:52,024
-Yes, Juea.
-I need your advice.

582
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:56,305
Don't ask questions. Come now.

583
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:57,944
All right.

584
00:57:59,745 --> 00:58:01,024
I'm going to the office.

585
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:02,705
Okay.

586
00:58:10,504 --> 00:58:12,305
Nut is so cute.

587
00:58:17,904 --> 00:58:19,065
Mr. Rocking Chair.

588
00:58:21,424 --> 00:58:22,424
Ms. Sofa.

589
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:24,785
Ms. Phone.

590
00:58:25,424 --> 00:58:26,504
Are you still sleeping?

591
00:58:26,585 --> 00:58:27,904
I'm so sleepy.

592
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:29,944
I don't want to get up.

593
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,864
Ms. Phone.

594
00:58:38,424 --> 00:58:39,585
Ms. Phone.

595
00:58:41,265 --> 00:58:42,384
What are you doing?

596
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:47,345
It went off.

597
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:48,864
I was going to charge it.

598
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:52,345
I've been trying to charge it
since yesterday, but it won't work.

599
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:54,545
I guess it's broken.

600
00:58:58,345 --> 00:58:59,265
Kuenchai.

601
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:01,305
He's digging again.

602
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:07,625
Is it possible

603
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:10,024
that Ms. Phone fell asleep too?

604
00:59:11,745 --> 00:59:12,864
What about me?

605
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:16,024
How much time do I have left?

606
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:27,705
Kids are so rude these days.

607
00:59:29,745 --> 00:59:30,665
Oh, my…

608
00:59:30,745 --> 00:59:33,065
There must be a thunderstorm.

609
00:59:33,145 --> 00:59:37,105
My niece is working early in the morn…

610
00:59:38,265 --> 00:59:39,345
You're not working.

611
00:59:39,904 --> 00:59:41,504
What are you looking at?

612
00:59:43,185 --> 00:59:45,825
Doesn't the guy with the book

613
00:59:45,904 --> 00:59:47,225
seem familiar to you?

614
00:59:50,145 --> 00:59:51,265
No.

615
00:59:51,345 --> 00:59:53,305
Look carefully.

616
00:59:53,384 --> 00:59:56,904
Why do his nails, joints, and finger hair

617
00:59:56,984 --> 00:59:58,384
look familiar to me?

618
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:02,464
These fingers definitely belong
to a handsome person.

619
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:06,785
How are the fingers of a handsome man
and an ugly man different?

620
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:07,705
Well…

621
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:09,585
This means

622
01:00:09,665 --> 01:00:10,504
I am

623
01:00:10,585 --> 01:00:12,984
really damn handsome.

624
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,105
Seriously?

625
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:18,384
They are so different.

626
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:20,145
Your fingers

627
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:22,345
-are so tanned.
-Prib.

628
01:00:22,424 --> 01:00:23,265
Hey.

629
01:00:24,904 --> 01:00:27,904
Why is he covering his face with a book?

630
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:28,944
I don't know.

631
01:00:29,024 --> 01:00:30,105
If I run into him,

632
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:33,984
I'll ask him why he's trying
to hide his face.

633
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,904
Instead of looking at his fingers,

634
01:00:36,984 --> 01:00:41,145
why don't you ask
his friends or relatives?

635
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:45,625
Is it possible that he's an orphan?

636
01:00:45,705 --> 01:00:48,145
He's an orphan with relatives.

637
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:49,825
I see.

638
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,665
That's right.

639
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:54,705
I'll ask his relatives.

640
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:56,545
Please move.

641
01:00:57,105 --> 01:00:58,864
Aren't you going to work?

642
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:00,785
Gosh.

643
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,225
-Nut.
-Juea, hello.

644
01:01:03,305 --> 01:01:04,225
Hello.

645
01:01:04,305 --> 01:01:07,464
Can you give me
the location of the school?

646
01:01:07,545 --> 01:01:08,585
And the mall

647
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,145
didn't give us their permission.

648
01:01:10,785 --> 01:01:13,665
-Okay.
-Let's talk inside. Come on.

649
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,585
Wait.

650
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:19,944
-Juea.
-Hold on.

651
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:25,265
What are you doing?

652
01:01:30,384 --> 01:01:34,225
All men's hands look the same.
I shouldn't suspect anything.

653
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:35,944
Come on, Nut.

654
01:01:36,464 --> 01:01:38,545
Okay, Prib. I'll send it to you.

655
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:42,225
But I don't know how much
he knows about Tatarn.

656
01:01:42,305 --> 01:01:45,305
As far as I know,
their relationship wasn't going well.

657
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:47,145
It's okay.

658
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:49,265
It's worth a shot.

659
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:51,464
Thank you, Mr. Anik.

660
01:01:51,944 --> 01:01:53,145
You're welcome.

661
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:55,585
Let's go, Dad.

662
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:56,825
Let's go.

663
01:01:56,904 --> 01:01:57,984
Where are we going?

664
01:01:58,065 --> 01:01:59,464
I've booked us a table.

665
01:01:59,545 --> 01:02:01,225
-Let's go.
-Yes.

666
01:02:09,745 --> 01:02:10,904
Yes, Lieutenant Kong.

667
01:02:12,384 --> 01:02:13,305
What?

668
01:02:20,265 --> 01:02:21,585
You can go to work.

669
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:23,024
Don't worry about me.

670
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:24,305
I can go with a friend.

671
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:27,424
We can go next time.

672
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:29,305
I'm coming back next week.

673
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:34,464
Be honest with me.

674
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:36,944
Are you so involved in this case

675
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:38,785
because it's Neung's friend?

676
01:03:20,145 --> 01:03:21,265
Mister.

677
01:03:21,345 --> 01:03:22,185
Where are you?

678
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,345
I'm at the hospital.

679
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:26,944
What happened?

680
01:03:29,145 --> 01:03:30,424
I'm fine.

681
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:38,785
Song.

682
01:03:38,864 --> 01:03:39,825
Song.

683
01:03:39,904 --> 01:03:40,745
Song.

684
01:03:42,984 --> 01:03:44,705
Why are you at the hospital then?

685
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:47,944
I was selling an ad nearby,
so I came to visit my mom.

686
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:50,105
Is something wrong?

687
01:03:56,384 --> 01:03:57,544
What's with you?

688
01:03:58,065 --> 01:04:00,065
I prepared you very well.

689
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,305
How did this happen?

690
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:04,384
What did you say to your dad?

691
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:08,345
He ditched me for work

692
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:10,665
before I could say anything.

693
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,944
Don't be such a crybaby.

694
01:04:13,024 --> 01:04:14,384
Your dad is a cop.

695
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:16,504
He had an urgent case.

696
01:04:17,504 --> 01:04:19,265
You've been his son for 18 years.

697
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:20,984
You should get it by now.

698
01:04:22,145 --> 01:04:24,944
I wouldn't mind
if he went to work on another case.

699
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:27,464
But the victim

700
01:04:27,544 --> 01:04:29,024
is Neung's friend.

701
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,984
Neung always comes first for him.

702
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:35,825
That's crazy.

703
01:04:35,904 --> 01:04:36,825
You think too much.

704
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:39,065
It's true.

705
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,705
Neung was his favorite

706
01:04:41,185 --> 01:04:42,745
ever since I was a baby.

707
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:47,944
He was handsome, smart, athletic,

708
01:04:48,024 --> 01:04:51,544
into music, popular,
and good at everything.

709
01:04:53,705 --> 01:04:55,225
When Neung died,

710
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:58,504
Dad's hope died along with him.

711
01:05:05,145 --> 01:05:06,864
I'm just someone

712
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:08,944
he neglects.

713
01:05:10,024 --> 01:05:11,544
No matter how hard I try,

714
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:14,265
I can only be Neung's shadow.

715
01:05:25,065 --> 01:05:26,585
All parents

716
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:29,544
love their children the same way.

717
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:31,464
That's not true.

718
01:05:33,024 --> 01:05:35,345
Maybe they love their children equally,

719
01:05:35,424 --> 01:05:37,625
but not in the same way.

720
01:05:42,024 --> 01:05:44,065
I'm sorry for eavesdropping.

721
01:05:44,145 --> 01:05:46,544
The conversation happens
to be about family,

722
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:49,665
so I'm hoping to give you
my opinion as a mother.

723
01:05:56,424 --> 01:05:58,665
Parents can't love
their children the same way

724
01:05:59,225 --> 01:06:01,424
because every child is different.

725
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:04,785
Some children who can take good care
of themselves

726
01:06:04,864 --> 01:06:07,225
may be neglected by their parents.

727
01:06:07,904 --> 01:06:11,105
But some children
who can't take care of themselves

728
01:06:11,864 --> 01:06:14,705
require more attention from the parents.

729
01:06:15,544 --> 01:06:17,544
Because parents treat them differently,

730
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:20,745
children tend to think that parents
love their children unequally.

731
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:22,504
The truth is

732
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:26,105
they just love and care about
their children in different ways.

733
01:06:27,504 --> 01:06:28,345
That's right.

734
01:06:28,424 --> 01:06:29,745
I express my love

735
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:32,105
towards my parents differently.

736
01:06:33,504 --> 01:06:34,864
But I love both of them.

737
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,145
I talk to each of them

738
01:06:39,225 --> 01:06:41,145
about certain things.

739
01:06:45,785 --> 01:06:48,024
The fact that your father
gives you freedom

740
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:51,384
doesn't mean he doesn't love
or care about you.

741
01:06:52,305 --> 01:06:55,265
It's because he trusts you.

742
01:06:57,544 --> 01:07:00,464
Your father has stuff he needs to work on,

743
01:07:01,265 --> 01:07:04,864
but you do too.

744
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:11,745
You always

745
01:07:11,825 --> 01:07:14,424
compare yourself to your brother.

746
01:07:15,145 --> 01:07:16,504
You want to be as good as him,

747
01:07:17,464 --> 01:07:18,944
so your dad would praise you.

748
01:07:21,424 --> 01:07:23,265
You don't need to be like anyone.

749
01:07:24,305 --> 01:07:26,065
Just be yourself.

750
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:28,424
You are second to none.

751
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:34,544
Thank you

752
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,585
for reminding me.

753
01:07:37,145 --> 01:07:38,424
You're welcome.

754
01:07:41,105 --> 01:07:42,384
Can I

755
01:07:43,065 --> 01:07:44,544
hug you?

756
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,145
I don't have a mother to hug.

757
01:07:49,745 --> 01:07:50,625
Of course.

758
01:07:50,705 --> 01:07:51,944
Gen's friends

759
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:54,225
are like my own children.

760
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:06,424
That's enough.

761
01:08:06,504 --> 01:08:07,544
You sneaky punk.

762
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,024
He's being protective of me.

763
01:08:16,865 --> 01:08:19,384
Mom, are you not coming home with me?

764
01:08:19,464 --> 01:08:23,305
-I'm not going back to the office.
-I have to meet two more patients.

765
01:08:23,384 --> 01:08:24,905
You can go home first.

766
01:08:26,305 --> 01:08:27,544
I'll see you at home.

767
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:29,905
I need to check on my patients.

768
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,905
Go home safely, both of you. See you.

769
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:41,985
Mister, come have dinner with me.

770
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:43,265
I've booked a table.

771
01:08:47,905 --> 01:08:49,145
Don't you have any friends

772
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,504
other than me?

773
01:08:51,825 --> 01:08:54,464
You are not my friend.

774
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:57,784
Please, come on. Have dinner with me.

775
01:08:58,624 --> 01:08:59,865
Please.

776
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:03,945
Where is it?

777
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:11,424
Wait, mister.

778
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:20,305
Ms. Phone has fallen asleep
along with Ms. Sofa and Mr. Right Slipper.

779
01:09:21,664 --> 01:09:23,664
Mr. Rocking Chair looks sleepy too.

780
01:09:25,464 --> 01:09:27,265
Am I going to be next?

781
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:29,185
Maybe

782
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,345
only the furniture downstairs
is falling asleep.

783
01:09:32,424 --> 01:09:35,065
The rest of us upstairs are fine.

784
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:39,025
But Mr. Right Slipper
followed Mrs. Na around the house.

785
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:41,065
He still fell asleep.

786
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:43,305
Teddy goes around the house too,

787
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:45,865
so he might fall asleep next.

788
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:48,945
We don't know why the furniture
is falling asleep.

789
01:09:49,025 --> 01:09:51,664
And you don't know how you became a human.

790
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:54,784
I don't know if those two things
are related,

791
01:09:54,865 --> 01:09:57,945
but you might be the only one
who can find the answer.

792
01:09:58,025 --> 01:10:02,225
If you discover where you came from,

793
01:10:02,305 --> 01:10:06,945
you might find a way to stay awake,
unlike the others.

794
01:10:07,025 --> 01:10:08,945
Did you find any more clues yesterday?

795
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:10,545
Yes.

796
01:10:11,225 --> 01:10:13,065
Yesterday, Prib said…

797
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:16,865
She said it was a tall male student.

798
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:21,145
After he bought me,

799
01:10:21,744 --> 01:10:23,265
he put a bandana on me.

800
01:10:24,664 --> 01:10:25,784
Excuse me.

801
01:10:25,865 --> 01:10:27,784
I'll take these two items

802
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:31,425
and please swap the bow
for this pink bandana.

803
01:10:31,985 --> 01:10:33,425
Don't you like the bow?

804
01:10:33,505 --> 01:10:36,624
I want it to be special.

805
01:10:37,145 --> 01:10:38,784
Plus, he likes the color pink.

806
01:10:38,865 --> 01:10:40,505
-All right.
-Thank you.

807
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:45,664
You hid the teddy's scarf
in my room, didn't you?

808
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:47,865
Didn't you?

809
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,065
I didn't.

810
01:10:51,945 --> 01:10:53,744
It had fallen, so I put it away.

811
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:54,985
Don't lie!

812
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:57,985
You were going through my personal stuff!

813
01:10:58,065 --> 01:10:59,624
What do you want?

814
01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:02,025
The scarf. The book.

815
01:11:02,784 --> 01:11:04,585
Still think it's unrelated?

816
01:11:07,385 --> 01:11:08,465
Could it be…

817
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:17,624
BE WITH YOU

818
01:11:17,704 --> 01:11:22,185
BE WITH YOU

819
01:11:37,265 --> 01:11:38,465
You're home early.

820
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,105
Yes.

821
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:42,225
I talked to Juea and had a meeting.

822
01:11:42,305 --> 01:11:44,385
I have to write more scenes.

823
01:11:44,465 --> 01:11:46,225
I'm pulling an all-nighter tonight.

824
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:52,704
He's writing about his life.

825
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:55,265
Even if it's a little sad,

826
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,185
that's okay,

827
01:11:57,265 --> 01:12:00,585
because I'll add sweetness to his life,

828
01:12:03,825 --> 01:12:04,784
There might be clues

829
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:07,345
about that man in the screenplay.

830
01:12:07,985 --> 01:12:09,385
Then you should get writing.

831
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:13,145
What's with you?

832
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:15,465
You usually tell me to rest.

833
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:17,624
Well,

834
01:12:17,704 --> 01:12:19,425
finish it so you can rest.

835
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:21,385
Keep on writing.

836
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:22,825
I'll give you a massage.

837
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:26,664
You're being weird today.

838
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,545
I might be weird,

839
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:32,784
but I look cute every day.

840
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:45,225
SCENE 14A. BASKETBALL CLUB.
HIGH SCHOOL. DAYTIME (CONTINUED).

841
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:11,265
The character Kawee

842
01:13:11,825 --> 01:13:12,945
is sensitive,

843
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:14,065
not talkative,

844
01:13:14,545 --> 01:13:16,025
introverted,

845
01:13:16,704 --> 01:13:18,624
and not athletic.

846
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,345
That must be Nut.

847
01:13:40,225 --> 01:13:41,345
Song

848
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:42,664
plays Nont,

849
01:13:42,744 --> 01:13:46,065
the popular basketball player
whom Nut had a crush on.

850
01:13:46,145 --> 01:13:47,425
He didn't like Nut back.

851
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:49,985
He's probably

852
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:52,305
Neung,

853
01:13:52,865 --> 01:13:54,305
Song's brother.

854
01:14:48,945 --> 01:14:51,185
The character Tonnam

855
01:14:51,265 --> 01:14:53,145
is Nont's best friend.

856
01:14:58,664 --> 01:15:00,265
Wow, that's beautiful.

857
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:02,145
Thank you.

858
01:15:06,865 --> 01:15:08,225
Tonnam

859
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:09,905
is a young and confident thinker

860
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:12,664
who loves to read

861
01:15:13,145 --> 01:15:14,704
and is obsessed with art.

862
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:17,945
There's only one moon.

863
01:15:18,664 --> 01:15:19,664
Right?

864
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:23,345
How about I draw another moon?

865
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:26,784
If you draw another moon,

866
01:15:27,505 --> 01:15:29,865
the first moon will lose its meaning.

867
01:16:21,704 --> 01:16:22,545
TONNAM

868
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:29,704
Tarn.

869
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:32,824
Why would you do that?

870
01:17:32,905 --> 01:17:33,824
Why?

871
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:35,744
-Tarn.
-It's funny.

872
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:37,624
That hurts.

873
01:17:38,105 --> 01:17:40,505
-My ear hurts.
-Did your ear explode?

874
01:18:06,624 --> 01:18:08,265
This "T" guy

875
01:18:08,345 --> 01:18:09,905
is definitely portrayed by Tonnam.

876
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:14,305
I need to find the person
the character Tonnam is based on.

877
01:18:33,865 --> 01:18:37,784
BASKETBALL TEAM BATCH 128

878
01:18:47,545 --> 01:18:48,784
What are you doing?

879
01:19:00,185 --> 01:19:01,145
You…

880
01:19:06,945 --> 01:19:08,425
Ma'am.

881
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:10,025
Ma'am.

882
01:19:10,585 --> 01:19:11,905
Are you okay?

883
01:19:23,624 --> 01:19:24,664
Ma'am.

884
01:19:24,744 --> 01:19:25,704
Anont.

885
01:19:27,784 --> 01:19:30,425
Are you still wandering here?

886
01:19:30,505 --> 01:19:32,425
You should go to the light.

887
01:19:32,505 --> 01:19:34,385
I'll make merit for you.

888
01:19:34,865 --> 01:19:38,265
-Ma'am, I'm human.
-No…

889
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,865
You've been dead for ten years.

890
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,824
Don't you know?

891
01:19:48,744 --> 01:19:49,985
Sathu.

892
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:53,345
Ma'am, my name is Tofu, not Anont.

893
01:19:53,425 --> 01:19:55,185
I'm here to shoot the series.

894
01:20:02,985 --> 01:20:04,185
Really?

895
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:07,105
Are you really human?

896
01:20:07,185 --> 01:20:08,345
Yes.

897
01:20:13,265 --> 01:20:14,905
My heart almost stopped.

898
01:20:16,105 --> 01:20:16,945
Listen.

899
01:20:17,505 --> 01:20:18,865
Peeranut told me

900
01:20:19,824 --> 01:20:22,744
that the script
is based on his experience.

901
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:25,345
I never thought

902
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:29,824
he would find an actor
who looked so similar to his senior.

903
01:20:31,465 --> 01:20:33,145
Do you know Nut?

904
01:20:33,824 --> 01:20:34,824
Of course.

905
01:20:35,305 --> 01:20:36,545
Look.

906
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:38,744
I even know his parents,

907
01:20:38,824 --> 01:20:41,624
let alone him.

908
01:20:42,265 --> 01:20:43,624
I was afraid

909
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:48,105
his puppy love was going to stop him
from graduating.

910
01:20:49,624 --> 01:20:51,425
Why? What happened?

911
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:53,585
He got a boyfriend.

912
01:20:53,664 --> 01:20:56,385
Luckily, I stopped him in time.

913
01:20:57,465 --> 01:20:59,225
Do you know his boyfriend?

914
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,065
Look.

915
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:04,265
I took care of Peeranut
as if he was my own son.

916
01:21:04,345 --> 01:21:05,824
-What was his name?
-I…

917
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:07,784
He was Anont's best friend.

918
01:21:07,865 --> 01:21:09,624
-His name was--
-Tofu.

919
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:12,385
You're here.

920
01:21:18,265 --> 01:21:19,145
My goodness.

921
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,505
You interrupted our conversation.

922
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,465
Were you afraid I would say something?

923
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,305
No.

924
01:21:26,145 --> 01:21:28,265
I just hate it when people talk
behind my back,

925
01:21:28,345 --> 01:21:29,624
the way they used to.

926
01:21:30,225 --> 01:21:31,185
Listen.

927
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:34,865
If that's your way
of calling me a busybody,

928
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:37,265
you should know that I meant well.

929
01:21:38,664 --> 01:21:39,624
Are you sure

930
01:21:40,624 --> 01:21:42,465
it wasn't for your own benefit?

931
01:21:43,025 --> 01:21:44,105
Peeranut.

932
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:49,185
If you think badly of my goodwill,

933
01:21:49,265 --> 01:21:51,265
I want you to think again.

934
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:55,065
You should realize
that you grew up with a good life

935
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:58,784
because I pulled you back on track.

936
01:21:59,505 --> 01:22:00,545
Yes.

937
01:22:01,545 --> 01:22:03,145
You are partly the reason

938
01:22:03,905 --> 01:22:05,225
my life is like this.

939
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:08,784
Thank you so much.

940
01:22:10,784 --> 01:22:11,945
Let's go, Tofu.

941
01:22:20,664 --> 01:22:21,704
Nut.

942
01:22:23,225 --> 01:22:24,704
Why did you go back to the club?

943
01:22:25,905 --> 01:22:27,265
I forgot my phone.

944
01:22:28,425 --> 01:22:30,345
What did she say to you?

945
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:32,305
Nothing much.

946
01:22:32,385 --> 01:22:34,225
She asked why I look like Neung.

947
01:22:39,465 --> 01:22:41,145
Don't listen

948
01:22:41,225 --> 01:22:42,624
to anything she says.

949
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:47,624
She's a dictator

950
01:22:48,425 --> 01:22:50,145
who thinks she's always right.

951
01:22:55,465 --> 01:22:57,185
Go back to the shoot first.

952
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:58,624
I'm going to the toilet.

953
01:23:12,465 --> 01:23:15,624
It's okay. I'll ask Song myself.

954
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:23,385
Sir.

955
01:23:24,985 --> 01:23:27,425
Song told me
he was shooting his series here.

956
01:23:27,905 --> 01:23:29,385
Hey.

957
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:30,585
Can I ask you something?

958
01:23:31,425 --> 01:23:34,145
Has Song complained
or come to you for advice?

959
01:23:37,265 --> 01:23:38,664
No.

960
01:23:39,225 --> 01:23:41,105
Song is a talented guy.

961
01:23:41,185 --> 01:23:43,185
He's my hero.

962
01:23:43,265 --> 01:23:46,345
If someone were to ask for advice,
it would be me.

963
01:23:46,425 --> 01:23:49,784
Song used to call Neung his hero.

964
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:53,545
Today, someone who looks like Neung
is calling Song a hero.

965
01:23:54,065 --> 01:23:55,784
It's a little weird to me.

966
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,265
But Song is really my hero.

967
01:24:00,145 --> 01:24:01,824
Think about it.

968
01:24:01,905 --> 01:24:03,505
How can someone be handsome,

969
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:04,545
hardworking,

970
01:24:04,624 --> 01:24:06,225
smart,

971
01:24:06,305 --> 01:24:07,824
talented,

972
01:24:07,905 --> 01:24:08,985
good at basketball,

973
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:10,865
and good at riding a bike?

974
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,345
He's good at everything.

975
01:24:13,385 --> 01:24:14,545
Is that so?

976
01:24:16,945 --> 01:24:19,345
You might not realize how talented Song is

977
01:24:20,744 --> 01:24:23,265
because you're busy
thinking about your dead child.

978
01:24:25,545 --> 01:24:27,744
Maybe you're neglecting
the child you have left.

979
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:34,704
What part of your life
don't I take an interest in?

980
01:24:35,225 --> 01:24:36,624
There's a lot.

981
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,744
You don't remember the food I like.

982
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,185
You don't even remember my birthday.

983
01:24:41,265 --> 01:24:43,905
I wasn't the one who gave birth to you.

984
01:24:44,985 --> 01:24:47,185
But you always remember Neung's birthday.

985
01:24:47,824 --> 01:24:50,704
Even after he passed away,
you still remember.

986
01:24:54,704 --> 01:24:56,945
Song never told me anything.

987
01:24:58,865 --> 01:25:00,465
He's a strong person.

988
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,225
But every strong person

989
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:07,265
can get weak sometimes.

990
01:25:10,345 --> 01:25:12,185
I'm a terrible father.

991
01:25:14,465 --> 01:25:15,425
No.

992
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:18,465
No one's perfect.

993
01:25:19,784 --> 01:25:21,385
And it's not wrong

994
01:25:22,065 --> 01:25:24,905
to mourn and miss your dead child.

995
01:25:25,905 --> 01:25:28,985
However, you can't neglect
the child you have left.

996
01:25:31,744 --> 01:25:34,465
To be forgotten while you are still alive

997
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:38,105
hurts more than being separated by death.

998
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,065
Thank you.

999
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:49,664
Study hard and take care of the club.

1000
01:26:05,185 --> 01:26:06,225
Put this on me.

1001
01:26:16,865 --> 01:26:18,704
Now, we have one each.

1002
01:26:27,624 --> 01:26:28,945
That's it for today.

1003
01:26:39,265 --> 01:26:41,265
-Thank you so much.
-The shoot is over.

1004
01:26:42,985 --> 01:26:47,624
I said, the shoot is over.
Girls, the shoot is over.

1005
01:26:53,744 --> 01:26:55,065
Congratulations.

1006
01:26:56,145 --> 01:26:57,744
The shoot will be done soon.

1007
01:26:57,824 --> 01:26:59,624
Does this mean I won't see you anymore?

1008
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:01,425
Yes.

1009
01:27:01,505 --> 01:27:04,505
We're going separate ways.

1010
01:27:05,585 --> 01:27:08,065
Can I live at your house then?

1011
01:27:08,624 --> 01:27:10,465
My dad will ask for your hand.

1012
01:27:10,545 --> 01:27:14,065
Jeez, as soon as your stress goes away,
you're here to annoy me.

1013
01:27:14,905 --> 01:27:16,145
Have you talked to him?

1014
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:21,025
Not yet.

1015
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:23,545
What are you waiting for?

1016
01:27:23,624 --> 01:27:24,864
Shall I talk to him?

1017
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:29,345
How will you introduce yourself to him?

1018
01:27:32,265 --> 01:27:33,145
Well…

1019
01:27:33,744 --> 01:27:36,265
I'll say I'm a senior who pities you.

1020
01:27:39,225 --> 01:27:41,465
Have you heard of the phrase

1021
01:27:41,545 --> 01:27:44,864
"Pity is the foundation of love"?

1022
01:27:46,305 --> 01:27:47,545
No.

1023
01:27:47,624 --> 01:27:49,185
I've only heard of sympathy.

1024
01:28:01,145 --> 01:28:02,505
I wasn't expecting you.

1025
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:06,545
I came to support you.

1026
01:28:08,305 --> 01:28:10,905
You've invited me many times,
but I never came.

1027
01:28:12,265 --> 01:28:13,824
You didn't tell me

1028
01:28:13,905 --> 01:28:15,465
it was a love story.

1029
01:28:18,905 --> 01:28:20,185
You don't mind, do you?

1030
01:28:21,784 --> 01:28:23,065
Of course not.

1031
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:24,345
It's just acting.

1032
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,824
You're not really gay.

1033
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:31,824
Are you?

1034
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:37,265
Song.

1035
01:28:38,185 --> 01:28:39,664
I'm sorry.

1036
01:28:41,744 --> 01:28:43,265
I keep breaking my promises.

1037
01:28:44,105 --> 01:28:46,265
I flew here as soon as I finished working.

1038
01:28:48,465 --> 01:28:50,465
Dad, don't worry.

1039
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:52,945
I know you are busy.

1040
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:57,945
Song.

1041
01:28:59,025 --> 01:29:00,545
I'm not working hard

1042
01:29:02,265 --> 01:29:04,265
because the victim is Neung's friend.

1043
01:29:04,345 --> 01:29:06,425
I would do the same with any case.

1044
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:11,025
I'm sorry

1045
01:29:12,065 --> 01:29:13,225
if I hurt your feelings.

1046
01:29:18,744 --> 01:29:19,704
In the past,

1047
01:29:19,784 --> 01:29:22,065
I've neglected you

1048
01:29:23,385 --> 01:29:25,505
because I knew you could
take care of yourself.

1049
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:28,425
But the truth is, deep down,

1050
01:29:29,065 --> 01:29:30,505
you're still a puppy

1051
01:29:31,465 --> 01:29:33,265
who needs his daddy, aren't you?

1052
01:29:43,585 --> 01:29:45,225
I will try

1053
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:47,545
to be here for you more.

1054
01:29:55,545 --> 01:29:57,025
I'm sorry.

1055
01:29:58,545 --> 01:30:02,864
It's my fault
for never telling you how I feel.

1056
01:30:07,784 --> 01:30:09,305
We are going

1057
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:12,545
to be honest with each other

1058
01:30:13,425 --> 01:30:15,985
to avoid any misunderstandings
in the future.

1059
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,545
We only have each other.

1060
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:24,225
You are my life and soul.

1061
01:30:29,585 --> 01:30:30,905
I love you.

1062
01:30:32,025 --> 01:30:33,385
I love you too.

1063
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:54,025
Come on.

1064
01:30:54,105 --> 01:30:55,505
Let's give them some privacy.

1065
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:57,824
Tofu.

1066
01:30:57,905 --> 01:30:59,505
Go get changed.

1067
01:30:59,585 --> 01:31:01,105
I'll wait in the car.

1068
01:31:01,185 --> 01:31:02,345
Okay.

1069
01:31:09,545 --> 01:31:10,385
Sometimes,

1070
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,065
we forget that we are still breathing.

1071
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:15,864
But it doesn't mean

1072
01:31:16,465 --> 01:31:17,985
that breathing isn't important,

1073
01:31:18,945 --> 01:31:19,985
does it?

1074
01:31:27,664 --> 01:31:29,265
Do you want to be gay?

1075
01:31:29,824 --> 01:31:31,305
Don't you want to be a man?

1076
01:31:31,385 --> 01:31:33,265
Are you and Nut in love?

1077
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:35,824
Yes.

1078
01:31:39,345 --> 01:31:41,105
You can hate me all you want.

1079
01:31:42,145 --> 01:31:44,585
But I will never be who you want me to be.

1080
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:46,945
Did your ex-boyfriend traumatize you

1081
01:31:47,545 --> 01:31:48,744
from dating a younger man?

1082
01:31:50,425 --> 01:31:53,704
Not all younger men are the same.
Don't generalize us.

1083
01:31:54,505 --> 01:31:56,345
Don't you have confidence in me

1084
01:31:57,505 --> 01:31:59,185
when I'm with you at all?

1085
01:33:07,824 --> 01:33:12,824
