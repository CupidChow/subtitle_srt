1
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:08,385
Do you want to be gay?

2
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,425
Don't you want to be a man?

3
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,385
Are you and Nut in love?

4
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:14,945
Yes.

5
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,064
You can hate me all you want.

6
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:23,705
But I will never be who you want me to be.

7
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:28,265
Did your ex-boyfriend traumatize you
from dating a younger man?

8
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,464
Not all younger men are the same.

9
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:32,825
Don't generalize us.

10
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,425
Don't you have confidence in me

11
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,705
when I'm with you at all?

12
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,945
Didn't you say you had lots of homework?

13
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:11,904
You better go.

14
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:20,385
I want to drop you off at home.

15
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,985
I want to keep seeing your smile.

16
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,105
But my freedom

17
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,505
ended once I was at home.

18
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:27,545
Get home safely.

19
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:29,865
I'm going then.

20
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:46,425
Who was that?

21
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:49,465
Just a friend.

22
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,345
I know now

23
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:08,225
why you were angry with me.

24
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,065
I said the same thing as Tatarn, didn't I?

25
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,264
When I was at home,

26
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,505
I felt suffocated.

27
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,505
Tarn seemed to realize

28
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,945
that home didn't feel like home to me.

29
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,425
He tried to give me
a bit more time to smile

30
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,665
by the gate.

31
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:51,665
That's why you chose
to keep it to yourself

32
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,065
and didn't even tell your mom.

33
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:55,704
Yes.

34
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,505
We were secretly dating for about a year.

35
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,704
It was risky

36
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,545
but exhilarating.

37
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,144
The more you were oppressed,

38
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,185
the more you wanted to rebel.

39
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:09,704
Am I right?

40
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,345
I was so happy to beat them,

41
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,345
even though it was behind their backs.

42
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:19,704
But one day,

43
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,904
I almost got caught.

44
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,904
That scene really impressed me.

45
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:32,464
-Which scene?
-Take a guess.

46
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:34,545
-The book opening scene?
-Yes.

47
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,745
When the book was opened
and the music started,

48
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:41,024
I almost cried.

49
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,545
-Were you sucked in?
-Of course.

50
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,545
That person had a crush
on the other person for a long time

51
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,105
but they had to say goodbye.

52
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,105
Nut!

53
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,464
Dad.

54
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:06,425
Hello.

55
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,425
-Let's go home.
-Please calm down, Uncle.

56
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:12,505
I'm not your uncle!

57
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,625
-Come on. We're going home.
-But Dad…

58
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:16,785
We're going home.

59
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:18,625
Come on.

60
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,545
-But--
-Stop.

61
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:21,945
I said to stop.

62
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,065
I got away with it that time,

63
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,344
but luck didn't stay with me for long.

64
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,464
-What are we doing here?
-Just follow me.

65
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,745
Come. Sit down.

66
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,505
Gosh.

67
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,185
I was expecting a bigger surprise.

68
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,385
Nut.

69
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,464
In two months,

70
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:30,425
I'm leaving for Chiang Mai.

71
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,345
I'm going to miss this.

72
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,264
Miss school?

73
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,825
School

74
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,385
and someone at school.

75
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:46,625
If you miss me,

76
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,184
you have this as a keepsake.

77
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:53,265
Seeing you in the flesh is better though.

78
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,025
How about

79
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,424
I go and study there too?

80
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:01,064
There's no need for that.

81
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:04,865
I don't want that to be your reason.

82
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,785
I want you to study
at the university of your choice.

83
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:13,985
But if I'm far from you

84
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,505
and we miss each other,

85
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,544
what would we do then?

86
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,585
We can do something before I leave.

87
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,345
What are you two doing?

88
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,785
It happened at the gym.

89
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,705
I was returning something
to the second floor,

90
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,025
at the gym storeroom.

91
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,145
What I saw was…

92
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:12,345
Peeranut and Tatarn

93
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:15,145
kissing each other.

94
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:41,064
I…

95
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,544
I am sorry.

96
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,385
-Hey!
-Please don't.

97
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:46,865
Mr. Sib,

98
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,345
I beg you.
Please don't start a fight here.

99
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,665
Go.

100
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:57,345
If you don't stop seeing him,
don't you dare call me your dad.

101
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,145
Come with me.

102
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,544
Once I broke it off with him,

103
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:12,985
I stopped feeling happy.

104
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,585
Can I see you one last time?

105
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,665
Tarn.

106
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:33,865
Nut.

107
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:37,145
I get it.

108
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,625
Even though this is it for us,

109
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,785
I'll never forget you.

110
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:51,544
In my heart,

111
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:54,665
all the space

112
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:57,105
is occupied by you.

113
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,345
I'm not dead yet.

114
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:12,505
I won't let you die before I do.

115
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:15,785
I want you to stay with this
for a long time.

116
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,145
I'm asking you to keep it.

117
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:23,824
One day,

118
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,105
if you're afraid
and you don't know what to do,

119
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,585
give it a hug

120
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,544
like when we hugged.

121
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,944
I believe that you're strong

122
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,105
and brave enough
to find your own happiness.

123
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,985
Thank you.

124
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,824
But I don't have anything for you.

125
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:05,585
I just want you to be happy.

126
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,424
Then I'll be happy too.

127
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,184
Can I ask you one thing?

128
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,064
Can I hug you one--

129
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:56,304
Nut!

130
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:03,304
Why are you doing this?

131
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,345
Please don't, I'm begging you.

132
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,985
Dad, don't do it.

133
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,064
-Please don't.
-Nut.

134
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:11,985
Nut.

135
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:13,345
Don't do it, Dad.

136
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:15,225
-We're going home. Come with me.
-Nut.

137
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:16,824
-Come on!
-Nut.

138
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:24,064
-Come.
-Let go, Dad.

139
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,865
-Come with me.
-I said let go.

140
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:27,505
You're such a disgrace.

141
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,225
Have you thought of my reputation?

142
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,944
-Will you stay out of this?
-Come.

143
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:32,905
Come here.

144
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,145
What is going on?

145
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,105
-He sneaked off to see him.
-Mom.

146
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,025
They were hugging in the mall.

147
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,145
I told you to break it off.

148
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,584
But you went behind my back.

149
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:44,824
Do you want a beating?

150
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,785
Please don't. Stop it.

151
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,265
Please don't. Stop it.

152
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:49,704
Nut, don't.

153
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:50,665
You want to fight?

154
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:52,745
Do you have no respect for me?

155
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:54,745
Don't you respect me anymore?

156
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:56,505
If you want my respect,

157
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:58,785
you have to earn it.

158
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,225
Nut!

159
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,225
No, don't!

160
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,424
Please don't.

161
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:09,184
Why are you protecting him?
You damn moron.

162
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,184
Why protect him?

163
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:14,665
I don't want a fucking
mean dad like you either.

164
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,105
Where are you going?

165
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:22,145
Did you think you could run away?

166
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,385
Don't.

167
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,265
Nut!

168
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,944
Nut! Open up!

169
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,304
Open up!

170
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:41,944
Nut, open up!

171
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:43,865
How dare you raise your voice at me.

172
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:46,265
How dare you raise your voice
at your own dad.

173
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:47,265
Nut!

174
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:50,265
A little pervert like you
will never achieve anything.

175
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,704
You two are never going to last!

176
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:56,584
You want to see each other?
Over my dead body!

177
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,025
-Open up!
-Please don't.

178
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,345
-Please don't.
-Are you not opening up?

179
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,345
Fine.

180
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,785
Since your mom failed to teach you,
I'll do it myself!

181
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:12,785
What are you going to do?

182
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,224
What are you going to do?

183
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,545
That's why

184
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,264
on the day I woke up,

185
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,865
Nut was crying.

186
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,585
I should actually thank my parents

187
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,585
for ending my relationship with Tarn.

188
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,345
It gave me the courage

189
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:47,545
to do something
I never had the courage for.

190
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:08,625
Nut?

191
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,024
Why don't you come down for dinner?

192
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,305
Your dad wants you
to take a military exam.

193
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,465
Please study hard.

194
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:24,024
I'm not taking it.

195
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,585
I don't want to be a soldier.

196
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:31,385
If you won't be a soldier,
what do you want to be?

197
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,545
Anything.

198
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:36,225
I just don't want to be like Dad.

199
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,784
Will you please

200
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:44,984
listen to your dad?

201
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,385
He wants the best for you.

202
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:48,744
He wants the best?

203
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:53,825
For me or himself?

204
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,585
I've never been allowed
to do anything I wanted.

205
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,945
You wanted me to transfer, so I did.

206
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,784
You told me to end my relationship,

207
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,585
I did.

208
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,425
Now, you want me to stop being myself?

209
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:16,264
Do I have any say in my own life, Mom?

210
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,825
I'm sorry.

211
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:32,024
I'm sorry for making your life like this.

212
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,825
All you do is apologize.

213
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,784
You can be angry with me all you want.

214
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,665
But will you come down for dinner?

215
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:51,024
Your dad won't be angry for long.
He'll cool down when he sees you behave.

216
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:53,305
If you want to see a doctor…

217
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,145
I'm gay.

218
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:57,385
I don't have a disease.

219
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:59,585
It doesn't go away.

220
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,905
I agreed with no military exam,
yet you took the communications one.

221
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:45,545
It's what I want to study.

222
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:48,185
Reject that offer

223
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,345
and take the engineering exam.

224
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:53,705
If that's what you want, do it yourself.

225
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:54,825
Nut!

226
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,744
I'm going to study what I want.

227
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:59,705
I can transfer as many times as you like,

228
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:03,105
try out however many military services
or see however many doctors,

229
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,825
but I'll still be the same me.

230
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:06,705
But I forbid it!

231
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:08,465
If you want to do that,

232
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:10,145
wait until I'm dead!

233
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,145
Sure!

234
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:13,905
Since you two won't let me be myself,

235
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:15,825
I'll live somewhere else.

236
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:19,425
Since you despise who I am that much,

237
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,225
I'll tell everyone

238
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:23,264
that we are not related,

239
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,345
that I'm not your son.

240
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,145
Don't you ever say that again.

241
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:34,504
You are our son.

242
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,865
-Nut.
-Let him go!

243
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:44,945
If you step out of this house,
don't ever come back!

244
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:01,784
Your dad said that out of anger.
Don't take it to heart.

245
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:03,744
Why don't you eat something?

246
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,905
Go ahead and eat if you want.

247
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:31,425
Mom is good.

248
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:34,945
Good at making me behave.

249
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,865
Whenever we had a fight,

250
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:41,865
she would give us food

251
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:44,425
and apologize.

252
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,744
When in fact,

253
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:51,345
she simply wanted me to obey Dad

254
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,145
the way she did.

255
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:59,305
Even when I said I was leaving,

256
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,625
she still wanted me to concede to him.

257
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,504
She never loved me.

258
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:13,225
She wanted an obedient son

259
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:15,905
like you.

260
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,625
That's why she agreed to let you stay.

261
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,065
Is that why

262
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,744
you refuse to eat from your lunchbox?

263
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:34,465
I refuse to eat what she prepared

264
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,145
because whenever I see it,

265
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:39,385
I'm reminded of that day,

266
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:42,065
of what she said.

267
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,145
If I could turn back time,

268
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:51,544
I would rather have Dad beat me to death

269
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,585
than have the person I loved the most,

270
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:01,625
the person I thought would take my side

271
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,145
and protect me

272
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,465
turn against me like that.

273
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:16,744
I'm so sorry.

274
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:29,665
I was going to lock up.

275
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:34,065
I'll leave that to you.

276
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:52,225
I get it now.

277
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:57,665
The reason you blow up at your mom…

278
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,264
is to resist the feeling of love.

279
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,665
You're afraid that if you love someone,

280
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:20,385
you'll lose them.

281
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:30,425
What happened at the mall…

282
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:34,225
You were hesitant to enter

283
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:39,225
not because of bad memories,

284
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,425
but because it's where you lost
your loved one.

285
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:51,304
You lost him for good.

286
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,665
I never realized that my backstory

287
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:17,304
had everyone upset.

288
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:24,984
This must be why he loved to hug me

289
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,185
when he was sad.

290
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:32,905
It wasn't because he loved the teddy bear,

291
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:35,825
but because

292
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,585
I represented someone he loved dearly.

293
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:45,665
I apologize for my lies.

294
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:49,625
I am actually hurt

295
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:52,504
and jealous of Tatarn.

296
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:56,465
Am I a liar now?

297
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,784
But no matter how jealous I am,

298
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,585
I'll always be here.

299
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:11,105
Whatever reason he had for hugging me,

300
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:13,825
his hugs

301
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,105
have always been my safe harbor.

302
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:28,744
Right now, he's in need
of a safe harbor too,

303
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:32,585
isn't he?

304
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,784
What can I do to help
Nut and his mom reconcile?

305
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:08,264
At first, you two fought.
Now, Nut and his mom also have issues.

306
00:30:08,345 --> 00:30:10,264
If you won't help, be quiet.

307
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:13,425
Nut and his mom
have always been like this.

308
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,905
We've spoken about it.

309
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:18,544
But…

310
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,784
as you know,

311
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:23,345
he's a complex character.

312
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,625
He has been through a lot.

313
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,225
Right now,

314
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,825
he has a good person supporting him.

315
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:34,064
I think things are looking better.

316
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:38,145
They are a family. They'll talk it out.

317
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:40,145
Someone once told me,

318
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:43,145
to help another person understand,

319
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,145
you should be honest.

320
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:48,185
Talking is not that hard.

321
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:50,145
I'll give it a try.

322
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,225
That lot is now working things out.

323
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:55,225
This lot needs to do the same.

324
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:56,865
What's with that lot and this lot?

325
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:59,225
I'm not talking to you.

326
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:01,705
I have something important to discuss.

327
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,825
Tomorrow,

328
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:07,024
will you meet me?

329
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,385
I have something important to discuss.

330
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,024
Tomorrow,

331
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,264
will you meet me?

332
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,064
Hey.

333
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:22,984
What are you thinking?

334
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,504
Nothing.

335
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,784
If you want me to do that,

336
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,425
let me in first.

337
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:41,945
Just say what you have to say,

338
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:43,984
so I can go back to bed.

339
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:46,385
Why did you want to see me so early?

340
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:49,665
Let me ask you this.

341
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:53,465
Do you not like younger guys,
or do you just not like me?

342
00:33:57,865 --> 00:33:59,784
You seem to like me, though.

343
00:34:00,824 --> 00:34:03,185
Why do you pretend
that you have no feelings?

344
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,024
What's wrong?

345
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,744
I want to know what I have to do
for you to give me a chance.

346
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,344
Could it be

347
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:14,944
that whatever I do,

348
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:16,344
you're never going to like me

349
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:18,705
because you can't forget your damn ex?

350
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:22,384
Come on.

351
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,225
I'm being serious.

352
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,665
Not every kid is like that.

353
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,784
There are many good kids out there.

354
00:34:34,384 --> 00:34:35,784
You don't have to come.

355
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,264
It's just a scratch. It's not deadly.

356
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,744
Once I get my salary,

357
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:45,744
I'll treat you to a meal.

358
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:47,545
It's just tiring

359
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:50,824
when you try your best to please someone,

360
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:52,585
but they don't even notice.

361
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:00,384
Why aren't you saying anything?

362
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:02,864
You're making me nervous.

363
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,465
Gen?

364
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:11,944
Is it you, Gen?

365
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,305
Win.

366
00:35:25,944 --> 00:35:28,105
When did you get back from Australia?

367
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,825
A month ago.

368
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:34,785
May I ask

369
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:37,705
who you prepared this surprise for?

370
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:39,985
Your boyfriend?

371
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:43,545
Yes. We met when we were there.

372
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:45,185
We came back together.

373
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,265
I wanted to make it official.

374
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,625
You and I haven't spoken for three years.

375
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:55,785
I'm glad

376
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:57,785
that we can still talk.

377
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:01,465
Well,

378
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,384
we parted on good terms.

379
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:05,785
Even though I was upset,

380
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,745
I understood

381
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:10,944
that you had to plan for your future.

382
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:14,785
Back then, I didn't treat you well,

383
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:18,105
but you always treated me like a king.

384
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:23,145
Actually,

385
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,065
I did many things for you

386
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,305
without you having to ask.

387
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:29,025
You were head over heels.

388
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:33,424
Seriously though,

389
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,705
if I could turn back time,

390
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:37,625
I would still break up with you.

391
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:39,985
Good relationships

392
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,505
come at the right time.

393
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,625
-Song…
-By the way.

394
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:50,305
What is it?

395
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:51,505
I'm all grown up now.

396
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:53,505
I eat my vegetables,

397
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:56,864
but I no longer like cabbage.

398
00:36:57,944 --> 00:36:59,464
Do you still grow it?

399
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:01,864
No, I don't grow it anymore.

400
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:04,904
I grow ivy gourd now, got it?

401
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:26,384
I thought you had left.

402
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:31,384
I can wait.

403
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,384
I just don't want to watch.

404
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:37,424
You're too sensitive.
It's because you're the youngest son.

405
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:41,505
What did cabbage boy want?

406
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:44,665
His name is Marvin.

407
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:46,105
I don't care what his name is.

408
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,944
Tell me what you were talking about.
Are you getting back together?

409
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,625
Song, are you blind?

410
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,225
This is for his boyfriend.

411
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,345
Where would I fit in?

412
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,904
You didn't answer my question.

413
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,985
Did you have to drag me here
to tell me your answer?

414
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,265
I want to talk this through.

415
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:17,825
Here.

416
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,944
Drink this to cool yourself down
and listen to me.

417
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:22,625
Okay?

418
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:24,745
Okay.

419
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:29,185
You've talked with your ex.
Now, you have to talk to the new guy.

420
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:35,785
Why do you keep resisting me?

421
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:39,825
Why? Did cabbage boy hurt you that badly?

422
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:43,545
We were in a relationship three years ago.

423
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:45,705
He was 18 at the time.

424
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:47,305
I was 24.

425
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:50,345
Did he ask you out?

426
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,065
No, I approached him.

427
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,424
He was so cute.

428
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:01,145
I was generous with my money.

429
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:04,904
He liked eating cabbage, so I grew some.

430
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,985
I even cooked it for him.

431
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:15,944
It lasted less than a year.

432
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:19,065
He went abroad to study.

433
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:23,305
I told him I was willing to wait,

434
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:25,705
but he said I shouldn't waste my time.

435
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,705
Also, he might meet someone better.

436
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,864
When I saw him just now,

437
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:35,545
he stood by what he said before

438
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:40,345
and he's not sorry he said it.

439
00:39:45,145 --> 00:39:47,105
Maybe he was focusing on his future,

440
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,785
but he obviously didn't love you enough.

441
00:39:50,864 --> 00:39:52,305
That's why he let you go.

442
00:39:53,345 --> 00:39:55,505
He and I are different people, you know?

443
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:56,745
I know that.

444
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:58,225
What are you afraid of then?

445
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,545
What happened to you in the past

446
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:05,705
made you lose faith in love,

447
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:11,904
but I'm going to show you
how serious I am about you.

448
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:20,705
People change.

449
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,265
You're young. You have a lot to see.

450
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:27,105
This is all I have to say.

451
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,145
Hey.

452
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:32,585
Hey, where are you going?

453
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,065
Hey.

454
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:38,745
So what if I'm young?

455
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,145
I'll grow up one day.

456
00:40:44,665 --> 00:40:47,185
You're afraid I'll change,
but what about you?

457
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:50,305
If you were to die tomorrow,
what would I do?

458
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:51,424
Are you cursing me?

459
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:53,185
I'm not cursing you.

460
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,705
I'm serious.

461
00:40:56,585 --> 00:41:00,305
What are you afraid of? It just
complicates everything and wastes time.

462
00:41:00,384 --> 00:41:02,585
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

463
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:05,225
Why can't we just get together now?

464
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,145
Where are you going?

465
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:22,665
Can we talk this through?

466
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,464
Wait.

467
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:26,825
I'm going home.

468
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:33,904
I need to water my plant,

469
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:35,105
so it grows quickly,

470
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:36,105
like someone I know.

471
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:48,065
Are you agreeing to our relationship?

472
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:50,785
Finally!

473
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:52,785
I can't wait to eat some ivy gourd leaves.

474
00:41:52,864 --> 00:41:55,225
-Hooray.
-Let me down.

475
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:59,345
We're in a park. Don't make so much noise.

476
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:00,985
I'll refrain from making noise.

477
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:03,265
-Let me kiss you instead.
-Don't.

478
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:07,145
Stop it. Keep your hands to yourself.
Do you hear me?

479
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,785
Look, there are people around.

480
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:12,505
Okay?

481
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:15,384
I love you. Let's go home, shall we?

482
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:17,225
Come on.

483
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:18,585
-Are you driving me?
-Yes.

484
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:21,225
Get on my back.

485
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:22,705
One, two, three.

486
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:24,745
Let's go home.

487
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:38,585
Let me help you.

488
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,825
Are you thinking about last night?

489
00:42:47,785 --> 00:42:49,545
Why would I?

490
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:54,424
You want to make things better, don't you?

491
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:57,745
You get irritable with your mom,

492
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,105
but you're not really angry.

493
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:03,185
You just…

494
00:43:03,904 --> 00:43:05,145
hold a grudge.

495
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:08,745
You've been holding onto it for so long

496
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:11,625
and you can't seem to let it go, right?

497
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:14,705
You're such a know-it-all.

498
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:17,424
Someone once told me

499
00:43:18,384 --> 00:43:20,745
that families should try
to resolve their problems.

500
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:23,825
If you love someone, you should say so.

501
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:27,944
If you want to understand,
you should talk to each other.

502
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:30,065
Mutual understanding

503
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:32,464
requires an open mind.

504
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:35,225
When did you get so smart?

505
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,944
Do you like it?

506
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:40,225
I like it.

507
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,145
I like listening to your voice.

508
00:43:47,665 --> 00:43:48,705
Let me help.

509
00:44:10,705 --> 00:44:12,464
Don't do what you did yesterday.

510
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:16,185
As long as Mom doesn't start it.

511
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:18,424
Nut.

512
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,825
All right. I won't.

513
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:25,944
Are you satisfied now?

514
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,505
I'm satisfied.

515
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:31,065
You're very cute like this.

516
00:44:31,984 --> 00:44:33,585
If I'm cute, I want a reward.

517
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:54,065
Let me think about what to give you.

518
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,185
Kuenchai.

519
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:14,944
Mrs. Na.

520
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:18,745
Mom.

521
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:22,464
I'll check upstairs.

522
00:45:25,705 --> 00:45:26,785
Mom.

523
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:36,185
Sorry, the number you've dialed
cannot be reached--

524
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:37,864
She's not upstairs.

525
00:45:39,585 --> 00:45:40,424
Sorry--

526
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,944
Where did she go?
Why is her phone switched off?

527
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,025
I forgot to tell you

528
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:49,225
that her phone is broken.

529
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,464
I'll go and ask the neighbors.

530
00:46:05,464 --> 00:46:08,345
Ms. Chair, do you know where Mrs. Na went?

531
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,944
Ms. Chair.

532
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:18,825
Ms. Chair.

533
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:20,864
Ms. Chair.

534
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,705
Chu and Nhong didn't see anything.

535
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:46,585
Kuenchai.

536
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:57,785
I have a doctor's appointment.

537
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:00,904
I'm going to see the doctor.

538
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:03,585
She is…

539
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:22,025
I forgot your mom
had an appointment this month.

540
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:25,185
I'm sorry for not taking good care of her.

541
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:28,305
It's not your fault. It's my fault.

542
00:47:29,065 --> 00:47:31,265
You're worried about her too, aren't you?

543
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:33,265
-Hi, there.
-Hello.

544
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:34,904
Hi, Nut, Tofu.

545
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:36,065
I came to pick Mom up.

546
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:37,944
Really?

547
00:47:39,105 --> 00:47:41,785
I saw her going that way.

548
00:47:44,265 --> 00:47:46,265
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

549
00:47:56,145 --> 00:47:59,225
The psychiatrist sent me
the preliminary test results.

550
00:47:59,785 --> 00:48:01,105
You shouldn't worry.

551
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:05,665
The symptoms you described
could have stemmed from several causes.

552
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:09,065
It could be a side effect of the medicine.

553
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,424
How about this?

554
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:12,665
I'm going to run a few more tests

555
00:48:12,745 --> 00:48:15,625
and do an additional blood test.

556
00:48:15,705 --> 00:48:18,424
This way we can identify the real cause.

557
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:55,464
There she is.

558
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:01,105
-Mom!
-Mrs. Na.

559
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:19,464
Mrs. Na.

560
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:21,785
Are you all right?

561
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:25,505
Are you hurt, Nut?

562
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:28,065
Are you?

563
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,225
Are you hurt, Nut?

564
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,105
Are you?

565
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:40,424
Are you hurt?

566
00:49:44,424 --> 00:49:45,785
He's bleeding.

567
00:49:50,785 --> 00:49:52,065
Oh, no.

568
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:54,265
Does it hurt?

569
00:50:22,825 --> 00:50:24,185
Does it hurt a lot?

570
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:25,545
Not at all.

571
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:29,424
How could it not hurt?

572
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,944
So long as you're okay, it doesn't hurt.

573
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:37,145
However, if you're hurt,
I'll feel it even more.

574
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,464
I cast a magic spell.

575
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:49,185
Your wound is going to heal soon.

576
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:52,944
Is it? Thank you.

577
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:54,785
Thank you, my boy.

578
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:02,025
Excuse me.

579
00:51:02,785 --> 00:51:04,345
I've finished dressing your wound.

580
00:51:07,345 --> 00:51:08,464
Thank you.

581
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,305
Does it hurt?

582
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,944
How could it not hurt?

583
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:41,225
How could it not hurt?

584
00:51:41,825 --> 00:51:45,025
So long as you're okay, it doesn't hurt.

585
00:51:45,665 --> 00:51:48,424
However, if you're hurt,
I'll feel it even more.

586
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:59,105
I'll go collect the prescription.

587
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:06,745
Sit down.

588
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,665
They found you?

589
00:52:12,384 --> 00:52:13,984
Where were you going just now?

590
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,105
You left by the back door.

591
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:22,745
I was…

592
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,145
just thinking about stuff
without realizing where I was going.

593
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:30,065
By the time I realized it, there I was.

594
00:52:32,785 --> 00:52:35,984
Next time, you should go with her,
so she doesn't get lost.

595
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:42,185
You seem to have the meds.
Make sure to remind your mom to take them.

596
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:50,864
Yes, Juea.

597
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:53,705
I'm at the hospital.

598
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:55,785
I have something to do.

599
00:52:57,145 --> 00:53:01,065
Okay. Once I've taken Mom home,
I'll be there.

600
00:53:03,464 --> 00:53:06,864
I better get going.

601
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:08,065
Sure.

602
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:09,464
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

603
00:53:09,545 --> 00:53:10,585
Thank you.

604
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:12,105
Let's go.

605
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:29,265
NEVER FORGET THE GOOD DAYS

606
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:36,025
ALWAYS CARE

607
00:53:43,944 --> 00:53:45,904
STILL WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

608
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:57,665
STILL WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

609
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,105
I broke up with him.

610
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,185
You two broke up?

611
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,265
It was my decision.

612
00:54:14,424 --> 00:54:15,825
Why?

613
00:54:18,665 --> 00:54:19,545
It's just…

614
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:22,065
I'm not over my ex.

615
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,705
I can tell that you really like him.

616
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:27,944
You must have been together a while.

617
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:30,665
He seems to have left quite an impression.

618
00:54:32,424 --> 00:54:33,585
Only one year.

619
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,825
He was my first love though.

620
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:42,225
They say people tend to remember
their first love.

621
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,585
They also say first loves

622
00:54:47,225 --> 00:54:50,545
often end badly.

623
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:54,025
Who was he?

624
00:54:57,785 --> 00:54:59,504
My junior in school.

625
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,625
NEVER FORGET THE GOOD DAYS

626
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,545
SOMEONE SEE… AND VALUES

627
00:55:12,864 --> 00:55:15,025
ALWAYS WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

628
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:17,265
ALWAYS WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

629
00:55:29,424 --> 00:55:30,384
Prib.

630
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:32,105
-Where's Juea?
-Hi, Nut.

631
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:33,545
Can you check this out?

632
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:35,904
-I want to know if--
-Watch out, Juea.

633
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:37,745
What's wrong with your arm?

634
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:39,504
I had an accident.

635
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:40,504
Hey, Nut.

636
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:42,944
I want to discuss the script
with you. Come.

637
00:55:43,025 --> 00:55:44,904
-Ouch. Careful, Juea.
-Sorry.

638
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:47,185
-Nut, can you first check this out?
-Prib.

639
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:49,464
We have work to do.

640
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:52,305
You don't get it, Uncle Juea.

641
00:55:54,504 --> 00:55:57,864
When am I going to finally find out?

642
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:06,984
The scene where Kawee argues with his dad,
and his mom hits Kawee.

643
00:56:07,745 --> 00:56:10,185
You describe the mom's feelings like this…

644
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:13,464
His mom is angry
because he disobeys his dad.

645
00:56:15,025 --> 00:56:16,384
Why would you think so?

646
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:20,585
I'll tell everyone

647
00:56:20,665 --> 00:56:22,625
that we are not related,

648
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:24,265
that I'm not your son.

649
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:27,145
Don't you ever say that again.

650
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,785
You are our son.

651
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,305
Because his mom is angry.

652
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:36,305
This child who's been obedient
all this time

653
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:39,825
suddenly rebels and threatens
to cut ties with his parents.

654
00:56:40,384 --> 00:56:44,984
As I read your script
and got to know your characters,

655
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:46,464
it seemed that prior to this

656
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:51,345
Kawee's mom was too afraid
to stand up for him.

657
00:56:52,424 --> 00:56:53,944
But in this scene,

658
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:58,745
it seems more like his mom
is trying to protect him.

659
00:57:00,225 --> 00:57:01,265
What do you mean?

660
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:03,984
If his mom doesn't hit him,

661
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,825
his dad probably won't stop.

662
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:09,944
She hits him
to avoid any further violence.

663
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:13,105
His dad might end up beating him to death.

664
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:16,225
But what she has done

665
00:57:16,745 --> 00:57:18,944
shows that she is affected.

666
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:22,944
She just locks up the feelings of remorse

667
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:25,145
and pain inside.

668
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:30,504
So long as you're okay, it doesn't hurt.

669
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:34,545
However, if you're hurt,
I'll feel it even more.

670
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:40,225
Since you despise who I am that much,

671
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,185
I'll tell everyone

672
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:44,145
that we are not related,

673
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:45,785
that I'm not your son.

674
00:57:48,984 --> 00:57:50,384
Don't you ever say that again.

675
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:55,504
You are our son.

676
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,145
If the mother protects her son
by hurting him,

677
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:15,345
how does she expect him to understand?

678
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,545
That's hard to say.

679
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:21,904
There's more to what she did
than I can get from the script.

680
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:26,345
It's not easy to tell
without scratching the surface.

681
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:36,424
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

682
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:42,705
WHAT IS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?

683
00:59:42,785 --> 00:59:44,904
Ms. Chair has fallen asleep.

684
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:48,785
The house is really quiet.

685
00:59:49,864 --> 00:59:51,504
Mrs. Na has been very quiet too.

686
00:59:51,984 --> 00:59:55,904
Surely, she's still upset
about what happened last night.

687
00:59:56,745 --> 00:59:59,024
I think there's more to it.

688
01:00:01,345 --> 01:00:03,785
Since we came back from the hospital,

689
01:00:03,864 --> 01:00:06,065
she has been silent,

690
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:08,745
as if she has something on her mind.

691
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:15,545
Tofu?

692
01:00:24,265 --> 01:00:25,745
Can you do me a favor?

693
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:38,384
I know that doing this is wrong.

694
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:42,384
If Nut finds out, he'll be angry with me.

695
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:45,464
I want to know what he thinks about me.

696
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:47,785
I want to know

697
01:00:49,185 --> 01:00:51,024
if he says anything bad about me.

698
01:00:53,585 --> 01:00:55,665
Why do you want to find out
all of a sudden?

699
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:59,384
Is it because of last night?

700
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:04,265
I made many mistakes in the past.

701
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:07,585
I want to find a way to correct them.

702
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:12,585
I want to make things better

703
01:01:13,225 --> 01:01:14,904
before…

704
01:01:17,065 --> 01:01:19,185
it's too late.

705
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:23,105
Can you read it out for me?

706
01:01:25,024 --> 01:01:26,225
Okay.

707
01:01:37,545 --> 01:01:38,745
Moving house

708
01:01:39,225 --> 01:01:41,065
is such a hassle.

709
01:01:46,464 --> 01:01:48,464
There are so many things to think about.

710
01:01:49,145 --> 01:01:52,665
There's the house itself
and the people in it.

711
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:57,625
At least, living here is better
than our old place.

712
01:02:04,864 --> 01:02:06,904
I haven't bought everything we need yet.

713
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:12,464
Fortunately, I brought my desk and chair
from our old house.

714
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,745
They might be old,

715
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,024
but I really like them.

716
01:02:19,145 --> 01:02:20,984
It's my favorite desk.

717
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:23,585
I've written a lot on it.

718
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:28,145
I like sitting at this desk while working.

719
01:02:29,424 --> 01:02:31,185
I feel comfortable writing on it.

720
01:02:33,345 --> 01:02:36,904
You used to tell me
that Nut wasn't home a lot.

721
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:40,225
But it sounds like he loves this house.

722
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:43,145
He chose everything in the house.

723
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:45,864
I'm terrible.

724
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:49,065
I've lived in this house for years,

725
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:54,864
but I've never thought
about how each item came about.

726
01:02:56,665 --> 01:02:57,785
It's okay.

727
01:02:58,424 --> 01:02:59,785
It's just everyday stuff.

728
01:02:59,864 --> 01:03:01,705
But Nut's everyday thoughts

729
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:05,504
don't seem to include me.

730
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:11,984
I'm sure they do.

731
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,464
I haven't reached halfway yet.

732
01:03:25,665 --> 01:03:26,625
Here we go.

733
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:32,825
Mom's phone is so old.

734
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:37,384
I'm getting my paycheck today.
I'll buy her a new phone.

735
01:03:39,904 --> 01:03:41,464
I shouldn't have bought it.

736
01:03:43,065 --> 01:03:44,864
She complained it was expensive.

737
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:46,024
What's the matter?

738
01:03:47,345 --> 01:03:48,904
What else did he write?

739
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:55,705
He wrote that you complained
it was expensive.

740
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:15,825
I don't need something
this new and expensive.

741
01:04:15,904 --> 01:04:17,864
You should have saved the money.

742
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,345
I didn't know what to do.

743
01:04:31,864 --> 01:04:34,384
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

744
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:40,305
I should have told him how good it felt

745
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:43,544
that he had thought of me.

746
01:04:44,544 --> 01:04:48,024
I should have at least said thank you.

747
01:04:50,145 --> 01:04:52,024
But I didn't say that.

748
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:56,665
Nut wanted you to have a good phone,

749
01:04:57,665 --> 01:05:01,265
while you wanted him
to keep the money for himself.

750
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,145
You both had different ways

751
01:05:04,225 --> 01:05:05,904
of showing good intentions.

752
01:05:06,504 --> 01:05:08,944
If you had been honest
with each other that day,

753
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,585
Nut wouldn't have been upset.

754
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:20,705
What else did he write?

755
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:23,065
There's more.

756
01:05:24,864 --> 01:05:26,984
I've already bought
everything for the house,

757
01:05:27,544 --> 01:05:29,504
but it's still so damn quiet.

758
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,305
Adding a new member to the household

759
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:35,424
should make it feel more like home.

760
01:05:40,825 --> 01:05:44,504
And this little guy is supposedly smart

761
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:47,305
and easy to keep and train.

762
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:49,625
He makes a good companion.

763
01:05:50,185 --> 01:05:52,105
He's just right for Mom.

764
01:05:52,185 --> 01:05:54,944
He can keep Mom company while I'm at work.

765
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,904
Despite having heavy workload

766
01:06:04,705 --> 01:06:06,745
that makes him unable
to stay home with you,

767
01:06:06,825 --> 01:06:09,145
Nut is always trying to take care of you.

768
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:15,785
I'm very lucky.

769
01:06:17,745 --> 01:06:19,424
He might be stubborn at times,

770
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:22,825
but he has always been a good son.

771
01:06:38,904 --> 01:06:40,345
I know now

772
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:43,024
why she didn't want to read it herself.

773
01:06:44,105 --> 01:06:46,984
She would rather not face
the harsh reality.

774
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,665
The reality

775
01:06:51,825 --> 01:06:54,065
that Nut hardly ever writes about her.

776
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,185
When he writes about her,

777
01:06:58,745 --> 01:07:00,745
it's not necessarily in a good light.

778
01:07:00,825 --> 01:07:03,504
You've done your best, Teddy.

779
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:08,745
Sometimes, humans tell white lies
to make others feel better.

780
01:07:10,185 --> 01:07:12,345
I wasn't intending to lie to her.

781
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:14,864
I know

782
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:17,864
that even when he writes about her
that way,

783
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:20,984
when it comes down to it, he loves her.

784
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:41,265
If the mother protects her son
by hurting him,

785
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:43,145
how does she expect him to understand?

786
01:07:43,745 --> 01:07:45,065
That's hard to say.

787
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:49,984
There's more to what she did
than I can get from the script.

788
01:07:51,904 --> 01:07:55,504
It's not easy to tell
without scratching the surface.

789
01:08:04,305 --> 01:08:06,665
If you don't see us when you get home,
don't panic.

790
01:08:07,225 --> 01:08:10,424
I'm taking your mom out for some exercise
as Dr. Kanya recommended.

791
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:22,145
Since I moved here,

792
01:08:22,225 --> 01:08:24,145
I've never come out for a walk like this.

793
01:08:25,145 --> 01:08:29,424
As a matter of fact,
I haven't done it since I was a kid.

794
01:08:29,504 --> 01:08:33,265
Back when I was still single,
I was a workaholic.

795
01:08:34,265 --> 01:08:38,504
When I got home, I had to look after
my mom who was old.

796
01:08:41,504 --> 01:08:43,464
After I got married,

797
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:45,905
I had to take care of the family.

798
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:57,985
You always put others' needs
before your own.

799
01:09:01,145 --> 01:09:02,704
I grew up with my mom.

800
01:09:03,384 --> 01:09:05,025
My parents separated.

801
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:09,145
It really affected my mom.

802
01:09:11,384 --> 01:09:14,225
I just wanted to be good
to relieve her burden.

803
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:18,225
When I got married,

804
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:23,065
I wanted my children
to have a loving family.

805
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:24,784
Not like mine.

806
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:30,384
But Nut wasn't like other boys.

807
01:09:34,744 --> 01:09:36,065
Isn't this pretty?

808
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:40,345
Nut. That's a girl's dress.
You can't wear that.

809
01:09:42,704 --> 01:09:43,664
Why not?

810
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:47,305
Can't boys wear it? I like this dress.

811
01:09:49,825 --> 01:09:52,744
Pink is for girls.

812
01:09:52,825 --> 01:09:55,784
You are a boy.
You shouldn't like pastel rainbows.

813
01:09:56,345 --> 01:09:57,425
It's silly.

814
01:10:04,345 --> 01:10:07,545
Being different
isn't the same as being bad.

815
01:10:09,025 --> 01:10:11,305
I admit that I was negligent back then.

816
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:16,185
I didn't know why Nut was like that.

817
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:20,225
I was genuinely concerned.

818
01:10:21,225 --> 01:10:24,265
I was concerned about his future.

819
01:10:24,865 --> 01:10:26,505
I wondered if he would be accepted,

820
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,704
if anyone would love him.

821
01:10:33,784 --> 01:10:35,664
His dad couldn't accept it

822
01:10:36,744 --> 01:10:40,585
and blamed me
for not raising him properly.

823
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:43,704
That's why I took his dad's side

824
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,065
and forbade Nut from being himself.

825
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:51,465
He's turning gay
because of your negligence.

826
01:10:51,545 --> 01:10:52,784
He's just a nice boy.

827
01:10:52,865 --> 01:10:54,465
Don't talk back to me.

828
01:10:54,545 --> 01:10:56,425
Boys have to be strong.

829
01:10:56,505 --> 01:10:59,065
What kind of mom are you?

830
01:10:59,145 --> 01:11:00,505
I'm not taking it.

831
01:11:01,664 --> 01:11:03,385
I don't want to be a soldier.

832
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:06,305
If you won't be a soldier,
what do you want to be?

833
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:07,985
Anything.

834
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:10,425
I just don't want to be like Dad.

835
01:11:11,704 --> 01:11:13,265
Will you please

836
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:17,345
listen to your dad?

837
01:11:17,425 --> 01:11:18,744
He wants the best for you.

838
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:21,065
He wants the best?

839
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:26,225
For me or himself?

840
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:29,744
I was weak and selfish.

841
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:33,905
As a mother,

842
01:11:33,985 --> 01:11:35,465
I should have sided with him

843
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:39,025
and protected him.

844
01:11:40,465 --> 01:11:42,825
Instead, I trampled on his heart.

845
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:48,105
I forced him to comply the way I did.

846
01:11:54,664 --> 01:11:56,704
I forbade him from being himself.

847
01:12:01,145 --> 01:12:03,704
I failed to support him.

848
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:21,505
I know that you feel bad about it.

849
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:27,744
But now that you've acknowledged
what happened,

850
01:12:29,744 --> 01:12:32,145
you feel better, don't you?

851
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:39,025
If you want
to get anything off your chest,

852
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:42,465
you can tell me.

853
01:12:43,784 --> 01:12:45,265
I'm willing to listen.

854
01:12:54,345 --> 01:12:55,865
After that day,

855
01:12:56,545 --> 01:12:58,505
Nut avoided me.

856
01:13:00,545 --> 01:13:03,105
He barely uttered a word to me.

857
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:08,065
I never had a chance to apologize to him.

858
01:13:13,664 --> 01:13:16,345
After his dad passed away,
we became even more distant.

859
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:25,945
Nut.

860
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:28,545
Come for dinner. I'll warm it up.

861
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:31,825
There's no need. I've eaten.

862
01:13:47,585 --> 01:13:48,664
Mom,

863
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,784
I'm moving to a dorm next week.

864
01:14:57,225 --> 01:15:00,025
I knew that Nut moved here
because of my condition.

865
01:15:01,025 --> 01:15:03,945
He didn't want me to be reminded
of what had happened before.

866
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:10,345
Despite our move,

867
01:15:11,385 --> 01:15:14,505
the distance between us didn't change.

868
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:27,425
The longer it went on,

869
01:15:29,345 --> 01:15:32,824
the harder it became to heal the rift.

870
01:15:34,105 --> 01:15:35,905
Then I came to realize

871
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:41,145
that Nut didn't need me anymore.

872
01:15:54,905 --> 01:15:57,145
I wronged him

873
01:16:00,784 --> 01:16:04,065
because I grew up in an unstable family.

874
01:16:05,784 --> 01:16:08,865
I wished for my own family to be perfect.

875
01:16:10,624 --> 01:16:13,585
But in this world, nothing is perfect.

876
01:16:14,545 --> 01:16:16,465
I used to fear

877
01:16:18,305 --> 01:16:21,465
that Nut was abnormal for being like this.

878
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:25,225
In fact, being gay is normal.

879
01:16:29,305 --> 01:16:30,784
These days

880
01:16:33,225 --> 01:16:35,065
seeing him all grown up,

881
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:38,105
capable of supporting himself…

882
01:16:39,065 --> 01:16:42,624
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH PEERANUT BURARAT

883
01:16:57,784 --> 01:16:59,065
…being accepted by others,

884
01:16:59,905 --> 01:17:02,265
with friends like everyone else…

885
01:17:02,345 --> 01:17:04,185
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH PEERANUT BURARAT

886
01:17:20,145 --> 01:17:22,425
I've realized that kids
should be themselves.

887
01:17:24,225 --> 01:17:26,744
They should be allowed
to choose their own paths

888
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:31,945
with the support of their parents,

889
01:17:32,985 --> 01:17:34,664
without being under control.

890
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:38,025
A child's life is their own,

891
01:17:38,585 --> 01:17:40,305
not their parents'.

892
01:17:44,065 --> 01:17:46,784
You accepted who he was long ago, right?

893
01:17:49,025 --> 01:17:51,225
That's why you could accept me.

894
01:17:51,905 --> 01:17:55,225
I never wanted to kick you out
like Nut always feared.

895
01:17:56,465 --> 01:18:00,465
I'm actually thankful
for your presence in our life.

896
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:04,824
I no longer care about
what others might say.

897
01:18:06,225 --> 01:18:07,744
The smile on his face

898
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:11,025
makes me realize what makes him happy

899
01:18:11,664 --> 01:18:13,945
and what makes me happy.

900
01:18:17,185 --> 01:18:21,065
Thank you
for throwing me a birthday party.

901
01:18:22,945 --> 01:18:24,065
Do you like it?

902
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:26,585
Yes.

903
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,185
Do you like the party

904
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:31,225
or me?

905
01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:35,025
What a cheap shot.

906
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:39,585
When you asked me what I wanted

907
01:18:39,664 --> 01:18:41,664
for my birthday

908
01:18:42,465 --> 01:18:44,065
and I said nothing,

909
01:18:48,465 --> 01:18:50,145
that's because

910
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:53,744
I already have you.

911
01:18:59,624 --> 01:19:01,585
Stay by my side…

912
01:19:04,345 --> 01:19:05,865
and don't go anywhere.

913
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:16,945
Thank you so much

914
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:20,145
for making him happy.

915
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:26,784
You make him laugh and smile
like I haven't seen him do for so long.

916
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:31,585
Also,

917
01:19:33,824 --> 01:19:35,624
thank you…

918
01:19:38,465 --> 01:19:40,105
for being there for me

919
01:19:40,905 --> 01:19:43,465
and supporting me through all this.

920
01:19:48,704 --> 01:19:52,065
If I hadn't been sick, I would have
been able to talk to him more.

921
01:19:53,065 --> 01:19:56,265
Now that I feel better
and I'm thinking straight,

922
01:19:57,305 --> 01:19:58,985
it seems like it's too late.

923
01:20:00,945 --> 01:20:02,744
It's never too late.

924
01:20:05,145 --> 01:20:07,305
You can always start over.

925
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:10,225
You can do that right this minute.

926
01:20:34,784 --> 01:20:35,945
Shall we go home?

927
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:39,025
Let's go.

928
01:21:22,305 --> 01:21:24,105
How about this?

929
01:21:24,585 --> 01:21:26,225
Think about it.

930
01:21:26,704 --> 01:21:28,305
From what you've written,

931
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:30,065
the mother and her son

932
01:21:30,145 --> 01:21:32,105
don't really show it,

933
01:21:33,425 --> 01:21:34,865
but I can tell for sure

934
01:21:35,905 --> 01:21:37,425
that they still love each other.

935
01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:42,704
Do you think I should revise it?

936
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,185
You should ask yourself that.

937
01:21:46,145 --> 01:21:48,664
You're the one writing it.

938
01:21:49,585 --> 01:21:52,985
How the relationship
between the mom and her son will turn out

939
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,305
is not up to me.

940
01:21:56,185 --> 01:21:57,744
It's up to you.

941
01:22:55,025 --> 01:22:57,025
You came home late today, Nut.

942
01:22:59,824 --> 01:23:02,185
I thought we might go out for a walk.

943
01:23:02,865 --> 01:23:04,744
I took a walk with your mom.

944
01:23:04,824 --> 01:23:06,545
We talked about many things.

945
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:16,225
She knows about us.

946
01:23:18,905 --> 01:23:20,784
She's not opposed to it.

947
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:26,664
Perhaps she doesn't say anything,

948
01:23:27,704 --> 01:23:29,585
not because she doesn't care,

949
01:23:31,265 --> 01:23:34,025
but because she accepts who you are.

950
01:23:41,664 --> 01:23:42,985
I know

951
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:45,065
that you're staying silent

952
01:23:45,545 --> 01:23:47,385
because you're thinking.

953
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:52,945
Your mom is like this too.

954
01:23:54,385 --> 01:23:56,465
If you listen carefully,

955
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:58,905
the silence

956
01:23:59,585 --> 01:24:02,585
may hide deep love and concern.

957
01:24:06,145 --> 01:24:09,664
Don't you think you should give yourself

958
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,905
and give your mom a chance?

959
01:24:18,744 --> 01:24:20,185
You're quite the philosopher.

960
01:24:22,305 --> 01:24:23,505
Are you talking now?

961
01:24:28,824 --> 01:24:30,985
Today, your mom had sore feet.

962
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:34,505
Shall we buy her new shoes tomorrow?

963
01:25:03,905 --> 01:25:05,065
Mrs. Na?

964
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:13,265
I came to tell you to dress up tomorrow.

965
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:14,225
Yes?

966
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:16,985
Why?

967
01:25:17,065 --> 01:25:20,225
Well, we are going shopping tomorrow.

968
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:21,505
Nut is taking us.

969
01:25:22,065 --> 01:25:22,985
Really?

970
01:26:13,145 --> 01:26:15,145
Is this outfit okay, Tofu?

971
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:19,704
I don't go out much.
I only have old clothes.

972
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:21,945
You look great.

973
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:25,225
Where's Nut?

974
01:26:30,145 --> 01:26:31,065
He…

975
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:46,345
Are they both your sons?
They're so handsome.

976
01:26:46,824 --> 01:26:47,824
Yes.

977
01:26:48,505 --> 01:26:49,824
He is my son.

978
01:26:51,185 --> 01:26:52,704
He is also my son.

979
01:26:55,065 --> 01:26:58,545
Tarn told me
that he wanted Nut to be happy,

980
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:01,185
and what happened between them

981
01:27:01,865 --> 01:27:05,744
should just be left as a happy memory.

982
01:27:06,704 --> 01:27:09,185
He was the one who made me understand

983
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,905
that being gay isn't a disease.

984
01:27:11,545 --> 01:27:12,864
It's not down to bad karma,

985
01:27:14,265 --> 01:27:15,744
or an emotional disorder.

986
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:18,585
And it's not a joke.

987
01:27:18,664 --> 01:27:24,385
NEXT EPISODE

988
01:27:24,465 --> 01:27:25,945
Tarn.

989
