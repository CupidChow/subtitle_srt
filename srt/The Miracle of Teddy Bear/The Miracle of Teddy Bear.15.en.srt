1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,144
I promise.

2
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,945
I'll stay and take care of you

3
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,184
and take care of Nut.

4
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,585
I'll never leave.

5
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:19,665
Let's make the rest of your mom's memories

6
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,545
good memories.

7
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:29,585
The thing that Alzheimer's
can't take away from us…

8
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,344
is love.

9
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,785
I want a photo shoot too.

10
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,105
A family photo shoot.

11
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:38,985
You better ask your dad.

12
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:40,105
If Dad agrees,

13
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:42,745
we have to dress up nicer than this.

14
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:44,025
But I'm sick of it!

15
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:47,665
I'm sick of getting pressured by everyone,

16
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,985
including Sib, Mr. Sakon,

17
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:51,585
Ms. Ching, and you.

18
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:21,745
Are you leaving already?

19
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,665
What's the rush?

20
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,745
You talked me into staying over.
What am I supposed to do?

21
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:33,344
I have to go before your dad comes back.

22
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,425
Didn't you say you're willing
to face anything?

23
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:39,145
What are you afraid of?

24
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:42,344
I'm not afraid.

25
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,105
I'm just thinking of your dad.

26
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,945
If he sees me here unexpectedly,

27
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,344
he might be shocked.

28
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,464
When Dad gets back,

29
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,665
I'll tell him about us.

30
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,064
Are you in a rush?

31
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,025
Yes. Of course.

32
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:07,585
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

33
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:10,504
Nothing is certain in life.

34
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,545
Look at Nut and his mom.

35
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,384
They say you should live life
to the fullest.

36
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,704
Do whatever you want to do.
Love whoever you want to love.

37
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,704
Tell the ones you love how you feel.

38
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,385
I'm very happy to have you.

39
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,025
Should I be happy

40
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:37,865
to have you?

41
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:40,785
Of course.

42
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:42,785
I have many good qualities.

43
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,144
Do I still have to prove them?

44
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:50,024
You little…

45
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,545
Should I do it again?

46
00:04:58,185 --> 00:04:59,065
Dad.

47
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:24,425
Here.

48
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,985
I'm leaving now.

49
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,225
I'll let you two talk.

50
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:49,985
I want you to stay.

51
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,584
He and I

52
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,144
are seeing each other, Dad.

53
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:18,065
I wanted to tell you about it
in Chiang Mai.

54
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,985
I just couldn't find the right timing.

55
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:27,824
How long has it been?

56
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,425
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,264
I didn't think I needed to tell you.

58
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,824
We've lived together for so long.

59
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:41,665
You should have realized what I'm like.

60
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,865
But I forgot

61
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:49,904
that actually…

62
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,505
we barely spent any time together.

63
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,545
I was focused on my studies here.

64
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,185
You were busy with your work there.

65
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,345
We don't know each other
as well as I thought.

66
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:07,785
Even though I'm still young,

67
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,945
and you still see me as a little kid…

68
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:19,625
this…

69
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,545
is something I'm certain about.

70
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,144
I'm sorry, Dad.

71
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:36,584
Getting married,

72
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,665
having children,

73
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:43,305
having a family like you dream of,

74
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,065
like other sons could,
isn't possible for me.

75
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:57,105
I know that

76
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,144
this might come as a shock.

77
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:02,865
It might make you upset

78
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:05,144
and disappointed,

79
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,385
but we promised

80
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,305
that we would be honest with each other.

81
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,144
I wanted you to hear this from me

82
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,704
rather than find out from someone else.

83
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:02,745
Hello, are you home yet?

84
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,865
Yes, I'm home.

85
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,585
Are you all right?

86
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,785
Sure.

87
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,465
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:15,985
I meant to introduce you to my dad
under better circumstances.

89
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,785
However you did it,
your dad would have been shocked.

90
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:24,785
But I'm sure

91
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,905
that your dad will realize

92
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,505
that you told him first

93
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,865
because he's the person
you love and trust the most.

94
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,145
Just be patient.

95
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:39,145
I'm sure he was so quiet
because it was a shock like you said.

96
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:44,184
But I believe that Dad
will come to love you like I do.

97
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:48,025
Dad will realize
that I made the right choice.

98
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,985
I know. I'll speak to you later.

99
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,265
I'm going to do some revision.

100
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:12,785
Song.

101
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:30,505
I should

102
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:33,625
apologize to you.

103
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,265
I know that in the past,

104
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,424
I didn't give you
the attention you deserved.

105
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:45,304
Now, I know who you really are.

106
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:50,145
I need some time.

107
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,785
Please give me time.

108
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:02,625
I love you, Dad.

109
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,865
I love you too, boy.

110
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:33,824
Yes, Lieutenant Kong?

111
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,064
Ms. Kaew-ching-duang flew back to Bangkok.

112
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,665
From the information I found,

113
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:44,265
TRD seems to be a major investor
in the hospital.

114
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,705
They've been donating money
for construction and medical supplies

115
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,465
for years.

116
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,465
You seem very concerned about Tarn.

117
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,585
You came all the way here to visit him.

118
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,505
I care for the welfare of all people.

119
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,985
Particularly people involved
with your assets, right?

120
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,705
Everyone is concerned with their assets.

121
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:14,304
As it happens,

122
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:18,025
you wouldn't give the time of day
to the nephew you so despise

123
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:21,385
if he didn't own the land
you have your eyes on.

124
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:26,785
Don't look so surprised.

125
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,905
I pay attention to every single one
of my people.

126
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:36,225
Your husband is my trusted employee.
We've worked together for years.

127
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:39,905
If he has a problem,
I'm always willing to lend a hand.

128
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:50,944
But it appears that someone
doesn't want this to end.

129
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,985
Things would have turned out better

130
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,944
if it wasn't for those busybodies
causing trouble.

131
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:00,145
The people checking out Tarn's house?

132
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:06,505
Yes, but they won't be
in the way much longer,

133
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,544
because I hate people getting in my way.

134
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:24,465
Oh, wow.

135
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:27,865
Are you that sick of my cooking?

136
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:29,465
Not at all.

137
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,345
I just wanted to take you out for a meal.

138
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,625
We could just eat at home.
That way, your mom could join us.

139
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:42,225
I promised you
before we left for Chiang Mai

140
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:44,944
that I wanted to take you on a trip.

141
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:48,385
But right now, we can't go anywhere.

142
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,505
Since we can't take a trip,

143
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,225
a meal will have to do.

144
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,025
Also, don't worry about Mom.
I've told her about this.

145
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,184
Mom wanted you to take a break.

146
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:04,184
She also said you've lost weight lately.

147
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:06,505
You should eat more. Here.

148
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,265
I'm going to dig in then.

149
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:11,865
This is mine.

150
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:21,064
You should think about
your own feelings, Tofu.

151
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:24,944
If you have a chance to love someone,

152
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:30,304
you should show your love
and take good care of that person.

153
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:31,265
Is it good?

154
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,225
You have no clue

155
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,064
where your path will lead.

156
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:43,225
Your destination

157
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:47,465
may cause you heartache,

158
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:50,105
but you will not regret it.

159
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,985
There's nothing more important

160
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,225
than seeing your loved ones happy

161
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,184
when you are together.

162
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:33,745
It's Juea. I should take it.

163
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:37,785
What is it, Juea?

164
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:42,184
When?

165
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,905
I already sent it.

166
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,424
Nut,

167
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,865
I need the bathroom.

168
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:56,025
I already sent it. Check again.
It's the third draft.

169
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,625
Yes. No, that was last Monday.

170
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,944
Here, Tofu.

171
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:06,984
Thank you.

172
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:11,865
Tofu. Pampering him like this
will only make him fall deeper for you.

173
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:14,585
Nut has been taking great care of me.

174
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:16,785
I wanted to give him something.

175
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,984
Thank you so much.

176
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:22,305
It's no problem.
I like seeing people in love.

177
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:27,865
I'm going now.

178
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,625
Aren't they enviable?

179
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:36,065
Why would you be envious?
Do you want a gift too?

180
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,825
Of course not.

181
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,385
I'm already head over heels for you.

182
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:42,785
I'm just waiting for Dad to feel the same.

183
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,504
He needs some time. Please wait a bit.

184
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,065
Where are you going?

185
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,905
If you don't want to die,
keep your mouth shut.

186
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,905
Who are you? What do you want?

187
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,585
Tofu.

188
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:49,145
Nut.

189
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,024
Tofu.

190
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,665
Are you hurt?

191
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:09,825
Hey.

192
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:21,264
If I hadn't been there,
what would you have done?

193
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:24,825
Fortunately, I went to look for you.

194
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:26,984
You had been gone a while.

195
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:30,905
I'm sorry.

196
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:33,784
I almost got you hurt again.

197
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,105
It's you who got hurt.

198
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:39,024
Why didn't you let me call the police?

199
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:44,825
It's no big deal.

200
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:47,425
If you call the police

201
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:49,984
and they find out
that I don't have any ID,

202
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,545
we'll have problems.

203
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,625
But we'll never know who he was.

204
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,585
What brings you to see me this early?

205
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:19,945
I brought you some strawberry jam.

206
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,744
Mrs. Na and I made it
for the people who came to our party.

207
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:25,865
I thought you would like some.

208
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:31,545
I don't like sweet stuff.

209
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,984
Say thank you anyway, though.

210
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:39,665
What happened to your hand?

211
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,105
I was attacked.

212
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:48,145
A harmless boy like you got attacked?

213
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,905
It must have been a misunderstanding
or misidentification.

214
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:55,705
That's what I thought at first.

215
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,065
But when he threatened me,

216
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:01,825
I thought maybe I had stumbled upon
someone's secrets.

217
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:04,825
People these days are scary.

218
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:06,984
They're hard to read.

219
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,984
They do what they like.

220
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:12,865
That's right. You never know.

221
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:17,065
Some people seem harmless,

222
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,784
but they can be hiding a vicious side.

223
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,105
And sometimes,

224
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,744
those closest to you

225
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,585
are the least trustworthy.

226
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:35,145
But you have amnesia.

227
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:38,105
How could you have come across
anyone's secrets?

228
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:40,305
Maybe…

229
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:43,105
you really don't have amnesia.

230
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,185
Hey, I'm just kidding.

231
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,905
A good boy like you wouldn't lie, right?

232
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:58,865
I don't know

233
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,905
if you had anything to do with Tarn.

234
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:06,905
However, if you happen to remember
anything, you should be careful.

235
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,345
With some matters,

236
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:12,264
the more you know,
the more danger you are in.

237
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:15,544
Like how Tarn was attacked

238
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,825
on the day you and Mr. Saen were there?

239
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:27,264
SAEN

240
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,345
Why don't you answer it?

241
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,784
Do you have a secret I shouldn't hear?

242
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,945
I can leave.

243
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:41,865
What is it?

244
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,225
The doctor wants to talk?

245
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,185
What's the matter?

246
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,784
Okay. I'm on my way.

247
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,385
Can I go and see Tarn?

248
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:57,465
You wouldn't mind, would you?

249
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:04,264
From the X-ray and CT scan,

250
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:08,984
we found that the patient
has a brain abscess.

251
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:12,585
It's about 3 cm across.

252
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,105
If we leave it,

253
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:17,305
it could rupture,
causing pus to enter the brain cavity.

254
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:19,345
That could be fatal.

255
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:23,744
We need to operate again
to remove the pus.

256
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:28,865
Dr. Nueng will perform the surgery.

257
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:33,544
Why did the previous doctors
not find this?

258
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:39,905
Perhaps because his symptoms
weren't indicative of an abscess then.

259
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,865
I can't say for sure
how long it has been there.

260
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:45,385
We saw he had fever,

261
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:46,984
which suggested an infection.

262
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:50,385
So Dr. Nueng ordered the CT scan,
which led to this finding.

263
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:53,665
Is the surgery high-risk?

264
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,625
It's possible that the patient
won't survive the surgery.

265
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:03,585
After the surgery, will my nephew
regain consciousness?

266
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,065
The brain abscess doesn't affect
whether he will wake up or not.

267
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:10,784
He's in a coma

268
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:13,865
because his brain suffered severe trauma

269
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,145
that put him in a brain-dead condition.

270
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:20,625
For that, we can only wait
for his brain to slowly recover.

271
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,225
As for the abscess,

272
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:27,225
if we don't operate on it,
there's a chance he'll die if it ruptures.

273
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,945
What about the cost?

274
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:34,465
I will cover any costs. I'm happy to.

275
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:37,225
I just want Tatarn to be safe.

276
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,585
There's no need to help.
I can handle this myself.

277
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,425
Seeing my employee

278
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:04,465
running around for his nephew,

279
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:05,984
I can't help but lend a hand.

280
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:09,065
Are you helping me or TRD?

281
00:26:09,784 --> 00:26:10,905
You know

282
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,784
that with my help,

283
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,465
all sides stand to gain.

284
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:18,385
If you want to repay my kindness,

285
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:22,385
you should use your time
to focus on our project.

286
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:35,504
Why do you care?
The operation won't wake him up.

287
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,585
Does Tatarn need more surgery?

288
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:43,984
The doctors found an abscess.

289
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:45,225
They need to operate

290
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,504
as it could be dangerous.

291
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:49,504
He might not make it.

292
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,665
How did you get here?

293
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:59,425
I went to Jan's house
to give her something.

294
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:01,625
When I heard the news,

295
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,585
I wanted to visit him.

296
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:10,264
And your hand?

297
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:15,504
It was just a little accident.

298
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:18,425
I'm leaving now.

299
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,385
Don't tell me you did that.

300
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,784
I told you not to do anything.

301
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:30,065
Why are you stirring things up?

302
00:27:30,145 --> 00:27:33,665
Why is it always my fault?
I didn't do anything.

303
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,065
Let me drive you home.

304
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:52,185
I want to see Na.

305
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:15,264
That blanket…

306
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:18,425
It's the wedding gift
you gave Mrs. Na, right?

307
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:25,225
How strange.

308
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,705
When I gave it to her,

309
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,825
I had this feeling

310
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,024
that it was like our little daughter.

311
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:38,225
Na and I used to talk
about having a daughter.

312
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:46,304
That must be why Ms. Blanket

313
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:49,544
became such a chatty girl.

314
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:53,744
I never thought

315
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:57,064
that what I did would hurt Na.

316
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:01,825
I made Sib paranoid.

317
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,984
The blanket made him jealous.

318
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,465
He forbade her from using it.

319
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:12,064
He thought I gave it to her
to remind her of me.

320
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,105
Even on that day,

321
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:20,625
the day he died…

322
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:23,905
The day Mr. Sib died,

323
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,225
were you there?

324
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:54,105
I had come back to Bangkok on business.

325
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:57,264
I went to see Na and Nut as usual.

326
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,544
Nut wasn't home that day.

327
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,024
Sib was seriously ill.

328
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,825
He still managed
to come downstairs, though.

329
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:12,705
Mr. Sib must have thought

330
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,585
that the two of you were still in love,

331
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:18,544
so he hurried down to intervene.

332
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,225
That was part of it.

333
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:27,425
The thing was,

334
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:31,064
Sib used to hit Na.

335
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:34,585
He didn't want me to find out.

336
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:38,504
He took a load of meds,
so he could go down and get rid of me.

337
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:19,345
As your friend, you can tell me.

338
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,504
He must have been in a hurry,

339
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:23,504
and he took the wrong meds.

340
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:26,385
Sib had been allergic to NSAIDs
since he was young.

341
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,744
Luckily, I don't have the same allergy.

342
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:33,945
Honey.

343
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,385
What's wrong?

344
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,105
What's wrong?

345
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,105
What's wrong?

346
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:42,905
Saen, call for an ambulance.

347
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:45,024
Sib.

348
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:46,784
Sib.

349
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:50,784
Na and I tried to get him to the hospital.

350
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:53,905
But it was too late.

351
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:59,185
-No!
-Na was devastated.

352
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,984
She blamed herself for his death.

353
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:08,465
She didn't know
that Sib was allergic to those drugs.

354
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:10,504
That's why she kept them in the house.

355
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:14,304
I tried to console her.

356
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:17,105
I told her it wasn't her fault.

357
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:21,064
All she did was buy the medicine.

358
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,504
The reality was too cruel to take,

359
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,544
which was why she deluded herself

360
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:33,824
and created a new world.

361
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,105
I'll come back another day to visit her.

362
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,945
She needs plenty of rest.

363
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:27,984
I'm leaving now.

364
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:30,824
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

365
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,824
I'm sorry

366
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:52,824
for going to visit Tatarn
without telling you.

367
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:57,425
Since we came back from Chiang Mai,

368
00:33:58,345 --> 00:33:59,945
you've visited Tarn regularly

369
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:02,905
and it seems like
something is on your mind.

370
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:06,064
It's not just Tarn
that has been bothering you, is it?

371
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,625
It has something to do
with Uncle Saen and Jan.

372
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:12,744
You know?

373
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:14,465
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:19,505
I have my suspicions,

375
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:22,904
but I hope those are not true.

376
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:26,585
I never thought someone like Mr. Saen

377
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,465
could hurt anyone,

378
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:31,904
especially his own family.

379
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:35,705
I hope you're right.

380
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,665
I have enough on my plate with Mom.

381
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:52,424
You love Mr. Saen a lot, don't you?

382
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,225
Maybe because I've always wished

383
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:03,424
he was my dad.

384
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:09,345
When my dad died, I hardly cried.

385
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,185
I used to think that

386
00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:13,585
it wasn't bad that he died.

387
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:15,665
Mom and I were free.

388
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:17,825
We would no longer get hurt.

389
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:25,185
You must have been
grief-stricken that day.

390
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:30,065
It was like any other day.

391
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:33,345
My dad and I stayed out
of each other's way.

392
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:50,345
At the time, I was staying in a dorm.
I rarely came home.

393
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:54,065
When I found out and came to the hospital,

394
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:56,345
he had already passed.

395
00:35:57,665 --> 00:35:58,625
When I asked Mom…

396
00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:00,025
What happened?

397
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,745
…she just cried.

398
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:05,864
She must have been in shock
to see him die in her arms.

399
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:11,944
My uncle later told me

400
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,065
that Dad took the wrong meds.

401
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,424
I don't know how it could have happened.

402
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:21,025
Dad knew which meds he was allergic to.

403
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:23,065
Mom also knew.

404
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:25,065
Even I knew about it

405
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:27,465
because I used to buy meds for him.

406
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,185
I guess it was just his time.

407
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:43,465
Uncle Saen arranged the funeral.

408
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,665
He stepped in to help us.

409
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,944
After that, we rarely saw him.

410
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,665
He still helped us from afar,

411
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,585
but he stopped visiting Mom.

412
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:01,864
At the time, I was busy studying.
I didn't come home much.

413
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,145
Mom was grieving on her own.

414
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,065
If I had known then that Mom was sick,

415
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:17,825
I wouldn't have left her like that.

416
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:33,864
How is Tarn?

417
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,384
The surgery went as planned.

418
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:39,505
We managed to draw out some pus.

419
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:41,185
And during the surgery,

420
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:43,745
his blood pressure
and vital signs were all normal.

421
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:49,705
Does that mean Tarn
has a chance of recovering?

422
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,585
Like I've said,

423
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:56,384
whether he wakes up or not
depends on how his brain recovers.

424
00:38:57,825 --> 00:38:59,864
But I think I know

425
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:01,665
what caused the abscess.

426
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:05,864
I need to talk with the doctor first.

427
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:10,904
I'm the officer in charge of this case.

428
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:18,705
Lieutenant.

429
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:21,305
I just heard from the doctor that--

430
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:22,305
Dad.

431
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:27,105
Dad!

432
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:30,985
Dad.

433
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,225
You have to be okay.

434
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:43,065
Your dad will be fine.

435
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:50,424
Nut.

436
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:52,065
What happened?

437
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:53,705
He was shot.

438
00:39:53,785 --> 00:39:54,825
What?

439
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,424
I just saw him less than ten minutes ago.

440
00:39:57,985 --> 00:39:59,145
You were with him?

441
00:39:59,225 --> 00:40:02,265
Yes. Me, the deputy chief,
Mr. Saen and Jan

442
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:04,944
were just speaking with Tarn's surgeon.

443
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:07,384
How could he get shot at the hospital?

444
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:09,185
He doesn't have any enemies.

445
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,464
Maybe it's about what the doctor said?

446
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:13,105
What did she say?

447
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,745
The doctor found a splinter
in Tarn's brain.

448
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:20,185
When I removed the pus,
I found this splinter.

449
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:24,665
A splinter?

450
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:29,464
I suspect this to be the cause
of the abscess…

451
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:32,785
even though it has been a while
since the incident.

452
00:40:33,785 --> 00:40:35,424
But the previous doctor said

453
00:40:35,904 --> 00:40:38,785
that the weapon the perpetrator used
was a blunt, solid object.

454
00:40:39,464 --> 00:40:40,424
Moreover,

455
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,665
there was no sign of an open wound

456
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:45,265
or any other object found.

457
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:47,505
That's not possible.

458
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,625
During the first operation,

459
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:52,665
the surgeon must have seen
that piece of wood in there.

460
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:55,225
Unless the surgeon made a mistake.

461
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:59,225
The doctor suspects that it was likely
from the assault weapon.

462
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:01,985
I reckon it's a vital piece of evidence

463
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:04,944
that will help us identify
who the perpetrator is.

464
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,185
Dad must have realized this,

465
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:11,105
so they sent someone to silence him.

466
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:13,464
What about the broken tiles?

467
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,464
What are you talking about?

468
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:22,065
That day at Tarn's house,

469
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:24,665
I found some tile fragments in a pot.

470
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:27,505
They shouldn't have been there.

471
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:29,745
I told Mr. Anik about it,

472
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:32,505
in case they might help find who did it.

473
00:41:34,384 --> 00:41:36,105
Why didn't you tell me?

474
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,625
Do you actually think
that Uncle Saen and Jan did it?

475
00:41:42,424 --> 00:41:44,065
I can't be sure.

476
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:46,944
The perpetrator must have known
that I told Mr. Anik this.

477
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:53,424
Actually, the day I was attacked,

478
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:56,145
he didn't get the wrong person.

479
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,705
He threatened me.

480
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:03,105
I didn't tell you

481
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,025
because I didn't want you to worry.

482
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:10,145
It's obvious.

483
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:12,384
The culprit must be involved
in Tarn's assault.

484
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,985
Someone must have been following us.

485
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:18,185
Anyone that bold,

486
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:20,145
who's not scared of the police,

487
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,545
must have money and power.

488
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:27,464
TRD?

489
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:37,345
Saen, where are you going?
We have to talk.

490
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,625
Since it has come to this,

491
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:39,864
will you tell me

492
00:42:39,944 --> 00:42:42,345
what happened after you took Tarn
away in your car?

493
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:44,665
-Saen!
-I don't know.

494
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:46,345
I know.

495
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:48,745
I know that you can get out of this.

496
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:51,505
What the doctor said about the splinter

497
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:54,505
means that you didn't put Tarn in a coma.

498
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:57,305
If we tell the police,
we'll be out of the spotlight.

499
00:42:57,384 --> 00:43:00,145
Will you stay out of this?

500
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:02,904
But why? You didn't do anything wrong.

501
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:04,904
Why would you be a scapegoat
for your boss?

502
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:07,145
What I do is my business.

503
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:10,464
What did she say to you
to make you do all this?

504
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,185
Did she threaten you?

505
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:13,185
Are you afraid?

506
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:14,625
You should go home.

507
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,185
I can handle this.

508
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:19,665
Saen.

509
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:22,825
Saen.

510
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:35,984
The police will be on their way
to the hospital.

511
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:38,185
Tell him to find a place to lay low.

512
00:43:38,864 --> 00:43:40,944
This way, we'll win this.

513
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:45,864
Why did you have to do that?

514
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:49,505
Was hurting the kid not enough?
You sent someone to shoot the cop.

515
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,585
I was only going to handle that young man.

516
00:43:54,904 --> 00:43:57,984
But you had him transferred here
and alerted the police.

517
00:43:58,464 --> 00:44:00,505
I had to nip it in the bud.

518
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:04,145
How many more doctors will you pay off?
How many police are you going to kill?

519
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:08,105
How is this going to end? By killing me?

520
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:11,185
Killing you would be nothing.

521
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:16,185
That's right. If you wanted to kill me,
you would have done so long ago.

522
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:18,305
But you didn't,

523
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:19,984
because you knew that more killings

524
00:44:20,065 --> 00:44:21,745
would attract more attention to TRD

525
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,984
reducing your chances
of getting away with it.

526
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:27,785
I think instead of stirring
things up further,

527
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:29,105
we should make a deal.

528
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:33,825
What deal?

529
00:44:34,825 --> 00:44:38,105
If you want the property development
project to continue,

530
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:40,424
you must stop hurting people.

531
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:42,384
Let me deal with Tatarn.

532
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:44,904
When he wakes up, I'll talk to him.

533
00:44:46,025 --> 00:44:49,185
Are you going to ask him
not to pursue the assault case?

534
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:50,625
That's right.

535
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:52,505
When he wakes up,

536
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:55,345
I'll explain everything
that happened to him.

537
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:00,825
There's no chance that will work.

538
00:45:00,904 --> 00:45:03,705
If you had done the job properly
in the first place,

539
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,424
it wouldn't have come to this.

540
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:08,424
It's your fault it came to this.

541
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:12,345
You sent people after us
after ordering me to negotiate with Tarn.

542
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:55,305
I knew what a coward you were.

543
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:58,384
That's why I sent my people
to finish the job.

544
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,065
But you were stupid.

545
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,625
You almost wrecked everything.

546
00:46:08,424 --> 00:46:09,665
Tarn!

547
00:46:09,745 --> 00:46:10,665
Tarn.

548
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,625
Clean up the scene.

549
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:17,225
What are you doing?

550
00:46:17,785 --> 00:46:19,105
Why did you do that?

551
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:22,785
It's done.

552
00:46:23,545 --> 00:46:24,464
Hey.

553
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:26,625
Let's move him.

554
00:46:26,705 --> 00:46:29,305
Where are you taking him?

555
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:31,265
I won't let you do this to my nephew.

556
00:46:31,345 --> 00:46:33,464
Stay out of this.
It's none of your business.

557
00:46:33,545 --> 00:46:34,864
I made a recording.

558
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:37,705
You killed your own brother.

559
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,864
You caused the woman
you loved to go crazy.

560
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:44,025
But you pretended
it had nothing to do with you.

561
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:46,785
Pick him up.

562
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:53,105
How fortunate that luck
didn't side with an idiot like you.

563
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,745
We succeeded.

564
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:59,025
It's just a shame that my people
weren't thorough enough.

565
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:02,305
Your nephew is like a cat with nine lives.

566
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:06,585
What did you do to him?

567
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,464
Careful.

568
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:30,665
-You!
-Ouch.

569
00:47:49,984 --> 00:47:52,065
You are even more heartless
than I thought.

570
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:54,065
You are no less heartless than I am.

571
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:58,625
Acting all worried about your nephew,
but not reporting it to the police.

572
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:02,745
Hurrying home to get rid
of incriminating evidence.

573
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:04,904
You might as well admit

574
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,265
that deep down,

575
00:49:06,345 --> 00:49:08,065
you wanted him dead.

576
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,384
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
threatened him with the vase.

577
00:49:12,705 --> 00:49:14,864
Besides, you didn't want him dead

578
00:49:15,424 --> 00:49:16,944
just because I ordered it.

579
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:19,944
You know the real reason.

580
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:23,025
Should I tell the police

581
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:25,505
as well as your wife?

582
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:28,025
Jan.

583
00:49:29,025 --> 00:49:30,145
What are you doing here?

584
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,305
I told you I could handle this.

585
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:33,505
If I hadn't come,

586
00:49:33,585 --> 00:49:35,665
would I have found out what she did

587
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:36,984
to force your hand

588
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:38,825
and make you her scapegoat?

589
00:49:39,705 --> 00:49:40,705
Scapegoat?

590
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:45,424
Do you really believe your husband
is so innocent and virtuous?

591
00:49:46,944 --> 00:49:48,825
You put on a good facade.

592
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:52,225
Haven't you told your wife
the terrible thing you did?

593
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:56,424
What did you do?

594
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:00,464
ONE MILLION BAHT

595
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:23,545
Please return this to your boss, Uncle.

596
00:50:25,265 --> 00:50:27,025
Let's not make things difficult.

597
00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:29,305
-Accept this and--
-I won't.

598
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:33,305
I'm not like you,
choosing money over justice.

599
00:50:34,305 --> 00:50:35,384
Justice?

600
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:38,984
Justice in this country can be bought.

601
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:41,384
Do you really think you can beat them?

602
00:50:41,864 --> 00:50:43,545
Look at them, then look at you.

603
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:45,705
Stop being naive.

604
00:50:46,265 --> 00:50:48,625
It's because of your generation
thinking that way

605
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:50,545
that our country is like this.

606
00:50:51,585 --> 00:50:53,464
If you don't want to make things better,

607
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,904
feel free to put up with it.

608
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:58,105
Just don't get in my way.

609
00:50:58,665 --> 00:51:00,225
Tarn.

610
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:03,785
Please Tarn, do it for me.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

611
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:06,864
Are you threatening me?

612
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:08,265
I'm just trying to warn you.

613
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:10,504
Stop trying.

614
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,225
I won't back down.

615
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:14,625
What do you hope to gain?

616
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:17,745
You know full well
that you don't have enough influence.

617
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,944
It's not going to bring about any change.

618
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:23,424
Things might not change today,

619
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:25,424
but they will in the future.

620
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:28,065
Time is on our side.

621
00:51:28,145 --> 00:51:30,545
We have time to win, to fight, to lose.

622
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:33,984
Winning might take time,

623
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,345
but that day will come.

624
00:51:36,904 --> 00:51:38,665
But power is on their side.

625
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:41,225
We have to get that power on our side.

626
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:45,265
The people should have the power,
so that problems can be solved.

627
00:51:46,464 --> 00:51:48,145
Am I supposed to give up

628
00:51:48,225 --> 00:51:50,265
and be a coward like you?

629
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:54,105
Should I give in to power,
abandon my principles,

630
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,904
and behave immorally like you?

631
00:51:56,984 --> 00:51:57,984
I can't do it.

632
00:51:58,065 --> 00:51:59,065
Tarn!

633
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:05,825
You have to back down.

634
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:08,464
Let others do what they want.
It's not our concern.

635
00:52:10,745 --> 00:52:12,384
Not our concern?

636
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,785
I'm not surprised by your indifference.

637
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:22,065
One of your family members died

638
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:24,145
and you kept it quiet to this day.

639
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,504
What are you implying?

640
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,745
Did you think you could keep a lid on it?

641
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:33,065
Don't forget that Mrs. Na is sick.

642
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:37,504
Do you think a sick person
can keep secrets?

643
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:44,745
Two years ago,
I went to visit your nephew Nut.

644
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:48,464
He wasn't home.

645
00:52:49,384 --> 00:52:50,785
We had a long talk.

646
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,745
The words of a mentally ill person

647
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:57,265
are more truthful
than those of a mentally capable one.

648
00:52:58,384 --> 00:52:59,745
Wouldn't you agree?

649
00:53:02,785 --> 00:53:04,424
She's like that

650
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:08,345
because she feels guilty
about her husband dying in her arms

651
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:10,145
and not being able to do anything.

652
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:13,745
You killed your own brother,

653
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:16,825
You caused the woman
you loved to go crazy.

654
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:20,025
But you pretended
it had nothing to do with you.

655
00:53:20,904 --> 00:53:22,065
So it's not surprising

656
00:53:22,705 --> 00:53:25,825
that you said this isn't your concern.

657
00:53:28,025 --> 00:53:30,504
The wife wanted his nephew dead
to get the inheritance.

658
00:53:31,305 --> 00:53:32,585
As for the husband,

659
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:34,145
he wanted to kill his nephew

660
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:37,265
because Tatarn discovered his secret
that he killed his own brother.

661
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:40,345
You might have been able
to stop your nephew,

662
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:43,384
but you can't stop
other people from finding out.

663
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:46,864
And if your nephew recovers

664
00:53:47,464 --> 00:53:48,705
and gets in my way again,

665
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,864
I won't hesitate to get rid of him.

666
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:54,665
If anyone gets in my way,

667
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:57,065
I will get rid of them all.

668
00:53:58,305 --> 00:54:01,384
What you two need to do

669
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,305
is mind your own business

670
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:06,625
and let it all pan out the way I want.

671
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:09,305
That way, your secret…

672
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:11,665
will remain a secret.

673
00:54:49,464 --> 00:54:51,504
You killed your own brother.

674
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,384
You're a murderer.

675
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:57,864
You thought that if Sib weren't around,

676
00:54:59,384 --> 00:55:01,345
you could return to Na, didn't you?

677
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:06,225
I just didn't want him
to hurt her anymore.

678
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:08,745
I wanted her to be happy.

679
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:13,305
You two shared a secret.

680
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:15,345
You must have been delighted

681
00:55:15,424 --> 00:55:17,185
when she went mad.

682
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:25,225
What are you going to do?

683
00:55:26,025 --> 00:55:28,345
Everyone seems to know your secret.

684
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:32,585
Your boss and Tarn. Tofu as well.

685
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:34,665
I think he knows everything.

686
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:42,345
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

687
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:48,305
Are you going to beg him for mercy
as well as Tarn?

688
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:51,944
You can't keep begging
more and more people.

689
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:54,225
What sort of a life would that be?

690
00:56:27,545 --> 00:56:29,305
Kuenchai.

691
00:56:32,545 --> 00:56:35,305
Stop it, Kuenchai.

692
00:56:36,904 --> 00:56:37,984
Kuenchai!

693
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:40,105
Let go, Kuenchai.

694
00:56:41,345 --> 00:56:42,185
Let go.

695
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:44,185
-Mom.
-Let go, Kuenchai.

696
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:45,625
-Kuenchai, Let go.
-Kuenchai!

697
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:46,944
-Stop!
-Kuenchai!

698
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:47,984
Watch out.

699
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:50,504
Mom.

700
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:51,464
Tofu!

701
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:53,625
Help me, Tofu!

702
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:55,185
Tofu!

703
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:57,305
Kuenchai. Kuenchai, stop.

704
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:01,145
Kuenchai, let go. Kuenchai!

705
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:03,504
Kuenchai, let go. Stop.

706
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:04,984
Kuenchai, let go.

707
00:57:05,065 --> 00:57:06,265
Kuenchai, stop.

708
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:07,585
Give it to me.

709
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,585
Kuenchai, let go.

710
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:13,065
Kuenchai.

711
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:30,984
What happened?

712
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,864
I just moved a little.

713
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:35,825
Then Kuenchai bit me.

714
00:57:35,904 --> 00:57:39,024
It hurt just like that day.

715
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,785
What day?

716
00:57:40,864 --> 00:57:43,065
The day Mr. Sib died.

717
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,105
I just remembered.

718
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:48,065
That day, Mrs. Na took me out
of the cabinet.

719
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:50,545
Mr. Sib was gravely ill.

720
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:53,464
She got me in case he felt cold.

721
00:57:56,024 --> 00:57:58,665
Suddenly, Mr. Sib got angry.

722
00:57:58,745 --> 00:58:02,424
He threw me away and trampled on me
as he walked out.

723
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:06,384
A little while after he left,

724
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:09,585
I heard Mr. Sib, Mr. Saen,

725
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:13,185
and Mrs. Na arguing with one another.

726
00:58:13,265 --> 00:58:15,745
Mr. Sib kept coughing.

727
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,585
A short while later,
I heard someone stomping up the stairs.

728
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,065
I thought it was Mr. Sib.

729
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:25,944
But it wasn't him.

730
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:30,384
Thank goodness it was Mr. Saen.

731
00:58:32,105 --> 00:58:35,024
Mr. Saen came up to fetch
some medicine for Mr. Sib.

732
00:58:35,504 --> 00:58:36,745
But there was none left.

733
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:47,424
He filled the bottle with his own pills

734
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:49,504
Mr. Saen was so kind.

735
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,424
My uncle later told me

736
00:58:54,024 --> 00:58:55,625
that Dad took the wrong meds.

737
00:58:56,984 --> 00:58:58,904
I don't know how it could have happened.

738
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:02,585
Dad knew which meds he was allergic to.

739
00:59:03,345 --> 00:59:04,464
Mom also knew.

740
00:59:05,424 --> 00:59:06,585
Even I knew about it

741
00:59:07,185 --> 00:59:08,785
because I used to buy meds for him.

742
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:13,585
So you're saying

743
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,625
Mr. Saen swapped the meds.

744
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:20,625
So Mr. Sib didn't take the pills
by mistake.

745
00:59:22,305 --> 00:59:23,705
He lied.

746
00:59:24,745 --> 00:59:28,625
Mrs. Na knew about his drug allergies.
She wouldn't have bought them.

747
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:33,625
What are you saying, Tofu?
I'm so confused.

748
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:40,225
I'm very sleepy.

749
00:59:41,265 --> 00:59:42,345
Who said that?

750
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:46,984
I know. That's Mr. Backpack.

751
00:59:48,145 --> 00:59:49,225
Mr. Backpack?

752
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,665
Yes.

753
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:54,065
I'm in here.

754
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:19,065
Nut's backpack.

755
01:00:20,305 --> 01:00:23,745
Mrs. Na cleans Mr. Backpack regularly.

756
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:25,745
She keeps him in here.

757
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:28,745
He drifts between sleeping
and being awake just like me.

758
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:34,585
Do you know anything
about Mr. Sib and Mr. Saen?

759
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:38,944
I don't know about Mr. Saen,
but I remember Mr. Sib very clearly.

760
01:00:39,024 --> 01:00:40,904
Nut didn't talk about his dad much.

761
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:43,545
But one day, he went to buy
some meds for his dad.

762
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:44,625
I was with him.

763
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,065
Where are you going?

764
01:00:50,504 --> 01:00:52,024
I'm getting some meds for my dad.

765
01:00:55,305 --> 01:00:57,305
Can I get something for cough and flu?

766
01:00:57,384 --> 01:00:58,984
Any drug allergies?

767
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:01,625
Yes, NSAIDs.

768
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,585
Got it. Please wait a moment.

769
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:07,265
-I'll give you this one.
-Sure.

770
01:01:07,345 --> 01:01:10,345
-And this one is for coughs.
-Okay.

771
01:01:10,424 --> 01:01:12,785
-Has he ever taken these?
-Yes.

772
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:14,424
-That's 80 baht.
-Eighty baht?

773
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,705
-Thank you.
-Here.

774
01:01:19,585 --> 01:01:20,785
-The change.
-Thank you.

775
01:01:22,105 --> 01:01:23,984
That means Tatarn

776
01:01:24,585 --> 01:01:26,424
also knew of Mr. Sib's drug allergies.

777
01:01:26,504 --> 01:01:28,904
There's another character?

778
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:31,705
Is he related to the others?

779
01:01:31,785 --> 01:01:35,345
Of course. Not only did Tarn go
with Nut to the pharmacy,

780
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:38,225
he also came here and spoke with Mrs. Na.

781
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:42,825
Mrs. Na told me about that day.

782
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:44,984
Do you know about it too?

783
01:01:45,065 --> 01:01:46,424
It was a coincidence.

784
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:48,705
Mrs. Na took me out for a wash.

785
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,265
She hadn't put me back in the box.

786
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:54,185
I got to see Tatarn again
after a long time.

787
01:01:56,944 --> 01:01:59,984
I'm thinking of setting up
a photography studio in Chiang Mai.

788
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:01,545
-Really?
-Yes.

789
01:02:02,504 --> 01:02:04,265
They were talking for a while.

790
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,585
Then Mrs. Na excused herself
to take her meds.

791
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:09,384
I forgot that it's time for my meds.

792
01:02:09,864 --> 01:02:11,464
Okay.

793
01:02:27,105 --> 01:02:29,305
Mrs. Na, let me help.

794
01:02:43,705 --> 01:02:44,984
Sib is allergic to these.

795
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:48,145
Sib is allergic to these.
Don't let him take these.

796
01:02:48,785 --> 01:02:50,105
Saen, don't give it to him.

797
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:52,185
-Mrs. Na.
-Don't give it to Sib.

798
01:02:52,265 --> 01:02:53,545
-Mrs. Na.
-Don't do it.

799
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:56,305
-Please calm down.
-Don't.

800
01:02:56,785 --> 01:02:58,024
Don't make him take it.

801
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,305
I wasn't well back then.

802
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,825
But he made me feel better.

803
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,065
Was Tatarn aware that you weren't well?

804
01:03:11,145 --> 01:03:12,065
He was.

805
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:19,745
I didn't sense that he was treating me
like a sick person at all, though.

806
01:03:20,705 --> 01:03:23,345
He didn't find anything strange
about my hallucinations.

807
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:27,024
It made me drop my guard,
and we had a long chat.

808
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,305
What happened next?

809
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:33,545
Then…

810
01:03:39,785 --> 01:03:41,464
Mrs. Na must have stopped

811
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,145
because she realized

812
01:03:44,665 --> 01:03:46,424
that her condition

813
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:50,424
made her reveal a secret to Tatarn.

814
01:03:51,864 --> 01:03:53,944
Tatarn must have wanted to tell Nut.

815
01:03:55,105 --> 01:03:58,265
But it's not an easy topic to bring up.

816
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,265
He must have been afraid

817
01:04:02,424 --> 01:04:04,424
of hurting Nut.

818
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:07,544
Also, they were no longer together.

819
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,345
He knew he had no right to interfere.

820
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:14,065
Tatarn kept that secret to himself

821
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,145
until the day trouble came knocking.

822
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:22,424
If things really played out
the way it seems,

823
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:25,464
how distressing it would be for Nut

824
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:27,625
to find out

825
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:29,585
that the uncle he respects

826
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:31,984
killed his father.

827
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:36,105
His relationship with his dad
might not have been the best,

828
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:42,864
but his dad and his mom raised him.

829
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:47,024
If Nut finds out
that his mom knows everything,

830
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:49,825
what will he think?

831
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:04,745
I bought snacks.

832
01:05:06,864 --> 01:05:08,024
Keep reading.

833
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:17,544
Thank you.

834
01:05:20,065 --> 01:05:21,665
Here's some sago.

835
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:02,544
Just be patient.

836
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:07,705
I believe that Dad
will come to love you like I do.

837
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:11,585
Dad will realize
that I made the right choice.

838
01:07:27,785 --> 01:07:28,984
Have you been awake long?

839
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:35,665
You're awake?

840
01:07:55,265 --> 01:07:56,185
Tofu.

841
01:07:56,665 --> 01:07:58,504
What are you doing?

842
01:08:06,825 --> 01:08:07,904
Tofu.

843
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:10,305
Hey.

844
01:08:10,944 --> 01:08:12,065
Why do you look so pale?

845
01:08:12,984 --> 01:08:13,864
Get up.

846
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:18,305
What's the matter?

847
01:08:20,265 --> 01:08:21,225
Tofu.

848
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:23,065
Watch out.

849
01:08:24,744 --> 01:08:26,384
Tofu, lie down.

850
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:28,865
Tofu.

851
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:32,105
What's wrong?

852
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:33,744
Tofu.

853
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:36,384
Mom!

854
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:38,945
Mom!

855
01:08:39,704 --> 01:08:41,265
Mom, something is wrong with Tofu.

856
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:45,265
What should I do?

857
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:48,345
Should I act as if nothing has happened

858
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,825
and carry on as if everything is normal?

859
01:08:51,744 --> 01:08:53,905
I want this house to be a home.

860
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:57,544
I want Nut and his mom to be happy.

861
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,504
But how will…

862
01:09:04,624 --> 01:09:05,905
Tatarn get justice then?

863
01:09:09,985 --> 01:09:11,704
What's wrong with Tofu?

864
01:09:13,664 --> 01:09:15,584
They said it's stress-induced gastritis.

865
01:09:17,105 --> 01:09:18,584
What is he stressed about?

866
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:27,265
Tofu.

867
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:34,744
How are you feeling?

868
01:09:35,624 --> 01:09:36,865
Do you still feel nauseous?

869
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:38,825
Not anymore.

870
01:09:41,185 --> 01:09:44,145
I'm sorry for making you worry.

871
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:49,265
How is Mr. Anik doing?

872
01:09:50,744 --> 01:09:51,825
Dad woke up.

873
01:09:52,624 --> 01:09:55,744
His condition is stable.

874
01:09:58,265 --> 01:10:00,465
Can you take me to visit him, Nut?

875
01:10:01,145 --> 01:10:03,744
He helped me
when I got lost in Chiang Mai.

876
01:10:04,385 --> 01:10:07,425
Leave Tofu with me.
I've already visited Mr. Anik earlier.

877
01:10:07,505 --> 01:10:09,025
I've also visited Tarn.

878
01:10:10,025 --> 01:10:12,065
How is he doing, by the way?

879
01:10:12,624 --> 01:10:14,465
I think he's improving,

880
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:17,025
but he's still unconscious.

881
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:19,664
Speaking of which, two days ago,

882
01:10:19,744 --> 01:10:21,945
before he had the surgery
to remove the pus,

883
01:10:22,025 --> 01:10:24,704
he seemed to have improved
all of a sudden.

884
01:10:25,664 --> 01:10:27,265
But the nurse said

885
01:10:27,825 --> 01:10:29,664
that was normal

886
01:10:30,265 --> 01:10:32,025
and he was still unconscious.

887
01:10:33,585 --> 01:10:37,905
I remember his condition
improving like this once before.

888
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:42,385
It's the time I went to visit Tarn
in Chiang Mai with Tofu.

889
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:48,265
I really hope he recovers quickly
and he wakes up soon.

890
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:51,425
I'll be back in a bit.

891
01:10:51,905 --> 01:10:53,865
Call me if you need anything.

892
01:10:55,145 --> 01:10:58,145
Leave him with me. Don't worry.

893
01:10:59,985 --> 01:11:00,825
Let's go, Mom.

894
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:04,105
Take care of him.

895
01:11:04,185 --> 01:11:05,145
I will.

896
01:11:21,585 --> 01:11:23,664
Do you want some, Tofu? I'll get you some.

897
01:11:27,545 --> 01:11:28,744
No, thank you.

898
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:39,025
Hello, Uncle Juea.

899
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:40,865
Prib,

900
01:11:41,345 --> 01:11:44,145
where's the movie contract?

901
01:11:44,704 --> 01:11:47,425
The document is in my car.

902
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:49,945
Can you check if I've signed it?

903
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:51,945
They need it soon.

904
01:11:52,624 --> 01:11:54,825
Okay, I'll check it for you.

905
01:11:55,664 --> 01:11:57,545
Okay. Got it.

906
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:35,865
What should I do?

907
01:13:37,025 --> 01:13:38,784
As long as I'm alive,

908
01:13:40,025 --> 01:13:42,025
Tatarn will never wake up.

909
01:14:11,784 --> 01:14:15,265
You made the right decision
bringing Tatarn here for treatment.

910
01:14:15,345 --> 01:14:17,185
He should wake up soon.

911
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:20,385
Hi, Nut.

912
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:24,225
Saen is walking me back.

913
01:14:25,225 --> 01:14:27,664
Tofu hurt himself again.

914
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:28,824
He cut his hand.

915
01:14:29,305 --> 01:14:30,505
Is it serious?

916
01:14:31,145 --> 01:14:33,744
No. He's more interested in food.

917
01:14:33,824 --> 01:14:35,145
He asked me to buy something.

918
01:14:35,945 --> 01:14:36,905
That boy.

919
01:14:37,505 --> 01:14:38,664
That's good to hear.

920
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:44,905
Please apologize to Tofu for me.
I can't visit him today.

921
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,744
It's okay.

922
01:14:46,824 --> 01:14:49,985
Do you want to visit Tatarn?

923
01:14:51,985 --> 01:14:55,624
Maybe next time. I don't want
to leave Tofu alone for long.

924
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:02,265
Goodbye for now.

925
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:03,664
Thank you, Saen.

926
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:25,065
What is it, Tofu?

927
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:28,824
Is it a good idea to lie to Nut?

928
01:15:29,305 --> 01:15:31,865
Or you're a habitual liar anyway?

929
01:15:33,265 --> 01:15:35,784
You helped me lie to Nut about my amnesia.

930
01:15:36,784 --> 01:15:38,185
Wasn't I right?

931
01:15:38,945 --> 01:15:41,265
You claimed that you and Tatarn
knew each other

932
01:15:41,744 --> 01:15:44,945
and you went to Chiang Mai
because you began to remember.

933
01:15:45,025 --> 01:15:46,784
You clearly used to live in the area.

934
01:15:48,145 --> 01:15:51,105
But you hung around Na's house
until they let you stay.

935
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:53,784
What does that mean?

936
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:56,065
What is it that you want?

937
01:15:56,545 --> 01:15:58,664
If I were to tell you

938
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:02,065
that I was at Tatarn's house that day

939
01:16:03,585 --> 01:16:05,824
and I know about your argument,

940
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:09,145
about him knowing

941
01:16:10,225 --> 01:16:12,425
that you killed Mr. Sibmeun,

942
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:16,465
what would you think I wanted?

943
01:16:20,305 --> 01:16:22,945
So are you saying
that you went to Na's house

944
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:25,664
and got close to Nut

945
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,505
in order to investigate what happened?

946
01:16:30,744 --> 01:16:33,704
What an ingenious and roundabout method.

947
01:16:36,385 --> 01:16:38,425
I didn't have much choice.

948
01:16:39,704 --> 01:16:41,824
But you still have a choice.

949
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:45,905
You can choose to seek justice for Tatarn.

950
01:16:48,624 --> 01:16:50,664
You want me to turn myself in.

951
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:56,185
Tatarn didn't do anything wrong.

952
01:16:57,025 --> 01:16:59,025
This shouldn't have happened to him.

953
01:17:00,265 --> 01:17:02,505
I want you to do the right thing.

954
01:17:05,065 --> 01:17:07,865
I know that it's not easy.

955
01:17:09,065 --> 01:17:11,345
But you need to put everything right.

956
01:17:13,065 --> 01:17:14,744
I'm not just talking about you.

957
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:19,105
The real culprit, TRD,
also has to be made accountable.

958
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:26,225
If you're certain
that either I or TRD did it,

959
01:17:27,905 --> 01:17:29,225
you should go to the police.

960
01:17:32,824 --> 01:17:36,265
Unless you have no evidence.

961
01:17:39,945 --> 01:17:41,664
You should think carefully.

962
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:46,025
Digging up the past

963
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:50,704
will not only cause Na to suffer,

964
01:17:52,545 --> 01:17:55,664
but it will also hurt Nut.

965
01:18:16,465 --> 01:18:18,225
If one day

966
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,945
I am no longer by your side,

967
01:18:24,385 --> 01:18:26,425
will you be okay on your own, Nut?

968
01:18:33,265 --> 01:18:34,865
Let's go home, Tofu.

969
01:18:59,465 --> 01:19:01,624
Perhaps death

970
01:19:02,744 --> 01:19:05,985
is not as scary as saying goodbye.

971
01:19:40,704 --> 01:19:44,385
Kuenchai, what are you doing there?

972
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:56,865
What do you want to talk to me about, Jan?

973
01:19:58,704 --> 01:20:01,664
I've always known
that Saen was in love with you.

974
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:06,945
But I never thought that he would kill
his own brother for your sake.

975
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:10,945
Maybe it's because I'm jealous
that I'm saying this now,

976
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:14,624
but you should know that your condition

977
01:20:14,704 --> 01:20:16,425
has caused a lot of problems.

978
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,865
That secret should have stayed
between the two of you,

979
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:22,185
but now it has spread.

980
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:25,265
Do you mean Tatarn?

981
01:20:26,065 --> 01:20:28,225
Yes, him.

982
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:32,025
Because of him,
Kaew-ching-duang found out.

983
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:37,824
If you do up the first button wrong,
the rest would get done up wrong.

984
01:20:38,385 --> 01:20:40,545
He chose to help you that day,

985
01:20:40,624 --> 01:20:43,784
and that led to the position he's in now.

986
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:47,824
He spends his whole life looking
over his shoulder. It's suffocating him.

987
01:20:48,505 --> 01:20:50,784
Whichever way he turns is a dead end.

988
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:57,425
I'm sorry.

989
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:04,824
Honestly though,
I know it's not your fault.

990
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:07,985
But I still hate you.

991
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:12,824
I also hate him for helping you
without a care for his own well-being,

992
01:21:14,425 --> 01:21:16,704
while you never did anything yourself.

993
01:21:18,265 --> 01:21:21,905
You never thought
of standing up for yourself.

994
01:21:21,985 --> 01:21:26,145
It compelled him to commit murder.

995
01:21:26,985 --> 01:21:30,105
As for you, you were so immersed
in your grief and guilt

996
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:31,824
that you became mentally ill.

997
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:36,185
I used to think

998
01:21:37,465 --> 01:21:39,585
that your life was pitiful.

999
01:21:40,065 --> 01:21:44,345
But everything that happened
is your own fault.

1000
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:50,784
Well…

1001
01:21:51,664 --> 01:21:54,105
Taking it out on you
won't change anything.

1002
01:21:55,865 --> 01:21:57,905
I just wanted to tell you

1003
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:01,225
that I won't remain passive like you.

1004
01:22:03,865 --> 01:22:05,704
If what he did

1005
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:09,744
was to relieve you from your suffering,

1006
01:22:10,945 --> 01:22:14,345
I could do the same.

1007
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:28,105
What did you just say?

1008
01:22:29,305 --> 01:22:31,624
You're making a mess.

1009
01:22:36,345 --> 01:22:38,145
I said let's take a trip.

1010
01:22:39,824 --> 01:22:41,025
Just the two of us?

1011
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:43,105
Yes.

1012
01:22:43,744 --> 01:22:45,505
Mom is going away with her friend,

1013
01:22:45,985 --> 01:22:47,664
Mrs. Pritr.

1014
01:22:48,624 --> 01:22:50,704
She has called to ask Mom multiple times.

1015
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:53,824
At first, Mom thought
she would be a burden.

1016
01:22:54,585 --> 01:22:57,784
I noticed she was down,
so I told her to go.

1017
01:22:58,624 --> 01:23:02,305
So I was thinking we could go away.

1018
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:05,784
I made you a promise.

1019
01:23:09,624 --> 01:23:11,105
Aren't you happy?

1020
01:23:12,704 --> 01:23:14,905
Don't you want to go?

1021
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:18,945
Of course, I'm happy.
I'm dying to go on a trip with you.

1022
01:23:32,385 --> 01:23:34,145
Why did you choose to come here?

1023
01:23:36,505 --> 01:23:38,265
Actually, any place was fine.

1024
01:23:39,505 --> 01:23:40,624
For this trip,

1025
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:43,784
the company is more important.

1026
01:23:47,585 --> 01:23:50,784
I chose Sichang Island
because it was close.

1027
01:23:52,985 --> 01:23:54,865
What should we do?

1028
01:23:55,345 --> 01:23:56,865
Go swimming?

1029
01:23:57,624 --> 01:23:58,945
No.

1030
01:23:59,905 --> 01:24:01,545
I want to be with you

1031
01:24:02,385 --> 01:24:04,505
and celebrate finishing the project.

1032
01:24:04,585 --> 01:24:07,585
I brought you a gift.

1033
01:24:08,985 --> 01:24:10,065
It's for me?

1034
01:24:11,065 --> 01:24:14,145
In the past, I haven't done much for you.

1035
01:24:14,905 --> 01:24:16,585
It's always you who do things for me.

1036
01:24:17,704 --> 01:24:19,065
I wanted to thank you.

1037
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:22,065
This might be a little strange

1038
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:25,225
because I didn't know what to give you.

1039
01:24:25,824 --> 01:24:27,345
I asked Gen for advice.

1040
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,065
Here you go.

1041
01:24:36,145 --> 01:24:37,465
Ice cream?

1042
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:40,945
I was considering buying
an ice cream factory for you,

1043
01:24:41,025 --> 01:24:44,784
but you'll have to wait until I get paid
like a Korean scriptwriter.

1044
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:47,824
Make do with this ice cream cake for now.

1045
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:52,985
I didn't know what flavor you liked,

1046
01:24:53,664 --> 01:24:55,784
so I picked the flavor I like.

1047
01:24:56,945 --> 01:24:58,265
What flavor do you like?

1048
01:24:59,945 --> 01:25:02,345
I like tofu flavor.

1049
01:25:10,025 --> 01:25:12,305
I would like to say I did it myself,

1050
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:15,265
but I actually had lots of help.

1051
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:32,425
Not just them, though.

1052
01:25:32,505 --> 01:25:35,145
Chu and Nhong helped me as well.

1053
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:36,905
They were my brave tasters

1054
01:25:38,145 --> 01:25:41,025
and they shared some ideas
about toppings and decoration.

1055
01:25:42,465 --> 01:25:45,265
When I told people
that I wanted to make you a gift,

1056
01:25:45,784 --> 01:25:47,025
everyone was happy to help.

1057
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:50,945
You really are loved by everyone.

1058
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:55,025
I have to say that this gift

1059
01:25:55,545 --> 01:25:57,784
is not only from me,

1060
01:25:58,345 --> 01:26:00,225
but from everyone.

1061
01:26:01,385 --> 01:26:03,145
Everyone wants you to be happy.

1062
01:26:05,225 --> 01:26:07,025
I'm the happiest person in the world.

1063
01:26:10,824 --> 01:26:13,985
Before I dig in,
can I have a photo with it?

1064
01:26:14,065 --> 01:26:15,065
No problem.

1065
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:18,185
-I'll take the photos for you.
-Thanks.

1066
01:26:21,105 --> 01:26:22,225
One, two, three.

1067
01:26:23,185 --> 01:26:25,105
One, two, three.

1068
01:26:33,784 --> 01:26:36,305
I have something else for you.

1069
01:26:37,505 --> 01:26:39,704
It's from me alone.

1070
01:26:50,225 --> 01:26:51,784
A chain bracelet with a lock?

1071
01:26:52,305 --> 01:26:53,905
Are you going to chain us together?

1072
01:26:54,945 --> 01:26:58,784
Yes. I'm binding you to me forever.

1073
01:26:59,345 --> 01:27:00,345
You can't go anywhere.

1074
01:27:15,305 --> 01:27:16,945
I'll stay with you, Nut.

1075
01:27:17,545 --> 01:27:18,784
I'll never leave.

1076
01:27:43,864 --> 01:27:46,585
Do I deserve to be happy?

1077
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:50,025
I took Tatarn's place.

1078
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:53,905
I get to be with Nut

1079
01:27:56,345 --> 01:27:58,985
and do the things he can't.

1080
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:03,185
I know that my time is coming to an end.

1081
01:28:04,185 --> 01:28:05,945
What will happen to me?

1082
01:28:06,664 --> 01:28:09,345
Will I transform back
into Nut's teddy bear?

1083
01:28:10,105 --> 01:28:11,905
Will I ever wake up again?

1084
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,784
Will I be able to speak?

1085
01:28:15,985 --> 01:28:17,864
Will I be left with nothing

1086
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,545
and be erased from everyone's memory?

1087
01:28:25,145 --> 01:28:28,225
When we get back,
what story do you plan to write?

1088
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:31,824
Juea and I haven't decided yet.

1089
01:28:32,704 --> 01:28:34,985
He wants something new from me.

1090
01:28:36,225 --> 01:28:38,105
Why don't you write my story?

1091
01:28:38,664 --> 01:28:40,585
If he wants something new,

1092
01:28:40,664 --> 01:28:42,864
I am your new boyfriend.

1093
01:28:43,345 --> 01:28:45,465
I'm newer than Tatarn.

1094
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:48,065
You're such a jealous boy.

1095
01:28:49,505 --> 01:28:51,505
I really am jealous.

1096
01:28:51,585 --> 01:28:53,664
I want to be present in your work too.

1097
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,385
What would people think?

1098
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:58,905
I've just written about my ex,

1099
01:28:58,985 --> 01:29:00,945
and then I'm writing
about my new boyfriend.

1100
01:29:01,025 --> 01:29:03,345
They'll tear me apart online.

1101
01:29:04,945 --> 01:29:06,744
Aren't you going to write about me?

1102
01:29:08,025 --> 01:29:09,824
I'll think about

1103
01:29:09,905 --> 01:29:11,385
what I could write.

1104
01:29:12,945 --> 01:29:13,945
Promise?

1105
01:29:14,025 --> 01:29:16,225
I promise.

1106
01:29:16,704 --> 01:29:18,305
Let's stop talking about work.

1107
01:29:18,385 --> 01:29:19,465
Let's take some photos.

1108
01:29:25,345 --> 01:29:27,185
One, two, three.

1109
01:29:28,465 --> 01:29:29,664
One, two, three.

1110
01:29:31,105 --> 01:29:32,265
Nice.

1111
01:29:39,585 --> 01:29:42,105
It's a shame that Mom
has a doctor's appointment

1112
01:29:43,185 --> 01:29:44,905
or we could spend more time here.

1113
01:29:47,225 --> 01:29:49,465
I'm already very happy.

1114
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:53,905
This memory is something
I'll never forget.

1115
01:29:57,105 --> 01:30:00,624
Thank you for doing so much for me, Nut.

1116
01:30:11,465 --> 01:30:14,784
Seeing you happy makes me happy.

1117
01:30:17,985 --> 01:30:22,145
I hope this happiness stays with us
for a long time.

1118
01:30:25,985 --> 01:30:27,945
You should understand

1119
01:30:28,025 --> 01:30:30,784
that it hurts even more

1120
01:30:30,864 --> 01:30:32,784
to see your loved ones in pain.

1121
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:38,265
Tofu!

1122
01:30:38,824 --> 01:30:40,145
Tofu, what happened?

1123
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,824
I can see you're happy
that you found each other.

1124
01:30:44,585 --> 01:30:47,025
I can tell that you two
can take care of each other.

1125
01:30:48,465 --> 01:30:50,744
If it makes you happy, then be together.

1126
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:54,784
Didn't I tell you?

1127
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:57,465
I'm happy

1128
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:00,385
to see you happy.

1129
01:31:01,145 --> 01:31:02,585
I'm happy

1130
01:31:03,225 --> 01:31:04,985
to see you smile.

1131
01:31:06,905 --> 01:31:08,905
Please be very happy.

1132
01:32:14,704 --> 01:32:19,704
