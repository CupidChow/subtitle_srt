1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,144
Ask your mom

2
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,705
why your dad used to call you

3
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,945
a bastard.

4
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,025
Do you and Uncle Saen
still love each other?

5
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:17,105
Am I really a bastard like Dad said?

6
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,665
Don't say that.

7
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:21,624
Is anyone inside the house?
Come out this instant.

8
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,825
Did you see the way
they were looking at us?

9
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:28,385
Do you really think
they came here to get Tofu's memory back?

10
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:31,985
You should live in the present.

11
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,464
You should use the time to worry
about your loved ones' feelings.

12
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:37,665
You are confusing Tofu

13
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,505
by expressing countless concerns
toward your ex-boyfriend.

14
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:44,145
She said…

15
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:47,344
I'm showing symptoms of Alzheimer's.

16
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,385
Since your mom is already sick,

17
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:55,105
why don't we find a way to help her?

18
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:04,265
I suspect there is still some evidence
remaining in the house.

19
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,425
Our forensics team even found the blood

20
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,105
that was wiped clean.

21
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,904
Do you think
they could've missed something?

22
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:34,985
A bit of broken tile.

23
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,425
How did it get there?

24
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:39,145
And how did you know?

25
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:44,985
I found a bit of broken tile
in a cactus at Tatarn's house.

26
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:48,344
Could it be related to the case?

27
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,425
Do you mind checking it for me?

28
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,185
Lieutenant Kong.

29
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,785
Can you find an old picture of the house,
so we can compare?

30
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:03,425
Yes, sir.

31
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,225
Hey.

32
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:24,985
Why did you come here?

33
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,704
I told you not to come here.

34
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,464
My employee said
the police went to Tatarn's house.

35
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,665
See? Those kids
are really causing us trouble.

36
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,225
You should've discussed with me
before letting them in.

37
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,385
You're too careless.

38
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:43,905
You're the careless one.

39
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,905
If you hadn't stepped in,
it would've been much easier.

40
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,185
I stepped in
because I was worried about you.

41
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:54,345
If you hadn't attacked him,
I wouldn't have to put myself in danger.

42
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,665
Are you threatening me?

43
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,024
I'm just trying to warn you.

44
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,985
Stop trying.

45
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:02,625
I won't back down.

46
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:05,505
What do you hope to gain?

47
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:08,185
You know full well
that you don't have enough influence.

48
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,545
It's not going to bring about any change.

49
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,545
Things might not change today,

50
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,345
but they will in the future.

51
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,665
Time is on our side.

52
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,345
We have time to win, to fight, to lose.

53
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:22,824
Winning might take time,

54
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,545
but that day will come.

55
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,345
But power is on their side.

56
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,985
We have to get that power on our side.

57
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:33,144
The people should have the power,
so that problems can be solved.

58
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:37,745
Am I supposed to give up
and be a coward like you?

59
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:40,945
Should I give in to power,
abandon my principles,

60
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:43,185
and behave immorally like you?

61
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:45,024
I can't do it.

62
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:59,425
Mr. Saen…

63
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,665
hit your nephew's head.

64
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,665
Secretly keep an eye on him

65
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:04,904
and keep me posted.

66
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,305
I'm heading there now.

67
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:29,185
I stayed put like you told me to,

68
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,985
but trouble still found us.

69
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,865
Are you sure

70
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:36,305
that nobody was in the house
other than you and your men?

71
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,144
Why? Who do you suspect?

72
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,785
Tofu.

73
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,545
He might actually know Tarn.

74
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:47,545
He could have been in the house that day
and has seen the whole thing.

75
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:50,264
That's why he moved
to the house next door,

76
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,704
and lied about his amnesia
in order to keep an eye on us.

77
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,144
Did you see the way he looked at us?

78
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:58,704
It's as if he knows something.

79
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:01,584
Think about it.
He went to the house yesterday.

80
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,704
Today, the police went
there for something.

81
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:12,625
How did this happen?

82
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:17,305
We don't know for sure what the cause is.

83
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:19,185
According to studies,

84
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:23,425
there are multiple factors that can be
the cause of Alzheimer's disease.

85
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,904
It may be due to age,

86
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,584
genetics,

87
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:29,704
brain trauma,

88
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:32,385
or brain infections.

89
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,424
These can cause changes in brain cells.

90
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:40,264
As brain cells deteriorate,

91
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,585
the patients start losing memories.

92
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:47,945
This affects thinking

93
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,225
and decision-making.

94
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:51,945
They will be forgetful,

95
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,145
and won't be able to learn new things.

96
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,544
To be honest,

97
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,825
the chance of Alzheimer's disease

98
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,945
for someone
in their fifties like you is slim.

99
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,985
Especially for someone
who has had a mental illness,

100
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:11,945
the chance is incredibly slim.

101
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:18,304
But looking at your symptoms,

102
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:21,064
it's most likely

103
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:23,745
that it is Alzheimer's disease.

104
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:27,865
But we should still monitor the symptoms.

105
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,625
Why didn't you tell me about it last time?

106
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,145
I was afraid you would worry.

107
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,825
I thought I would tell you about it
after your trip.

108
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,304
I didn't expect that incident
in Chiang Mai.

109
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:56,585
It doesn't matter.

110
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,345
Now that we know about it,

111
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:03,424
let's do our best
to look after her from now on.

112
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:05,345
Exactly.

113
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,105
We can't cure Alzheimer's disease,

114
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:13,304
but if we find out and treat it early,
and take good care of ourselves,

115
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:16,385
it will slow down the disease progression.

116
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:20,745
We can also prevent the danger
of other complications.

117
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,944
To treat Alzheimer's disease,

118
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,505
you can use drugs and other methods.

119
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:30,585
These are the drugs I'm prescribing.

120
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:35,225
One is for temporarily reducing symptoms,

121
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:41,985
and the other is for suppressing
brain deteriorating chemicals.

122
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:47,225
The patient can lead
a relatively normal life.

123
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,064
You will feel bright,

124
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:54,865
which will be easier on the caretaker.

125
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:56,905
Where's Tofu?

126
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:01,064
Let's go, Mrs. Na.

127
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,505
Shoot.

128
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:11,585
But what's more important than drugs

129
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:14,265
is taking care of the brain,

130
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,745
along with caring
for your physical and mental health.

131
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:22,064
Research has found

132
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:24,905
that regular exercise

133
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,985
freshens up the brain

134
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:31,465
and extends the disease progression.

135
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:42,304
It is also important

136
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:46,745
for the patient to socialize
and meet up with people

137
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:48,944
apart from household members.

138
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,304
I noticed that your lights were still on.

139
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,705
I realized I hadn't unpacked.

140
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,304
Do you need a hand?

141
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:25,385
I can put the suitcase away
for you tomorrow.

142
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,585
Thanks.

143
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,105
Is Nut asleep?

144
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,785
Not yet.

145
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,544
He's rather enthusiastic.

146
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,665
He's reading Gen's book.

147
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:40,785
I have to thank you for taking care of us.

148
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,585
You don't have to thank me.

149
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:46,145
Both of you take good care of me too.

150
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:48,985
It's not the same.

151
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:54,225
I may be…

152
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:56,304
a little forgetful,

153
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:59,985
but… I know my son well.

154
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:04,025
Nut is a handful,

155
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:05,985
especially when he's upset.

156
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,184
I'm really thankful to you

157
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:15,424
for accepting who he is and not giving up.

158
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,865
From now on, my condition…

159
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:22,824
will keep getting worse.

160
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,865
I won't be the same and…

161
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,585
I'll cause a lot more problems for him.

162
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,944
I would like to ask you

163
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,665
to stay calm

164
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,625
and…

165
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:44,225
forever remain so nice to our family.

166
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,225
Don't leave Nut.

167
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:54,465
I don't want him to lose another person
who he loves and loves him back.

168
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,385
I promise.

169
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,704
I'll stay and take care of you

170
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:05,704
and take care of Nut.

171
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,585
I'll never leave.

172
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:11,345
I'll take care of Nut forever.

173
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,665
It's not just my job,

174
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,345
but it's my life's vocation.

175
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,424
Thank you.

176
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:23,184
You're as focused
as when you were studying for exams.

177
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,944
Have you seen me studying for exams?

178
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:29,865
Who knows?

179
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,505
I might have seen you.

180
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:33,785
You just didn't care about me.

181
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,145
Come here, then.

182
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:39,905
So…

183
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,544
Read it to me.

184
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,265
Your voice might make me less sad.

185
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:52,145
"Your mother behaves
and speaks differently.

186
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:54,184
After a checkup,

187
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:56,865
Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed.

188
00:15:57,944 --> 00:15:59,905
The patient can still speak normally.

189
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,865
Her memories remain.

190
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:07,064
This means
she's still in the early stages."

191
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:10,824
It says that…

192
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:13,025
Mom will keep losing her memory

193
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:15,944
and her ability to help herself.

194
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,145
She'll forget how to chew.

195
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:23,865
She'll even forget how to breathe.

196
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:27,865
Don't be afraid.

197
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,905
No matter what happens,

198
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:32,704
we'll keep fighting.

199
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:37,824
Let's make the rest of your mom's memories

200
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,665
good memories.

201
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:45,944
Thank you.

202
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,024
UNCLE SAEN

203
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:25,504
-Yes, Uncle Saen.
-Where are you?

204
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:29,625
I just got off work.
We barely talked yesterday.

205
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:31,225
I'll swing by to see you.

206
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:33,385
I'm already home.

207
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,264
Why so fast?

208
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,625
My mom is sick.

209
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,305
I took her to the hospital.

210
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:41,785
What happened?

211
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,345
She has Alzheimer's.

212
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,305
You don't have to worry.

213
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:52,744
I'll take care of her.

214
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:20,984
Be careful.

215
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:26,945
Kuenchai.

216
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:30,105
Gosh.

217
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:32,225
So noisy.

218
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,545
Who's that?

219
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,705
It's me.

220
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:44,984
It feels so nice to have a wash.

221
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:48,865
It was so stuffy in there.

222
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:52,625
Was it your voice I heard the other day?

223
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:57,865
I was the only one
who would wake up in that room.

224
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:00,065
Wait a minute.

225
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:01,984
Actually…

226
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:03,504
Does this mean

227
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,585
you've woken up before?

228
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:06,705
When was that?

229
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:09,065
I'm not sure.

230
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,665
I remember that there were

231
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,825
Mr. Sibmeun and Mrs. Na in the house.

232
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:16,264
Mrs. Na was still pregnant with Nut.

233
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:21,024
One day, they brought baby Nut home.

234
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:23,345
He kept crying

235
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,945
that Mr. Sibmeun and Mrs. Na
had to cradle him all night long.

236
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:31,585
What's next?

237
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,744
This house was filled
with happiness back then.

238
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,504
Both of them loved Nut so much.

239
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:41,744
Mrs. Na would tell him stories

240
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:44,225
even when he was so young.

241
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,905
Mr. Sib would buy him toys.

242
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:49,945
But as Nut grew up,

243
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:52,145
the two of them started to fight.

244
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:56,105
Nut is a normal boy like anyone else.

245
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,625
Can't you see how girly he is?

246
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:05,225
After that, they didn't use me as much.

247
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,465
It's probably because…

248
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:12,744
you're a keepsake from Mr. Saen,

249
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,545
so Mr. Sibmeun didn't want to see you.

250
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,825
Mrs. Na put me in the closet.

251
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:22,945
I would fall asleep from time to time.

252
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:27,145
I remember a time
when I woke up because it was so hot.

253
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:31,545
Do you love him?

254
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:38,545
I almost died because of Mr. Sib.

255
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,705
Thank goodness Mrs. Na saved me.

256
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:47,225
After that day,
I was moved to the storage room,

257
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,425
and I've been sleeping since.

258
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:12,305
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:14,264
I saw it in the storage room,

260
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:16,625
so I washed it for you.

261
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:19,065
I'll put it back

262
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,705
once it's dry.

263
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:24,825
That's okay.

264
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,585
I don't use it anymore.

265
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:38,945
I'll take a look.

266
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:09,625
Hello, Uncle Saen.

267
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:12,665
Go ahead. Mom is inside.

268
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:22,145
Come here, Kuenchai.

269
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:51,625
What do you think Mr. Saen is like
when he's angry?

270
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,865
Why are you asking that?

271
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,705
I'm just wondering.

272
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:04,305
From what I know about him,

273
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:06,825
he always seems kind and considerate.

274
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,305
I can't imagine what it's like

275
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:15,145
when someone like him gets mad.

276
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,905
I don't see him that often,

277
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:24,105
but he usually takes care of Mom and me.

278
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:27,744
He really loves his family.

279
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:30,504
He even stepped back for Dad

280
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,465
when they fought over Mom.

281
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:36,105
He didn't get mad when Dad made trouble.

282
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:38,544
He's very calm.

283
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,905
I've never seen him mad
except when it comes to Jan.

284
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,185
I assume family members…

285
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:50,625
wouldn't hurt each other.

286
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,465
Are you worried about Jan?

287
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:59,504
I don't know about his family,

288
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:02,984
but I believe that…

289
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:06,544
he's not the same as my dad.

290
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:14,825
You seem livelier than I expected.

291
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:19,145
I have no reason to be sad.

292
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:21,865
Nut gets worried when I'm sad.

293
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,465
This disease has made me realize

294
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,385
that I don't have much time left
to live a life with memories.

295
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:32,784
So I would rather use
the rest of my memories

296
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:35,065
for good things

297
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,425
and happy things.

298
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:47,905
I'm sorry

299
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,705
for being one of the reasons
that you ended up this way.

300
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,225
Don't be.

301
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,504
I know you've done a lot of things for me

302
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,305
and helped relieve my sadness.

303
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:15,385
I'm sick from my own doings.

304
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:21,145
I blamed myself that my family suffered
because I chose the wrong husband.

305
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,665
I felt sorry for myself,

306
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,504
for Sibmeun,

307
00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:30,825
for Nut,

308
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,185
and for you.

309
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,504
Those feelings didn't just…

310
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,024
weaken my heart,

311
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:46,065
they destroyed my body.

312
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:48,865
It's a shame

313
00:25:50,744 --> 00:25:52,345
that I realized this too late.

314
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:56,345
Had I fixed it earlier,

315
00:25:58,385 --> 00:25:59,984
I wouldn't have suffered

316
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:03,825
and I wouldn't have been sick
all this time.

317
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:23,625
I'll forget it soon enough.

318
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:28,425
You'll probably suffer more

319
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:30,345
since you remember all of it.

320
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:38,825
If you don't want
a twisted, tormented life like mine,

321
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,304
you'll have to live mindfully.

322
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:46,425
Correct your mistakes while you still can.

323
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,665
Don't neglect them
and drown in regret like I did.

324
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,744
I don't want you to end up like me.

325
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:20,744
Thank you for visiting Mom.

326
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:24,865
I don't know if I can come again.

327
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:29,264
It will be even harder on you from now on,

328
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:31,304
having to take care of two sick people.

329
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:35,065
You can call me whenever you need to.

330
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,145
One person lost his memory.

331
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:41,825
Another person is losing hers.

332
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,065
Who knows?

333
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,705
I might remember something soon.

334
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:56,705
Actually,

335
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,504
I'm starting to see more things.

336
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:02,145
I can't piece them together just yet,

337
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:05,225
but I think

338
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:07,825
I might remember everything soon.

339
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:10,665
When that time comes,

340
00:28:11,744 --> 00:28:13,105
I might find out

341
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,665
what happened to Tatarn.

342
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,345
That would be great.

343
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:25,865
Tarn's case will finally progress.

344
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,865
I don't know

345
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,825
why Tatarn was attacked,

346
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,544
but nobody

347
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:37,744
should be harmed, should they?

348
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,064
Not everyone

349
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:45,984
is blessed with humanity.

350
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,465
People can hurt each other

351
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:50,225
over simple disagreements.

352
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:52,905
Conflicts of interest

353
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:54,504
can lead to murder.

354
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:59,185
When we disagree,

355
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,225
shouldn't we talk about it reasonably?

356
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:04,264
Shouldn't we try to understand

357
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:07,225
rather than fight?

358
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,145
-A fractured skull and a hemorrhage?
-Excuse me, sir.

359
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:29,784
We found no fingerprints
on the vase or the broken pieces.

360
00:29:30,264 --> 00:29:31,865
Here's the report.

361
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:38,064
They probably thought
that it was well planned.

362
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:42,145
They must have thought
that they destroyed all the evidence.

363
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:43,625
Unfortunately,

364
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:46,865
they dropped some evidence
in the cactus pot.

365
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,304
It doesn't weigh much.

366
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,504
Why was his injury so severe?

367
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:03,465
Or, is the weapon not the vase?

368
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:10,145
According to the report,

369
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:14,024
if the weapon is really
a blunt, hard object like you said,

370
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:17,145
and if it's the vase in this photo,

371
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:21,825
could it really cause
a fractured skull and a hemorrhage?

372
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:23,825
That's right.

373
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:26,385
The vase would break after one hit.

374
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:28,544
The injuries suggest multiple hits.

375
00:30:30,465 --> 00:30:33,264
I confirm that I diagnosed
according to his symptoms.

376
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,264
A combination of things
could have caused the injuries,

377
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:38,945
not just the weapon's weight or shape,

378
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,064
It also depends on force

379
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:42,024
and other factors.

380
00:30:42,665 --> 00:30:43,784
Unless

381
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:46,105
the weapon is not just this vase,

382
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,264
but another as well.

383
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:56,665
You'll have to live mindfully.

384
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,825
Correct your mistakes while you still can.

385
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:04,585
Don't neglect them
and drown in regret like I did.

386
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,064
Not everyone

387
00:31:06,585 --> 00:31:08,145
is blessed with humanity.

388
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:10,625
People can hurt each other

389
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,185
over simple disagreements.

390
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:13,425
Conflicts of interest

391
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:15,585
can lead to murder.

392
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,744
Shouldn't we try to understand

393
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,705
rather than fight?

394
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:27,225
Yes.

395
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:30,784
I just got back. I'm at the parking lot.

396
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:34,544
I just found out

397
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,945
that you let people into that house.

398
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:41,504
The police called. I couldn't refuse.

399
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,024
The issue was dying down.

400
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:47,345
People were forgetting about it,
but you dug it back up.

401
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:51,145
You can't blame it all on me.

402
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,905
This whole thing happened
all because of you.

403
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:57,064
Get out! No more deforestation.

404
00:31:57,145 --> 00:32:00,145
Get out! No more deforestation.

405
00:32:00,225 --> 00:32:03,824
Get out! We don't want it. Is that right?

406
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:05,264
We don't want it. Get out!

407
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,185
Yes, Dad.

408
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:25,185
Don't worry.

409
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:27,064
I'll handle it as soon as possible.

410
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,345
Is the leader your wife's nephew?

411
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,744
-Yes. I warned him--
-Tell him to stop.

412
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:44,024
The board is getting upset.

413
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:48,585
You know how much we paid him
to settle this deal.

414
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,824
It cannot fail from these stupid ideals.

415
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:02,345
I'm not sure if he'll listen.
He's pretty stubborn.

416
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:04,024
I don't care what he is.

417
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,425
All I care about
is that we continue this project.

418
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,225
If he doesn't stop,

419
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,185
you'll have to.

420
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:14,945
You…

421
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:18,744
Your future at TRD depends on yourself.

422
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:25,105
You ordered me to do it.

423
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,865
I did, but you didn't succeed.

424
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,905
I had to clean up for you.

425
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:35,425
I kept him alive for your sake.

426
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,504
That's why this is all messed up.

427
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:44,064
Right now, my father, the board,

428
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:46,264
and the investors are all pressuring me.

429
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,185
And the police are snooping around.

430
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:51,145
I have to do something

431
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,105
before we're all ruined.

432
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:54,544
What will you do?

433
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:00,905
If your wife's nephew is such a nuisance,

434
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,585
I'll end it myself.

435
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:15,665
The book that Nut
was reading yesterday said that

436
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:19,185
this seemingly harmless disease

437
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:22,225
can eat up the patient

438
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,864
and spit out the empty shell

439
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,424
without the person's identity inside.

440
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,304
The movie Nut watched the other day

441
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,505
also said

442
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:35,225
that cancer is better than this.

443
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,065
It sounds terrifying,

444
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,665
but seeing her now…

445
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,784
You're awake.

446
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,784
Yes.

447
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:50,944
Nut went to bed late, so he isn't up yet.

448
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:54,025
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

449
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:57,145
I wake up early every day.

450
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:00,665
You and Nut are the only ones
who always wake up late.

451
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:06,505
-I was meaning to ask.
-Yes?

452
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:08,384
Do you like wood sorrels?

453
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,625
Well…

454
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:20,585
It's a flower that sticks in my memory.

455
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:24,545
I used to live in Soi Butterfly,

456
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:28,985
and that alley was lined
with wood sorrels.

457
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:34,225
That was what they called the alley.

458
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:38,825
When I first moved here,

459
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:42,384
I felt a little out of place,

460
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:43,904
so I planted these here.

461
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:49,864
These flowers made this place feel
warm and familiar like the old house.

462
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,265
I'm used to this house now, though.

463
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:58,265
And I…

464
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:01,825
love this house as much as the old one.

465
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:06,384
A house that is a home.

466
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:14,785
I like this house too.

467
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,225
I also like that you're cheerful.

468
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:27,345
I know Nut and you are worried about me.

469
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,625
But since my disease can't be cured,

470
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:33,505
don't worry about curing it.

471
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,065
The drugs are just slowing it down,

472
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:42,185
but my body worsens every day.

473
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:47,025
I think…

474
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,465
From now on, let's live.

475
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,665
Through both joy and sorrow…

476
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:59,985
until my memories fade away.

477
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:08,585
I read somewhere

478
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:13,305
that the thing that Alzheimer's
can't take away from us…

479
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:15,745
is love.

480
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,705
Sometimes, the sooner we accept the truth,

481
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,065
the sooner our wound heals.

482
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:45,625
THIS WAY TO THE BEDROOM

483
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:58,185
What's this?

484
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:03,305
I registered your information
at The Mirror Foundation,

485
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:06,265
and they gave us this wristband.

486
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:08,944
It's filled with all of your information.

487
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:13,065
In case you get lost
and someone finds you,

488
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:14,864
they'll know where to drop you off.

489
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:16,745
So…

490
00:38:16,825 --> 00:38:18,464
you must wear it at all times.

491
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:19,505
Don't take it off.

492
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,904
Next.

493
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,825
-What's it?
-The number is…

494
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:37,225
-Sixty-two.
-Sixty-two.

495
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:38,785
-I have it.
-You do.

496
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:41,265
-I have it, too.
-I don't.

497
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:43,545
This one.

498
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,225
What's the number?

499
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:48,705
-Forty-six.
-Forty-six.

500
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,225
-I have it.
-What?

501
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,864
Why don't I have it?

502
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:56,904
Wait a minute.

503
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,145
-Kuenchai got bingo.
-What?

504
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:03,464
-Oh, wow. Great job.
-That's awesome.

505
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:06,145
Great job.

506
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:08,384
Give me your hand.

507
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,305
-Great job.
-Another one.

508
00:39:10,384 --> 00:39:12,145
Since it can't be avoided,

509
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,745
we'll hold onto it.

510
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,345
We'll use this pain as an opportunity

511
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,145
to bring us even closer.

512
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:36,145
It smells so good.

513
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:38,065
What are you making today?

514
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:41,705
Tofu with tamarind sauce.

515
00:39:43,145 --> 00:39:44,185
What?

516
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:49,585
-Mom.
-What?

517
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,705
You got Tofu all confused.

518
00:39:53,585 --> 00:39:56,185
I only heard of eggs with tamarind sauce.

519
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:58,065
Well,

520
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,705
they're similar.

521
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:01,785
I changed the eggs to tofu.

522
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:07,384
I like the name of this dish.

523
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:12,825
So…

524
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,985
what are the ingredients?

525
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,545
There is

526
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:19,345
hard tofu.

527
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:22,025
There are also red onions,

528
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:24,185
dried chili,

529
00:40:24,265 --> 00:40:26,025
and…

530
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:30,305
Here, Mom.

531
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:33,424
There's cilantro, tamarind,

532
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:34,985
and palm sugar.

533
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:38,185
Some recipes also add garlic and sesame.

534
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:41,904
-Mom.
-What?

535
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:44,305
Should we try new recipes someday?

536
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:45,785
There is a lot here.

537
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:47,145
Sounds good.

538
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:50,305
-Should I help?
-Sure.

539
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,944
What are there?

540
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:55,025
Here.

541
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,944
The bread looks delicious.

542
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:59,545
The sweets look good.

543
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,785
What sweet?

544
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:02,025
What does it say?

545
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,145
Can we order it?

546
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,904
-Let's just bake it. It's much cheaper.
-Fine.

547
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:12,305
Here.

548
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:18,585
-I'll take a look.
-Okay.

549
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:33,464
-Hi, Prib.
-Hi.

550
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:36,864
Long time no see. You're still handsome.

551
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,025
You, too.

552
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:41,185
I'm still pretty, right?

553
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:45,145
Do you want to come in?

554
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:50,904
I haven't seen Nut in weeks.

555
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,505
He barely goes to the office.

556
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,864
Even Uncle Juea is missing him.

557
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:57,345
He asked me to bring Nut the new project.

558
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:59,705
Is there a new project?

559
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:01,464
He hasn't finished the old one.

560
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:04,105
I can handle it.

561
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:08,665
It's better to have money.

562
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:09,944
In case we need it.

563
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:13,105
I won't get overworked.

564
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:14,745
You're taking care of me.

565
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,025
It must be harder on you,

566
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:19,345
having to take care of two people.

567
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:22,545
It's all right.

568
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,785
I'm happy to do it.

569
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:27,944
I better find Mrs. Na.

570
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:30,105
I feel invisible here.

571
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,305
-Hello.
-Hello.

572
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:42,625
You are…

573
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:47,545
It's Prib,

574
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,705
my coworker.

575
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,384
-Right. Prib.
-Yes.

576
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:56,625
I'm sorry. I couldn't remember your name.
Don't mind me.

577
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,105
Don't worry.

578
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:02,585
I can introduce myself
every time you forget.

579
00:43:03,825 --> 00:43:05,305
I'm a great talker.

580
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:10,065
Stay for dinner.

581
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:11,545
Definitely.

582
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:14,384
Please excuse me.
I have to fill Kuenchai's bowl.

583
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:17,065
Kuenchai already ate.

584
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:20,904
He won't be able to walk if he eats more.

585
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,464
Wait.

586
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:31,105
It smells like…

587
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:32,625
-It smells like--
-Hey!

588
00:43:37,944 --> 00:43:39,105
Be careful, Nut.

589
00:43:41,545 --> 00:43:42,384
Move aside.

590
00:43:58,944 --> 00:44:00,904
Why didn't you turn it off?

591
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:04,825
I told you to be careful.

592
00:44:06,864 --> 00:44:09,864
What would you do if you were alone?

593
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:13,105
I forgot.

594
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:16,105
I'm sorry.

595
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:33,864
It's all right, Mrs. Na.

596
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:11,464
How's it going, Nut? How's the script?

597
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:05,145
Nut.

598
00:46:36,705 --> 00:46:39,025
You've been doing a great job.

599
00:46:42,825 --> 00:46:44,384
Don't blame yourself.

600
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:48,464
You did great.

601
00:47:20,944 --> 00:47:22,025
Thank you.

602
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:26,265
What for?

603
00:47:28,105 --> 00:47:29,225
Everything.

604
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:33,145
Thank you for staying beside me

605
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:36,864
when I feel alone.

606
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:41,185
And I'm sorry

607
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,424
for bringing you into this

608
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:46,745
when you're suffering from memory loss.

609
00:47:51,864 --> 00:47:53,825
I have to thank you too,

610
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,424
for letting me stay here

611
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:00,424
and always missing me,

612
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:04,944
even when you have a lot to think about.

613
00:48:08,105 --> 00:48:09,825
And I'm sorry

614
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:13,585
that I can't help much.

615
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:17,105
This is more than enough.

616
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,825
With you hugging me like this,

617
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,464
I have enough strength to go on.

618
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:29,424
You can recharge anytime.

619
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:31,864
I'll be right here.

620
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:05,825
Eat this, Mrs. Na.

621
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:08,785
Eat up.

622
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:10,145
Thanks.

623
00:49:23,864 --> 00:49:25,705
-Mom.
-What is it?

624
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:28,745
I want to host a party.

625
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,785
What party?

626
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:35,065
Is it for a birthday?

627
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:39,424
I don't recall anyone's birthday
around this time.

628
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:42,625
That's not it.

629
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,864
I want to host a party just because.

630
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:53,505
Just because?

631
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:56,904
Then please do.

632
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:07,625
I don't even know some of their faces.

633
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:11,745
Then we should just invite close friends.

634
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:17,545
I saw this album in the storage room.

635
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:21,225
Do you want to take a look?
We might find photos of your friends.

636
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:38,145
"All grown-ups

637
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:41,305
were children first,

638
00:50:43,345 --> 00:50:45,984
but few of them remember it."

639
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,025
That's from The Little Prince.

640
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:51,705
Right.

641
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:54,625
I suddenly remembered it.

642
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,625
When I was a teacher,

643
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:01,705
I would stop the children when I see them

644
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:03,424
doing something strange.

645
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:05,384
But I had actually done

646
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:08,345
the same things when I was their age.

647
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:15,345
Being a grown-up
makes me forget the child in me.

648
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:19,265
I live in a world of benefits,

649
00:51:21,105 --> 00:51:23,545
filled with numbers and competitions.

650
00:51:29,424 --> 00:51:31,545
Just like how Dad used to ask me

651
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:33,984
where I was ranked

652
00:51:34,984 --> 00:51:36,145
and how my grades were.

653
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:41,904
He never asked me
how my classes went, if I enjoyed it,

654
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,185
or if I liked it.

655
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:56,025
Dad and I are sorry.

656
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:01,705
We lost our childhoods along the way.

657
00:52:05,984 --> 00:52:08,424
Our childhood memories

658
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:10,345
shape who we are today.

659
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:12,904
But as we grow up,

660
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:14,864
we tend to forget those times.

661
00:52:15,825 --> 00:52:18,025
We lose our own Little Prince

662
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:21,065
along with our imagination and dreams.

663
00:52:29,265 --> 00:52:31,785
I just noticed
that we have no family photo.

664
00:52:33,705 --> 00:52:36,145
I never thought it was a real family.

665
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:39,745
And I don't know who to show it to.

666
00:52:40,785 --> 00:52:42,545
We don't really have visitors.

667
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:45,384
Also,

668
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:48,145
we rarely take photos together.

669
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:51,585
As I remember, the last time…

670
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,145
was probably on a trip.

671
00:52:54,825 --> 00:52:56,265
I was around eight years old.

672
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:02,145
Shall we take a family photo?

673
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:05,464
We're about to host a party.
We can show it to them.

674
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,825
The party will be at the garden.

675
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:10,065
We can place it at the garden.

676
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:13,904
I think we should just frame

677
00:53:13,984 --> 00:53:15,585
the ones we have.

678
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:18,424
Those photos were for fun.

679
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:21,265
I want a serious photo.

680
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,265
Whatever you say.

681
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,504
I'll take Mom to a photo studio.

682
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:28,785
No.

683
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:30,345
I want to take it in the house.

684
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:31,585
What?

685
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:32,785
The house…

686
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:34,464
Well,

687
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,825
this house is our memory.

688
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:39,464
Your mom said she likes this place.

689
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,025
I do too.

690
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:43,585
Let's take the photo here.

691
00:53:45,504 --> 00:53:46,864
Here it is.

692
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:48,585
But…

693
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:50,105
we need some assistance.

694
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,944
Get closer.

695
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:53,944
Okay. Ready?

696
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:55,384
Oh, wow.

697
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:58,025
The models look so great.

698
00:53:58,105 --> 00:54:00,904
You can blame me
if the photos don't turn out well.

699
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:04,225
All right.

700
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:07,025
One, two, three.

701
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:30,705
What's with you?

702
00:54:32,384 --> 00:54:33,745
I want a photo shoot too.

703
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:37,504
What type of photo shoot?

704
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:39,665
Like this one.

705
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:41,745
A family photo shoot.

706
00:54:45,145 --> 00:54:46,785
You better ask your dad.

707
00:54:49,944 --> 00:54:51,025
If Dad agrees,

708
00:54:51,105 --> 00:54:53,424
we have to dress up nicer than this.

709
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,225
Fine. Give me that.

710
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,345
Why the rush?

711
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:11,384
I have to go. I still have work to do.

712
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:13,625
Thank you, Prib.

713
00:55:14,705 --> 00:55:16,984
-Let me know when you get there.
-Okay.

714
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,545
I'll get going, then.

715
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:26,585
Thank you, Gen.

716
00:55:26,665 --> 00:55:27,545
You, too, Song.

717
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:30,225
Sure thing. I'll see you.

718
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:32,305
-I'm leaving.
-Bye.

719
00:55:58,145 --> 00:55:59,864
UNCLE JUEA

720
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:05,785
What is it, Uncle Juea?

721
00:56:06,265 --> 00:56:08,345
How was Nut's photo shoot?

722
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:11,424
All good.

723
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:13,984
I'm heading back now.
I'll show you the photos.

724
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:15,864
Once you see them,

725
00:56:15,944 --> 00:56:18,625
you'll want them as film references.

726
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:21,384
Oh, wow. Are they that good?

727
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:24,185
They were like wedding photos.

728
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:26,305
Gen did an amazing job.

729
00:56:26,825 --> 00:56:28,745
I see.

730
00:56:28,825 --> 00:56:31,424
A boys' love fan like you
must be over the moon.

731
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,464
I would be if it was actually possible.

732
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:37,705
I wish they would legalize
same-sex marriage.

733
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:40,984
Shouldn't we all benefit from the law

734
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,864
when it's created for everyone?

735
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:24,145
Tofu.

736
00:57:24,944 --> 00:57:27,065
It will take all night at this rate.

737
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,904
You look good today.

738
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:33,384
I want to see more of you in this outfit.

739
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:36,464
You look good too.

740
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:39,145
Just like in my dreams.

741
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:41,864
Have you dreamed of me?

742
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:44,424
A long time ago.

743
00:57:47,265 --> 00:57:48,464
Well,

744
00:57:48,984 --> 00:57:50,265
if you like it,

745
00:57:51,785 --> 00:57:53,825
should we sleep in these outfits tonight

746
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,545
without showering?

747
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,785
What?

748
00:58:05,864 --> 00:58:07,504
So you can take a good look.

749
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:11,424
Thank you

750
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:14,424
for letting me into your family.

751
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:32,504
Ouch. Nut!

752
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:34,105
Don't get too emotional.

753
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:36,105
Get in the shower.

754
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:37,185
I want to sleep.

755
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:40,424
All right.

756
00:58:47,145 --> 00:58:48,504
Then…

757
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:50,864
can we keep the outfits

758
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,705
and wear them to the party?

759
00:58:55,864 --> 00:58:58,545
It's a simple event.
We don't need to dress up.

760
00:58:59,384 --> 00:59:01,944
Everyone there will be Mom's guests.

761
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:03,145
We're all friends.

762
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:07,185
I don't want you to look too good.

763
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,384
Mom's friends will faint.

764
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,864
Fine.

765
00:59:13,944 --> 00:59:16,345
I'll only look good for you, then.

766
00:59:24,904 --> 00:59:26,185
Nut.

767
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:28,705
Good boy.

768
00:59:30,585 --> 00:59:31,785
I'll go take a shower.

769
00:59:38,105 --> 00:59:39,065
Nut.

770
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:41,504
What's a party like?

771
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:44,345
Is it something with flashing lights,

772
00:59:44,424 --> 00:59:46,065
people dancing,

773
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:48,625
and falling confetti?

774
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:50,345
Is it going to be fun like that?

775
00:59:56,105 --> 00:59:58,065
-How are you?
-I'm good.

776
00:59:58,145 --> 01:00:00,225
You're still so pretty.

777
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,585
-You look the same.
-Thanks.

778
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:04,145
-Su and Na are here.
-They are?

779
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:06,145
-It has been so long.
-It has been so long.

780
01:00:06,225 --> 01:00:07,384
Let's head in.

781
01:00:07,464 --> 01:00:09,625
-Hey, host.
-Pritr!

782
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:15,504
They're dancing.

783
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:27,384
How's this?

784
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:29,065
Aren't they having fun?

785
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:31,745
Just seeing your mom happy

786
01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:33,424
makes me happy.

787
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:42,785
Oh…

788
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:44,705
be careful.

789
01:00:47,384 --> 01:00:48,345
Hello.

790
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:51,024
-Hello.
-I'm sorry.

791
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,024
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

792
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:55,305
How could we miss it?

793
01:00:55,384 --> 01:00:58,225
It's a rare occasion for this house
to host a party.

794
01:00:58,305 --> 01:01:00,265
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

795
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:02,705
Tofu. Set the table for Chu and Nhong.

796
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:03,904
Okay.

797
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:09,065
I never thought I would see this house
with such atmosphere.

798
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:11,065
-Me neither.
-Right.

799
01:01:11,665 --> 01:01:13,345
Is it Tofu's doing?

800
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:16,825
Yes.

801
01:01:16,904 --> 01:01:19,705
I got to this point, thanks to Tofu.

802
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:23,864
-I should help Tofu.
-Go ahead.

803
01:01:25,305 --> 01:01:27,665
You can grab the water.

804
01:01:27,745 --> 01:01:30,625
I can't help but envy them.

805
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:33,424
We can't host such a party. We live alone.

806
01:01:34,585 --> 01:01:37,984
We have no friends or family.
It's just the two of us.

807
01:01:38,065 --> 01:01:43,145
Don't envy them.
It's nice to have a happy family.

808
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:44,625
We don't need a big family,

809
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,585
children,

810
01:01:47,065 --> 01:01:49,145
or a marriage license.

811
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:52,984
It doesn't matter what people think.

812
01:01:53,065 --> 01:01:55,185
It's up to the two of us, okay?

813
01:01:55,265 --> 01:01:57,305
We are a family.

814
01:02:02,464 --> 01:02:04,944
Like how Tofu is Nut's family, right?

815
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:07,745
Right.

816
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:09,504
He's more than family.

817
01:02:12,464 --> 01:02:14,305
-Make yourself at home.
-Okay.

818
01:02:14,384 --> 01:02:16,305
-Mom made this.
-Did she?

819
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:18,305
-Hello
-Hello.

820
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:20,424
-Thank you.
-It's great.

821
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:21,785
You haven't eaten yet.

822
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:24,145
Please excuse me.

823
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:25,984
Are you tired, Tofu?

824
01:02:26,864 --> 01:02:29,384
Thank you for helping me with the guests.

825
01:02:29,464 --> 01:02:30,944
No problem.

826
01:02:31,024 --> 01:02:32,825
I've never done anything like this.

827
01:02:32,904 --> 01:02:34,065
It's quite fun.

828
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:40,225
Na.

829
01:02:41,145 --> 01:02:42,105
Saen.

830
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:46,185
I'm happy to see you happy and healthy.

831
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:48,745
How can she be healthy?

832
01:02:48,825 --> 01:02:51,464
Alzheimer's destroys health.

833
01:02:51,545 --> 01:02:52,745
Lucky you have a son.

834
01:02:52,825 --> 01:02:54,944
Nut is behaving better.

835
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:58,625
He probably won't let you get sick
and burden people again.

836
01:03:00,305 --> 01:03:02,504
It's probably hard on you,

837
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:04,545
suffering from two diseases back to back.

838
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,225
What kind of karma is this?

839
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,265
Jan.

840
01:03:08,345 --> 01:03:10,504
If you can't speak nice, then don't.

841
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:14,705
I'm sorry.

842
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:16,665
Jan tends to say hurtful things.

843
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,384
Hurtful is different

844
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:21,185
from disrespectful.

845
01:03:24,785 --> 01:03:26,305
As I recall,

846
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:27,825
I only invited Uncle Saen.

847
01:03:29,944 --> 01:03:32,225
You came here uninvited.

848
01:03:32,305 --> 01:03:34,185
If you can't behave,

849
01:03:34,265 --> 01:03:35,545
then you should leave.

850
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,424
This event is for my mom.

851
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,305
I want her to be surrounded
by good people.

852
01:03:42,225 --> 01:03:43,745
Calm down, Nut.

853
01:03:45,665 --> 01:03:47,424
As long as she's here,

854
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:49,265
let's welcome her.

855
01:03:51,424 --> 01:03:52,705
I don't mind it.

856
01:03:53,825 --> 01:03:55,864
I understand that this is who you are.

857
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:58,585
Well,

858
01:03:59,384 --> 01:04:00,904
you may think that…

859
01:04:01,785 --> 01:04:03,105
I'm selfish

860
01:04:03,185 --> 01:04:05,825
and I'm being a burden to my son
because of my sickness.

861
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:09,705
Since we can't choose what disease we get,

862
01:04:10,705 --> 01:04:14,185
all I can do is to accept it
and live the best I can.

863
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,904
It's good that you realize that,
so you can find peace.

864
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,145
Excuse me.

865
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:22,424
Sorry for interrupting.

866
01:04:23,265 --> 01:04:24,785
It's time for the highlight.

867
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:26,384
Should we get ready?

868
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:34,705
Nut.

869
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:37,585
Take your mom.

870
01:04:38,305 --> 01:04:39,384
Song is waiting.

871
01:04:45,424 --> 01:04:46,305
Let's go, Mom.

872
01:04:48,265 --> 01:04:49,105
Please enjoy.

873
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,825
Mrs. Na.

874
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:53,825
What song will you choose?

875
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,984
If you're staying,

876
01:04:57,065 --> 01:04:58,225
I'll find you a table.

877
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,384
Follow me.

878
01:05:03,305 --> 01:05:05,424
If you can't behave,

879
01:05:05,504 --> 01:05:06,665
don't sit with me.

880
01:05:06,745 --> 01:05:07,745
I'm embarrassed.

881
01:05:28,305 --> 01:05:29,864
What is it?

882
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,864
Do I look more handsome?
You keep staring at me.

883
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:35,185
I guess.

884
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,544
I saw the photo of you in a suit.

885
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,225
You looked different.

886
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:41,825
Are you surprised?

887
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:44,944
There may be more surprises
coming your way.

888
01:05:45,745 --> 01:05:47,105
Get ready for them.

889
01:05:51,424 --> 01:05:52,625
I mean,

890
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:54,665
get ready for my handsomeness.

891
01:05:54,745 --> 01:05:55,984
I'll look better every day.

892
01:05:59,745 --> 01:06:00,984
We're starting soon.

893
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:02,464
Please excuse me.

894
01:06:14,185 --> 01:06:15,424
Hello, everyone.

895
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,145
Hello.

896
01:06:22,705 --> 01:06:28,145
You might wonder
why I suddenly invited you all here today

897
01:06:28,825 --> 01:06:32,105
when I rarely ever did anything like this

898
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:35,225
the whole time we've known each other.

899
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:38,785
To tell you the truth,

900
01:06:39,864 --> 01:06:41,825
I have Alzheimer's.

901
01:06:42,384 --> 01:06:43,265
What?

902
01:06:47,145 --> 01:06:50,984
I'm sorry if I've dampened the party,

903
01:06:51,065 --> 01:06:53,864
but I've decided that it didn't matter

904
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:55,705
when I told you.

905
01:06:56,305 --> 01:07:00,065
When I first found out,
my reaction was the same as yours now.

906
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:03,944
I was confused. I didn't know
what to say or what to do.

907
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:07,785
When I got a hold of myself,

908
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,384
I started preparing

909
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,745
and researched about the disease.

910
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:18,785
This disease
will strip me away of memories,

911
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:21,424
skills,

912
01:07:22,265 --> 01:07:23,464
and my pride,

913
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:25,464
little by little.

914
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:29,424
Finally, I know that I'll start
to lose myself.

915
01:07:31,225 --> 01:07:32,785
I'll turn into…

916
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:34,864
someone else.

917
01:07:38,825 --> 01:07:40,705
All of this got me

918
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:43,145
to decide to stay in the present

919
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:45,504
and…

920
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:48,625
strengthen our family ties.

921
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,024
I know

922
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:56,825
that it will be harder on them
in the future.

923
01:08:04,065 --> 01:08:05,345
From now on,

924
01:08:06,024 --> 01:08:09,185
your mom may turn into
someone new every day.

925
01:08:12,984 --> 01:08:16,065
I may turn into someone
who can't help myself.

926
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:18,865
I may be unreasonable,

927
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:20,744
clumsy,

928
01:08:21,825 --> 01:08:23,025
and I may do things…

929
01:08:24,384 --> 01:08:25,544
foolishly

930
01:08:25,624 --> 01:08:26,945
or in a silly manner.

931
01:08:32,424 --> 01:08:33,945
But I always know

932
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:36,704
that you'll never leave me.

933
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:40,584
You've always taken good care of me.

934
01:08:43,905 --> 01:08:46,384
I want you to take care
of your own heart too.

935
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:54,985
This includes

936
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:56,865
everyone here.

937
01:09:00,664 --> 01:09:02,225
In the end,

938
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:05,504
it may hurt

939
01:09:07,464 --> 01:09:08,985
that I won't remember you.

940
01:09:10,065 --> 01:09:13,065
You may be the only one who remembers me.

941
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:16,025
If that day comes,

942
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:20,025
I want all of you to know that…

943
01:09:22,105 --> 01:09:24,825
even though you won't be in my memories,

944
01:09:25,865 --> 01:09:28,185
I believe that you'll remain in my heart.

945
01:09:47,504 --> 01:09:50,265
Thank you everyone for coming today.

946
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:52,185
I also

947
01:09:52,744 --> 01:09:56,664
thank my son
for having the idea for this party.

948
01:09:57,545 --> 01:09:59,065
I just want

949
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:05,025
to gather all the memories
and the love of everyone once again.

950
01:10:06,945 --> 01:10:09,945
I may be sad, but let's have some fun.

951
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:15,905
I want my last memory with all of you

952
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:17,265
to be filled with happiness.

953
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:49,545
It doesn't matter who you were

954
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:54,225
You introduced me to a new world

955
01:10:54,305 --> 01:10:58,945
I learned what love and compassion are

956
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:05,345
-When I someone I love
-Loves me back

957
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:09,545
You lifted my heart

958
01:11:09,624 --> 01:11:15,105
This worn-out heart finally sees
Some wonderful days ever since

959
01:11:15,185 --> 01:11:21,345
You became a part of my life

960
01:11:21,425 --> 01:11:25,744
You're my breath

961
01:11:25,825 --> 01:11:28,744
I can't live without you

962
01:11:29,784 --> 01:11:32,545
I heard some patients found miracles.

963
01:11:33,425 --> 01:11:35,225
I guess Alzheimer's is different.

964
01:11:35,865 --> 01:11:38,265
Since the world isn't so nice to us,

965
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:41,265
let's try our best instead.

966
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:46,025
Nut and I will do our best
to take care of his mom,

967
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:48,265
rather than give up

968
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:51,825
and let the disease
erase her identity forever.

969
01:12:00,505 --> 01:12:02,065
I'm sorry.

970
01:12:02,905 --> 01:12:05,704
I never knew how much you suffered

971
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:08,545
after you got married.

972
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:11,145
I shouldn't have pushed him on you.

973
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:15,425
Don't worry about it.

974
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:19,065
It's all in the past.

975
01:12:19,624 --> 01:12:21,825
You didn't do anything wrong.

976
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,185
I made my own decisions.

977
01:12:25,265 --> 01:12:27,585
I still feel bad about it.

978
01:12:29,744 --> 01:12:33,585
Back then, Sibmeun was perfect
in every way.

979
01:12:34,945 --> 01:12:37,865
I thought you could trust him
with your life.

980
01:12:38,865 --> 01:12:40,985
Who would have known

981
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,025
that one day,

982
01:12:43,585 --> 01:12:45,744
that man would turn your life upside down.

983
01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:50,945
Nobody knows what lies ahead of us.

984
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:54,305
At that time,

985
01:12:54,905 --> 01:12:56,545
we both tried…

986
01:12:58,265 --> 01:12:59,664
our very best.

987
01:13:00,945 --> 01:13:04,744
We chose what was best for us
at that time.

988
01:13:05,345 --> 01:13:06,985
I'm really sorry.

989
01:13:08,905 --> 01:13:11,185
I lost touch with you.

990
01:13:11,265 --> 01:13:14,945
I never knew you were hurt
both physically and mentally.

991
01:13:15,025 --> 01:13:16,225
Pritr.

992
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:18,784
You really don't have to apologize.

993
01:13:19,345 --> 01:13:22,784
I'm not suffering as much anymore. Okay?

994
01:13:23,905 --> 01:13:26,065
I chose to stay in the present.

995
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:31,825
I'm going to live every day
as best as I physically can.

996
01:13:33,065 --> 01:13:36,145
If there's anything I can help with,
you must let me know.

997
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:37,985
I'm happy to help.

998
01:13:39,385 --> 01:13:42,305
Your visits will be more than enough.

999
01:13:45,824 --> 01:13:47,065
I promise.

1000
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:54,865
-Mom.
-What is it?

1001
01:13:54,945 --> 01:13:56,065
They're asking for you.

1002
01:13:57,744 --> 01:13:58,905
Okay.

1003
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:01,824
-I'll see you outside.
-Okay.

1004
01:14:19,624 --> 01:14:20,664
Peeranut.

1005
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:30,385
What is it?

1006
01:14:33,185 --> 01:14:34,585
I'm sorry.

1007
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,824
What I did in the past

1008
01:14:39,905 --> 01:14:42,505
must have scarred you.

1009
01:14:43,065 --> 01:14:45,784
I just want you to understand

1010
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:47,824
that I did everything I did

1011
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:51,105
because your father asked me
to take care of you.

1012
01:14:54,945 --> 01:14:56,145
At that time,

1013
01:14:56,624 --> 01:14:59,664
I thought it was better for you.

1014
01:15:03,905 --> 01:15:04,985
On that day,

1015
01:15:06,065 --> 01:15:08,345
I intended to call your mother.

1016
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:12,505
Na was my junior

1017
01:15:12,585 --> 01:15:14,704
who I genuinely adored and cared for.

1018
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:18,265
I didn't want it to become an issue.

1019
01:15:18,824 --> 01:15:20,985
Unfortunately, your father picked up.

1020
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:28,865
It's too late to say it now,

1021
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,065
but I'm really sorry.

1022
01:15:38,465 --> 01:15:40,265
Did you also tell Dad…

1023
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:42,744
about the exam?

1024
01:15:44,105 --> 01:15:45,545
I did it

1025
01:15:46,624 --> 01:15:48,265
because…

1026
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,624
You meant well.

1027
01:15:54,225 --> 01:15:56,025
You studied sciences in school.

1028
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:57,744
Why would you pursue arts?

1029
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:03,025
Engineering has better advantages
than Communication Arts.

1030
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:06,704
I should have pursued the army
like your son.

1031
01:16:07,385 --> 01:16:08,744
That would have been the best.

1032
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:11,545
I might have become a prime minister.

1033
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:16,345
Back then,

1034
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:18,784
that's what I thought.

1035
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:21,784
But now,

1036
01:16:21,865 --> 01:16:24,385
I know that it's better
to study what you like.

1037
01:16:25,065 --> 01:16:27,784
I can see that you're successful now

1038
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:29,945
because you got to study what you wanted.

1039
01:16:31,585 --> 01:16:33,465
Even if I failed,

1040
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,185
it's okay.

1041
01:16:35,265 --> 01:16:36,345
What kids choose

1042
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:38,905
is what they have to live with.

1043
01:16:39,465 --> 01:16:41,385
Adults aren't joining their kids
in school.

1044
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,145
They don't experience what the kids have.

1045
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:46,305
Even if they fail,

1046
01:16:47,385 --> 01:16:48,824
they'll get to learn

1047
01:16:49,744 --> 01:16:50,704
and grow.

1048
01:16:56,505 --> 01:16:57,704
That's true.

1049
01:17:00,185 --> 01:17:02,345
I'm sorry, Peeranut.

1050
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:06,664
I know

1051
01:17:07,145 --> 01:17:09,185
that the world is moving forward,

1052
01:17:09,905 --> 01:17:13,065
and people my age may be moving backwards.

1053
01:17:14,425 --> 01:17:15,824
I'm trying.

1054
01:17:16,784 --> 01:17:19,225
I'm slowly learning new things.

1055
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,465
I might not understand everything now…

1056
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,465
I might…

1057
01:17:28,265 --> 01:17:29,985
not agree with some things.

1058
01:17:34,585 --> 01:17:36,585
You don't need to agree with everything.

1059
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:40,305
Just trying to understand

1060
01:17:41,225 --> 01:17:42,784
and not hurting anyone

1061
01:17:44,065 --> 01:17:45,545
is good enough.

1062
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:51,105
If we understand each other more,

1063
01:17:52,744 --> 01:17:54,345
not just you and I,

1064
01:17:55,265 --> 01:17:56,824
or in school,

1065
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,305
but within families,

1066
01:18:00,265 --> 01:18:02,744
maybe we'll all understand each other…

1067
01:18:03,865 --> 01:18:04,744
someday.

1068
01:18:10,664 --> 01:18:11,865
Do you like this one?

1069
01:18:11,945 --> 01:18:12,945
I'm trying.

1070
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:26,905
You should've invited your dad.

1071
01:18:27,465 --> 01:18:29,305
I guess he's busy

1072
01:18:29,824 --> 01:18:31,465
since he's working on Tatarn's case.

1073
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,664
Why are you surprised?

1074
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:39,185
Didn't you know

1075
01:18:39,265 --> 01:18:41,345
that Song's father was Mr. Anik?

1076
01:18:44,265 --> 01:18:47,025
We weren't all together in Chiang Mai,

1077
01:18:47,105 --> 01:18:48,345
so I didn't tell you.

1078
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:52,105
Do you have to tell her who my dad is?

1079
01:18:52,704 --> 01:18:55,105
That's silly. Who would want to know?

1080
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:57,225
Maybe someone does.

1081
01:18:59,105 --> 01:19:01,505
I just want to show off

1082
01:19:01,585 --> 01:19:03,305
that I know someone with a rank.

1083
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:06,985
My dad is just a normal police officer.

1084
01:19:07,065 --> 01:19:09,545
If you want to show off some big names,

1085
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:11,624
you should pick Gen's father.

1086
01:19:11,704 --> 01:19:13,585
He's a navy admiral.

1087
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:20,025
You know more people than I expected

1088
01:19:20,105 --> 01:19:23,624
for an amnesiac who always stays home.

1089
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:27,225
Isn't it beneficial
to have good connections?

1090
01:19:27,784 --> 01:19:30,505
They may be able to help
if something happens.

1091
01:19:34,225 --> 01:19:36,225
What help did you expect from my dad?

1092
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,905
He can't even help you

1093
01:19:38,985 --> 01:19:40,624
find your family.

1094
01:19:41,905 --> 01:19:43,305
That, he can't help with.

1095
01:19:43,865 --> 01:19:45,865
Maybe he can help with something else.

1096
01:19:51,585 --> 01:19:52,425
Oh, wow.

1097
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:55,305
Speak of the devil. Right on queue.

1098
01:19:57,145 --> 01:19:58,145
Hi, Dad.

1099
01:20:00,065 --> 01:20:02,225
Yes. That's great.

1100
01:20:02,704 --> 01:20:04,065
You can stay longer this time.

1101
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:07,185
Yes. I'll see you.

1102
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:09,585
What did he say?

1103
01:20:10,704 --> 01:20:11,545
Don't tell me.

1104
01:20:11,624 --> 01:20:12,905
Is he free to join us now?

1105
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:14,985
No.

1106
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,704
He said he'll come to Bangkok.

1107
01:20:16,784 --> 01:20:20,704
Mr. Saen moved Tarn to Bangkok,

1108
01:20:20,784 --> 01:20:22,744
so Dad will follow him.

1109
01:20:28,025 --> 01:20:30,345
I moved Tatarn to Bangkok.

1110
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:34,545
Why is that?

1111
01:20:35,065 --> 01:20:38,145
It's because of what you said.

1112
01:20:38,225 --> 01:20:40,065
What I said?

1113
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,265
You told me

1114
01:20:42,784 --> 01:20:45,385
to correct my mistakes while I still can.

1115
01:20:46,305 --> 01:20:49,385
Not to neglect them and drown in regret.

1116
01:20:49,465 --> 01:20:52,425
I realized that Tatarn's condition
hasn't improved.

1117
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:54,744
And it could be because

1118
01:20:54,824 --> 01:20:57,824
I made the wrong decision
to leave him there.

1119
01:20:57,905 --> 01:21:01,744
I think that it would be better
to get treated by good doctors in Bangkok.

1120
01:21:03,465 --> 01:21:06,065
I'll be able to visit you more from now on

1121
01:21:06,704 --> 01:21:09,265
since I have to follow up on Tatarn too.

1122
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:14,985
You can tell me if Nut is busy
when you have doctor's appointments.

1123
01:21:15,065 --> 01:21:16,065
I'll take you.

1124
01:21:18,385 --> 01:21:22,385
Thank you very much
for always taking care of Nut and me.

1125
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,865
We would get to meet a lot more
if you moved next door.

1126
01:21:32,824 --> 01:21:34,025
Actually, Jan and I…

1127
01:21:35,105 --> 01:21:36,905
split a while ago.

1128
01:21:38,905 --> 01:21:40,265
It's not because of work.

1129
01:21:41,265 --> 01:21:43,945
We decided not to be together anymore.

1130
01:21:45,385 --> 01:21:46,985
We haven't divorced,

1131
01:21:47,065 --> 01:21:48,305
but the love is gone.

1132
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:53,585
That's what I thought too.

1133
01:21:55,824 --> 01:21:59,905
But since it has nothing to do with me,
I decided not to pry.

1134
01:22:01,425 --> 01:22:02,905
I wanted you to know.

1135
01:22:04,865 --> 01:22:07,784
I wanted you to know
that we ended up this way

1136
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:11,345
because of Jan and Sib's vicious plan.

1137
01:22:12,704 --> 01:22:14,664
The two of them…

1138
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:18,545
I know.

1139
01:22:19,865 --> 01:22:21,465
I've known it for a while.

1140
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:25,865
Sib said it when he was drunk.

1141
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,065
Aren't you angry?

1142
01:22:31,545 --> 01:22:33,065
I'm angrier at myself

1143
01:22:34,185 --> 01:22:35,865
for being indecisive.

1144
01:22:38,145 --> 01:22:39,505
As I said before,

1145
01:22:41,025 --> 01:22:42,824
I'm totally fine with the present.

1146
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:45,505
I know you might not be,

1147
01:22:48,145 --> 01:22:49,865
but I believe you can get through it.

1148
01:22:52,465 --> 01:22:53,624
We've all

1149
01:22:54,145 --> 01:22:56,744
been through painful things.

1150
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:00,225
I want us to let go of the past.

1151
01:23:01,465 --> 01:23:02,905
Let's forgive ourselves,

1152
01:23:03,465 --> 01:23:06,065
and live the rest of our lives happily.

1153
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:22,425
-Thank you all.
-It was fun.

1154
01:23:22,505 --> 01:23:23,865
-Get home safe.
-Bye.

1155
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:26,305
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

1156
01:23:26,385 --> 01:23:29,145
-Your singing was great.
-Happy to hear that.

1157
01:23:29,225 --> 01:23:31,065
Enough compliments.

1158
01:23:32,704 --> 01:23:35,704
-Thanks for coming.
-You sing a lot too.

1159
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:37,985
-Mom.
-Yes?

1160
01:23:38,065 --> 01:23:40,025
-I'll clean up.
-Go ahead.

1161
01:23:47,585 --> 01:23:50,664
Thank you for coming.

1162
01:23:51,425 --> 01:23:52,744
Take care of yourself.

1163
01:23:53,225 --> 01:23:54,585
You too.

1164
01:24:02,265 --> 01:24:03,185
Saen.

1165
01:24:03,265 --> 01:24:04,465
What are you doing?

1166
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:06,385
Why did you get me in trouble?

1167
01:24:07,305 --> 01:24:08,305
What's this about?

1168
01:24:08,385 --> 01:24:09,744
About Tatarn.

1169
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,185
I know you moved him to Bangkok.

1170
01:24:12,265 --> 01:24:13,865
Why did you do that?

1171
01:24:13,945 --> 01:24:15,824
You should've left him there.

1172
01:24:15,905 --> 01:24:19,105
Your boss will cover for you
even if he dies.

1173
01:24:19,185 --> 01:24:20,704
Why the sudden humanity?

1174
01:24:20,784 --> 01:24:23,465
I don't want him in a vegetative state.

1175
01:24:23,985 --> 01:24:26,744
I may be a bad person,
but he's our nephew.

1176
01:24:26,824 --> 01:24:30,225
I have no reason to want him dead.

1177
01:24:30,305 --> 01:24:31,704
You're the one

1178
01:24:31,784 --> 01:24:33,704
who lacks humanity.

1179
01:24:33,784 --> 01:24:36,704
He's your nephew,
but you've never cared for him.

1180
01:24:36,784 --> 01:24:39,985
You just leave him there,
waiting for his death.

1181
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:42,025
Everything I did was for you.

1182
01:24:42,105 --> 01:24:44,345
You never appreciated me.

1183
01:24:44,425 --> 01:24:46,704
You destroyed us to impress Na.

1184
01:24:46,784 --> 01:24:49,025
I didn't do it
just because of what she said,

1185
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,744
but I'm sick of it!

1186
01:24:51,505 --> 01:24:54,744
I'm sick of getting pressured by everyone,

1187
01:24:55,385 --> 01:24:57,265
including Sib, Mr. Sakon,

1188
01:24:57,345 --> 01:24:58,865
Ms. Ching, and you.

1189
01:24:58,945 --> 01:25:01,065
I'm sick of this kind of life!

1190
01:25:02,585 --> 01:25:04,065
I want to let go of the past.

1191
01:25:04,585 --> 01:25:06,225
I want to be able to forgive myself.

1192
01:25:06,305 --> 01:25:09,664
I want to live the rest of my life happily
like what Na said,

1193
01:25:09,744 --> 01:25:12,225
but I don't see how it can be possible.

1194
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:38,385
I know all good things
must come to an end,

1195
01:25:39,065 --> 01:25:40,664
but it is so sad

1196
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,185
to see that what's left

1197
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,465
is loneliness.

1198
01:25:46,345 --> 01:25:47,985
What we can savor

1199
01:25:48,664 --> 01:25:50,305
are happiness

1200
01:25:50,385 --> 01:25:51,824
and memories.

1201
01:25:55,145 --> 01:25:56,345
For Mrs. Na, though,

1202
01:25:57,145 --> 01:25:58,824
the memory of today

1203
01:25:59,704 --> 01:26:01,305
will be short-lived.

1204
01:26:02,425 --> 01:26:03,865
Alzheimer's

1205
01:26:04,345 --> 01:26:06,664
is taking her away from everyone.

1206
01:26:08,185 --> 01:26:09,425
She's fading away,

1207
01:26:10,025 --> 01:26:11,305
but not dying.

1208
01:26:20,824 --> 01:26:22,305
She's fading away,

1209
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,265
but not dying.

1210
01:26:26,065 --> 01:26:27,385
She's fading away

1211
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:30,824
because her memories are perishing away.

1212
01:26:34,865 --> 01:26:38,065
When her memories slowly disappear,

1213
01:26:39,305 --> 01:26:40,704
her belongings

1214
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:43,025
slowly fall into slumber.

1215
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:46,025
This means

1216
01:26:46,585 --> 01:26:48,985
that each item is where the owners

1217
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:51,985
store their memories.

1218
01:26:57,985 --> 01:26:59,585
Mr. Rocking Chair.

1219
01:27:01,065 --> 01:27:02,345
Ms. Sofa.

1220
01:27:03,105 --> 01:27:05,145
Ms. Phone.

1221
01:27:06,065 --> 01:27:07,545
Mr. Right Slipper.

1222
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:09,784
All of them

1223
01:27:10,624 --> 01:27:13,025
came to life with Mrs. Na's memories.

1224
01:27:14,345 --> 01:27:16,864
Since she's slowly losing her memories,

1225
01:27:18,305 --> 01:27:20,145
they are starting to fall asleep.

1226
01:27:43,905 --> 01:27:45,744
Not just memories,

1227
01:27:49,704 --> 01:27:51,145
but tears…

1228
01:27:55,905 --> 01:27:58,624
also wake us up

1229
01:27:59,145 --> 01:28:01,824
to comfort our sad owner like Nut.

1230
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:13,385
I came to life

1231
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:15,624
because of Tatarn's memories.

1232
01:28:20,065 --> 01:28:21,505
Tatarn's love

1233
01:28:22,065 --> 01:28:23,824
and his ties with Nut

1234
01:28:24,704 --> 01:28:27,025
woke a teddy bear like me up.

1235
01:28:28,105 --> 01:28:29,945
Those gave me a conscience,

1236
01:28:30,025 --> 01:28:31,305
and let me think,

1237
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:33,345
move,

1238
01:28:33,905 --> 01:28:35,065
and communicate.

1239
01:28:42,265 --> 01:28:44,305
Tatarn may be unconscious,

1240
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,185
but his memories still thrive.

1241
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,385
That's why I'm alive.

1242
01:28:50,225 --> 01:28:52,185
More than being alive,

1243
01:28:52,704 --> 01:28:54,225
there's a miracle that occurred.

1244
01:28:54,864 --> 01:28:57,465
It's a miracle that turned a teddy bear
into a human.

1245
01:29:02,185 --> 01:29:03,824
When Dad gets back,

1246
01:29:04,985 --> 01:29:06,624
I'll tell him about us.

1247
01:29:07,145 --> 01:29:08,784
I have many good qualities.

1248
01:29:09,425 --> 01:29:11,025
Do I still have to prove them?

1249
01:29:16,465 --> 01:29:17,744
When I removed the pus,

1250
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:20,265
I found this splinter.

1251
01:29:23,585 --> 01:29:27,105
The doctor suspects that it was likely
from the assault weapon.

1252
01:29:27,185 --> 01:29:29,864
I reckon it's a vital piece of evidence

1253
01:29:29,945 --> 01:29:32,824
that will help us identify
who the perpetrator is.

1254
01:30:41,784 --> 01:30:46,784
