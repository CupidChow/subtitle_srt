1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:09,985
I think you like Nut, Tofu.

2
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:13,985
You didn't use your experience
as material, right?

3
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,505
If for you, normal means

4
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,025
only thinking the way you do,

5
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,865
then half the world would be abnormal.

6
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,865
If I remember who I am,

7
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,265
I have to leave.

8
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:25,064
I want to record my time with you,

9
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,064
so it can be my memory.

10
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:31,745
That plot of land and your house
should have gone to me,

11
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,904
not a brat like you who has never
contributed to the family business.

12
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,184
If you want it,

13
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,064
wait until I'm dead.

14
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,665
When will you understand

15
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:42,545
that going into someone's room
without permission

16
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,505
is an invasion of privacy?

17
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:46,105
If you're happy,

18
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:49,064
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

19
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,265
will come to you naturally.

20
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,344
Mister.

21
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:36,624
Song.

22
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:46,545
What's that smell?

23
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:48,545
Song.

24
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:49,624
Song.

25
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,224
Song.

26
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:55,665
Song.

27
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:00,464
Song.

28
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,025
Song!

29
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:09,265
Song.

30
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,464
Song, wake up.

31
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:12,585
Song.

32
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:13,705
Song.

33
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,265
Song, get up.

34
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:16,624
Get up.

35
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:22,505
What happened?

36
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,505
I can't…

37
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,345
Don't fall asleep.

38
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:37,584
You can't die on me.

39
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:38,865
Come on.

40
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,625
One, two…

41
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,144
Let's go.

42
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,865
You can't die on me, Song.

43
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,024
Come on.

44
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,625
Song.

45
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:59,545
Are you okay? Come on.

46
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:05,465
I need a stretcher.

47
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,985
-This person is hurt.
-This way.

48
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,264
Bring the stretcher.

49
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:10,024
-Come on.
-Let's go.

50
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,704
Gen.

51
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,065
What's happening?

52
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:15,704
Mom.

53
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,745
The guy who went inside is my friend.

54
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,345
Go park your car. It's blocking the way.

55
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,824
I'll take care of this end.

56
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,185
Dad.

57
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:38,945
Why are you here?

58
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,945
I'm here to pick your mom up.

59
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,704
Who's that?

60
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:50,185
Well…

61
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,824
He's an actor in Nut's series.

62
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,464
I found him

63
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:56,745
-in bad shape
-I see.

64
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,584
so I brought him here.

65
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:00,144
Were you on the set?

66
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,584
No.

67
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:07,505
Wait.

68
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:09,345
Where did you find him?

69
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:15,105
At his house.

70
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:16,785
I went

71
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:17,865
to talk to him.

72
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,584
-Oh, my…
-Oh, my…

73
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,665
-Our son went to a man's house.
-I know.

74
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:22,824
Mom.

75
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,665
It was necessary.

76
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,945
Why are you investigating me?

77
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,464
You seem to care about him,
but he's not your friend.

78
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:31,945
-That's why I asked.
-Yes.

79
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,425
I'm worried the series

80
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:37,745
will be affected.

81
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,665
If you're short of an actor,

82
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,305
it's a big deal, Dad.

83
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,945
Nut is fixing the drafts all by himself.

84
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,345
He's got enough on his plate.

85
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,105
I don't want to make it worse.

86
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,065
I see.

87
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,345
You worry about Nut.

88
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,385
Who else am I supposed to worry about?

89
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,945
-My goodness.
-Well…

90
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:57,985
Him, maybe.

91
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,305
He's fine. He has diarrhea, that's all.

92
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:03,024
We call it non-stop shitting.

93
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,345
He's a shitting dog.

94
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,625
So it's just

95
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:07,945
-diarrhea?
-Yes.

96
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,344
-It's diarrhea.
-He's a friend?

97
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:11,745
Gosh.

98
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,904
-Yes.
-I see.

99
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,065
A friend and a brother.

100
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:15,385
Is that so?

101
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,505
Are you all right?

102
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,305
Tell us.

103
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:21,584
I'm fine, Dad. I'm usually like this.

104
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:22,545
I see.

105
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,545
He's sweating.

106
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:27,904
Bring it on.

107
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,065
Catch me.

108
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,785
Bring it on.

109
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:37,625
Bring it on.

110
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:38,545
No.

111
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:47,945
I love you, mister.

112
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,024
Fuck.

113
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:06,784
I died.

114
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:15,904
I know you heard me.

115
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:23,505
What?

116
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:24,904
I was

117
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:25,985
playing a game.

118
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,465
You know what?

119
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:42,784
I'll call a nurse for you.

120
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:47,385
I love you, mister.

121
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:51,505
I love you, mister.

122
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:03,945
I love you, mister.

123
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,705
I love you, mister.

124
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:09,865
I love you, mister.

125
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:11,064
I love you, mister.

126
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,785
-I love you, mister.
-Stop.

127
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:16,705
A nurse

128
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:18,025
might hear you.

129
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,385
I love you, mister.

130
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:23,745
-I love you, mister.
-Stop.

131
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,705
I said, be quiet.

132
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:28,745
They might hear you.

133
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:30,825
Okay?

134
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,985
But I really love you.

135
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:51,944
Give me your hand.

136
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:54,985
My hand?

137
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:01,225
I don't want your phone.

138
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:04,424
I need support from you.

139
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,745
-Please.
-Just be quiet.

140
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:30,985
Kuenchai.

141
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,665
You came to play inside this room again.

142
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:36,865
Go away. Get out.

143
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,544
Gosh.

144
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,785
This dog.

145
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,345
All right.

146
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,105
-What?
-Do you love him?

147
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:03,064
-What?
-Do you?

148
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:04,465
-No.
-You love him, don't you?

149
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:05,665
No!

150
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,265
Sib.

151
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:12,665
Mrs. Na.

152
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:14,625
Are you okay?

153
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:17,905
I'm fine.

154
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,345
I accidentally dropped those.

155
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,785
Do you like history books?

156
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:42,304
Yes.

157
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,865
I used to teach social science.

158
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,625
That's why I have history books.

159
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,544
Is history fun?

160
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,064
Of course.

161
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,705
You study important events from the past

162
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:57,665
to understand the present

163
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,025
and use them to guide the future,

164
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,304
so history doesn't repeat itself.

165
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:06,865
In that case,

166
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,544
if we realize

167
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,064
that we are unhappy
because of our bitter past,

168
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,625
can we create new history?

169
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:20,225
So we might end up happy in the future.

170
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:31,225
She was suffering.

171
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:33,865
That's why she created a new world.

172
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,265
And Nut is suffering

173
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,345
because he locked the old world up.

174
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,905
He can't make use

175
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:49,265
of those old memories.

176
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,225
Well, the best way
to get over your old love

177
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,585
is to find a new one, right?

178
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:06,184
If you're happy,

179
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:09,225
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

180
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,184
will come to you naturally.

181
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,385
I gave you a ladder, but why don't you
have the courage to climb it?

182
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,064
Go back

183
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:22,064
and think about
what your problem is and fix it.

184
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:25,385
I don't want to see a wall
in front of you your whole life.

185
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,304
Humans are so complicated.

186
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,704
Humans are like that, Teddy.

187
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,265
You might become
more complicated yourself.

188
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,304
I'm going to help him.

189
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:53,745
Prib said

190
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:56,225
Nut can't write romantic scenes

191
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:58,824
because he has a bitter past.

192
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,785
I might not be able to change his past,

193
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,665
but I will help him get over it.

194
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,865
What are you doing in my room?

195
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,865
We need to talk.

196
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:20,265
Stop.

197
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:22,265
Let me get dressed.

198
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,105
I talked to your mom about history.

199
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,345
Why don't you create new history

200
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,465
if your past was bad?

201
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:39,905
What are you saying?

202
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,465
Let's create new history together, Nut.

203
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:58,025
I want to make you happy.

204
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,025
With good memories,

205
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,424
you will have stories to tell.

206
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:14,824
Look ahead,

207
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:16,745
look around you,

208
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,465
and open up your heart.

209
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,304
Wait.

210
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,544
Is your name Tofu?

211
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,544
I'll let you stay here.

212
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:50,704
Nut.

213
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,105
Nut.

214
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:58,505
Why are you being quiet?

215
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:11,905
All right then.

216
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:14,064
Let's try it.

217
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,464
But since it's your idea,

218
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,824
you must take responsibility.

219
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:24,905
Let's go on a date.

220
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:00,064
We are here.

221
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,065
CAN TOSS

222
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,105
Tofu.

223
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,105
Is this where you wanted to take me?

224
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,504
Yes.

225
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:14,545
Do you like it?

226
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:17,224
I do.

227
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:18,224
Let's go.

228
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,785
RING TOSS

229
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,385
Take that.

230
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,345
Nut.

231
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,145
Look.

232
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,465
It's switched off.

233
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:51,504
Tell me next time.

234
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:11,545
Drink some juice, Nut.

235
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:18,905
Nut.

236
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,825
Tofu.

237
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:22,945
This isn't juice. It's herbal liquor.

238
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,865
-It's juice.
-Oh, my god.

239
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,625
It's fermented juice.

240
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,945
Come take a look.

241
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,225
Welcome.

242
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,545
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

243
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,784
-She sells many types of juice.
-That's right.

244
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,585
I see Trembling Girl,

245
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:42,585
-Elephant Power…
-Trumpet.

246
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,145
And Tiger Power.

247
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,465
-I have everything.
-Tofu.

248
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:48,784
Welcome.

249
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,105
-Is this it?
-Yes.

250
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,264
-This is it.
-I've tried them all.

251
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,825
This is the best one.

252
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:54,744
Take your pick.

253
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,705
-Can I take this home?
-No.

254
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:58,705
-Tofu, stop. Put it down.
-Sure.

255
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,305
-I'll give you a special price.
-That's all right.

256
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:02,345
Put it down.

257
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,984
We also have a set.

258
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:06,145
A set?

259
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:08,185
Do you want some?

260
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:09,945
It's pickled fruit.

261
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,865
Please have a taste.

262
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:14,225
-It's good for your circulation.
-Tofu.

263
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,784
-Try it.
-How much have you had?

264
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:18,744
-Just ten shots.
-What?

265
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:25,545
Nut, can you bike in a straight line?

266
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:27,585
You are so drunk.

267
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,865
-I'm not drunk.
-Careful.

268
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,425
Not drunk, my ass.

269
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,345
I've been going in circles.

270
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:37,065
I don't want to go home yet.

271
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,665
You don't want to go home,

272
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,345
but I do.

273
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:42,545
Really?

274
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,024
Tofu.

275
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,264
-I can walk home.
-Oh, my god.

276
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:54,105
You're a weird drunk.

277
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,065
I'm not drunk.

278
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,105
I can walk ten more laps.

279
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:02,185
One.

280
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,665
Two.

281
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,305
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

282
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:10,264
Tofu.

283
00:20:11,784 --> 00:20:12,705
Are you okay?

284
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:14,744
Get on. We're going home.

285
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,385
You want to go home?

286
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,665
You asked me out.

287
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:25,264
Why did we have to come here?

288
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:26,744
How is it romantic?

289
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,065
I don't know.

290
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:32,465
I wanted to come.

291
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:34,625
Did you not want to come?

292
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,065
Do I look like I wanted to come?

293
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,984
Where should we go for our date?

294
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:57,465
The market is good enough for you.

295
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,065
Give me somewhere more meaningful.

296
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,305
Does anyone know

297
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:04,945
where Nut wants to go?

298
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:07,305
Yes, I know a place.

299
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:10,705
Nut wrote how he wanted to go there
and drew a picture of it long ago.

300
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,585
Where is it?

301
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:16,784
Follow me, Nut.

302
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:17,825
Where are you going?

303
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,024
Answer me first, Tofu.

304
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:23,105
Tofu.

305
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,024
What made you think I wanted to come?

306
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,744
Does it matter?

307
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,185
I just want you to be happy,

308
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,705
smile

309
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,425
and laugh like you did today.

310
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:47,705
You need to remember
this moment to write the script.

311
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:50,825
I like seeing you happy.

312
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,465
Tofu.

313
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,065
Let's find a place to hide.

314
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:11,825
Why?

315
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:13,465
I've never played in the rain.

316
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,784
Woo-hoo.

317
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:17,585
You've gone crazy.

318
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,225
Let's go or you'll get sick.

319
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,225
The rain is so cooling, Nut.

320
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,585
It's as cooling as a shower.

321
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:31,185
You will be dry later

322
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:33,225
when the rain stops.

323
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,504
Don't be scared.

324
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:36,905
Come.

325
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:08,945
Are you happy, Nut?

326
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:13,345
Woo-hoo!

327
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,945
I made coffee for you.

328
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,744
You haven't showered.

329
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:27,345
I'll help you.

330
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:44,945
Do you know

331
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,345
how things will end

332
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,425
if you're too good to me?

333
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,105
What did you say?

334
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:03,385
I said,

335
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:06,065
do you know how things will end

336
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:09,345
if you're too good?

337
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:19,825
I'm kidding.

338
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,225
Go away. I need to work.

339
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:26,865
Go.

340
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:31,705
Go take a shower.

341
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,264
What's wrong with me?

342
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:15,665
Is it because of Nut?

343
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,024
My heart is racing

344
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,544
and my face

345
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,024
feels hot.

346
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,984
It's hotter than usual.

347
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,304
Why is my body so hot?

348
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,385
My whole body feels hot.

349
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,225
But I'm happy.

350
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:49,905
Is this

351
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,105
what they call…

352
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:46,705
This is for you.

353
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:51,784
Tofu.

354
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:57,945
Tofu.

355
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:04,065
You are so gross.

356
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:06,304
Go take a shower.

357
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:09,744
Tofu.

358
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:15,625
Oh, my god.

359
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,465
You're burning up.

360
00:29:13,264 --> 00:29:14,784
It ends with me caring for you.

361
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,064
Look.

362
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:53,665
-You're mine.
-Wow.

363
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:56,625
-How was that?
-You're good, Nut.

364
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,544
Watch me.

365
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,145
Oh, no.

366
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:03,225
Nut.

367
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:04,465
You go first.

368
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,544
BALLOON POP

369
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:08,105
Watch me.

370
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:09,744
Yes.

371
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,825
-Oh, my god. Watch me.
-Oh, no. Nut.

372
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:15,544
Oh, what?

373
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:18,825
-Oh, god.
-Oh, god.

374
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:21,105
Come on.

375
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,064
I have to win.

376
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:25,425
So close, Tofu.

377
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:26,345
Go.

378
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,345
Tofu.

379
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,225
Let's go.

380
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,145
What the hell?

381
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:39,145
It's hard.

382
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:42,825
Tofu, throw it.

383
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,024
What's wrong?

384
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,705
If I throw this ring,

385
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:50,825
I won't have one for you.

386
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:53,385
How lame.

387
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:54,945
Nut.

388
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:57,705
If you want me to propose,
buy me more rings.

389
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:01,385
Nut.

390
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:04,345
Thank you.

391
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,264
Yours is bigger.

392
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,665
Do you like this place?

393
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:13,705
That's great. I'm happy
to take you to a better place.

394
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:17,064
You make it sound like I'm dead.

395
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,544
How do you know my likes and dislikes?

396
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,865
I always pay attention to you.

397
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:26,744
Let's take a selfie.

398
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,064
I want to capture our day together

399
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,264
to remember it by.

400
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:51,544
Nut, look.

401
00:31:58,824 --> 00:31:59,984
You can see the candy.

402
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:09,945
No.

403
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:12,264
That trick is getting old.

404
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:15,544
Tofu.

405
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,504
Where are you going?

406
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:18,945
I'm going behind the hut.

407
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:34,865
Thank you.

408
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:33,225
You're frying pork in the office?

409
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:36,264
I can do anything for love.

410
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:38,544
I worked on the recipe all night.

411
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,345
Juea approved it.

412
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,705
I hope he doesn't get cancer.

413
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,504
The pork is way too burnt

414
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:48,945
to eat.

415
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:51,024
Nut eats it like this.

416
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:55,705
Do you think he eats it

417
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,304
because it's burned?

418
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:00,425
It's about the person who makes it.

419
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,105
If he were to fall for you,

420
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:06,905
this pork wouldn't be the reason.

421
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:09,025
He would love you for you.

422
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:10,585
Do you understand?

423
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:14,665
Who made it for him?

424
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:18,264
Only his mom and Tofu live with him.

425
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:21,904
Do you think that person…

426
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:23,944
What?

427
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,944
Don't be sad. I'm here.

428
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,185
I knew you would come,

429
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:47,225
so I waited for you.

430
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,904
Thank you for watching me all night

431
00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:52,264
and taking me home.

432
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,585
I'm taking responsibility
for giving you diarrhea.

433
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,625
Did you tell your dad?

434
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,665
He's busy.

435
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:42,585
He'll just worry.

436
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:46,465
If he worries,

437
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,065
take good care of yourself.

438
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:51,745
My parent isn't a doctor like yours.

439
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,145
I don't take good care of myself.

440
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:01,825
I'm looking for someone
to take care of me.

441
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:06,225
I'm here, am I not?

442
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,505
What is it, mister?

443
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:12,745
I…

444
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:13,825
washed them for you.

445
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:20,585
Wait.

446
00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:22,145
Are you opening up to me?

447
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:24,825
Opening up?

448
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,265
What are you talking about?

449
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:28,985
I'm just afraid

450
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,225
the series will go under

451
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,545
if you die.

452
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,384
That's all.

453
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:38,505
I won't die easily

454
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:40,384
because

455
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,985
-I will stay alive to hug you.
-Hey.

456
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,705
Song, what are you doing?

457
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,665
Song.

458
00:36:46,265 --> 00:36:47,985
-I love you, mister.
-Song.

459
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:49,384
What's your problem?

460
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:50,345
-Oh my.
-Let me go.

461
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:52,265
-My god.
-What are you doing?

462
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:55,305
Dad. Mom.

463
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,464
Why are you here?

464
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,384
We came to visit him.

465
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:09,305
The doctor approved his discharge.

466
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:12,145
He must have gotten a great caretaker.

467
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,105
Mom.

468
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:17,625
Be careful of what you eat next time.

469
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,464
Yes.

470
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:22,345
-Thank you guys so much
-You're welcome.

471
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,705
-for taking care of me last night.
-Sure.

472
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,345
You look better in real life.

473
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,785
I was the one who accepted
your friend request.

474
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,345
He was playing hard to get.

475
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:35,185
Dad!

476
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:37,825
You're being way too loud.

477
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:39,625
People will think I've died.

478
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:40,944
What?

479
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,265
If you don't like yelling.

480
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:43,625
you should leave.

481
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:45,225
I'm going to drop him off

482
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,825
and go to work.

483
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:49,065
Go already.

484
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:50,625
Let's go.

485
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,985
Gosh, judging from what
you were doing on the bed,

486
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,864
he's definitely more than a friend.

487
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:00,864
Mom.

488
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:02,904
This kid gets on my nerves.

489
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:04,745
Be glad I'm your friend.

490
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:08,825
Not every kid is like that.

491
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:11,665
There are many good kids out there.

492
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:17,785
Come on.

493
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,105
-What?
-Let's go.

494
00:38:20,185 --> 00:38:21,185
Look at him.

495
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:24,944
Who did he get his stubbornness from?

496
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:27,065
You, I guess.

497
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:29,464
-Really? Not from you?
-No.

498
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:57,864
I'm sorry.

499
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,065
I didn't mean to wake you.

500
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:10,904
The thing is

501
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:13,025
you had a fever last night,

502
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,904
so I wiped your body down.

503
00:40:18,384 --> 00:40:19,505
You said you were cold

504
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:22,225
so I…

505
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:27,145
Thank you.

506
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,225
It got much warmer

507
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,185
with you next to me.

508
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:07,745
Having fever for the first time sucks.

509
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:12,625
But I got a lot better…

510
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,265
when you hugged me.

511
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:21,345
Human bodies work in a strange way.

512
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:00,424
You can go back to sleep.

513
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:02,384
I'll go check on your mom.

514
00:43:12,745 --> 00:43:13,665
Mrs. Na.

515
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:25,105
Here's your apple juice.

516
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:26,545
Thank you.

517
00:43:27,424 --> 00:43:28,545
I'm sorry.

518
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,585
I woke up late because I was sick.

519
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:32,705
I almost forgot your apple juice.

520
00:43:34,464 --> 00:43:35,424
That's it?

521
00:43:36,384 --> 00:43:37,585
I was worried.

522
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,705
It's my job to take care of her.

523
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:41,665
I need to do my best.

524
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:45,025
Are you going to work today?

525
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:47,065
I didn't have time to prepare anything.

526
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:48,225
Can you wait?

527
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:50,984
I'll help you get it ready in no time.

528
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:29,025
What brings you

529
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:30,625
all the way here?

530
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,864
I hear you talked to a doctor in Bangkok.

531
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:37,225
Are you sending Tarn there?

532
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:41,585
I've got connections.

533
00:44:45,345 --> 00:44:48,545
I'm aware that the chance
of Tarn waking up is slim to none.

534
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,185
But I want to do my best.

535
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,705
He doesn't deserve any of this.

536
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,745
It's too cruel.

537
00:44:58,225 --> 00:45:00,025
He's unfortunate.

538
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,105
I still stand by what I said.

539
00:45:03,185 --> 00:45:04,944
I agree with you

540
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:07,785
and I'm willing to cover
all of the expenses

541
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,665
if it will get us out of trouble.

542
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:14,225
Trouble?

543
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:19,745
We don't know who attacked your nephew

544
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:23,185
but people think it's TRD.

545
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:27,984
Investors are putting
their investments on hold

546
00:45:28,065 --> 00:45:29,424
because it's too risky.

547
00:45:29,505 --> 00:45:31,984
It's starting to upset the executives.

548
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:34,585
If this project is terminated,

549
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,424
you, the project manager,
might be in trouble.

550
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:46,625
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

551
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:48,625
But you chose to get involved.

552
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:51,665
Your wife too.

553
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,745
Or they wouldn't have
asked you to give a testimony.

554
00:45:58,105 --> 00:45:59,025
You know?

555
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:01,785
That's all I know.

556
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:06,065
I'm not going to meddle
in your family's business.

557
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:10,265
I hope you can put an end
to this problem soon

558
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:12,185
without affecting our work.

559
00:46:13,665 --> 00:46:15,345
If you can't,

560
00:46:15,904 --> 00:46:17,145
I'll have to step in.

561
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:44,424
I thought you went back.

562
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:48,625
Didn't you want me
to do my job as his aunt?

563
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,864
Here I am.

564
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:53,384
It looks like

565
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:55,665
you're worried about him more than I am.

566
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:58,185
You must be extremely afraid of him dying.

567
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:01,025
That's why you are here all day.

568
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:02,864
Why?

569
00:47:03,505 --> 00:47:04,464
Do you feel guilty?

570
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:07,185
Guilt about what?

571
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,464
Don't get upset.

572
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:11,944
I meant

573
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:13,785
you feel guilty…

574
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:17,705
for neglecting your nephew.

575
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:20,984
Someone almost beat him to death.

576
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,065
That's all.

577
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:28,265
Or are there other reasons

578
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,025
that make you feel guilty?

579
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,345
I have only one regret in my life.

580
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:40,984
It's marrying you.

581
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,145
Saen.

582
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:44,745
Don't worry about him.

583
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:46,864
As his uncle-in-law,

584
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:50,145
I won't let his attackers walk.

585
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:01,265
A wound from a blunt object,

586
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,105
3cm wide and 7cm long,

587
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:05,065
was found at the back of his neck.

588
00:48:05,825 --> 00:48:07,505
His X-ray shows

589
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:10,065
a fracture in the skull
and a cerebral hemorrhage.

590
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:12,864
He needs more than 21 days to recover.

591
00:48:16,345 --> 00:48:18,904
He was hit from the back.
No other wounds were found.

592
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:21,705
This means there's no sign of struggle.

593
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:23,745
Is it possible

594
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:27,105
that the attackers
lured him out of the car

595
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:28,904
and hit him with an object?

596
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:33,105
Sir.

597
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,745
Sir.

598
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:46,545
Since he's smart enough to lead a protest,

599
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,864
he must be quite a thorough person.

600
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:52,424
Maybe someone lured him outside,

601
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,585
so he took the car.

602
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,464
Once he arrived,

603
00:48:55,545 --> 00:48:57,984
he carelessly got out of the car.

604
00:48:58,065 --> 00:48:59,705
According to Saen,

605
00:48:59,785 --> 00:49:02,025
he has evidence proving
it was an accident.

606
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:06,185
A security camera

607
00:49:06,265 --> 00:49:07,944
in Tatarn's neighborhood

608
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:11,864
recorded his car driving past at 7:06 p.m.

609
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:14,825
One minute later, Saen's car drove past

610
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:16,825
in the same direction.

611
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:19,545
Fifteen minutes later,

612
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,545
Tatarn's car was spotted
near Sarapee Temple

613
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,864
with Saen's car not far behind.

614
00:49:25,944 --> 00:49:28,145
Then, his car hit a motorcycle

615
00:49:28,225 --> 00:49:30,345
that was riding
on the wrong side of the road.

616
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:33,864
Looking at the time,

617
00:49:34,345 --> 00:49:37,384
there's no way Saen got there
in time to attack Tatarn.

618
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:40,185
Could Sajjaree

619
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,185
be behind it?

620
00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:44,825
Is that you, Tarn?

621
00:49:44,904 --> 00:49:46,265
Can we meet?

622
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:47,705
I need to talk to you.

623
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,505
Sajjaree

624
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,984
may have lured her nephew out
to the meeting spot.

625
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:54,984
Then she flew back to Bangkok right away

626
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:56,625
to avoid suspicion.

627
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:57,665
Yes.

628
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,424
As for Tatarn's car,

629
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:01,825
a security camera in Chiang Mai

630
00:50:01,904 --> 00:50:04,065
caught it on the road
along the railway track.

631
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,065
I've asked the officers
both in Lamphun and Lampang

632
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:10,864
to check the route Tatarn took
before the attack.

633
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:12,785
No one has found anything.

634
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:16,705
Why did he take the longer route
to get to Lampang?

635
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,384
It's like he avoided the cameras.

636
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:21,864
I agree.

637
00:50:21,944 --> 00:50:23,305
Something isn't right.

638
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:40,785
Set it up around the house.

639
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:08,145
The hard disk
of the security cameras is missing.

640
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:11,225
Search the house.

641
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:12,904
Yes, sir.

642
00:51:42,984 --> 00:51:44,345
-All done.
-Thank you.

643
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:47,145
Excuse me.

644
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:54,424
I thought you went back.

645
00:51:58,825 --> 00:51:59,864
Why do you care?

646
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:02,345
Who did you meet with?

647
00:52:03,025 --> 00:52:04,665
I saw you talking to a man.

648
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:07,305
Who?

649
00:52:07,384 --> 00:52:08,785
There are lots of men.

650
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:10,504
Which one do you mean?

651
00:52:13,984 --> 00:52:15,665
Are you jealous?

652
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,265
Don't worry.

653
00:52:17,745 --> 00:52:19,745
Even though you don't care about me,

654
00:52:19,825 --> 00:52:21,625
I would never cheat, unlike you.

655
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:23,585
If you don't want me to cheat,

656
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:25,984
then agree to the divorce,

657
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:28,944
so I can date her
without going behind your back.

658
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:45,745
-What? You drugged her?
-What? You drugged her?

659
00:52:49,384 --> 00:52:50,864
I had to.

660
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:53,504
Or she would have thrown
her medicine away again.

661
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:56,265
Why didn't you tell Nut the truth?

662
00:52:56,345 --> 00:52:59,745
He'll get mad
if he finds out about it later.

663
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:02,904
He might even kick you out, who knows.

664
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:06,464
I don't want Nut to fight with his mom.

665
00:53:06,545 --> 00:53:08,265
He's already stressed with work.

666
00:53:08,345 --> 00:53:12,065
What Tofu is doing might be good
for both Nut and his mom.

667
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:13,305
That's true.

668
00:53:13,384 --> 00:53:14,944
Saying only what is necessary

669
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,904
is better than making things worse.

670
00:53:17,984 --> 00:53:19,545
You are doing the right thing.

671
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,825
I won't hide it for long.

672
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,504
Once his mom gets better,

673
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:26,305
I'll tell everyone the truth.

674
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,864
Kuenchai.

675
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,065
Have you seen my book?

676
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:39,904
Did you take it again?

677
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,025
"The Little Prince."

678
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:00,065
They say,

679
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:03,904
older people perceive
The Little Prince differently

680
00:54:03,984 --> 00:54:05,904
than children.

681
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:08,864
You should read it again.

682
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:12,625
You might understand
and perceive it differently this time.

683
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,145
Dad.

684
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,785
-No.
-Be careful!

685
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:56,705
Saen.

686
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:00,384
Na.

687
00:55:10,585 --> 00:55:12,265
It's really you, Saen.

688
00:55:43,305 --> 00:55:44,384
Mrs. Na.

689
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:45,944
Mrs. Na.

690
00:55:49,464 --> 00:55:51,025
Mrs. Na!

691
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:53,065
No.

692
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:06,025
Let's move.

693
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:09,025
What's going on?

694
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:11,225
-What?
-Are you hurt anywhere?

695
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:15,904
How careless of you.
Do you have a death wish?

696
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:16,825
Jan.

697
00:56:16,904 --> 00:56:18,504
It's…

698
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:19,745
-Well…
-Saen.

699
00:56:20,345 --> 00:56:23,105
Do you see other men
as your husband again?

700
00:56:23,185 --> 00:56:25,345
-When will you stop being crazy?
-Jan.

701
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,864
Saen is my husband.

702
00:56:26,944 --> 00:56:28,424
-Can you hear me? Mine.
-Jan.

703
00:56:28,504 --> 00:56:30,625
-He's mine.
-Stop or I'll call the police.

704
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:31,825
-Get off her.
-Stay out.

705
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,585
Make sure she takes her medicine.

706
00:56:35,665 --> 00:56:37,424
She shouldn't talk to anyone's man.

707
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:38,825
Weren't you the one

708
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:40,265
who left Saen for Sib?

709
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:41,625
What a lunatic.

710
00:56:41,705 --> 00:56:42,745
Gosh.

711
00:56:42,825 --> 00:56:44,185
-Move.
-My goodness.

712
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:45,265
What the…

713
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:46,504
My goodness.

714
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:50,625
Let's go inside.

715
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:51,545
Okay.

716
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:56,504
-Gosh.
-What?

717
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:57,785
I feel sorry for Na.

718
00:56:58,585 --> 00:56:59,984
And what is Jan's problem?

719
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:02,825
She has been with Saen for 20 years.

720
00:57:02,904 --> 00:57:04,825
But she still can't let it go.

721
00:57:04,904 --> 00:57:07,225
She knows Na is sick.

722
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:08,665
What does she want from Na?

723
00:57:08,745 --> 00:57:10,864
Listen to me.

724
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,625
You shouldn't judge people.

725
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:14,864
All right?

726
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:16,504
People have

727
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:18,785
different limitations.

728
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:20,265
We are not her.

729
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,504
We don't know

730
00:57:22,585 --> 00:57:24,984
what she has been through.

731
00:57:25,464 --> 00:57:26,424
Do you understand?

732
00:57:27,984 --> 00:57:30,625
People who seem weak

733
00:57:30,705 --> 00:57:33,464
might have a really strong heart.

734
00:57:34,864 --> 00:57:37,185
And people who seem strong

735
00:57:37,265 --> 00:57:41,185
might have wept more tears
than we could imagine.

736
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,145
Keep an eye on him

737
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,345
and keep me updated.

738
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:45,185
Weren't you the one who left Saen for Sib?

739
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:48,625
Na.

740
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:51,984
Yes, Grandma.

741
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,345
I…

742
00:58:56,944 --> 00:59:00,904
I don't know how much time I have left.

743
00:59:02,145 --> 00:59:05,305
I'm worried about you.

744
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,265
You are a woman.

745
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:12,225
You need

746
00:59:13,265 --> 00:59:15,745
a husband

747
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:19,825
to take care of you.

748
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:24,585
Trust me.

749
00:59:31,504 --> 00:59:33,585
You won't have to anymore.

750
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:36,145
I'm returning this to you.

751
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:40,185
See? Do you see what Sib does for you?

752
00:59:40,265 --> 00:59:43,065
He's a man who's nice and consistent.

753
00:59:43,145 --> 00:59:45,024
What are you waiting for?

754
00:59:45,105 --> 00:59:48,625
A good man doesn't come by easily, Na.

755
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:00,424
Mrs. Na.

756
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:04,185
It's apple juice.

757
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:17,785
Is it a headache?

758
01:00:23,225 --> 01:00:24,585
I'm just a bit confused.

759
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:29,545
Is it about what Jan said?

760
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:36,384
That and…

761
01:00:41,424 --> 01:00:42,545
what I saw.

762
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:47,585
The guy who looks like Mr. Saen?

763
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:05,145
It's okay.

764
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:08,424
When you remember it,

765
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:10,984
you can talk to me.

766
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:35,944
You should rest.

767
01:02:02,944 --> 01:02:04,705
There's still a lot

768
01:02:04,785 --> 01:02:07,265
I don't know

769
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:08,345
about what happened

770
01:02:08,944 --> 01:02:11,265
between Mrs. Na, Mr. Saen,
Mr. Sibmeun, and Jan.

771
01:02:11,984 --> 01:02:13,464
It's still bothering her.

772
01:02:14,585 --> 01:02:17,225
It's the reason
she's refusing to get treated.

773
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:20,024
I hope

774
01:02:20,585 --> 01:02:21,785
what I'm doing

775
01:02:22,745 --> 01:02:24,424
will help her

776
01:02:24,504 --> 01:02:25,745
get over it one day.

777
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:27,785
Mrs. Na and Nut

778
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:29,864
will finally be happy.

779
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:47,864
Come in.

780
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:50,105
Nut, take a seat.

781
01:03:02,504 --> 01:03:05,225
Nut, you've managed
to climb over the wall.

782
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,305
Congratulations.

783
01:03:09,545 --> 01:03:10,825
Thank you so much, Juea.

784
01:03:11,545 --> 01:03:12,944
I don't regret

785
01:03:13,024 --> 01:03:14,625
giving you the ladder.

786
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:20,785
Or is it possible

787
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:22,825
that you are in love?

788
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:49,585
Song said I had to have a Facebook first

789
01:03:49,665 --> 01:03:51,625
before I can add you as my boyfriend.

790
01:03:57,464 --> 01:04:00,305
HE LOOKS CONFUSED AND SO ADORABLE

791
01:04:00,384 --> 01:04:03,384
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE

792
01:04:06,145 --> 01:04:07,785
I want to record my time with you,

793
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,024
so it can be my memory.

794
01:04:13,384 --> 01:04:14,864
You even have a photo of a dog.

795
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:27,185
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT IT

796
01:04:27,265 --> 01:04:29,944
BUT I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY

797
01:04:30,024 --> 01:04:33,185
PLEASE ACCEPT MY BOYFRIEND REQUEST,
I MEAN, FRIEND REQUEST

798
01:04:33,944 --> 01:04:35,265
You try too hard.

799
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:40,464
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT IT

800
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:43,785
BUT I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY

801
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:46,464
PLEASE ACCEPT MY BOYFRIEND REQUEST,

802
01:04:46,544 --> 01:04:49,345
I MEAN, FRIEND REQUEST

803
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:17,825
PEERANUT HAS ACCEPTED
YOUR FRIEND REQUEST

804
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:20,145
Nut accepted my boyfriend…

805
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:22,464
I mean, friend request.

806
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:25,424
Kuenchai, Nut has accepted
my friend request.

807
01:05:33,585 --> 01:05:37,265
HE LOOKS CONFUSED AND SO ADORABLE
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE

808
01:05:50,464 --> 01:05:51,424
Holy shit.

809
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:54,864
Has Prib seen this?

810
01:06:04,345 --> 01:06:06,384
Excuse me, where's Prib?

811
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:08,745
I don't know, but I saw her leave.

812
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:24,105
PRIB, WHERE ARE YOU? HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

813
01:06:57,345 --> 01:06:59,225
Are you dead?

814
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:01,305
No.

815
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,345
Almost though.

816
01:07:02,825 --> 01:07:05,145
You rubbing it in will do the job.

817
01:07:05,705 --> 01:07:07,705
I saw it when Nut posted it.

818
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:10,625
Nut accepted Tofu's friend request,

819
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:12,665
but not mine.

820
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,904
You should make peace with it.

821
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:17,424
Really?

822
01:07:17,504 --> 01:07:20,745
Stop it. Do you still
consider me as a friend?

823
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:21,825
Seriously.

824
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:24,105
I'm being honest with you

825
01:07:24,185 --> 01:07:25,305
because you're a friend.

826
01:07:25,864 --> 01:07:27,464
Stop running from the truth.

827
01:07:27,944 --> 01:07:29,705
I'm not running.

828
01:07:30,225 --> 01:07:32,225
Really? Where are you then?

829
01:07:33,305 --> 01:07:34,225
Did you go drinking?

830
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:36,065
No, I didn't.

831
01:07:36,145 --> 01:07:37,585
I'm getting my stuff together.

832
01:07:38,904 --> 01:07:40,944
Getting your stuff together? Where?

833
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:43,305
Somewhere far away.

834
01:07:43,384 --> 01:07:44,705
But don't worry.

835
01:07:44,785 --> 01:07:46,384
I'll be back in two days.

836
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:49,464
I'm going to take back what's mine.

837
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:51,065
Two days? Are you…

838
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:56,185
Are you becoming a nun or a witch?

839
01:08:35,384 --> 01:08:37,624
MY BELOVED BROTHER

840
01:08:55,704 --> 01:08:57,345
I came as promised.

841
01:08:58,704 --> 01:08:59,624
Do you remember?

842
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,424
We promised each other

843
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:09,825
that we would meet up this day every year.

844
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:17,305
We can't be lovers.

845
01:09:18,985 --> 01:09:20,544
But you can be my sister.

846
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:28,225
Fine.

847
01:09:29,985 --> 01:09:32,185
I'll be your sister.

848
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,225
But you have to promise

849
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:38,905
that you won't forget me.

850
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:42,065
You are

851
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,345
one of a kind.

852
01:09:43,905 --> 01:09:44,865
I won't forget you.

853
01:09:48,265 --> 01:09:49,424
Is that a compliment?

854
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,225
Yes.

855
01:09:53,664 --> 01:09:54,624
How about this?

856
01:09:55,105 --> 01:09:56,945
You must make it up to me

857
01:09:57,465 --> 01:09:59,465
by celebrating the day we met

858
01:10:00,025 --> 01:10:02,385
and our bond.

859
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:05,505
Promise me

860
01:10:06,065 --> 01:10:08,825
that we will meet every year

861
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:10,985
and you will buy me a meal.

862
01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:14,865
I promise.

863
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:19,664
I will buy you a meal every year.

864
01:10:19,744 --> 01:10:20,624
Okay?

865
01:10:22,025 --> 01:10:24,025
Let's take a picture
as proof of our promise.

866
01:10:37,825 --> 01:10:40,345
Don't keep me waiting for too long.

867
01:10:42,825 --> 01:10:45,425
Wake up and buy me a meal already.

868
01:10:50,385 --> 01:10:53,305
I think I'm about to be heartbroken again.

869
01:10:57,704 --> 01:11:00,664
Please wake up. I need your support.

870
01:11:17,465 --> 01:11:19,825
I came to visit Tarn.

871
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:22,265
It has been a month.

872
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:24,664
Are there any signs of recovery?

873
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,025
His condition has been stable.

874
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,345
Why don't you take Tarn to Bangkok?

875
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:35,704
My friend's mother is a doctor.

876
01:11:35,784 --> 01:11:36,945
I can talk to her.

877
01:11:37,545 --> 01:11:39,505
I already talked with a doctor.

878
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:41,225
He said the same thing.

879
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:46,744
Someone said,

880
01:11:47,425 --> 01:11:50,145
with enough moral support
from their loved ones,

881
01:11:50,704 --> 01:11:53,505
comatose patients

882
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:55,265
might get better.

883
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:58,704
But Tarn has no one.

884
01:11:58,784 --> 01:12:00,865
You are his only visitor.

885
01:12:02,105 --> 01:12:05,105
We can't do anything,
except wait for a miracle.

886
01:12:12,065 --> 01:12:14,065
Why hasn't Nut uploaded other photos

887
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:17,545
besides the one from the fair?

888
01:12:19,345 --> 01:12:20,265
Come here.

889
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:24,225
Nut said

890
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:27,265
Facebook is a diary full of memories.

891
01:12:28,825 --> 01:12:31,025
How come his diary is empty?

892
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:33,985
That's because some memories are kept

893
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:35,345
deep inside the heart.

894
01:12:36,425 --> 01:12:38,905
There's no need to archive them.

895
01:12:38,985 --> 01:12:39,865
You know?

896
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:45,545
You can never erase them from your heart.

897
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:46,545
Do you understand?

898
01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:48,425
Thank you.

899
01:12:49,025 --> 01:12:50,865
We went to the market.

900
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:53,744
We bought snacks for you and Na.

901
01:12:54,225 --> 01:12:55,145
-Thank you.
-Sure.

902
01:12:57,865 --> 01:13:00,545
-Yes.
-Which are harder to erase,

903
01:13:01,265 --> 01:13:02,585
good memories

904
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:04,784
or bad memories?

905
01:13:04,865 --> 01:13:06,985
Well…

906
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:09,664
-Nhong, tell him what you think.
-Yes.

907
01:13:10,225 --> 01:13:11,545
-I think
-Tell him.

908
01:13:11,624 --> 01:13:13,865
-Go ahead.
-bad memories stay in your heart

909
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:18,105
-Yes.
-longer than good memories.

910
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,265
Yes, that's right.

911
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:21,825
Do you understand?

912
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,025
Do you really like him?

913
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:49,065
What are you talking about?

914
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:51,265
I told you to find someone new,

915
01:13:52,265 --> 01:13:53,505
so you went out with Tofu.

916
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,744
Are you a couple?

917
01:13:58,385 --> 01:13:59,824
What's with you?

918
01:14:00,664 --> 01:14:01,784
Listen.

919
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:03,465
We've only been on one date.

920
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:05,704
Do I look that easy to you?

921
01:14:06,385 --> 01:14:07,225
Is that so?

922
01:14:07,305 --> 01:14:09,985
I can tell from Mars that you are happy.

923
01:14:12,425 --> 01:14:13,305
Look.

924
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:15,945
You've never been like this before.

925
01:14:22,345 --> 01:14:23,585
If you like him,

926
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:26,545
go for it.

927
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:27,664
You're a grown-up now.

928
01:14:28,145 --> 01:14:30,385
You don't need to listen
to anyone anymore.

929
01:14:33,824 --> 01:14:35,385
But he's a stranger.

930
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:37,784
He will leave one day.

931
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:41,545
That day isn't today.

932
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:43,065
Why worry about it now?

933
01:14:44,265 --> 01:14:45,704
If you want to be happy

934
01:14:45,784 --> 01:14:47,664
and Tofu makes you happy,

935
01:14:48,185 --> 01:14:49,065
why wait?

936
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:52,185
Someone might take him first.

937
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:16,624
Which one?

938
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:20,305
I don't know.

939
01:15:20,824 --> 01:15:21,985
What?

940
01:15:24,905 --> 01:15:27,545
Nut was looking
at this photo at the shoot.

941
01:15:28,105 --> 01:15:31,065
I thought maybe
he was thinking of an old friend.

942
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:35,025
Why do you want to know about this person?

943
01:15:37,465 --> 01:15:38,345
Well…

944
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:40,945
I want to help Nut with his work.

945
01:15:42,624 --> 01:15:45,225
I hear Nut is inspired by his own past.

946
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:48,664
If he meets an old friend

947
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:49,865
he misses,

948
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:53,025
he might have fun stories to tell.

949
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:57,265
You care a lot

950
01:15:57,784 --> 01:15:58,905
about Nut.

951
01:16:00,704 --> 01:16:02,465
He's my special someone.

952
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:04,905
Without him,

953
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:07,744
I wouldn't be here.

954
01:16:10,905 --> 01:16:12,345
If I were Nut,

955
01:16:12,425 --> 01:16:14,025
my ears would turn red.

956
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,025
Why?

957
01:16:19,664 --> 01:16:21,865
You're confessing your love.

958
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:28,545
Love?

959
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:30,225
Yes.

960
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:34,265
Nut is always your priority.

961
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:36,545
Nut was even the first person

962
01:16:37,065 --> 01:16:38,784
you added on Facebook.

963
01:16:39,624 --> 01:16:41,545
I'm the second, right?

964
01:16:42,624 --> 01:16:43,744
Right?

965
01:16:47,824 --> 01:16:48,784
Oh, my god.

966
01:16:49,505 --> 01:16:50,624
You are blushing.

967
01:16:51,265 --> 01:16:52,664
Your cheeks are red.

968
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:54,385
Look.

969
01:16:54,465 --> 01:16:56,185
Both cheeks are red.

970
01:16:57,824 --> 01:16:59,185
Look.

971
01:17:02,945 --> 01:17:04,385
Does Nut make you shy?

972
01:17:06,305 --> 01:17:08,345
Tell me the truth.

973
01:17:14,744 --> 01:17:15,664
You're back.

974
01:17:17,505 --> 01:17:18,744
I came back a while ago.

975
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,145
Are you deaf and blind?

976
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:26,265
Why are you here?

977
01:17:26,345 --> 01:17:28,704
I came to invite Tofu over for dinner.

978
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,865
My dad asked me to bring food.

979
01:17:32,664 --> 01:17:34,385
After that,

980
01:17:34,465 --> 01:17:36,865
Tofu can sleep over at my place.

981
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:38,465
I bought a new game.

982
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:39,865
Let's play it together.

983
01:17:40,985 --> 01:17:42,784
Sure, I want to play it.

984
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:44,505
Really?

985
01:17:46,465 --> 01:17:47,824
I was going to invite you

986
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:50,585
to watch a short film
produced by my senior.

987
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:54,704
Do you prefer games?

988
01:17:58,545 --> 01:18:00,025
You have to choose

989
01:18:00,105 --> 01:18:01,265
who you want to go with.

990
01:18:20,465 --> 01:18:22,225
You chose a short film over a game.

991
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,025
I chose you over Song.

992
01:18:28,865 --> 01:18:30,305
Nut.

993
01:18:31,025 --> 01:18:31,985
Joi, hello.

994
01:18:32,585 --> 01:18:34,784
Hello, how's it going? Long time no see.

995
01:18:34,865 --> 01:18:36,145
I'm good.

996
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:38,225
-I would never miss
-Welcome.

997
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:39,465
your event.

998
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:40,985
Thank you so much.

999
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:42,704
I ran into Juea.

1000
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,385
He said you were working on a series.

1001
01:18:45,465 --> 01:18:46,425
That's right.

1002
01:18:46,505 --> 01:18:47,545
I'm sorry.

1003
01:18:47,624 --> 01:18:49,385
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Thank you.

1004
01:18:49,465 --> 01:18:51,465
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Thank you.

1005
01:18:52,704 --> 01:18:54,185
Let's watch the film.

1006
01:19:14,905 --> 01:19:15,865
Why are you smiling?

1007
01:19:18,624 --> 01:19:20,624
I'm glad to see you happy.

1008
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:26,704
You must love your job.

1009
01:19:27,865 --> 01:19:29,545
You've been smiling nonstop.

1010
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,105
My job is what

1011
01:19:33,664 --> 01:19:34,784
I'm most proud of

1012
01:19:35,305 --> 01:19:36,945
in my life.

1013
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:40,585
When I work,

1014
01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:43,505
it feels like I can be myself.

1015
01:19:44,425 --> 01:19:45,664
I can think and do anything

1016
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:47,145
I want to do.

1017
01:19:49,545 --> 01:19:51,185
Your hard work

1018
01:19:51,824 --> 01:19:53,985
will make the new series very successful.

1019
01:19:56,185 --> 01:19:57,465
You are behind

1020
01:19:59,345 --> 01:20:00,425
the success too.

1021
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:04,185
You were right.

1022
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:06,465
I wanted to do it.

1023
01:20:07,585 --> 01:20:09,985
I want to tell the world
about many things in my life.

1024
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:13,025
I don't know why I was afraid.

1025
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,065
Thanks to you,

1026
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:18,465
I got through a hard scene.

1027
01:20:21,545 --> 01:20:22,824
Thank you.

1028
01:20:24,905 --> 01:20:25,824
Thank you so much.

1029
01:20:32,145 --> 01:20:33,345
Nut.

1030
01:20:33,425 --> 01:20:34,624
You're here.

1031
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:35,945
Hurry.

1032
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:37,305
Bow. Joy.

1033
01:20:37,905 --> 01:20:38,905
Tofu, scoot over.

1034
01:20:38,985 --> 01:20:39,865
What?

1035
01:20:39,945 --> 01:20:41,185
Scoot over quickly.

1036
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:42,345
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

1037
01:20:42,425 --> 01:20:43,784
Gosh.

1038
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:44,905
-Juea.
-Yes.

1039
01:20:44,985 --> 01:20:47,985
-You came too?
-Joi, my junior, directed this film.

1040
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:50,345
He's a great director.

1041
01:20:50,425 --> 01:20:51,305
You know?

1042
01:20:52,385 --> 01:20:53,425
All right.

1043
01:20:54,265 --> 01:20:55,145
Just wait.

1044
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,025
I was there during the first edit.

1045
01:20:57,105 --> 01:20:59,905
It was amazing.
He put a love scene at the start.

1046
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:01,465
It's starting.

1047
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:24,345
What's happening?

1048
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:28,265
What the hell?

1049
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,425
Joi, what happened?
Why did you cut out the love scene?

1050
01:21:33,985 --> 01:21:35,225
It was great.

1051
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:37,624
You ruined the whole film.

1052
01:21:37,704 --> 01:21:38,744
You know?

1053
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:40,585
Gosh.

1054
01:21:47,704 --> 01:21:48,905
-Nut.
-Tofu.

1055
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:53,225
I…

1056
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:00,385
I'm going to the toilet.

1057
01:22:01,065 --> 01:22:01,945
Okay.

1058
01:22:02,025 --> 01:22:03,945
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

1059
01:22:04,025 --> 01:22:05,025
Do you understand?

1060
01:22:05,105 --> 01:22:06,025
Yes.

1061
01:22:06,105 --> 01:22:07,305
I'll be right back.

1062
01:22:17,025 --> 01:22:20,425
Why does my heart keep racing today?

1063
01:22:21,744 --> 01:22:22,865
During the film,

1064
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,865
I couldn't focus
because I was looking at Nut.

1065
01:22:27,545 --> 01:22:28,784
What's happening to me?

1066
01:22:29,265 --> 01:22:31,824
You're confessing your love.

1067
01:22:33,905 --> 01:22:35,345
Is it possible

1068
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:38,624
that I really love Nut?

1069
01:22:46,945 --> 01:22:48,505
If you want to be happy

1070
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:50,744
and Tofu makes you happy,

1071
01:22:50,824 --> 01:22:51,704
why wait?

1072
01:23:08,425 --> 01:23:09,345
Excuse me.

1073
01:23:14,065 --> 01:23:14,985
Me?

1074
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:16,145
Yes.

1075
01:23:17,624 --> 01:23:18,985
I think you're cute.

1076
01:23:20,624 --> 01:23:21,824
Can we take a selfie?

1077
01:23:32,664 --> 01:23:35,185
Can I have your contact info?
I'll send you the photo.

1078
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:36,545
Tofu!

1079
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,744
We're going home.

1080
01:23:46,185 --> 01:23:47,225
Nut.

1081
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:35,105
Nut.

1082
01:24:45,385 --> 01:24:46,465
How did it go?

1083
01:24:46,545 --> 01:24:48,865
-How was the film?
-It was good, Mom.

1084
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:14,664
Nut.

1085
01:25:20,545 --> 01:25:21,945
Nut, why are you mad at me?

1086
01:25:28,345 --> 01:25:30,065
You said you would wait by the toilet.

1087
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:31,905
Where did you go?

1088
01:25:32,945 --> 01:25:34,784
Well, while I was waiting for you,

1089
01:25:36,385 --> 01:25:37,624
he asked to take a selfie.

1090
01:25:37,704 --> 01:25:38,585
That's all.

1091
01:25:41,664 --> 01:25:43,225
You went with him just like that?

1092
01:25:44,225 --> 01:25:45,624
You should have told me.

1093
01:25:47,065 --> 01:25:48,704
I thought you got lost.

1094
01:25:51,265 --> 01:25:52,905
There's no need to be upset.

1095
01:25:52,985 --> 01:25:54,465
I wasn't just worried about you.

1096
01:25:54,545 --> 01:25:55,704
I was jealous.

1097
01:26:04,945 --> 01:26:06,265
Forget what I said.

1098
01:26:07,425 --> 01:26:08,664
I'm your boss.

1099
01:26:09,905 --> 01:26:10,784
I'm talking crazy.

1100
01:26:14,185 --> 01:26:15,585
But that was before.

1101
01:26:21,185 --> 01:26:23,025
Things are different now.

1102
01:26:28,865 --> 01:26:31,025
I don't know what these feelings are.

1103
01:26:33,265 --> 01:26:35,265
But I want you to be more than my boss.

1104
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:40,145
I want to be by your side…

1105
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:44,624
hold your hand…

1106
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:48,065
and hug you.

1107
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:53,744
That's all?

1108
01:27:46,664 --> 01:27:47,624
I'm sorry.

1109
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,945
You're such a kid.

1110
01:28:51,465 --> 01:28:52,585
Why are you crying?

1111
01:28:55,585 --> 01:28:56,704
Your lips…

1112
01:28:59,185 --> 01:29:00,784
are sweet and soft like jelly.

1113
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:06,945
I'm afraid…

1114
01:29:07,704 --> 01:29:08,624
What did you say?

1115
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:15,305
I said,

1116
01:29:16,025 --> 01:29:17,225
your lips

1117
01:29:18,864 --> 01:29:20,784
are sweet and soft like jelly.

1118
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:22,864
Why do you sound like…

1119
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:27,105
Who the hell are you?

1120
01:29:29,025 --> 01:29:30,465
Why are you doing this?

1121
01:29:31,025 --> 01:29:32,345
What do you want from me?

1122
01:29:35,065 --> 01:29:36,145
What did I do?

1123
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,305
What you said just now…

1124
01:29:41,664 --> 01:29:43,824
Why did you say that after I kissed you?

1125
01:29:47,664 --> 01:29:49,145
It's how I felt.

1126
01:29:52,265 --> 01:29:53,545
I don't believe you.

1127
01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:56,265
Who sent you here?

1128
01:29:56,905 --> 01:29:57,945
Tell me.

1129
01:29:59,025 --> 01:29:59,985
Tell me now.

1130
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:14,305
This is Nut. His first name is Peeranut.
He's 27 years old.

1131
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:16,185
His mom is Matana. His dog is Kuenchai.

1132
01:30:16,265 --> 01:30:17,105
Tofu!

1133
01:30:17,784 --> 01:30:19,465
That's plenty of information.

1134
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:21,784
You say you don't know him.

1135
01:30:21,864 --> 01:30:24,545
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

1136
01:30:26,305 --> 01:30:28,425
I never thought you would be such a liar.

1137
01:30:28,505 --> 01:30:30,225
Excuse me.

1138
01:30:31,545 --> 01:30:32,585
You seem lonely,

1139
01:30:32,664 --> 01:30:34,305
like you have no friends to talk to.

1140
01:30:35,065 --> 01:30:38,385
Right. Nut told me you live alone.

1141
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:40,425
Your husband doesn't visit.

1142
01:30:42,065 --> 01:30:43,065
Is the room okay?

1143
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:44,185
Yes.

1144
01:30:44,265 --> 01:30:46,025
I was Nut's teddy bear.

1145
01:30:46,824 --> 01:30:48,905
Why did I become your look-alike?

1146
01:30:52,025 --> 01:30:53,585
What are you doing, Dad?

1147
01:31:51,025 --> 01:31:56,025
