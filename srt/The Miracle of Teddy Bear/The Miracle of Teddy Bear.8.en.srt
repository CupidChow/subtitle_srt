1
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:10,945
I never thought you would be such a liar.

2
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,335
Can I believe anything you've said?

3
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,425
If you can't answer it,

4
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,985
why bother thinking about
impossible questions like that?

5
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,585
You should think about the question
that you can answer.

6
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,705
Do you still want Tofu in your life?

7
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:27,265
I promised Nut

8
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,385
that I would take care of her.

9
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,145
Even if he's still mad at me,

10
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,745
I need to keep my promise.

11
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,305
True love.

12
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,225
…Even though my identity

13
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,745
might not seem so trustworthy.

14
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,265
But everything I've done for you

15
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,025
has always been sincere.

16
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,665
Kuenchai.

17
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:04,305
Hey.

18
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,425
Good morning.

19
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,335
I'm back.

20
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:23,145
Is it really you, Tofu?

21
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,425
You won't leave again, will you?

22
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:30,895
Stay here from now on.

23
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:39,545
If Nut still wants me,

24
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,335
I won't go anywhere.

25
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,055
Fine.

26
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,025
I won't send you away.

27
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,545
You might as well stay forever.

28
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:51,775
Are you serious?

29
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,025
Yes.

30
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,335
I'm leaving, Mom.

31
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:57,215
Okay.

32
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,665
Nut.

33
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:20,815
Nut.

34
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,345
You forgot your lunchbox.

35
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:39,905
Thank you.

36
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,465
Enjoy the food.

37
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,305
Were you in Chiang Mai or the forest?

38
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,105
How do you not know anything?

39
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:05,385
You lost out.

40
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,695
I was occupied with Tarn.

41
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:10,905
Then I saw it on Facebook,

42
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,985
Tofu's post saying he missed Nut.

43
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,425
Gen.

44
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,905
Are Nut and Tofu…

45
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,945
Prib, look over there.

46
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,065
It's written all over his face.

47
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,455
You said that when you come back,
you would claim what's yours.

48
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,305
It's too late. Give it up.

49
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:44,665
Did I make a mistake stepping away?

50
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:52,015
Nut, come here.

51
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,305
I knew it.

52
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,505
-What is it?
-All smiles, aren't you?

53
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:56,815
That's right. So what?

54
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,695
The other day you were so upset.

55
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,905
But today, you're smiling like a lunatic.

56
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,225
If I were to guess,

57
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:06,985
I would say

58
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,015
you've settled things with Tofu.

59
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:12,305
Yes. We talked.

60
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:14,305
You sorted it all out?

61
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,105
Yes.

62
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,505
You picked him up from Song's.

63
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:22,505
How did you know I had picked him up?

64
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:28,505
Now, it's my turn. What about you?

65
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,425
You two chat often, right?

66
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,815
Not really.

67
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:34,865
Just every night?

68
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:40,455
Hold on. I'm not done with my questions.

69
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,385
Don't try to change the subject.

70
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:43,865
You're a sly fox.

71
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,895
Hey Nut. Come back here.

72
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:49,135
We were talking about you. Come back.

73
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,625
How is everyone?

74
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:32,575
I missed everyone a lot.

75
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:37,335
You leave home only one night, Beary.

76
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:38,695
Don't overdo it.

77
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:42,455
Missing your dual-language complaints
for just one day

78
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,305
made me feel lonely.

79
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:49,545
Don't be sarcastic.

80
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,455
Be nice, everyone. Tofu just got back.

81
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:54,305
But my Little One has disappeared.

82
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,745
It's all your fault.

83
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:59,255
Now, you have the nerve
to behave like this.

84
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,185
You're just like
all the other humans in this country.

85
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,505
Sweeping problems under the rug.

86
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:07,945
Wow. You're angry about your girl,
but you can still preach your politics.

87
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:10,425
I really respect you.

88
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:15,385
Items like you, that represent
middle-class wealth,

89
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:19,065
surely have no idea
that ideology is driven by anger.

90
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:24,225
I'm sick of listening to you droning on
about the class gap or whatever.

91
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:26,455
Instead of mocking me,

92
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,815
why don't you use the time
to educate yourself?

93
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:31,305
This house is just a bubble.

94
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,625
You're so used to being oppressed

95
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:36,745
that you're afraid of asking questions
or voicing your views.

96
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,385
All you do is act fierce

97
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:42,105
and mix Thai and English words
to hide your fear.

98
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,055
Everyone, please calm down.

99
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,535
It's my fault.

100
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:51,905
I apologize.

101
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,825
I promise you

102
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:58,175
that I'll bring back Ms. Left Slipper.

103
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:59,945
Your promise means nothing.

104
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:03,345
It's in your upper-class blood
to use people then discard them.

105
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:06,295
What more do you want?
Tofu is trying his best.

106
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:07,905
You knew it was an accident.

107
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:11,105
Your girl volunteered,
meaning that she willingly took the risk.

108
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,825
You can't keep blaming him

109
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:15,935
and ordering him around
like you do with her.

110
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,865
When have I ever made her do anything?

111
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,625
She likes watching dramas,

112
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,985
but you force her
to watch documentaries with you.

113
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:24,265
Have you ever asked her if she wants to?

114
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,105
You claim you want democracy.

115
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,985
What kind of democracy
won't accept different opinions.

116
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:31,465
The patriarchy.

117
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,705
A societal system dominated by males.

118
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:41,385
Prib?

119
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:58,345
You made Nut fried pork for lunch, right?

120
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,415
Yes. I made it myself.

121
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:04,865
I knew it.

122
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:08,625
Normally, Nut doesn't eat
from his lunchbox.

123
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:12,785
If you didn't make it,
who else could it be?

124
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,865
Can I ask you one more time?

125
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:23,385
Do you like Nut?

126
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:27,145
I like him.

127
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:30,265
I want him to be
more than just a boyfriend.

128
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,175
I want him as my owner.

129
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:35,265
I want him as my boss.

130
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,985
I want him as my family.

131
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,055
As my everything.

132
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,295
That's enough.

133
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,175
I get it.

134
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,865
Can I ask you one more question?

135
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:56,025
Do you know what Nut wants
for his birthday?

136
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:04,265
I once read Mrs. Na's book,
The Little Prince.

137
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:06,905
I remember this one section

138
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:09,865
where the fox tells Little Prince

139
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,985
that every Thursday,

140
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:15,345
the hunters have a dance ritual
with the village girls,

141
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:19,055
which allows the fox
to take a stroll in the vineyard.

142
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,785
Thursday

143
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,265
is thus a special day.

144
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,585
If the hunters could dance on any day,

145
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,665
Thursday will not hold
any special meaning.

146
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,815
I understand now

147
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:35,385
why humans value special days.

148
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:38,265
Since there's no certainty in this world,

149
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,105
relationships may change any day.

150
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,585
On our special day,

151
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:44,705
we deserve happiness

152
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,105
to make it more special than other days,

153
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:48,385
don't you think?

154
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,865
You hired someone to follow me.

155
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,815
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you mean.

156
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,905
Don't act all innocent.

157
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,415
That guy Chut confessed to me.

158
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,385
You've had him follow me
since we separated.

159
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:58,385
Are you a psychopath?

160
00:12:58,465 --> 00:12:59,695
Why are you doing this?

161
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,665
Because I am your wife.

162
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:03,865
The wife you don't live with

163
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:05,295
and never share anything with.

164
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,695
If I didn't have someone follow you,
how would I know what's going on?

165
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:10,025
I'm no psychopath.

166
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:12,345
I'm doing this because I care about you.

167
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:14,055
You care about me?

168
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:16,345
You only care about yourself.

169
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,815
You're afraid of losing face,
and being humiliated.

170
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,905
You were afraid I was going to see Na.

171
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,625
So afraid that you bought a house
next to hers.

172
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:28,385
Even though I keep insisting
that Na and I are over,

173
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,175
you can't help but be paranoid.

174
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:33,535
How can it be over
when she's the only one you've ever loved?

175
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,665
When we married,
you were in love with her.

176
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:39,505
When you were with me,
you thought about her.

177
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,345
When you weren't with me,
you went to see her.

178
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:44,815
I'm no psychopath.

179
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,265
I'm doing all this

180
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,385
because I love you.

181
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:51,295
Do you hear me? I love you!

182
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,865
But I don't love you.

183
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,815
I married you
because your father pressured me,

184
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:03,905
and you were the only woman
I was close to.

185
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:07,745
If I had known
everything was just a scheme,

186
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,055
if I had been more assertive
with you back then,

187
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:12,935
I wouldn't have been stuck
with a woman I don't love.

188
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,985
I know that you don't love me.

189
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,575
You want to go back to her.

190
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:23,345
I won't let you.
I won't agree to a divorce.

191
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:26,505
If I can't be happy, then no one will be.

192
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,505
Where are you going? What are you doing?

193
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,055
Let go of me. Let go.

194
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,935
Let go!

195
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:45,055
How many times have I told you
not to jump up at the table?

196
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,415
Do you not understand?

197
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:52,865
Have I already given you food?

198
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:56,575
Na!

199
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,665
What's the matter?

200
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:01,985
Look at this!

201
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:03,385
Look!

202
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:16,105
Look at it.

203
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:18,385
Look at it.

204
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,935
Look at it and get it into your thick head

205
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:24,575
that the guy you think is your husband
is actually my husband.

206
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,295
Do you hear me? He is my husband!

207
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,695
-Jan!
-Look!

208
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:28,985
-You!
-Jan!

209
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,745
Take a look! These are our wedding photos.

210
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,665
Saen is my husband!

211
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:35,535
Sibmeun was yours,

212
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,665
and he's dead!

213
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:39,415
He left a dysfunctional family.

214
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,865
The mother is crazy and the son is gay!

215
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:43,345
Mrs. Na.

216
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:46,935
You act like a victim
who was driven to madness.

217
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:51,145
You used your suffering
to make people feel sorry for you

218
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:53,145
when you made the wrong choice yourself.

219
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:54,625
You agreed to marry him!

220
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,695
You were the one who left Saen!

221
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,625
Did you hear that? You left Saen!

222
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:00,985
Did you hear that?

223
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:02,225
In the end,

224
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,295
the one who everyone thought was an angel
only cares about herself.

225
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:11,695
You chose stability over the person
who was devoted to you!

226
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:14,385
You're just as selfish as me!

227
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:16,025
Let go of me!

228
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,105
Let go.

229
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,905
Get off her.

230
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:21,745
Stop fooling yourself!
It's time you accepted the truth!

231
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,145
Do you hear me? Stop fooling yourself!

232
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,625
He is my husband!

233
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,665
He is my husband! Do you hear me?

234
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,415
-Na.
-Do you?

235
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,175
I want to know

236
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:31,065
why you and Mom didn't get married.

237
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:37,625
I should…

238
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,975
You probably know

239
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:56,975
that your mom and I were once in love.

240
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:02,865
However, our relationship changed
after Jan came along.

241
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,975
You want a loan from my father?

242
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,495
Yes.

243
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:12,625
Na's grandmother is seriously ill.

244
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,015
Her treatment is expensive.

245
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,105
I would like to help her.

246
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,785
I envy Na.

247
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:24,905
She is really lucky to have a guy
who loves her so much.

248
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,735
Seeing as you've helped me so much,

249
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,825
I'll talk to my father for you.

250
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,495
Really?

251
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:36,225
Thank you so much.

252
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:37,305
No problem.

253
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,705
I know that you need money.

254
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,065
But this is a lot.

255
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,865
It's not a problem.

256
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:12,465
Please accept it.
I sincerely want to help.

257
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:20,735
Here.

258
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:23,945
Thank you.

259
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:48,015
Try turning it on.

260
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:24,305
At first, Jan was just my boss,
my colleague.

261
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:26,825
Once I owed her money,

262
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,385
things started to get worse.

263
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,385
I'm not coming back to Bangkok
this weekend.

264
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,545
Again?

265
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:37,255
But it's my birthday this Saturday.

266
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:39,305
Saen?

267
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,705
Saen?

268
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,345
Did you get cut off?

269
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:02,105
Saen is in a meeting.

270
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:04,145
Do you have a message for him?

271
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,735
Please let it be about work only, though,

272
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,865
because he's working right now.

273
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,145
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:12,625
I'll call again later.

275
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:31,385
Kwan said she might be late

276
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:33,545
and that we should go ahead and order.

277
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,385
Why didn't you tell me?
We didn't have to come so early.

278
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,345
It's no big deal.

279
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:41,975
Since we had to go out anyway,
we should get something to eat.

280
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,225
Why don't you order?

281
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:46,345
This dish is really delicious.

282
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:48,625
What would you like?

283
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:56,975
Here are their recommended dishes.

284
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:13,465
Isn't that Na and Sib?

285
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:15,625
They seem close.

286
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,665
I guess it's not that surprising though.

287
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,145
He's your twin brother.

288
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:26,905
He probably just helps in taking care
of his busy brother's girlfriend.

289
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:28,905
How nice of him.

290
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:37,495
Your mom and I

291
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:39,225
almost got married.

292
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:42,705
Here's what I owe you.

293
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,015
This is the first installment.

294
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:49,975
I'll pay you back

295
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,225
all the money you loaned me.

296
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,305
But I wanted you to have this money.

297
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:56,775
I don't want it back.

298
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,585
But I must repay you.

299
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:05,065
Thank you…

300
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,705
for the trouble you went to.

301
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:12,705
You must be sick of helping me.

302
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:16,775
You won't have to anymore.

303
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:22,775
I'm returning this to you.

304
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,145
What do you mean?

305
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:35,585
It's Sibmeun, isn't it?

306
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:40,255
It has nothing to do with him.

307
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,255
I made this decision on my own.

308
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:49,345
The other night,
Grandma's condition got worse.

309
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:54,465
Sibmeun promised her
he would take care of me.

310
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:58,105
And I think it makes sense.

311
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:02,255
We're getting married,
so Grandma won't have to worry.

312
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:13,735
Here he is.

313
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:18,865
Please excuse me.

314
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:20,465
Bye.

315
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:35,705
I wasn't going to give in that easily.

316
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:39,305
I asked your mom for another chance.

317
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,385
Jan.

318
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:55,465
Hey.

319
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,065
-Are you okay?
-Ouch.

320
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:06,735
Let's go to the hospital.

321
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:11,185
However, fate wasn't on my side.

322
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,705
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

323
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,865
Three years after their wedding,

324
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,015
I married Jan.

325
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:41,975
It was the worst decision I ever made.

326
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,345
Are you all right?

327
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,535
I don't understand my mom.

328
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,145
Why did she make that decision?

329
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,425
I think there must be more to the story.

330
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:53,665
Everyone has their own reasons.

331
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:55,825
If one could choose,

332
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:58,705
no one would choose heartache.

333
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:03,865
In fact,

334
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:07,015
when your mom
got admitted to the hospital,

335
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,345
there was more to it.

336
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:17,945
I saw that she has been dumping the pills.

337
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,865
So I…

338
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:26,185
started mixing the pills with apple juice
and gave it to her.

339
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,465
I think her memory was getting better.

340
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:36,665
Then Jan tried to make her remember.

341
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,295
As she started to remember,

342
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:41,625
she must have struggled with it

343
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:44,825
and ended up this way.

344
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,625
I'm sorry.

345
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:52,145
If you're angry with me, you can hit me.

346
00:27:53,945 --> 00:27:54,975
I don't mind.

347
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:06,825
How could I hit you?

348
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:10,735
You did it

349
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:14,015
because you want the best for me

350
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,345
and my mother.

351
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,255
Thank you

352
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:27,015
for staying by my side through all this.

353
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,225
I'm glad to have you.

354
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:35,905
Likewise. I'm glad…

355
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,665
to be here for you.

356
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:19,945
Get home safely.

357
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:21,825
Make sure to lock up

358
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:23,905
and feed Kuenchai.

359
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:26,225
I will.

360
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,945
Didn't I once say there's nothing good
about being human?

361
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,705
I'm taking back what I said.

362
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,705
Being someone who can hug Nut

363
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:48,295
and hold his hand

364
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,905
is amazing.

365
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:27,825
I'm sorry I put the medicine
in your drink.

366
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,425
The meds must have affected you.

367
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:33,945
But I only did it

368
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:36,625
because I want you to get better.

369
00:30:38,735 --> 00:30:41,295
I want you to be happy.

370
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:49,705
I'm the one

371
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:52,775
who should apologize
for making everyone worry.

372
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,425
What you said is right.

373
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:01,775
The path to happiness
might start with a nightmare.

374
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,225
But we have to wake up eventually.

375
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:09,015
We might miss a person who's far away,

376
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:15,825
but we shouldn't overlook
the people close to us.

377
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:21,705
In the past,

378
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,295
I kept avoiding reality.

379
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:30,495
I was selfish.

380
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,385
Until yesterday.

381
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:42,705
I came to realize

382
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,905
that my family's happiness
is more important than anything else.

383
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:54,625
Bad memories might cause suffering,

384
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,055
but they make us realize
we are still alive.

385
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:04,975
And I want to keep on living.

386
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:10,225
I think

387
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:14,495
it's time I wake up from the nightmare

388
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,865
for the people I love.

389
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:39,905
I've already settled the bill, Mom.

390
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:42,345
Let's go home.

391
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,225
There's somewhere I want to go.

392
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,015
Can you take me there?

393
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:40,255
Don't worry about your mom.

394
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:47,465
She's strong enough to face the truth now.

395
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:51,345
It might be difficult and intimidating,

396
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,905
but now is the time.

397
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:16,935
If Na has to keep waiting,

398
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:20,305
when will she ever find happiness?

399
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:44,825
Hello.

400
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,265
It's me, Saen.

401
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:51,545
I'll pick you up at your house.
The usual time.

402
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,185
Okay. See you then.

403
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:32,265
I bet he's not coming.

404
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:34,985
He never keeps his word.

405
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:37,745
He might be tied up at work.

406
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:40,545
Work or something else?

407
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:51,935
You don't know, do you?

408
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:56,625
The money Saen gave you
for your grandmother's treatment

409
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:59,025
was a loan from that woman named Jan.

410
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,545
What did you say?

411
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,855
He took out a loan without asking you.

412
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:08,825
You could see it as
an act of love and protection.

413
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:11,225
But if you think about it,

414
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:14,185
how close must they be

415
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,305
for that woman to loan Saen so much money?

416
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,785
It's not too late for you
to change your mind.

417
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:27,985
There's someone who loves you
just as much as Saen.

418
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:33,065
Sib has always been there for you.

419
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:36,665
His career is stable
and has a clear path forward.

420
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:42,825
When he gets old and retires,
he'll receive government pension.

421
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:48,505
If you marry Sib, you won't regret it.

422
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:56,415
Don't worry about me.

423
00:37:58,855 --> 00:38:01,265
I promise I'll take good care of myself.

424
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,895
Na,

425
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,705
you are a woman.

426
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:14,345
You will have to get married one day.

427
00:38:14,935 --> 00:38:17,705
That way your life will be fulfilled.

428
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,375
You shouldn't be alone.

429
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:26,225
Who would help protect you then?

430
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:28,745
People

431
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,185
will talk about you behind your back

432
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:38,025
saying you couldn't find a good man
to be your husband.

433
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:43,785
I want to see you happy.

434
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:52,065
Love someone who loves you.

435
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,705
Trust me.

436
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:29,895
Thank you…

437
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:33,895
for the trouble you went to.

438
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:36,825
You paid my mortgage

439
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:39,025
and my grandmother's medical bills.

440
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,505
You must be sick of helping me.

441
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:46,185
You won't have to anymore.

442
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,585
I'm returning this to you.

443
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:16,665
I'm doing all this because I love you.

444
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:19,375
Do you hear me? I love you!

445
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,415
I married you
because your father pressured me,

446
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:26,505
and you were the only woman
I was close to.

447
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,345
If I had known
everything was just a scheme,

448
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,665
if I had been more assertive
with you back then,

449
00:40:32,745 --> 00:40:35,665
I wouldn't have been stuck
with a woman I don't love.

450
00:40:58,185 --> 00:40:59,455
Thank you.

451
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:03,985
I never thought that you would miss
an important appointment for me.

452
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:06,705
You knew?

453
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,985
Yes, I knew.

454
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:12,065
That's why I did this.

455
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:13,745
Jan.

456
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:16,665
Na and Sib are happy now.

457
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:19,625
You should accept
that you can't make her happy.

458
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:23,745
You put yourself in this predicament.

459
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:28,025
Sib actually knows you very well.
I guess it's a twin thing.

460
00:41:28,935 --> 00:41:30,185
Since when?

461
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,705
How long have you and Sib been scheming?

462
00:41:32,785 --> 00:41:35,895
It doesn't matter how long.
It would always lead to this anyway.

463
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,185
Why are you doing this?

464
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:43,345
I merely presented the opportunity.
You took it yourself.

465
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:46,585
You were prepared to take on debt
just to beat your brother.

466
00:41:46,665 --> 00:41:49,505
You gave Sib the chance
of winning Na's heart.

467
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:54,025
You must have thought
that what you did would win her heart.

468
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:55,545
But you didn't realize

469
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,305
you can't buy love like that.

470
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:05,375
What you said is right.

471
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:09,065
Your money can't buy my love either.

472
00:42:55,545 --> 00:43:01,025
I might not be a big shot
who can take out a big loan for you,

473
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:06,545
but as a soldier, I have a stable career
that will ensure a comfortable life.

474
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:10,705
I love you, Na.

475
00:43:12,305 --> 00:43:14,225
You won't regret it.

476
00:43:16,705 --> 00:43:19,745
Give me a chance to take care of you
for the rest of your life.

477
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:48,855
Here we go.

478
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:50,505
You're ready.

479
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:53,375
There.

480
00:44:58,975 --> 00:44:59,975
Done.

481
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:02,895
Hello, boy.

482
00:45:05,855 --> 00:45:09,025
Come here.

483
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:11,505
Quiet.

484
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:21,975
Did you think you could run away?

485
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:23,265
Don't.

486
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:25,375
Please.

487
00:45:29,545 --> 00:45:31,745
Nut! Open up!

488
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:33,185
Open up!

489
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:35,745
Nut, open up!

490
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:37,585
How dare you raise your voice at me.

491
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,825
How dare you raise your voice
at your own dad.

492
00:45:39,895 --> 00:45:41,065
Nut!

493
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:43,895
A little pervert like you
will never achieve anything.

494
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:28,825
It's my fault.

495
00:46:30,785 --> 00:46:32,455
If I wasn't indecisive,

496
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:35,825
if I had been firm

497
00:46:36,825 --> 00:46:38,705
and not easily swayed by others,

498
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:44,265
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

499
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:48,625
If I had thought it through,

500
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:51,745
things would have turned out better.

501
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:18,745
Be careful.

502
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:33,825
Mrs. Na.

503
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:39,935
Nut.

504
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:41,705
Nut.

505
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,415
Are you okay?

506
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:48,975
I'm just tired.

507
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:59,065
Your mom is regaining her memory.

508
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:01,855
Things will get better soon.

509
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:09,455
What will get better?

510
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:15,585
I think your mom must have loved your dad,

511
00:48:15,665 --> 00:48:17,745
or she wouldn't have chosen to marry him.

512
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,705
When he died,

513
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:23,305
it must have been a huge blow.

514
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:26,665
If he were still alive,

515
00:48:27,225 --> 00:48:29,305
I'm sure she would be happier.

516
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:31,785
You know nothing.

517
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,225
If that's what upset her,

518
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:36,785
why is it Uncle Saen that she misses?

519
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:38,975
She should miss Dad.

520
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:45,745
Nut.

521
00:48:46,935 --> 00:48:49,065
She chose the path

522
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:51,345
that everyone thought was right.

523
00:48:53,185 --> 00:48:54,785
Maybe it was just the safest.

524
00:48:57,825 --> 00:48:59,105
Mom chose Dad

525
00:49:00,265 --> 00:49:02,225
as a substitute for Uncle Saen.

526
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,025
She didn't really love him.

527
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,305
I'm just a product of their mistake.

528
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:04,625
Love should make people happy.

529
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:09,345
Why, then, is everyone so sad?

530
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:13,415
Whichever path you choose,

531
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,415
someone would always be disappointed.

532
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:20,975
If disappointment is inevitable,

533
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,705
why do humans seek love?

534
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:29,935
You still don't know humans that well.

535
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:33,305
You've learned about humans
based on theory

536
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,895
and from your experience here.

537
00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:37,065
There's still much more you need to learn

538
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:40,415
about humans and love.

539
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:45,625
Love between humans is complicated,
just like humans themselves.

540
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,665
Humans are even more complicated.

541
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,265
It's not just about love.

542
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:53,785
There are other things
you might not even think of.

543
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:56,345
Some people appear pitiful,

544
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:58,265
but they are really terrifying.

545
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:00,345
Some people might seem decent,

546
00:51:00,415 --> 00:51:03,895
but they may not necessarily be
good people.

547
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:00,585
Aren't you going to help at all?

548
00:52:01,145 --> 00:52:02,415
Why should I help?

549
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,975
You don't need help
pouring alcohol down your throat.

550
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:07,185
If you just came to lecture me, get lost.

551
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:08,415
Leave.

552
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:16,265
I want to know about the guy
you hired to follow me.

553
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,625
He has been following me for a while.

554
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:24,025
You know what happened that day, right?

555
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,455
Are you admitting you went there that day?

556
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,825
You wanted to get rid of him,
just like I did.

557
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:56,495
We're in the same boat here.

558
00:53:02,105 --> 00:53:04,375
Do you still plan to abandon me?

559
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:07,745
Stay out of this.

560
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:09,895
Also, tell your guy to stop following me.

561
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,785
You wanted to get rid of him,
just like I did.

562
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,785
Please, Tarn. I don't want anything
to happen to you.

563
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:32,745
Are you threatening me?

564
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:34,185
I'm just trying to warn you.

565
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,495
Stop trying.

566
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:38,265
I won't back down.

567
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:39,855
What do you hope to gain?

568
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,855
You know full well
that you don't have enough influence.

569
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:45,105
It's not going to bring about any change.

570
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:47,145
Things might not change today,

571
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,855
but they will in the future.

572
00:53:49,345 --> 00:53:51,495
Time is on our side.

573
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:54,705
We have time to win, to fight, to lose.

574
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:57,455
Winning might take time,

575
00:53:57,545 --> 00:53:59,105
but that day will come.

576
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:01,825
But power is on their side.

577
00:54:01,895 --> 00:54:03,975
We have to get that power on our side.

578
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,305
The people should have the power,

579
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,975
so that problems can be solved.

580
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:13,185
Am I supposed to give up
and be a coward like you?

581
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:16,855
Should I give in to power,
abandon my principles,

582
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:19,415
and behave immorally like you?

583
00:54:19,495 --> 00:54:21,455
-I can't do it.
-Tarn!

584
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:04,225
What is it, Lieutenant?

585
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:08,145
I searched the house
and the surrounding area.

586
00:55:08,665 --> 00:55:10,745
I didn't find any weapons.

587
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,545
We checked the car again,

588
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,265
but we didn't find
the perpetrator's blood or fingerprints.

589
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:18,585
This means

590
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:21,745
that we have no other suspects.

591
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:26,225
All the evidence we have
points to Saen as the perpetrator.

592
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:28,935
The wife

593
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,145
might have hired someone to use
Tarn's grandfather as a diversion.

594
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:00,935
It's my fault.

595
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:03,225
If I wasn't indecisive,

596
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:05,545
if I had been firm

597
00:56:06,105 --> 00:56:07,745
and not easily swayed by others,

598
00:56:11,545 --> 00:56:13,415
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

599
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:17,185
If I had thought it through,

600
00:56:18,705 --> 00:56:20,625
things would have turned out better.

601
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:25,895
Mom chose Dad because she saw him
as a substitute for Uncle Saen.

602
00:56:27,105 --> 00:56:28,585
She didn't really love him.

603
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:32,665
I'm just a product of their mistake.

604
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,375
Nut.

605
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:47,265
Yes?

606
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:51,225
What?

607
00:56:52,495 --> 00:56:53,495
Why did you come in?

608
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,495
I brought you coffee.

609
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:05,935
Did you get your phone fixed?

610
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:09,105
I did.

611
00:57:16,825 --> 00:57:17,895
What's on your mind?

612
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,105
I'm working.

613
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:25,895
Working or daydreaming?
You were in a trance.

614
00:57:26,745 --> 00:57:28,265
My brain is not working.

615
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:31,665
Shall I give you a massage?

616
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:33,225
It might help.

617
00:57:37,785 --> 00:57:40,345
What does a massage have to do with this?

618
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:42,855
I can't focus with you massaging me.

619
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:49,585
Let me help you.

620
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:16,185
Focus, Nut.

621
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:24,785
When you're so close,

622
00:58:25,665 --> 00:58:27,225
I can't focus.

623
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,545
I'm sorry.

624
00:58:33,745 --> 00:58:35,305
I'll go then.

625
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:42,585
If you go, I'll still be stuck.

626
00:58:44,015 --> 00:58:45,585
What should I do then?

627
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:50,185
You made me lose my focus.

628
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,375
You must take responsibility.

629
00:58:56,545 --> 00:58:57,625
No problem.

630
00:58:59,065 --> 00:59:00,415
I know what to do.

631
00:59:13,895 --> 00:59:15,545
-Hurry up.
-But why?

632
00:59:16,065 --> 00:59:17,625
Is this taking responsibility?

633
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:20,855
They say running is good for dogs.

634
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:22,585
But I'm not a dog.

635
00:59:22,665 --> 00:59:23,705
-Come on.
-Damn it.

636
00:59:24,305 --> 00:59:25,825
Humans are the same.

637
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:26,825
All you do is work.

638
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:29,145
How can you have energy
if you sit inside all day?

639
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:32,935
I guarantee running a few laps
will kick your brain into gear.

640
00:59:33,495 --> 00:59:35,375
I am busy.

641
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:37,745
But…

642
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:39,705
you're getting fat.

643
00:59:40,975 --> 00:59:42,345
Your butt is big.

644
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:44,305
Your thighs are big.

645
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,585
You're getting a belly.

646
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:49,225
Come on. Don't complain.

647
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:55,105
Give me a sec.

648
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:56,855
See?

649
00:59:57,705 --> 00:59:58,855
You're busy now.

650
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:03,345
I'm busy, Song.

651
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:05,305
I'm tending to Nut's heart at the moment.

652
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:07,185
Is it that serious?

653
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:09,975
If you're busy, you're busy.
Speak to you later.

654
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:13,545
Who's busy, son?

655
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,785
Dad.

656
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,265
Do I really have to run?

657
01:00:22,345 --> 01:00:23,825
Two laps will be fine.

658
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:25,065
I'll do one.

659
01:00:25,545 --> 01:00:26,785
How about three and a half?

660
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:31,065
Come on.

661
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:35,105
Hurry up, Nut.

662
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:37,705
-I'm already tired.
-We are only just starting.

663
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,345
I'm catching up.

664
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:46,895
Hurry up, Nut.

665
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,745
How come you're so fit?

666
01:00:51,265 --> 01:00:54,305
That's obvious. Since I turned human,
I've been running regularly.

667
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:55,455
What?

668
01:00:56,145 --> 01:00:57,305
What I meant to say was,

669
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,785
since we got to know each other.

670
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:02,705
Don't you remember we had a chase
the first time we met?

671
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,495
Did you bring me out to reminisce?

672
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:07,745
I'm giving you a second shot.

673
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:09,665
I wonder if you'll lose again today?

674
01:01:09,745 --> 01:01:11,745
I won't lose to you today.

675
01:01:17,705 --> 01:01:21,105
I'm sorry, Song. I really am busy.

676
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:24,265
It's important to look after
your loved ones' hearts.

677
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:27,145
Right now,

678
01:01:27,825 --> 01:01:30,625
I think Nut is in desperate need
of someone to look after him.

679
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:31,975
Kuenchai.

680
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:34,745
What are you training for?

681
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:37,145
Next week,
we're shooting a basketball scene.

682
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:39,895
That's why I called Tofu
to practice with me, but he's busy.

683
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:41,145
Speaking of Tofu,

684
01:01:41,225 --> 01:01:43,265
we barely had a chance to talk

685
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:44,785
before Nut came to pick him up.

686
01:01:44,855 --> 01:01:45,855
It's a shame.

687
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:50,185
He had to go home, Dad.

688
01:01:50,265 --> 01:01:52,345
Why, do you miss him?

689
01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:53,935
What?

690
01:01:54,415 --> 01:01:57,785
Between Tofu and me, who do you miss more?

691
01:01:57,855 --> 01:02:00,015
You, of course.

692
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:03,785
What's up?
You're acting like a neglected puppy.

693
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:09,265
I don't know. You just seem
more interested in other people's lives.

694
01:02:09,345 --> 01:02:12,545
What part of your life
don't I take an interest in?

695
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:14,415
There's a lot.

696
01:02:14,495 --> 01:02:16,545
You don't remember the food I like.

697
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:19,105
You don't even remember my birthday.

698
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:21,935
I wasn't the one who gave birth to you.

699
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,455
But you always remember Neung's birthday.

700
01:02:32,745 --> 01:02:35,935
Even after he passed away,
you still remember.

701
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,935
Thanks for offering to train with me, Dad,

702
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:47,265
but I forgot I arranged to meet a friend.

703
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:48,895
I better get going.

704
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:19,895
What's wrong with you?

705
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:21,935
When I called, you sounded upset.

706
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:24,265
Did you trick me into watching you play?

707
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:29,625
You're quick. Not bad.

708
01:03:38,825 --> 01:03:40,855
I didn't ask you to come just to watch.

709
01:03:40,935 --> 01:03:42,705
Will you help me with my lines?

710
01:03:43,265 --> 01:03:44,375
What lines?

711
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:49,015
A proposal.

712
01:03:50,105 --> 01:03:52,745
I have to play basketball

713
01:03:53,305 --> 01:03:55,105
and pour my heart out at the same time.

714
01:03:56,625 --> 01:04:00,305
What about this? If I score,
you agree to be my boyfriend?

715
01:04:12,345 --> 01:04:13,495
I'm not playing.

716
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,935
Don't fool me. I've read the script.

717
01:04:17,015 --> 01:04:18,225
There's no such scene.

718
01:04:21,935 --> 01:04:25,065
What about this, if you can't score,
you have to be my boyfriend?

719
01:04:28,225 --> 01:04:30,745
Fine. Remember, this is your challenge.

720
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:50,935
How was that?

721
01:04:53,065 --> 01:04:54,105
That's that.

722
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:57,495
How come you're so good?

723
01:04:59,585 --> 01:05:00,585
Damn.

724
01:05:03,225 --> 01:05:04,585
Are you okay?

725
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:28,935
Song,

726
01:05:29,015 --> 01:05:30,015
take this.

727
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:33,855
Thank you.

728
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:52,415
Aren't you going to ask anything?

729
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:54,745
Are you not worried about me?

730
01:05:56,705 --> 01:05:59,415
Tell me if you want to.
If you don't want to, don't tell me.

731
01:05:59,495 --> 01:06:02,455
I'll just sit here, okay?

732
01:06:10,785 --> 01:06:12,265
It's just tiring

733
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:15,455
when you try your best to please someone,

734
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,225
but they don't even notice.

735
01:06:19,895 --> 01:06:21,415
So now you're sulking, are you?

736
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:25,455
Look at you.

737
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:28,855
You may seem like an adult,
but you are not really one.

738
01:06:29,415 --> 01:06:32,975
What? I am an adult.
I'm not a kid anymore.

739
01:06:33,065 --> 01:06:34,825
I'm also very good at making money.

740
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:38,345
I know that.

741
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,585
I've seen you running yourself
into the ground

742
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:43,265
trying to make that someone proud of you.

743
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:49,625
There might be a reason
they haven't noticed.

744
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,935
If you want them to notice you,

745
01:06:52,535 --> 01:06:54,305
why don't you say something?

746
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,535
Just tell them. It's not that hard.

747
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:06,495
What are you doing?

748
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:09,535
Come on.

749
01:07:10,305 --> 01:07:12,665
Just let me recharge for five minutes.

750
01:07:16,185 --> 01:07:17,225
Fine.

751
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:20,225
Anything over five minutes,
I'll charge you.

752
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:24,065
Aren't you stingy?

753
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,305
It's fine. I'll pay.

754
01:07:41,065 --> 01:07:42,305
I don't remember

755
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:44,585
the last time I came running here.

756
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:49,065
Let's come again sometime.

757
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:53,105
When I'm not busy.

758
01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:12,665
Where's Kuenchai?

759
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:21,825
Kuenchai.

760
01:08:21,905 --> 01:08:23,225
Kuenchai.

761
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,345
Kuenchai.

762
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:29,865
Hey.

763
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,905
I'm sorry for letting him loose.

764
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:37,905
Come here, Kuenchai. Let's go.

765
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:39,695
Is his name Kuenchai?

766
01:08:40,695 --> 01:08:42,575
Please don't be angry with him.

767
01:08:42,655 --> 01:08:44,615
He just wanted to play.

768
01:08:45,575 --> 01:08:47,575
Today is my daughter's birthday.

769
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:49,415
I made her a cake.

770
01:08:49,495 --> 01:08:52,375
She found him adorable
and wanted to share her cake with him.

771
01:08:52,455 --> 01:08:53,945
But she dropped it.

772
01:08:54,025 --> 01:08:55,495
Didn't you?

773
01:08:55,575 --> 01:08:57,025
Thank you.

774
01:09:09,575 --> 01:09:12,225
What decoration do you want
on your cake this year?

775
01:09:14,305 --> 01:09:16,375
I want a rainbow.

776
01:09:18,145 --> 01:09:20,225
With these colors please, Mom.

777
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:21,905
Let me see.

778
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:40,415
Your birthday is in a few days.

779
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:43,615
Is there anything you want?
I'll surprise you with it.

780
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:45,615
You're so stupid.

781
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:48,145
If you ask me what I want,
how will it be a surprise?

782
01:09:48,945 --> 01:09:51,225
I want to give you a special gift.

783
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,265
Birthdays are special days.

784
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,905
Everyone celebrates, don't they?

785
01:09:57,145 --> 01:09:59,265
My birthday is just another normal day.

786
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:01,775
It has never been special.

787
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,385
I've never wanted anything before.

788
01:10:07,345 --> 01:10:08,585
But this year…

789
01:10:11,865 --> 01:10:13,145
What is it?

790
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:16,105
Forget it.

791
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:18,265
Nut.

792
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:20,185
What do you want?

793
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:23,025
Tell me.

794
01:10:27,585 --> 01:10:29,065
I don't know.

795
01:10:29,865 --> 01:10:31,465
Listen, Prib.

796
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:33,465
I had to eat that burnt pork you made,

797
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:36,465
and now you want me
to help you think of a gift for Nut.

798
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,775
You're the worst niece of all time.

799
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:42,105
Your heart is blacker
than your burnt pork.

800
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,735
You can talk, Uncle. Your skin is black,
and you have a black heart.

801
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,465
We're family but you won't help me.

802
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:50,945
You've worked with Nut for ages.
How come you know nothing about him?

803
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:53,655
You're a useless uncle

804
01:10:53,735 --> 01:10:55,505
and the worst boss.

805
01:10:56,145 --> 01:11:00,505
Listen. Nut and I just work together.

806
01:11:01,065 --> 01:11:04,775
I'm not his father. I don't know
everything about him.

807
01:11:05,655 --> 01:11:07,265
This is a waste of time.

808
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:09,025
Yes, you're wasting your time.

809
01:11:10,775 --> 01:11:13,225
Wasting time is still better
than wasting my chance.

810
01:11:13,305 --> 01:11:15,065
You'll surely waste your chance.

811
01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:19,025
No matter how precious the gift is,

812
01:11:19,105 --> 01:11:20,945
no matter how expensive it might be,

813
01:11:21,025 --> 01:11:24,265
Nut will never accept your love.

814
01:11:32,775 --> 01:11:34,185
A precious gift?

815
01:11:36,735 --> 01:11:38,225
-Uncle Juea!
-What is it?

816
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:41,185
Thank you. You are the best uncle ever.

817
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:44,585
-Whatever. I've warned you.
-Hey.

818
01:11:54,385 --> 01:11:56,425
Give me your paw.

819
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:58,345
The other one.

820
01:11:58,425 --> 01:12:00,025
Well done.

821
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:01,945
Here.

822
01:12:03,775 --> 01:12:04,985
Here's some water.

823
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:07,735
Thank you.

824
01:12:09,985 --> 01:12:11,545
What brings you here?

825
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:14,615
I would like your help with something.

826
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:19,065
I've figured out what I'm going
to give Nut for his birthday.

827
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:30,545
Did you tell her

828
01:12:30,615 --> 01:12:33,305
what Nut's teddy bear looked like?

829
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:35,695
Yes.

830
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:38,545
Was that a good idea?

831
01:12:38,615 --> 01:12:41,585
What if she manages to find
an identical teddy bear,

832
01:12:41,655 --> 01:12:44,065
and Nut replaces you with it?

833
01:12:46,025 --> 01:12:49,145
The best she'll find is something similar.

834
01:12:50,695 --> 01:12:53,105
Nothing can replace me, right?

835
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:56,425
Well, I guess
it won't hurt to be optimistic.

836
01:13:00,225 --> 01:13:01,735
I know that Prib likes Nut.

837
01:13:02,735 --> 01:13:04,735
She just wants him to be happy.

838
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:08,185
If her gift makes him happy,

839
01:13:08,735 --> 01:13:10,265
I am happy too.

840
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:12,065
How naive.

841
01:13:12,145 --> 01:13:14,265
Of course, you and Nut
are getting on well.

842
01:13:14,345 --> 01:13:16,735
Even better than before, I may say.

843
01:13:18,825 --> 01:13:20,695
When he is being nice to me,

844
01:13:22,305 --> 01:13:24,465
I want to be even nicer to him.

845
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,905
But…

846
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:30,655
I haven't figured out what to give him.

847
01:13:31,505 --> 01:13:33,655
When I asked him,
he wouldn't say what he wants.

848
01:13:35,775 --> 01:13:37,945
Should I get him a new bolster cushion?

849
01:13:38,025 --> 01:13:39,775
Tofu, you evil teddy bear!

850
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:43,985
You are very close to him.
You must know what he wants.

851
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:45,505
It shouldn't be that hard.

852
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,465
Nut was a cute kid.

853
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:16,905
He was.

854
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:20,585
He was such a cute child.

855
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:23,065
He was lively and he always smiled.

856
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:28,505
Lately, he hardly ever smiles though.

857
01:14:30,025 --> 01:14:31,425
It must be because of me.

858
01:14:34,185 --> 01:14:36,065
He seems to have a lot on his mind.

859
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:39,185
There's his work and his research.

860
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:41,545
He works really hard.

861
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:43,695
That's why he looks so serious.

862
01:15:11,065 --> 01:15:12,185
Is that a rainbow?

863
01:15:14,225 --> 01:15:18,775
When he was young,
he wanted a rainbow on his cake.

864
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,025
He asked me to make it for him.

865
01:15:24,945 --> 01:15:27,305
That year, he must have been very happy.

866
01:15:37,185 --> 01:15:38,225
No.

867
01:15:40,985 --> 01:15:42,465
I didn't make it for him.

868
01:15:47,425 --> 01:15:50,185
We never made
another birthday cake together again.

869
01:16:24,655 --> 01:16:26,105
In that case,

870
01:16:26,185 --> 01:16:29,185
for his birthday this year,
shall we make him a cake?

871
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:47,225
ALARM

872
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,105
Nut.

873
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:14,945
Are you awake, Nut? It's getting late.

874
01:18:15,615 --> 01:18:17,025
All right. I know.

875
01:19:25,225 --> 01:19:26,695
Happy birthday.

876
01:19:41,185 --> 01:19:42,545
What are you doing with that?

877
01:19:52,065 --> 01:19:53,265
Hey.

878
01:19:55,615 --> 01:19:56,735
Go put it away.

879
01:20:00,655 --> 01:20:01,815
Take this.

880
01:20:06,545 --> 01:20:07,615
I'm leaving, Mom.

881
01:20:16,655 --> 01:20:18,585
I already opened the gate for you.

882
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:42,655
Are you nearly here, Song?

883
01:20:44,345 --> 01:20:45,345
Sure.

884
01:20:57,585 --> 01:20:58,585
Song.

885
01:21:01,265 --> 01:21:03,185
Here's everything.

886
01:21:03,905 --> 01:21:05,025
Thank you.

887
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:06,425
Sure. I'm going now.

888
01:21:06,505 --> 01:21:07,775
Drive safely.

889
01:21:29,425 --> 01:21:30,465
Here you go, Prib.

890
01:21:31,145 --> 01:21:32,425
Thank you, Nut.

891
01:21:49,585 --> 01:21:54,225
LOOKING FOR A TEDDY BEAR

892
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:00,985
LOOKING FOR A TEDDY BEAR
IDENTICAL TO THIS

893
01:22:01,065 --> 01:22:02,945
ANYONE WITH INFO, PLEASE DM ME

894
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:10,105
-I'm going.
-See you.

895
01:25:16,425 --> 01:25:17,585
Haven't you finished yet?

896
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:21,985
It's all right.
I have someone to delay him.

897
01:25:29,505 --> 01:25:31,105
-Look.
-Yes?

898
01:25:31,185 --> 01:25:33,585
I've been editing this for hours.

899
01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:34,815
It's fine as it is.

900
01:25:34,905 --> 01:25:36,185
You say good.

901
01:25:37,305 --> 01:25:38,655
I say not good enough.

902
01:25:38,735 --> 01:25:40,505
A bit more. Go on.

903
01:25:42,265 --> 01:25:43,655
Fine, a bit more.

904
01:25:43,735 --> 01:25:45,865
Why do you sound so irritated?

905
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,585
It's okay now. You can let him go home.

906
01:26:01,655 --> 01:26:03,695
Wait, let me see.

907
01:26:06,985 --> 01:26:10,345
Not bad. This dialogue here is good.

908
01:26:12,345 --> 01:26:13,345
What?

909
01:26:13,945 --> 01:26:17,105
That dialogue was in the first draft.

910
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:21,025
That's what I'm saying. The dialogue
is exactly where it should be.

911
01:26:21,695 --> 01:26:23,545
All right. You may leave now.

912
01:26:24,105 --> 01:26:25,065
Good job.

913
01:26:25,145 --> 01:26:27,065
-I'm going then.
-Hold on.

914
01:26:29,345 --> 01:26:31,145
What is it now, Juea?

915
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:36,615
You remembered?

916
01:26:36,695 --> 01:26:37,985
Nut,

917
01:26:38,065 --> 01:26:40,695
how long have we worked together?
How could I not remember?

918
01:26:42,105 --> 01:26:44,305
Thank you.

919
01:26:44,385 --> 01:26:45,865
You're like a father to me.

920
01:26:45,945 --> 01:26:47,345
I'm more handsome than him.

921
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:53,985
I'm kidding. Don't crush my hopes.

922
01:26:54,065 --> 01:26:55,905
I would like to be handsome too.

923
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:57,385
Thank you.

924
01:26:58,425 --> 01:27:00,465
Even though you didn't raise me
as a parent,

925
01:27:01,145 --> 01:27:03,615
you've guided my career in this industry.

926
01:27:03,695 --> 01:27:06,505
Well said.

927
01:27:06,985 --> 01:27:10,905
If you didn't have talent,
I wouldn't be able to help you.

928
01:27:11,465 --> 01:27:13,465
Whatever problems you faced last year,

929
01:27:14,105 --> 01:27:15,695
let them go.

930
01:27:16,735 --> 01:27:19,385
I'm sure this year will be your year.

931
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:24,585
Because your series
is going to be a big hit.

932
01:27:25,065 --> 01:27:26,465
You would like that, right?

933
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:27,735
It's a win-win situation.

934
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:29,655
Go on. Go home.

935
01:27:30,265 --> 01:27:31,945
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

936
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:33,655
Drive safely.

937
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:50,105
You?

938
01:27:52,655 --> 01:27:53,775
Gen.

939
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:56,425
Yes, it's me.

940
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:59,025
Who else would it be?

941
01:27:59,105 --> 01:28:01,945
Happy birthday.
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

942
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,735
You buy yourself a cake every year,

943
01:28:05,815 --> 01:28:06,945
so I bought you one.

944
01:28:07,025 --> 01:28:08,305
Although this year,

945
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:10,695
you might not really want any cake.

946
01:28:11,385 --> 01:28:13,655
All right. Thank you.

947
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:14,735
I'm leaving.

948
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:18,905
Got you, Nut.

949
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:39,385
Hey, you.

950
01:28:40,185 --> 01:28:41,775
Is that all you got for him?

951
01:28:43,345 --> 01:28:45,105
What should I give him?

952
01:28:45,185 --> 01:28:46,465
A car? A house?

953
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,655
Nut doesn't want anything.

954
01:28:49,735 --> 01:28:50,655
Every year,

955
01:28:50,735 --> 01:28:51,985
I wish him a happy birthday

956
01:28:52,065 --> 01:28:54,025
and offer my support.

957
01:28:55,855 --> 01:28:58,265
That's adorable.

958
01:29:01,065 --> 01:29:02,655
I would like someone

959
01:29:03,225 --> 01:29:04,585
to offer me support

960
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:06,505
like that.

961
01:29:07,855 --> 01:29:09,105
Wait.

962
01:29:09,185 --> 01:29:12,105
Find a good friend like me then.

963
01:29:13,855 --> 01:29:15,735
I already have plenty of friends.

964
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:19,545
But now, I want you.

965
01:29:26,145 --> 01:29:27,145
This is for the cake.

966
01:29:29,065 --> 01:29:32,585
Thanks for buying it for me.

967
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:38,345
Right, I…

968
01:29:41,145 --> 01:29:42,265
better get going.

969
01:29:44,185 --> 01:29:47,025
You can buy a cake like that
from loads of places around here.

970
01:29:48,385 --> 01:29:50,615
You can just tell me
if you want to see me.

971
01:29:56,065 --> 01:29:57,735
Stay by my side…

972
01:30:00,775 --> 01:30:02,265
and don't go anywhere.

973
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:05,615
Your mom said,

974
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:09,065
love isn't about doing
something for someone.

975
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:12,855
It's about putting your heart into it.

976
01:30:13,345 --> 01:30:17,025
How are you involved with what happened
to Nut and his mother?

977
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:18,855
You're nosy

978
01:30:18,945 --> 01:30:21,065
because you're jealous
of Nut's mother, right?

979
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:23,145
Why would I be jealous?

980
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:25,615
Well, everybody loves her.

981
01:30:26,225 --> 01:30:27,505
This includes Mr. Saen too.

982
01:30:29,655 --> 01:30:31,465
Have you heard of the phrase

983
01:30:31,545 --> 01:30:35,065
"Pity is the foundation of love"?

984
01:30:36,425 --> 01:30:39,385
No. I've only heard of sympathy.

985
01:31:41,305 --> 01:31:46,305
