1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,024
Stay by my side…

2
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,545
and don't go anywhere.

3
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,904
Your mom said,

4
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,344
love isn't about doing
something for someone.

5
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,145
It's about putting your heart into it.

6
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:27,305
How are you involved with what happened
to Nut and his mother?

7
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:30,745
You're nosy because you're jealous
of Nut's mother, right?

8
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,425
Why would I be jealous?

9
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,785
Well, everybody loves her.

10
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,785
This includes Mr. Saen too.

11
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,825
Have you heard of the phrase

12
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:45,305
"Pity is the foundation of love"?

13
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:49,665
No. I've only heard of sympathy.

14
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,145
I'm off, Mom.

15
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:11,545
Tofu.

16
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:13,784
Want to see the series you were in?

17
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,624
Juea just finished editing the teaser.

18
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,585
Do you?

19
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,585
I shouldn't.

20
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,825
I just went out yesterday.

21
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,025
I was going to help your mom
with the chores.

22
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,504
Don't worry about me.

23
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,385
I'm healthy now.
I can take care of myself.

24
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,265
You should do what you want,
so you don't get bored.

25
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:41,585
Maybe another time.

26
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,464
I have a lot to do.

27
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,464
That's up to you. I'm off.

28
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:50,665
Bye.

29
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:53,585
Bye, Keunchai.

30
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:04,745
Song.

31
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,105
Oh, Tofu. What is it?

32
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,824
Song. Can you do me a favor?

33
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,185
Do you know

34
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:33,225
which close friend of Neung
has a name that begins with "T".

35
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:36,065
Is it Thanayut,

36
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,584
Title,

37
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,745
or Tatarn?

38
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:44,945
Neung's close friend
with a name beginning with a "T"…

39
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,584
I think he's the only one.

40
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,065
Tatarn.

41
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,745
That one. They have a picture together.

42
00:04:58,345 --> 00:04:59,264
This one?

43
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:01,465
That's right.

44
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:12,305
Watch this. I just finished editing.

45
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,345
There.

46
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,505
AN OLD STORY RETOLD…
AFTER A LONG WHILE

47
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:35,185
There's only one moon.

48
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:41,985
How about I draw another moon?

49
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,584
If you draw another moon,

50
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,185
the first moon will lose its meaning.

51
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:00,824
Then one is enough.

52
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:22,225
TATARN: SOMETIMES RAIN FALLS DOWN,
BUT SOMETIMES IT POURS UP.

53
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:26,865
TATARN: SOMETIMES RAIN FALLS DOWN,
BUT SOMETIMES IT POURS UP.

54
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:45,105
TATARN: I MIGHT BE FAR AWAY,
BUT I'M NEVER GONE.

55
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:50,424
TATARN: I MIGHT BE FAR AWAY,
BUT I'M NEVER GONE.

56
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:55,304
TATARN: I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE SAD.
I WANT THE WORLD TO BE NICE TO HIM.

57
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,865
TATARN: SOME THINGS,
WE HUG TO FILL OUR ARMS.

58
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:11,585
TATARN: BUT SOME THINGS,
WE HUG TO FILL OUR HEARTS.

59
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:28,745
Tatarn's Facebook is public.

60
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:32,625
It seems like he wants
to send someone a message.

61
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,705
That someone

62
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,665
could be Nut.

63
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:39,465
But there's not
a single photo of Nut here.

64
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:44,025
There's also no information
about Tatarn's whereabouts, job,

65
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,184
nor how to contact him.

66
00:09:55,145 --> 00:10:00,105
TATARN, OUR LIFE

67
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,304
That man seems familiar.

68
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,505
Is it someone who knows Nut?

69
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,465
He's not just someone he knows.

70
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,745
He's someone Nut loved.

71
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,985
Why would you look at his pictures?

72
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,265
Don't worry about it.

73
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,025
He's the past.

74
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:38,385
Now, you're the only one for Nut, okay?

75
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,944
Are you and Nut in love?

76
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:06,505
Yes.

77
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:10,665
You got it right.

78
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,824
We are in love.

79
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:16,544
Tofu makes me happy.

80
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,544
He's the reason I can tolerate this house.

81
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:25,785
What are you trying to do
by asking him behind my back?

82
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,145
Are you driving him away again?

83
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,385
Are you doing the same thing again?

84
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:39,505
Don't go anywhere,

85
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,705
or I'll go with you.

86
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:45,705
If you can't accept it,
then I won't stay here.

87
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,145
Where are you going?

88
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:51,385
You're my son.

89
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:53,944
Your son is gay!

90
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:59,064
If you dream of a happy family
like you find in books,

91
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,145
I can tell you now

92
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,665
that it will never come true

93
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,985
because I like men.

94
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:09,865
I can never marry a woman
and give you grandkids.

95
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,225
Calm down, Nut.

96
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:18,985
Are you hurt

97
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,184
to have me as a son?

98
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:24,585
It hurts me, too,

99
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,665
that you're my mom.

100
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:33,345
You can hate me all you want.

101
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:37,225
But I will never be who you want me to be.

102
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,225
Nut.

103
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,064
If you want me to stay,

104
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:45,265
I'll stay,

105
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,985
but I'll be myself.

106
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,265
I'll love him like this.

107
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,105
What are you doing?

108
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:10,145
Nut.

109
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:21,304
Nut.

110
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:32,145
Nut.

111
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,265
Nut.

112
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,544
Let's talk.

113
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:38,105
You'll never understand
what I went through.

114
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,824
All you do is side with her.

115
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,064
I don't.

116
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,704
I just didn't want you to do that.

117
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:45,544
Nut.

118
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:47,585
Nut!

119
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:07,944
Song.

120
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:10,985
Here.

121
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,785
Why did you come all the way here?

122
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,225
I had a fight with Tofu.

123
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:24,385
I don't want to see him.

124
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,064
What did he do?

125
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:30,465
I'll change the question.

126
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:33,225
What did you do?

127
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,985
My mom knows I'm with Tofu.

128
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:44,905
What did she say?

129
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:47,824
I don't care

130
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,665
if she yells at me.

131
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,625
I won't break up with him like last time.

132
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,345
Are you saying
that you broke up with your ex

133
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,145
because of your mom?

134
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:10,385
What does Tofu have to do with it?

135
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:14,544
He doesn't understand me.

136
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:18,385
I kissed him in front of Mom to spite her,

137
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,665
and he just pushed me away.

138
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,865
I wouldn't just push you away.

139
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:27,025
I would dropkick you.

140
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:29,465
Why are you acting like a child?

141
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:33,544
Don't you ever consider his feelings?

142
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,704
What about your mom's?

143
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:41,385
Fine.

144
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,265
I know I was wrong,

145
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:46,385
but I wanted to hurt her

146
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,225
like she hurt me before.

147
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,944
All right.

148
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,385
Hey, come. Let's have lunch.

149
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,025
Here. These are all Nut's favorites.

150
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,584
It has been a while.

151
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,665
Let's eat.

152
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:12,025
He has a boyfriend now.

153
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,985
He has forgotten about his friends.

154
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,944
Stop talking about him.

155
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:20,544
If I can't talk about him,
then you can leave.

156
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,824
Go home. Get out.

157
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,985
Hey, you're always welcome here,

158
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:29,704
but I would be glad
if you were happier at home.

159
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:41,985
Who's here?

160
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,785
How did you know Nut was here?

161
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,985
Lovers should know each other well,

162
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,505
just like how I know you.

163
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:02,625
You brought Tofu all the way here,

164
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,665
you can anticipate war.

165
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,264
Our weekend seems jolly today.

166
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:27,385
You guys must be hungry.

167
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,385
Let's dig in.

168
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,504
-Come on.
-Okay.

169
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:31,705
Let's eat.

170
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,425
I remember that you like eggplant.

171
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:09,665
-Nut.
-Get that for me.

172
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,465
I want that piece.

173
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:34,465
-Nut.
-Give me some fried pork too.

174
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,264
Do you want anything else?
I'll get it all for you now.

175
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:55,744
I don't.

176
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:57,905
Just eat. Don't bother me.

177
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:02,625
How can I eat when you're mad?

178
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,024
Whose fault is it that I'm mad?

179
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,185
Hey.

180
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,865
Whoever's fault it is,

181
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:13,345
let's clear it up after we eat.

182
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,625
It would be a shame to ruin lunch.

183
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,465
I don't know what you fought about,

184
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:27,825
but there aren't many chances for us
to eat together like this.

185
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:30,465
So the time that we spend together

186
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,705
should be a happy time.

187
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:35,825
The dining table is a war-free zone.

188
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,065
-We should enjoy the food.
-Right.

189
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:42,744
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

190
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,105
I'm sorry.

191
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,425
All right. That's that.

192
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:47,345
Let's eat,

193
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,185
so we can cheer up with desserts.

194
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,945
Do you think you own the place?

195
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,665
What?

196
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:09,705
You almost destroyed my home

197
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:10,865
by bringing Tofu here.

198
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:11,984
Just leave.

199
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,024
I won't.

200
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:15,984
-You won't?
-Right.

201
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,504
Your dad invited me to stay.

202
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,825
Nut. Talk it out nicely, okay?

203
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:37,585
Thank you for lunch, Gen.

204
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,185
Thank you, too, Song.

205
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:41,545
Right.

206
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,665
Thank you for your meddling.

207
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,145
I'm so darn touched.

208
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,425
Let me tell you about Gen.

209
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:52,065
-What are you doing, Nut?
-Don't worry.

210
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,984
Nut. What did you say?

211
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,185
You'll find out soon.

212
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:15,744
What did he say, Song?

213
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,465
What is this?

214
00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:40,345
Can we turn it off?

215
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:43,385
Gosh, Nut.

216
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,264
Nut.

217
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,425
Ouch.

218
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:51,945
Nut.

219
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:05,465
Tofu.

220
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,665
If something is bothering you,

221
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:34,585
you can tell me.

222
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:37,625
You might feel better.

223
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:48,465
I'm sorry

224
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:51,665
for what I did just now and at home.

225
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:55,625
I'm not mad.

226
00:22:57,065 --> 00:23:00,264
I know you probably feel bad too.

227
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:02,705
Don't you?

228
00:23:07,784 --> 00:23:08,984
I know I was wrong,

229
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:12,585
but Mom was wrong too.

230
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,625
It may be hard to imagine,

231
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,744
but Mom and I used to be close.

232
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,825
But as I grew up,

233
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,625
I found out

234
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,465
that we were never really close.

235
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:37,784
-Mom.
-Yes?

236
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:41,065
They say that Thailand
was never colonized.

237
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,625
What about the two times we lost to Burma?

238
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,065
Well…

239
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:50,385
we only count the Western Colonization
during the Rattanakosin period,

240
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:54,345
not during the Ayutthaya period,
since we weren't a country back then.

241
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:58,105
What are the pros and cons

242
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:00,425
of never being colonized?

243
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:05,705
What are we talking about?

244
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:09,225
I have something for you.

245
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:16,945
I'm hungry.

246
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:18,945
I'll cook you something.

247
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:50,504
Isn't this pretty?

248
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:56,345
Nut. That's a girl's dress.
You can't wear that.

249
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,945
Why not? Can't boys wear it?

250
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:04,705
I like this dress.

251
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:09,865
Pink is for girls.

252
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:13,865
What color is for boys, then?

253
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,425
Why can't it be pink?

254
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:26,264
Haven't I told you
not to let him play with these?

255
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:41,665
Sib.

256
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:46,665
-You shouldn't go so far--
-Shut it.

257
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:50,225
He's turning gay
because of your negligence.

258
00:25:51,504 --> 00:25:53,984
-He's just a nice boy.
-Don't talk back to me.

259
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,345
Boys have to be strong.

260
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:58,585
What kind of mom are you?

261
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:11,185
Nut!

262
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:14,625
Honey!

263
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,465
Hey! Stop!

264
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:21,504
Do you see
he's wearing heels like a queen?

265
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:24,145
Do you want to be one?

266
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,865
Do you want to be gay?

267
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,905
Don't you want to be a man?

268
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:29,744
Answer me!

269
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:32,185
What are you looking at?

270
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,544
What did I do wrong?

271
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,945
Why can't boys play with paper dolls?

272
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:50,345
Why can't we like pink?

273
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,784
Why can't we wear heels?

274
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:56,024
They never explained it to me.

275
00:27:56,984 --> 00:27:58,784
just that they're not for boys.

276
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:06,264
My parents ruined my self-esteem

277
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,264
and made me feel abnormal.

278
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:12,264
Nut is a normal boy like anyone else.

279
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:16,744
Can't you see how girly he is,

280
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,825
-that he's queer?
-That's not true.

281
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,345
That's not what he is.

282
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:24,185
Are you saying I'm making this up?

283
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:27,504
How did you let him turn out this way?

284
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:30,465
Instead of saying,

285
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,665
"Nut might not be so manly,

286
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,784
but nothing's wrong with him,"

287
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:36,705
she just said,

288
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:39,865
"Nut is a normal boy like anyone else,"

289
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:44,425
because she didn't want to admit
that she let me turn out this way.

290
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:58,784
What are you doing?

291
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,465
I just want to know what you wrote.

292
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:06,705
Is there something I can't see?

293
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:11,385
What's this poem? It doesn't even rhyme.

294
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:18,385
What I write is my business.

295
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:58,145
The only thing I could do at home
was write,

296
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:00,865
but they took that from me.

297
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:04,784
They told me to stop writing

298
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,544
and focus on my studies

299
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,185
because I should join the military.

300
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:13,744
Mom knew that I didn't like it.

301
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,024
I hated everything about the military.

302
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:19,625
I didn't want to be like Dad,

303
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,504
but Mom asked me to.

304
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:26,665
They forced me to move

305
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:29,705
to a school where someone
can watch me for Dad.

306
00:30:32,784 --> 00:30:34,504
I thought my world had ended.

307
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,744
But you know what,

308
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:46,185
that place gave me a new world.

309
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:50,145
A world that's bigger than home.

310
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:54,345
A world that changed my life.

311
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:47,465
Hey.

312
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,544
Hey, are you okay?

313
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:00,064
Neung, we should take him
to the infirmary.

314
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:03,824
What's going on? My goodness, Peeranut.

315
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,145
You're in trouble on your first day.

316
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:11,865
You two, take him to the infirmary.
Quickly.

317
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,024
Be careful.

318
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:18,264
Hurry up.

319
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:20,225
My goodness.

320
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:48,984
Thank you.

321
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:51,744
Thank you.

322
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:55,145
Thank you.

323
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:58,105
Oh, thank you.

324
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:00,145
You're claiming them all.

325
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,945
Neung. Here's a snack.

326
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,544
Thank you.

327
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:11,264
Bye. Thank you.

328
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:08,744
I'm so tired today.

329
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,904
I waited for ages.

330
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:11,904
I barely played.

331
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:33,985
Hey, Neung.

332
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:36,105
You got snacks again?

333
00:34:36,185 --> 00:34:38,585
-Man, I'm jealous.
-Right.

334
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:40,505
I can't eat them. Whose are they?

335
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:41,904
Throw them out.

336
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:45,264
I'll take them off your hands. I'm hungry.

337
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,384
Don't you want any? It's good.

338
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:05,864
Go ahead.

339
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:10,864
BASKETBALL TEAM ASSISTANT WANTED

340
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:02,745
New assistant?

341
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,745
Yes.

342
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:09,105
What's your name?

343
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:12,305
I'm Nut.

344
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:15,065
I'm Tarn.

345
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:17,065
Tatarn.

346
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:21,904
Tarn, come on.

347
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:23,505
Okay.

348
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:30,384
You can do it.

349
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:46,825
Hey, why aren't you in the girls' toilet?

350
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:48,505
You want to see our junk?

351
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:53,025
Does your dad know

352
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:53,944
you're a sissy?

353
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:57,705
Hi, sissy!

354
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,225
Think you can fight me?

355
00:38:00,305 --> 00:38:02,864
Why don't you go
ask your beloved Neung for help?

356
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,384
Oh, sissy!

357
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:09,745
This is a toilet, not a kennel.

358
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:11,904
If you're not peeing, get out!

359
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,305
If you want to gang up,

360
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:15,825
meet me on the court.

361
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:16,904
I'll play all of you.

362
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,705
Hey, let's go.

363
00:38:32,904 --> 00:38:33,985
Are you okay, Nut?

364
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,625
I'm fine.

365
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:39,985
Thank you.

366
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:00,825
What do you want to eat?

367
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:02,825
Up to you.

368
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,665
What about hotpot?

369
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:06,625
You were great.

370
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,384
Hey! Be careful!

371
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:22,145
Daydreaming again.

372
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:26,864
Are you okay?

373
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,345
I'm fine.

374
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:33,105
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

375
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:38,985
Tarn, get ready.

376
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:44,025
Let's play, Tarn.

377
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:47,585
Go on, Mr. Hero.

378
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:49,545
Do you like this book too?

379
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:54,025
I'm just looking. I don't like it.

380
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,145
Just admit if you like it.

381
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,384
Why hide it?

382
00:42:06,105 --> 00:42:07,705
I don't like it.

383
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:08,985
Take it if you do.

384
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:22,545
BE WITH YOU

385
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:01,985
What are you doing?

386
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,505
What were you doing?

387
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,384
I…

388
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:27,225
Wait.

389
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:31,705
Take this one too.

390
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,065
Okay.

391
00:44:12,185 --> 00:44:13,464
Please move.

392
00:44:14,424 --> 00:44:15,345
Just go.

393
00:44:21,984 --> 00:44:24,105
-I'm going to the toilet.
-Hurry up, then.

394
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,185
Please let me go.

395
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,105
I'm begging you.

396
00:44:30,665 --> 00:44:31,944
Are you that scared?

397
00:44:32,745 --> 00:44:35,145
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

398
00:44:46,025 --> 00:44:47,305
What are you looking at?

399
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,424
I tried to avoid him.

400
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:03,984
But you know what,

401
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,225
the more I hid, the more I saw him.

402
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,864
I was such a child back then.

403
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,505
I was afraid he would find out
that I liked Neung.

404
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,025
He was a real prankster.

405
00:45:19,944 --> 00:45:21,225
If he found out,

406
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:24,225
everyone else would too.

407
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:29,265
I was afraid my parents would know.

408
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:38,305
-Tuck your shirt in.
-Yes.

409
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,424
Don't come to school looking so scruffy.

410
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,984
I was in a hurry.

411
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:45,545
You still have to dress properly.
Where's your belt?

412
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:47,825
I forgot it.

413
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:50,665
Buy a new one. We sell them in the shop.

414
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:51,944
-Okay.
-Go.

415
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,345
Hey.

416
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:03,984
You're dropping him off.

417
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:06,065
Hello.

418
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,665
Go to class.

419
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:10,025
Goodbye.

420
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:13,984
Look after him for me.

421
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:16,785
Yes. Don't worry.

422
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:19,185
He's a good boy.

423
00:46:19,265 --> 00:46:20,904
How is he at school?

424
00:46:20,984 --> 00:46:22,665
He doesn't misbehave

425
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:24,944
and fits in with friends.

426
00:46:27,825 --> 00:46:28,785
Waiting for me?

427
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:30,984
-Let's go.
-We can guide him.

428
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,944
Just guide him little by little.

429
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,464
It's still possible.

430
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:38,345
I chose to stop going to the club,

431
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:40,984
but there was still a cause
for us to meet.

432
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:42,984
They were one person short,

433
00:46:44,145 --> 00:46:45,545
so they asked me to help.

434
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:47,665
I don't know why,

435
00:46:48,345 --> 00:46:50,145
but I didn't feel the same with Neung.

436
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,665
Catch it.

437
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:54,265
Pick up the ball.

438
00:46:55,665 --> 00:46:56,625
Tarn!

439
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:58,464
Focus!

440
00:46:58,545 --> 00:46:59,585
Come on.

441
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:03,265
There you go.

442
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:05,265
Go.

443
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:07,625
-Ouch.
-Tarn, are you all right?

444
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:09,384
What's going on?

445
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:12,265
My arm hurts.

446
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:14,065
Let's take a rest.

447
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:17,705
You two, give him first aid. Go on.

448
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,665
-Hey.
-What is it?

449
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,265
My leg hurts too.

450
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:24,705
Slowly.

451
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:29,505
Next person, get ready.

452
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:39,785
You should practice.

453
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:42,505
I'll ask Nut to take me to the toilet.

454
00:47:44,305 --> 00:47:45,904
Take care of him.

455
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:50,384
Come on.

456
00:47:51,904 --> 00:47:53,505
Hurry up. I have to pee.

457
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,185
Do you need help?

458
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,145
Do you mind?

459
00:48:50,705 --> 00:48:52,505
Do you really not want to see my face?

460
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:56,505
Just hurry up.

461
00:48:58,384 --> 00:48:59,625
Wait for me.

462
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:03,545
I don't know if I held it too long
or if there's someone here,

463
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:04,864
but I'm nervous.

464
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:09,585
Are you done?

465
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,065
Yes.

466
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,065
You haven't answered

467
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:43,505
if you were really that mad at me.

468
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,025
If you can stand on your own,

469
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:51,545
I'm leaving.

470
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:53,065
Nut.

471
00:49:59,025 --> 00:49:59,984
I'm sorry

472
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:02,185
for making you upset.

473
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,585
I don't want any bad blood between us.

474
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:12,424
It's okay if you don't want to look at me,

475
00:50:16,025 --> 00:50:17,305
but please

476
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:20,065
don't hate me.

477
00:50:24,665 --> 00:50:26,065
I don't hate you.

478
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,785
But you don't like me.

479
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:36,105
You not liking me now

480
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:39,464
doesn't mean
you won't like me ever, right?

481
00:50:43,504 --> 00:50:44,745
I didn't answer,

482
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:47,984
so he planned to make me confess to Neung

483
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,904
on Valentine's Day.

484
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:52,424
He was a crafty guy.

485
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:57,225
He knew I would get turned down
since Neung already had a girlfriend.

486
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:24,785
Didn't you go see Neung?

487
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:30,665
I did.

488
00:51:31,904 --> 00:51:33,944
I gave him the socks you asked me to.

489
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,025
He asked me to thank you.

490
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:41,944
Why are you here?

491
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,384
Well…

492
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:10,944
I brought you a Valentine's Day gift.

493
00:52:12,384 --> 00:52:13,504
Let's exchange.

494
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:39,065
BE WITH YOU

495
00:52:39,545 --> 00:52:42,785
TO NUT FROM 'T'

496
00:52:52,984 --> 00:52:54,625
Let's go for milk near the school.

497
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:57,745
I'll wait until you come.

498
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:16,345
I didn't know that a rough guy
could be sweet.

499
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:21,025
You didn't stand him up, did you?

500
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:25,145
I didn't, because I…

501
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,984
waited for him myself.

502
00:53:29,745 --> 00:53:31,504
I didn't know why I went there.

503
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:34,785
I probably wanted to challenge my parents

504
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:36,944
or just

505
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,225
wondered what would happen.

506
00:54:19,785 --> 00:54:21,145
I thought you weren't coming.

507
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:27,504
You would drag me here

508
00:54:28,145 --> 00:54:29,464
if I didn't come.

509
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:33,904
You know it's not you that I like.

510
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:36,265
Why do you keep bothering me?

511
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:41,225
Once you like someone, it's hard to stop.

512
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:49,984
Hey.

513
00:54:51,145 --> 00:54:52,625
You've never dated, right?

514
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,025
I'm going to college next year.

515
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:05,545
If this year we try dating
and it doesn't work out,

516
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,585
then that's that.

517
00:55:06,665 --> 00:55:07,504
Sounds good?

518
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:12,265
No.

519
00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:14,265
What? Why not?

520
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,705
I thought so hard about it.

521
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:22,944
BE WITH YOU

522
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:26,944
You know it's not you that I like.

523
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,145
You also know

524
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:33,345
that Neung will only see you
as his junior.

525
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:38,785
I know that.

526
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:43,384
It's good.
Nobody needs to know about this.

527
00:55:45,504 --> 00:55:46,345
Nut.

528
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,585
It's not like our lives will end

529
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:51,785
if we choose this path.

530
00:55:52,864 --> 00:55:54,625
There's nothing wrong with it.

531
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:57,025
Even if you don't agree to date me,

532
00:55:59,185 --> 00:56:01,745
BE WITH YOU

533
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,585
I still want you to reconsider.

534
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:07,504
Why so?

535
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:12,225
Have you tried their dessert?

536
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:14,665
No.

537
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:16,384
My parents don't like it

538
00:56:16,864 --> 00:56:17,944
because it's too sweet.

539
00:56:20,145 --> 00:56:21,105
Then try it

540
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:24,984
and see for yourself,

541
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,825
not from what others said.

542
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:36,065
If I eat this, you'll take it
as a yes, won't you?

543
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:40,904
Just try it.

544
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:02,345
How is it? Good?

545
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:33,705
BE WITH YOU

546
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:44,585
IT'S SWEET, BUT I LIKE IT.

547
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:48,665
IT'S SWEET, BUT I LIKE IT.

548
00:57:56,464 --> 00:57:57,785
I didn't know

549
00:57:59,424 --> 00:58:01,785
that a rough guy like you can be sweet.

550
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:07,825
Here you go.

551
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,024
Are you a masochist?

552
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:13,065
You keep listening even when it hurts you.

553
00:58:14,105 --> 00:58:15,665
I won't tell you any more stories.

554
00:58:15,745 --> 00:58:17,145
I'm really fine.

555
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:18,785
Do you want a mirror?

556
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:21,105
Your face doesn't look fine.

557
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:27,424
I just envy him a little,

558
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:29,665
I'm a bit jealous.

559
00:58:30,904 --> 00:58:32,745
But when it comes to your stories,

560
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:34,585
I want to know everything.

561
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:39,625
You're just thinking of him,

562
00:58:40,305 --> 00:58:41,785
but you aren't missing him.

563
00:58:47,345 --> 00:58:51,464
Finally, I got to know
how Nut ended up with Tatarn.

564
00:58:52,424 --> 00:58:54,864
Their love seemed fine,

565
00:58:55,984 --> 00:58:56,944
but…

566
00:58:57,745 --> 00:59:02,504
what happened
between Nut, Tatarn, and Nut's mom?

567
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:06,625
Why have Nut and his mom
had a problem for so long?

568
00:59:11,265 --> 00:59:13,785
Right. What's your problem?

569
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,904
My dad asked what the problem was.

570
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:19,705
You've been watering for five minutes.

571
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:21,625
My vegetables are probably dead.

572
00:59:22,665 --> 00:59:24,944
Gen cherishes that plot.

573
00:59:25,504 --> 00:59:27,305
It will rot if you water it too much.

574
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:28,504
Gen will yell at you.

575
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:30,464
I don't cherish it.

576
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,585
My mistake.

577
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:34,185
You used to cherish it.

578
00:59:34,984 --> 00:59:36,705
That plot was for his ex.

579
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:38,065
Dad! Don't.

580
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:39,864
Is that true?

581
00:59:43,904 --> 00:59:45,785
Yes. Well…

582
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,265
my ex wouldn't eat vegetables,

583
00:59:48,345 --> 00:59:50,345
so I tried to get him to eat those.

584
00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:52,904
He would only eat those

585
00:59:52,984 --> 00:59:54,185
if I planted them.

586
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,185
That kid liked cabbage,

587
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,384
so he paid special attention to those.

588
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:01,904
Dad! Again?

589
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:06,305
I guess they're useless now
since you broke up.

590
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:09,065
Can't I plant them for myself?

591
01:00:12,185 --> 01:00:13,665
I like ivy gourd leaves, though.

592
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:17,464
Listen.

593
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:19,305
When you leave my house,

594
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:21,305
turn left and you'll find a market.

595
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,904
Buy as many as you like.

596
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,545
Come on, mister.

597
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:29,864
I want you to plant those for me.

598
01:00:30,424 --> 01:00:31,345
Just like this.

599
01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:33,225
Please.

600
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:35,705
-Just a few.
-Why should I?

601
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,065
Plant them yourself.

602
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:42,585
I have the seeds.

603
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:45,665
Really? Where?

604
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:46,904
Over there.

605
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,305
I got them for free.

606
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:53,785
Are my vegetables just a giveaway?

607
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:56,825
Are you going to plant them or not?

608
01:00:59,585 --> 01:01:01,904
Of course, I am.

609
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:05,384
Hey.

610
01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:11,984
Mr. Sitha, cool it.

611
01:01:12,065 --> 01:01:13,665
Well, yes.

612
01:01:13,745 --> 01:01:15,825
Yes. Okay.

613
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,545
Wait. What's that?

614
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,225
What's that?

615
01:02:26,904 --> 01:02:28,665
Meow.

616
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:33,065
-Meow?
-Hey!

617
01:02:33,145 --> 01:02:35,464
What? Don't.

618
01:02:36,024 --> 01:02:37,904
I know why you like ivy gourd leaves.

619
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:39,424
Why so?

620
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:40,984
They're creepers.

621
01:02:41,065 --> 01:02:41,904
Hey.

622
01:02:41,984 --> 01:02:44,745
There. Take that.

623
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:46,504
Come here, Song.

624
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:47,944
Stop.

625
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:56,864
I'll wash it for you.

626
01:02:57,864 --> 01:03:00,545
Come on. Stop pestering me.

627
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:01,785
I'm tired of yelling.

628
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:07,665
I'm not fooling around anymore.

629
01:03:09,864 --> 01:03:12,345
Let me ask something serious.

630
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,265
Do you not like younger guys?

631
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:23,504
What are you saying?

632
01:03:24,745 --> 01:03:27,585
Earlier, Nut told me…

633
01:03:28,665 --> 01:03:31,464
Gen won't like you.
He doesn't like younger guys.

634
01:03:32,984 --> 01:03:34,145
Is it because of your ex?

635
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:37,984
Earlier,

636
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,544
your father said you went out

637
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:40,864
with someone younger.

638
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:49,745
Did your ex-boyfriend traumatize you
from dating a younger man?

639
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:54,745
Not all younger men are the same.

640
01:03:54,825 --> 01:03:56,065
Don't generalize us.

641
01:03:58,145 --> 01:04:00,384
The difference in our age
was only a few years,

642
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,145
yet my ex and I broke up.

643
01:04:03,305 --> 01:04:05,384
Our age gap is nine years.

644
01:04:06,585 --> 01:04:08,705
What if you meet someone better
in the future?

645
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:11,464
What if you become famous?

646
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,225
Your life has a long way to go.

647
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:18,665
That time hasn't come yet.

648
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:20,544
Why would you worry?

649
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:27,984
Do you think I'll turn out like them?

650
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:33,065
Don't you have confidence in me

651
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:37,904
when I'm with you at all?

652
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,345
I…

653
01:04:49,745 --> 01:04:50,904
I don't want to risk it.

654
01:04:57,424 --> 01:04:58,864
Hey, Gen.

655
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:13,065
Drink some water.

656
01:05:13,145 --> 01:05:14,105
Thank you.

657
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:19,305
It's a little tough.

658
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:21,944
Gen is a stubborn kid.

659
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:27,544
I'm very serious about him.

660
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:30,904
I don't know what else to do.

661
01:05:34,504 --> 01:05:37,024
Kanya and I were the same.

662
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:40,625
When I pursued her,

663
01:05:40,705 --> 01:05:42,944
she was hard to get like Gen.

664
01:05:44,185 --> 01:05:48,504
When older women marry younger men,

665
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:50,424
they worry about a million things.

666
01:05:51,424 --> 01:05:53,944
People would say
she's going out with her brother,

667
01:05:54,024 --> 01:05:56,185
or that she's my mom.

668
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,625
What did you do, then?

669
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:03,864
I just kept going?

670
01:06:05,225 --> 01:06:06,745
You just kept going?

671
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:09,665
What else could I do?

672
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:12,904
If you really like him,

673
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:14,825
then show him that.

674
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:15,745
Just do it.

675
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:18,265
It won't be a waste.

676
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:23,585
As Gen's father

677
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,705
who raised him with my own hands,

678
01:06:26,665 --> 01:06:29,665
his life has always been a breeze.

679
01:06:30,225 --> 01:06:32,065
He got to study what he wanted.

680
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,225
He has a good job.

681
01:06:34,944 --> 01:06:37,145
Nobody minds who he is.

682
01:06:37,225 --> 01:06:40,904
Kanya and I have always understood
and supported him,

683
01:06:42,024 --> 01:06:44,705
so he wants some things to be difficult.

684
01:06:46,305 --> 01:06:47,825
Love, for instance.

685
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:52,145
I have to try harder, do I?

686
01:06:54,705 --> 01:06:56,225
Do your best, if you can.

687
01:06:57,464 --> 01:06:59,944
If you want some help, tell me.

688
01:07:01,864 --> 01:07:04,345
I'll understand if you want to give up.

689
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:07,305
My son is high maintenance.

690
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:12,384
Thank you.

691
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:19,544
Cheer up.

692
01:07:28,864 --> 01:07:30,464
Have you two eaten?

693
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:50,504
I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

694
01:07:52,145 --> 01:07:54,745
I didn't want to do that.

695
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:57,984
I was just afraid you wouldn't like it,

696
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:01,424
and that it would affect your health.

697
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:05,145
I didn't want it to bother you.

698
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:12,065
I'm sorry.

699
01:08:18,945 --> 01:08:20,305
What are you doing?

700
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:22,225
I'm working.

701
01:08:23,584 --> 01:08:24,544
A change of scenery.

702
01:08:26,384 --> 01:08:28,704
I'm writing a boys' love screenplay.

703
01:08:29,384 --> 01:08:32,504
I get inspired with you around.

704
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:39,865
I'll try not to make loud noises,
so you can focus on work.

705
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:43,504
You want to know

706
01:08:44,865 --> 01:08:46,384
what I'm writing about?

707
01:08:49,905 --> 01:08:52,624
If you want to tell me, I'll listen.

708
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:57,744
I'm writing about a boy's love.

709
01:08:59,544 --> 01:09:01,744
Despite being a high school love,

710
01:09:02,384 --> 01:09:04,384
it's not as jolly as a fantasy world.

711
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:08,345
I won't write about
such an idealistic world.

712
01:09:10,185 --> 01:09:11,464
In reality,

713
01:09:12,185 --> 01:09:13,825
it's hard for men to be in love.

714
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:17,305
Family, friends,

715
01:09:17,865 --> 01:09:19,865
or people next door don't accept it.

716
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:23,464
That's just reality.

717
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:33,744
Oh. It's time for Keunchai's dinner.

718
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:38,504
He's probably starving.

719
01:09:38,584 --> 01:09:39,865
Then,

720
01:09:40,624 --> 01:09:42,225
I won't bother you anymore.

721
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:43,704
Work hard.

722
01:09:45,544 --> 01:09:48,105
Come on, Keunchai. Let's eat.

723
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,584
Come on.

724
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:51,825
Let's eat.

725
01:10:01,624 --> 01:10:03,385
What are you trying to do?

726
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:07,905
Aren't you curious to see

727
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:09,945
what will happen if Mom sees us?

728
01:10:15,624 --> 01:10:16,744
Let me help.

729
01:10:19,145 --> 01:10:20,065
Tofu.

730
01:10:21,704 --> 01:10:22,825
I want coffee.

731
01:10:23,825 --> 01:10:25,465
Wait a second. I'm helping your mom.

732
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:27,585
I want it now.

733
01:10:28,945 --> 01:10:30,945
You should make him coffee.

734
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:49,385
You're so slow.

735
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:52,784
Let me see it.

736
01:10:54,825 --> 01:10:56,065
What are you doing?

737
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:04,225
I want your attention. Can't I do this?

738
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:12,065
You usually know how to make coffee.

739
01:11:18,784 --> 01:11:20,225
Today, I forgot.

740
01:12:10,865 --> 01:12:12,065
In case you're hungry.

741
01:12:14,225 --> 01:12:15,385
Thank you,

742
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,425
but I'm not.

743
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,345
Tofu.

744
01:12:25,985 --> 01:12:28,385
Feed me. My hands are busy.

745
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:49,985
Thanks.

746
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:15,905
SCENE 36. BOOKSTORE. KAWEE, TONNAM.
KAWEE IS LOOKING AT BOOKS ON THE SHELF.

747
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:24,385
KAWEE IS LOOKING
AT THE FRONT OF THE BOOKSTORE.

748
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:33,545
I'll take it off for you.

749
01:13:36,825 --> 01:13:38,265
You can go.

750
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:52,664
Since you're so inspired, any progress?

751
01:13:57,585 --> 01:13:58,624
Quite a lot.

752
01:13:59,585 --> 01:14:00,824
Perfect timing.

753
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:03,465
Do a scene with me.

754
01:14:05,505 --> 01:14:06,624
What scene?

755
01:14:06,704 --> 01:14:07,744
You've only got that.

756
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:10,624
Just do what I say.

757
01:14:11,185 --> 01:14:13,465
Stay still. I'll do the work.

758
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:17,145
Let's do a romantic scene.

759
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:19,545
Like this, Tofu.

760
01:14:20,225 --> 01:14:21,265
What are you doing?

761
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:22,425
Come on.

762
01:14:23,704 --> 01:14:24,664
Nut.

763
01:14:28,624 --> 01:14:29,585
Nut!

764
01:14:33,664 --> 01:14:35,065
Let's talk.

765
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:42,945
What's wrong with you?

766
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,624
Why did you do that?

767
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:50,345
You couldn't write a single scene anyway.

768
01:14:50,425 --> 01:14:52,145
That's my problem.

769
01:14:53,345 --> 01:14:56,505
It's not just your problem.
We live together.

770
01:15:00,025 --> 01:15:02,664
Are you saying that if you're not happy,

771
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,305
no one else is allowed to be happy?

772
01:15:05,385 --> 01:15:06,345
That's not right.

773
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:07,664
Tofu.

774
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:09,225
You saw it.

775
01:15:09,744 --> 01:15:12,985
I went that far, but Mom still ignored me.

776
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:15,945
The more she ignores me,
the more invisible I feel.

777
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:20,664
Nut, it's not your fault
for being who you are,

778
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,585
but it's not hers either.

779
01:15:23,545 --> 01:15:26,865
Your mom is just trying
to keep everyone in the household happy.

780
01:15:26,945 --> 01:15:28,345
It's fake happiness.

781
01:15:28,985 --> 01:15:30,545
She keeps fooling herself.

782
01:15:31,105 --> 01:15:32,784
She has never really known me.

783
01:15:33,305 --> 01:15:35,305
How can we love each other

784
01:15:36,145 --> 01:15:37,624
when we barely know each other?

785
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:39,945
What do you want, then?

786
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:43,905
If she knows the real you, she'll be hurt.

787
01:15:43,985 --> 01:15:46,945
When she's hurt, you're hurt.

788
01:15:47,425 --> 01:15:50,545
It's a circle of pain. When will it end?

789
01:15:53,105 --> 01:15:55,025
Why don't you try talking about it?

790
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,465
I'm sorry.

791
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:07,265
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

792
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:09,985
I just happened to hear it
while passing by.

793
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,865
I'm really sorry.

794
01:16:12,585 --> 01:16:14,145
What are you fighting about?

795
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:24,784
-I'm here.
-You're here.

796
01:16:24,865 --> 01:16:26,545
What took you so long?

797
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,345
Gosh. Oh, take a seat.

798
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:31,385
Well…

799
01:16:33,945 --> 01:16:35,265
Tofu.

800
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:37,345
You don't look so good.

801
01:16:37,425 --> 01:16:38,824
Is there a problem at home?

802
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:42,624
Nut and his mom are fighting.

803
01:16:43,824 --> 01:16:45,585
I don't know how to help.

804
01:16:46,585 --> 01:16:48,385
It's a tough job.

805
01:16:48,465 --> 01:16:50,105
Ever since I moved here,

806
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:52,465
Na and Nut are always arguing.

807
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:55,345
It's not that hard, Nhong.

808
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,225
Of course, there's something we can do.

809
01:16:58,905 --> 01:16:59,824
Listen.

810
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:04,185
Na and Nut are mother and son.

811
01:17:04,265 --> 01:17:07,225
Of course, they have some issues.
It's called a generation gap.

812
01:17:08,865 --> 01:17:10,465
Generation gap?

813
01:17:10,545 --> 01:17:11,465
Right.

814
01:17:12,025 --> 01:17:14,225
Nut grew up in an open world

815
01:17:14,305 --> 01:17:15,784
with freedom

816
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,945
and all sorts of information.

817
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:22,425
Whatever he does or asks, he needs facts.

818
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:25,545
On the other hand,
Na is framed within her society.

819
01:17:25,624 --> 01:17:26,865
She's from my generation.

820
01:17:27,624 --> 01:17:29,985
She needs to be meticulous
in everything she does.

821
01:17:30,065 --> 01:17:31,784
That's her quality.

822
01:17:31,865 --> 01:17:34,145
She was taught that way
since she was born.

823
01:17:35,465 --> 01:17:37,985
They're from different generations.

824
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:39,545
They both have expectations.

825
01:17:39,624 --> 01:17:41,784
Mother expects her son
to be a certain way.

826
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,305
The son expects his mother
to be a certain way.

827
01:17:44,385 --> 01:17:47,744
The expectations
aren't met on either side,

828
01:17:47,824 --> 01:17:51,145
so they hurt each other
without realizing it.

829
01:17:56,425 --> 01:17:59,985
Wherever there's a gap,
you need to pay special attention.

830
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:03,465
It can be dangerous
if the gap is too wide.

831
01:18:05,505 --> 01:18:07,305
How do we reduce the gap?

832
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:09,664
Hey.

833
01:18:09,744 --> 01:18:12,025
The gap can be filled

834
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:13,624
with family ties.

835
01:18:13,704 --> 01:18:16,105
If Nut and Na love each other,

836
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:17,744
they should talk it out

837
01:18:17,824 --> 01:18:19,265
and maintain the ties.

838
01:18:19,345 --> 01:18:21,824
It will be fine
as long as they communicate.

839
01:18:27,545 --> 01:18:29,824
Because Mrs. Na and Nut won't communicate.

840
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:34,385
she does things
without asking what Nut wants,

841
01:18:34,465 --> 01:18:36,624
as she thinks those are her duties

842
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:38,225
as a mother.

843
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:42,065
Nut also has demands from his mom.

844
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:44,065
He always acts sarcastically,

845
01:18:44,664 --> 01:18:46,905
but he doesn't tell her what he wants.

846
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:53,065
The gap between mother and child
should be narrow,

847
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:55,425
but it keeps widening.

848
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,624
I don't want it to be like this.

849
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,545
Is there a way I can help them?

850
01:19:22,664 --> 01:19:23,664
I'm sorry.

851
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:28,945
Okay.

852
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,145
It's not all your fault.

853
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:36,784
I don't know how hard it is to be you,

854
01:19:38,185 --> 01:19:40,624
but it's not easy being your mom either.

855
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:45,905
You might have faced
many things in your life,

856
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:49,545
but your mom has too.

857
01:19:52,865 --> 01:19:55,265
I want you to think about her feelings.

858
01:20:00,265 --> 01:20:01,744
Thanks for reminding me.

859
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:04,985
I'll try to be a better person.

860
01:20:07,985 --> 01:20:10,425
You're not that bad.

861
01:20:11,664 --> 01:20:13,265
Try to be positive.

862
01:20:14,985 --> 01:20:18,425
I think there are a lot more good things
in your life.

863
01:20:20,385 --> 01:20:23,505
You're the good thing in my life.

864
01:20:26,545 --> 01:20:27,784
It's not just me.

865
01:20:29,065 --> 01:20:30,664
Think harder.

866
01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:36,624
I told you.

867
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,824
I won't talk about him anymore.

868
01:20:40,945 --> 01:20:42,225
It's okay.

869
01:20:42,945 --> 01:20:45,025
I want to know everything about you.

870
01:20:47,465 --> 01:20:49,505
I don't want you to act fine,

871
01:20:50,425 --> 01:20:52,185
when you're actually not.

872
01:20:56,744 --> 01:20:59,065
As long as you're not hurt
when you talk about it,

873
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:02,305
I'll be fine.

874
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:10,185
Continue.

875
01:21:11,624 --> 01:21:14,465
After you agreed to go out with Tatarn,

876
01:21:15,345 --> 01:21:16,905
how happy were you?

877
01:21:19,065 --> 01:21:20,704
It wasn't just happiness.

878
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:26,664
The world at home

879
01:21:28,185 --> 01:21:30,065
and the world when I was with him

880
01:21:31,065 --> 01:21:32,305
were drastically different.

881
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:49,824
Nut.

882
01:21:50,425 --> 01:21:53,145
Don't spend too much time on activities.

883
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:55,664
Your dad is worried about your grades.

884
01:21:59,704 --> 01:22:01,185
And regarding that other matter,

885
01:22:01,265 --> 01:22:02,345
you should behave.

886
01:22:03,664 --> 01:22:06,824
I won't stand it if you disobey me.

887
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:11,345
Let's eat.

888
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:12,545
I already ate.

889
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:28,945
My parents act like I don't fit in

890
01:22:29,025 --> 01:22:31,865
and that it's embarrassing.

891
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:46,185
Hey, Nut.

892
01:22:51,704 --> 01:22:52,945
I wrote it.

893
01:23:07,744 --> 01:23:08,664
How is it?

894
01:23:10,624 --> 01:23:11,865
It's great.

895
01:23:15,425 --> 01:23:17,065
-Really?
-Yes.

896
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:25,664
You could become a writer.

897
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:29,585
But Tarn

898
01:23:30,985 --> 01:23:33,744
made me feel like
I had discovered another world.

899
01:23:35,664 --> 01:23:36,945
He made me feel like

900
01:23:38,225 --> 01:23:40,385
I wasn't the only odd one out anymore.

901
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:48,624
Having a rough guy like him around,

902
01:25:49,664 --> 01:25:52,505
who dared to do things
that wouldn't hurt anyone,

903
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:56,345
got me to open my mind
and I started to feel free.

904
01:26:18,145 --> 01:26:19,105
Wait.

905
01:26:21,704 --> 01:26:22,784
Nut!

906
01:26:32,465 --> 01:26:33,744
Happy birthday, Nut.

907
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:38,105
I didn't think I would get one this year.

908
01:26:39,305 --> 01:26:40,784
I wouldn't forget your birthday.

909
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:43,105
I added jelly for you since you like it.

910
01:26:47,425 --> 01:26:48,585
Thank you.

911
01:26:49,664 --> 01:26:50,505
Try it.

912
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:04,225
Is it good?

913
01:27:06,025 --> 01:27:07,065
Feed me.

914
01:27:09,185 --> 01:27:11,824
Okay. You can have a big bite.

915
01:27:11,905 --> 01:27:12,945
Is it too big?

916
01:27:14,065 --> 01:27:14,945
Is it too big?

917
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:18,065
Here you go.

918
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,145
Oh, wow.

919
01:28:17,065 --> 01:28:18,145
Your lips are sweet

920
01:28:19,505 --> 01:28:20,784
and soft like jelly.

921
01:28:38,065 --> 01:28:42,145
What happened to you in the past
made you lose faith in love,

922
01:28:42,225 --> 01:28:43,305
NEXT EPISODE

923
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:46,784
but I'm going to show you
how serious I am about you.

924
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:49,824
The reason you blow up at your mom…

925
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:55,545
is to resist the feeling of love.

926
01:28:56,505 --> 01:28:58,744
But now that you've acknowledged
what happened,

927
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:02,864
you feel better, don't you?

928
01:29:04,624 --> 01:29:06,265
You get irritable with your mom,

929
01:29:07,105 --> 01:29:08,664
but you're not really angry.

930
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:11,465
You just…

931
01:29:12,465 --> 01:29:13,704
hold a grudge.

932
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:15,624
You're such a know-it-all.

933
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:18,265
Mom.

934
01:29:18,345 --> 01:29:20,025
-Mom!
-Mrs. Na.

935
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:22,704
