1
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,905
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,105
Mister.

3
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:10,945
Song!

4
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:15,665
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

5
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,705
But you chose to get involved.

6
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:20,825
I hope you can put an end
to this problem soon

7
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,624
without affecting our work.

8
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,624
Mrs. Na!

9
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:31,425
Are you happy, Nut?

10
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:37,825
Your lips…

11
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:41,545
are sweet and soft like jelly.

12
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,745
Why do you sound like…

13
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,585
Who the hell are you?

14
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:48,945
Why are you doing this?

15
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,865
What do you want from me?

16
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,064
I don't believe you.

17
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:54,904
Who sent you to mess with me?

18
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,545
Tell me!

19
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:00,505
-Nut.
-Come here.

20
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:01,624
Please let go of me.

21
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,265
-Where are we going?
-What's wrong?

22
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,464
Stay out of it, Mom.

23
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,385
-Come.
-Why? Where are you taking him?

24
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:08,425
This is between me and Tofu.
Stay out of it.

25
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:09,705
-What did Tofu do?
-Come.

26
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:11,825
-Come on.
-Nut. Where are you going?

27
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:13,064
-Mom, let go.
-Tofu.

28
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:14,665
Let go.

29
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,184
Nut.

30
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,184
Get in.

31
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:19,865
Get in!

32
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,985
Don't you dare get out!

33
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,105
Where are you taking Tofu?

34
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:28,585
Let go, Mom.

35
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:30,784
Where are you going? It's late.

36
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,585
-Please calm down, Nut.
-Nut.

37
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:34,865
Come out, Tofu.

38
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,425
-Mrs. Na.
-Come out, Tofu.

39
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,305
-Mrs. Na.
-Nut.

40
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:40,265
Nut!

41
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,504
Nut!

42
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,624
-Get out.
-No.

43
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,305
I said get out!

44
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:03,344
I won't.

45
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:04,624
You won't?

46
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,145
Come here!

47
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,305
Can I pick up the slipper first?

48
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:11,425
Stop stalling.

49
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,745
You'll run away.

50
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:13,745
Come here.

51
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:15,025
-Nut.
-Come on!

52
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:16,225
I won't run away.

53
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,064
That's your mom's slipper.

54
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,944
-Come here.
-Nut.

55
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:22,025
Tofu.

56
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:24,625
This is your last chance.

57
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:26,945
Will you tell me the truth,

58
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,345
or should I get the police to make you?

59
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:33,905
I…

60
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,264
I…

61
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:42,625
I am…

62
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,385
I am Tofu.

63
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,345
Fine.

64
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:54,785
Let's see how stubborn you really are.

65
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:55,945
Nut.

66
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,225
-Come here.
-Nut.

67
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:19,305
-Nut.
-Come up here.

68
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,225
Nut.

69
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,584
Officer.

70
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:25,905
Come here. Sit down!

71
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:29,144
Calm down, kid.

72
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:31,985
What's going on?

73
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:34,945
He's a stranger.

74
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:36,584
He's living in my house.

75
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,105
Why are you living in this house, then?

76
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,105
He asked me to take care of his mother.

77
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:42,865
So you know each other?

78
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:44,385
-Yes.
-No.

79
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,345
So what is it? Do you know each other?

80
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,785
Or not?

81
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,185
We do.

82
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,185
This is Nut. His first name is Peeranut.
He's 27 years old.

83
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,065
His mom is Matana. His dog is Kuenchai.

84
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:58,065
Tofu!

85
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,345
That's plenty of information.

86
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,665
You say you don't know him.

87
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,745
He just said

88
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,144
you invited him into your house.

89
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:09,865
Listen to me.

90
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,144
I don't know who he is.

91
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:15,144
My mom felt sorry for him,
so she brought him in.

92
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:17,185
And I let her.

93
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:19,385
But recently,

94
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:21,425
he has been acting strangely,

95
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,865
as if he's plotting something.

96
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,505
Are you?

97
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,665
I'm not plotting anything.

98
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,024
I just…

99
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,945
want to be with Nut.

100
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,745
I don't know what happened.

101
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:44,105
Everything was fine…

102
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,665
until we kissed.

103
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:50,505
You kissed?

104
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:53,745
Wait a minute.

105
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,105
There's no way he's a stranger.

106
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,225
So what is it?

107
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:01,945
Will you report him?

108
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,625
How old are you anyway? You look so young.

109
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,625
I'm not sure.

110
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:13,785
If you report him,

111
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,665
you may be charged with child abduction

112
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:17,945
and false imprisonment.

113
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,024
Those are two charges.

114
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,464
So, are we filing the report?

115
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,464
-Yes.
-No.

116
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,385
All right.

117
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:27,824
What do you want to do?

118
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,425
You should discuss it.

119
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,745
Don't confuse the police.

120
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,065
Stop following me.

121
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,305
Go away.

122
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:57,784
Please don't send me away.

123
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,344
You know I have nowhere to go.

124
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,105
I'm sorry

125
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,505
if I offended you,

126
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,144
but I was telling the truth.

127
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,745
Do you really have amnesia?

128
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,824
What's really wrong with you?

129
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,985
If you're not going to tell me,
then get lost.

130
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:37,945
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

131
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,424
I'm your teddy bear.

132
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:03,825
I have no idea

133
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,265
how I turned into a human.

134
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:30,105
I never thought you would be such a liar.

135
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,105
Can I believe anything you've said?

136
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:11,944
Nut. I'm Tofu.

137
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,505
Nut.

138
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,064
Nut

139
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,424
Don't leave me, Nut.

140
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:19,424
Nut.

141
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,985
I really am yours.

142
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:25,505
Nut.

143
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:27,625
Nut, open the door.

144
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:29,905
Nut.

145
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,865
I really am yours.

146
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,905
Nut, wait for me.

147
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:54,785
Nut, wait for me.

148
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:00,705
Nut!

149
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:05,585
Nut.

150
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:14,705
I really am yours.

151
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:17,225
Nut!

152
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,064
I'm sorry

153
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,025
if I offended you,

154
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:41,944
but I was telling the truth.

155
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,745
Do you really have amnesia?

156
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:45,145
What's really wrong with you?

157
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,025
Your lips are sweet

158
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:01,985
and soft like jelly.

159
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:04,944
Your lips…

160
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,905
are sweet and soft like jelly.

161
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:11,625
Who the hell are you?

162
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:13,345
Why are you doing this?

163
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,304
What do you want from me?

164
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,865
Who sent you to mess with me?

165
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,824
Tell me!

166
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:29,184
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

167
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,385
Why did you have to lie?

168
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,304
What a coward.

169
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,345
Would it hurt
to get your phone out and call Nut?

170
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:43,345
Do you want him to leave you?

171
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,824
How could someone leave
a person they love?

172
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,665
Can't you see he has already left?

173
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:53,145
Do you think he'll come back
for you like in a Korean drama?

174
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,824
If you're not going to call Nut,

175
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:58,265
then get up and find my Little One.

176
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,225
Okay.

177
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:36,184
I remember she fell off around here.

178
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:38,184
Little One!

179
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,225
Little One!

180
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:42,424
Ms. Left Slipper.

181
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,424
Ms. Left Slipper.

182
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,265
Walk around and look for her.

183
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,745
Little One!

184
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,505
Little One!

185
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,944
Little One!

186
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,985
Tofu is safe. He's with me.

187
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:24,424
He told me that Nut kicked him
out of the house.

188
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:27,265
I'll let him stay with me tonight.

189
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:29,544
Let's wait for Nut to calm down.

190
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,745
I'll talk to him.

191
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,265
Thank you.

192
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:35,544
You're welcome.

193
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,184
Tofu.

194
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:45,105
What did you do to him?
Why is he so mad at you?

195
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,625
I didn't do anything.

196
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:52,064
I just kissed him.

197
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:53,824
You kissed him?

198
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:55,665
He kissed me back too.

199
00:16:58,704 --> 00:16:59,785
Well…

200
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,345
We kissed each other.

201
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:03,145
That's enough.

202
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:04,944
I get it now.

203
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:08,024
They just kissed.

204
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:09,585
Why would he get mad?

205
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:13,305
Wait, who's that with Gen?

206
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:14,825
Is it Song?

207
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:16,744
It looks like Song.

208
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,184
Is he finally telling us about it?

209
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,145
Hello.

210
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,065
Hello.

211
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,264
This is Tofu.

212
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,865
The kid from Nut's house
that I told you about.

213
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:35,065
They had a fight,

214
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,984
so I thought
I would let him stay here tonight.

215
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:42,065
I'll get the first aid kit.

216
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,865
Have you eaten anything?

217
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,504
Not yet.

218
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:55,705
Here's some hot porridge.
I made it myself.

219
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:56,625
Thank you.

220
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:57,545
Here.

221
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,945
Thank you.

222
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,425
Yours is over there.

223
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,665
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

224
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,545
What did you fight about this time?

225
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:14,785
I…

226
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:17,425
was just going to kiss…

227
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:21,145
-Tofu!
-What are you doing, Gen?

228
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,465
You spilled it everywhere.

229
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,465
He said something rude.

230
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,264
Something

231
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,984
that might cause adults to freak out.

232
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:31,705
It wasn't rude.

233
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:38,545
Well, maybe a little.

234
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:43,264
It was just a misunderstanding.

235
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:46,264
You see,
Nut has always been temperamental.

236
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,825
-You know him.
-That's right.

237
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,784
Do you know Nut well?

238
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:54,905
I used to see him when he was a kid.

239
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:56,465
He came to work with his dad.

240
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:59,065
We barely spoke though.

241
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:03,425
We only started speaking
when he became friends with Gen.

242
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,385
Did you know Nut's dad?

243
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,145
We were classmates
in the military academy.

244
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:12,465
What was his dad like?

245
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,945
I want Nut to apply to the academy.

246
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:18,705
What about your son?
Will he apply next year?

247
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,345
My son doesn't want to.

248
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:22,425
What?

249
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,665
He's a man and a soldier's son.

250
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,305
It would be a waste
if he doesn't join the military.

251
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:32,504
Nut has to join the military.

252
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:38,385
He was a determined, serious man.

253
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,425
He was also a strong leader.

254
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,105
We were just acquaintances though.

255
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:44,905
We weren't close friends.

256
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:49,385
It was a shame that he died young.

257
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,984
Nut's mom was very upset.

258
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:55,665
Sibmeun really loved his family though.

259
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:58,825
But from what Nut said,

260
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,545
his dad was really strict with him.

261
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:07,225
I see. That must be why
Nut never talks about his dad.

262
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,945
There aren't any photos
of him at home either.

263
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:14,385
He probably loved them in his own way.

264
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:16,705
He wanted a bright future for Nut

265
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:18,585
as a leader.

266
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,825
So he was trying
to lay a path for Nut in the military,

267
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,225
to follow in his footsteps.

268
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,305
I guess he forgot

269
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:28,264
that everyone
has to follow their own path.

270
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,545
Dad.

271
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,784
Did you ever want me to be a soldier?

272
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:39,945
No.

273
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,465
Actually,

274
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,585
I kind of wanted you to be a doctor.

275
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:46,585
I just thought that

276
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:49,225
if you wanted to follow in our footsteps,

277
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:53,305
we would be able to guide you
better than other career paths.

278
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,545
In the end, though, it's up to you.

279
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,024
You have to decide what you want to be.

280
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,625
Every job has its pros and cons.

281
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,545
If you do a job you enjoy,

282
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:08,105
at least, you will be happy.

283
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,625
Then you will do that job well.

284
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:16,665
Mom.

285
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,705
-What is it?
-What?

286
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,545
-What's going on?
-I'm touched.

287
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:21,945
-Touched?
-Gen.

288
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:24,465
I thought you wanted to wipe your mouth.

289
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:26,465
-Here.
-Come on.

290
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:28,984
Our little puppy.

291
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:30,185
Puppies come from dogs.

292
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,665
-That backfired.
-Look at him.

293
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:34,225
You're never like this.

294
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,504
-Come on.
-Okay, you're touched.

295
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:38,585
I love you too.

296
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,264
-Can I hug you?
-Come here.

297
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:42,905
You little puppy.

298
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:45,984
Had Nut had a warm

299
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:48,105
and understanding family,

300
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:53,945
he would've grown up to be
a happy young man like Gen.

301
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:03,385
THE LITTLE PRINCE

302
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:08,345
You're home.

303
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:12,984
What's wrong?

304
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,544
Can you tell me?

305
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:52,705
SONG: SLEEPING ALONE
MUST BE LONELY, MISTER

306
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,225
I'M NOT LONELY

307
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,105
I HAVE SOMEONE TO SLEEP WITH

308
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:18,945
Gen.

309
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,705
What?

310
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:23,264
Will I get to live with Nut again?

311
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:28,305
I don't know.

312
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,185
You and Nut are the only ones who know.

313
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:34,865
It's up to your hearts

314
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,984
if you want to get back together.

315
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,865
I really want to.

316
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:45,105
But…

317
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:48,465
Nut…

318
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,744
Stop sulking.

319
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:55,385
Nut is just confused.

320
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:58,264
It's hard for him to move on

321
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,625
and start over, you know?

322
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:06,665
He probably had high hopes,

323
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:10,065
and you must have disappointed him.

324
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,304
Give him time.

325
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,544
I'll talk to him.

326
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:35,585
SONG: WHO? WHO ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH?

327
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,865
ARE YOU CHEATING ON ME?

328
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:44,984
MISTER, DON'T

329
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:47,145
Nut.

330
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:50,585
I want to be back by your side.

331
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:54,185
I will not give up.

332
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:04,385
BE WITH YOU

333
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:06,984
Wait.

334
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:09,264
You're not Neung.

335
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,744
Isn't he your friend?

336
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,784
He fell from your balcony
yesterday morning.

337
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:35,865
Who gave you that pork recipe?

338
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,105
I just followed my gut.

339
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:51,625
I'm your teddy bear.

340
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,825
I'm your teddy bear.

341
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,264
But…

342
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,585
I have no idea

343
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,304
how I turned into a human.

344
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:48,544
Do you really think Tofu is a teddy bear?

345
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:50,865
Who would be that crazy?

346
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,865
I just thought it might have
something to do with…

347
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:57,024
Is this about your ex again?

348
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,225
Do you think your ex revolves around you

349
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:04,705
like a planet orbiting around the sun?

350
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,705
I'm not just imagining it.

351
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:10,984
I have my reasons.

352
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:15,264
Tofu reminds me of him all the time.

353
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:20,105
Nut, there are tens of millions of people
in this country.

354
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:23,064
Don't you think
some of them talk and think alike?

355
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,905
Tofu could've watched the same movies,

356
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:28,784
read the same books,

357
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:31,585
and listened to the same songs as your ex.

358
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:33,425
That's why he said that.

359
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,185
But what he said was special.

360
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,385
He used the exact same words.

361
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,425
So what?

362
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:43,984
Did you think he sent Tofu here
to steal your teddy bear,

363
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:46,225
say those lines,

364
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,665
and love you in his place?

365
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,385
If you can't answer it,

366
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:59,185
why bother thinking about
impossible questions like that?

367
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,385
You should think about the question
that you can answer.

368
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,825
Do you still want Tofu in your life?

369
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:40,665
So it's you

370
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,465
who was with him.

371
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:47,304
Why do you need to borrow my laptop?

372
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:48,865
To get Nut back.

373
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:20,225
I'M NOT LONELY WITHOUT YOU

374
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,784
Why did you go to my house?

375
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,544
Where are you taking Tofu?

376
00:31:34,465 --> 00:31:35,304
Here.

377
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,425
I guess that's love.

378
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:43,585
Even though he kicked you out,

379
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,385
you still look after his mom.

380
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:49,824
I promised Nut

381
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,225
that I would take care of her.

382
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,744
Even if he's still mad at me,

383
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:58,385
I need to keep my promise.

384
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:00,945
True love.

385
00:32:04,304 --> 00:32:05,345
I'm going now.

386
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,705
Okay.

387
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,264
-Look, Tofu is here.
-Tofu.

388
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:20,744
-Tofu is here.
-Tofu.

389
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:22,225
What a relief.

390
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:25,465
I was praying for your safety all night.

391
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:30,625
What about Ms. Left Slipper?

392
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:46,984
Why did you come back alone?

393
00:32:47,504 --> 00:32:51,504
Mr. Right Slipper,
where's your girlfriend?

394
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,345
I lost Ms. Left Slipper.

395
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,024
What?

396
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:00,744
My goodness.

397
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,625
Little One shouldn't have helped you.

398
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:06,585
You always call others ignorant.

399
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,824
Well, your girlfriend
can't ignore you now.

400
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,784
I promise you, Mr. Right Slipper,

401
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:21,585
I'll find Little One.

402
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,824
I would never lose Mrs. Na's belongings.

403
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:36,304
Where's Mrs. Na?

404
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:44,384
Oh…

405
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:50,145
Thank you.

406
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,465
Let me help.

407
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,505
It wouldn't be as pretty
had I done it myself.

408
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,505
Thank you for helping me.

409
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:11,904
You're welcome.

410
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:23,265
This area still seems a bit bare.

411
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,745
Shall we buy some more plants?

412
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:31,505
Are you free this Saturday?

413
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:38,985
Let's take a photo

414
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:44,505
as a memento of the three of us
arranging the garden together.

415
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,705
I'll put the chair away.

416
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:53,384
Let me help.

417
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:52,745
I need to research a lot
for the subject I teach,

418
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:55,424
in order to explain it to the children.

419
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,904
But the more I research,

420
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:02,904
the more questions I have.

421
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,464
Do you think

422
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,625
Thai people really did migrate
from the Altai Mountains?

423
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:13,424
And did the villagers of Bang Rachan

424
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:17,585
really die fighting to protect Ayutthaya?

425
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:20,904
So,

426
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:23,265
is it not true?

427
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:27,464
Well,

428
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,825
I don't know much about this stuff.

429
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:33,985
You might have to explain it to me
a bit more.

430
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:39,545
Would you mind

431
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,705
if I asked you to come
and explain it to me every day?

432
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:48,825
Maybe Thais didn't migrate here

433
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:50,985
but have always been in this area.

434
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:56,745
As for Bang Rachan, they didn't fight
for anyone but themselves.

435
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:00,384
Is that what you think?

436
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:06,305
History isn't a record
of what actually happened.

437
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:10,265
It's just distorted recollections

438
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:14,864
that are retold in a way
that suits whoever is telling them.

439
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:16,785
Do you agree?

440
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,065
I didn't think…

441
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,585
you would be interested in history.

442
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,225
I like to read.

443
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:31,464
History, philosophy, and literature.

444
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:34,585
This one

445
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:36,985
is my favorite.

446
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,065
THE LITTLE PRINCE

447
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:39,384
"The Little Prince."

448
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:44,105
I really like
the illustrations in this book.

449
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,825
But when I was at school,

450
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,785
I didn't really understand it.

451
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:52,545
They say,

452
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,864
older people perceive
The Little Prince differently

453
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:58,305
than children.

454
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:01,665
You should read it again.

455
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:04,705
You might understand
and perceive it differently this time.

456
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:08,145
Okay.

457
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:22,185
Sib.

458
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,105
Mrs. Na.

459
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:32,944
When did you get here, Tofu?

460
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,025
Just now.

461
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,825
Do you remember Mr. Sibmeun now?

462
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:47,625
Do you want to tell me anything?

463
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:57,705
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

464
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,545
You all look happy in this picture.

465
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,025
Why don't you want to think about it?

466
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,384
Sometimes you are happy

467
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,265
at the start of a nightmare, Tofu.

468
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,665
We can't have good dreams all the time.

469
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,745
I have a secret to tell you.

470
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:35,665
You're the first one to know.

471
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:45,625
I've just started dreaming recently.

472
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,424
Whenever I have a nightmare,

473
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:51,625
I would really be glad when I wake up,

474
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:54,424
because I know it's just a dream.

475
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:56,185
It has passed.

476
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,025
The monster in my dream
can't hurt me anymore.

477
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,985
Whenever I have a good dream,

478
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:05,105
I'm happy all day long.

479
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,944
Don't you want

480
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:13,185
to go back to sleep

481
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,384
to continue the good dream?

482
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:18,225
No.

483
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:20,864
In my real life, I have Nut,

484
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,345
you,

485
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:26,065
and many other friends.

486
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,265
Sometimes I'm happy. Sometimes I'm sad.

487
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,384
But it's reality.

488
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,625
I wouldn't trade it for a dream.

489
00:41:58,384 --> 00:41:59,464
Mrs. Na.

490
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:02,944
Some nights you have good dreams.

491
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,904
Some nights you have bad dreams.

492
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,505
But in the end,

493
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,825
you have to wake up.

494
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:46,625
I've decided

495
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:49,384
to borrow some money
from Sakon to help Na.

496
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:53,384
Have you thought it through?

497
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,705
She's struggling.

498
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:58,105
She has to pay for her house
and her grandmother's medical bills.

499
00:42:58,185 --> 00:42:59,105
What can I do?

500
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:00,625
It's pointless.

501
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,665
You won't hold her grandmother back.

502
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:05,185
It will just prolong her suffering.

503
00:43:05,745 --> 00:43:08,825
In the end,
the person who will suffer the most is Na.

504
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:12,384
Is it Na or you who will suffer?

505
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,065
Do you think I don't know
what you're trying to do?

506
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:20,424
Is it only a soldier with a bright future
like you who deserves Na?

507
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:23,785
When we were kids, I may not have been
as good as you at anything,

508
00:43:24,545 --> 00:43:27,545
but I won't let you
walk all over me this time.

509
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,025
You know Na loves me.

510
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:34,705
I'm warning you with good intentions.

511
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:38,785
Think it through.
The money will cause you trouble.

512
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:42,345
I have thought it through.

513
00:43:43,065 --> 00:43:45,065
I will show both you and Na

514
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:47,785
that I can make her happy too.

515
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,745
May I give him a sponge bath?

516
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:13,665
Go ahead.

517
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:51,345
The lab results are in.

518
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:54,384
We found a bloodstain
on the living room floor,

519
00:45:54,864 --> 00:45:56,424
but it had been cleaned.

520
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,944
That means a fight occurred here.

521
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:01,545
I think Tatarn

522
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,464
could have been injured and moved.

523
00:46:05,505 --> 00:46:07,505
So, it seems like
he was attacked and killed.

524
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:09,345
That means Saen lied to us.

525
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,904
Should we issue a warrant?

526
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:17,305
Not yet. Don't alert him.

527
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:23,065
He went this far to deceive us.
He and his wife must have a solid plan.

528
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:26,505
Find some solid evidence against him,

529
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:28,464
then we'll arrest him.

530
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:41,464
Lieutenant.

531
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:43,505
Have a look around.

532
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:45,225
There must be more evidence.

533
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,464
Yes, sir.

534
00:46:55,705 --> 00:46:58,305
Do you remember what I told you?

535
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:00,585
About someone Tarn liked.

536
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:04,185
I do.

537
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:07,464
I would ask permission
to enter Tarn's house

538
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,384
to find clues about this person.

539
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:14,785
I want to create a miracle.

540
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:22,225
TO NUT, FROM TOFU

541
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:04,545
Excuse me, sir.

542
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:05,505
It's the commander.

543
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:08,904
Yes.

544
00:48:09,384 --> 00:48:10,665
Roger that.

545
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:30,384
"Be with you."

546
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:32,424
BE WITH YOU

547
00:49:32,984 --> 00:49:33,984
What are you doing?

548
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:39,384
I'm not doing anything.

549
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:41,345
I'm just arranging your books.

550
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:44,904
Why this book?

551
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:47,424
Well?

552
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:55,185
And this.

553
00:49:56,345 --> 00:49:59,185
You hid the teddy's scarf
in my room, didn't you?

554
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:01,384
Didn't you?

555
00:50:03,785 --> 00:50:04,904
I didn't.

556
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:08,545
It had fallen, so I put it away.

557
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:10,545
Don't lie!

558
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:13,864
You were going through my personal stuff!

559
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:15,585
What do you want?

560
00:50:16,065 --> 00:50:18,745
Nut. You said you would talk about it.

561
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:20,345
Yes. Talk to him nicely.

562
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:22,705
Right. Calm down.

563
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:24,785
How can I calm down?

564
00:50:25,384 --> 00:50:26,825
The scarf. The book.

565
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,864
Still think it's unrelated?

566
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:35,185
He sent you, didn't he?

567
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:36,665
Who did?

568
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:39,545
Don't act innocent.

569
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:41,625
Answer me!

570
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,864
If you think someone sent me,
why don't you ask them?

571
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,345
I want to know

572
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,464
who he is

573
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:09,625
and why he's so important to you.

574
00:51:10,185 --> 00:51:12,145
Why do you keep insisting I know him?

575
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:29,145
I've told you everything.

576
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:31,504
If you still don't believe me,

577
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:33,345
then I don't know what to do.

578
00:51:36,665 --> 00:51:38,145
I really don't know

579
00:51:38,785 --> 00:51:40,225
how I got here.

580
00:51:41,825 --> 00:51:43,944
It's not some plan.

581
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:49,345
I just want to stay here with you.

582
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,585
I want to take care of you.

583
00:51:56,785 --> 00:51:57,984
Take care of your mom.

584
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:02,864
That's all.

585
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:19,145
If you don't want me anymore,

586
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:23,424
I'll leave.

587
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:21,785
You're with Tofu almost all the time.

588
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,625
Do you really not know
what kind of person he is?

589
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:32,665
So,

590
00:53:33,225 --> 00:53:35,384
you no longer
want him in your life, do you?

591
00:53:57,145 --> 00:53:58,504
Are you really leaving, Tofu?

592
00:54:04,265 --> 00:54:05,745
Nut won't let me stay here.

593
00:54:08,864 --> 00:54:10,745
I don't want you to leave.

594
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:16,384
If you miss me,

595
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:18,825
you can call.

596
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:28,585
Be a good boy, Kuenchai.

597
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,904
Take care of Mrs. Na for me.

598
00:54:35,384 --> 00:54:37,225
Where are you going to stay?

599
00:54:38,665 --> 00:54:40,305
He can stay with me.

600
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:43,145
I live alone. My dad won't mind.

601
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:48,625
Don't worry.

602
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:51,185
You can't stay with Song, can you?

603
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:53,904
He's Nut's friend after all.

604
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,785
My house would be the best option.

605
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,384
Thank you.

606
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,585
I'll go now.

607
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:37,265
Goodbye.

608
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:40,825
I'll sneak back sometime.

609
00:56:31,944 --> 00:56:33,225
Let's go home.

610
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:01,225
Song.

611
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:03,464
I need to do something.

612
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:05,145
Can you help me?

613
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:12,105
A left slipper?

614
00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:13,745
Yes.

615
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:15,944
It's pink and fluffy.

616
00:57:16,825 --> 00:57:18,745
I remember I dropped it here.

617
00:57:20,345 --> 00:57:21,825
Can you help me find it?

618
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:23,625
I'll look over there, then.

619
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:25,305
You might not know who Tofu is
or where he came from,

620
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:27,984
but he has never hurt you, has he?

621
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:30,424
He's a nice kid.

622
00:58:30,504 --> 00:58:32,545
Will you really let him go like that?

623
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,625
Think it through.

624
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,305
If you really don't want him in your life,

625
00:58:39,944 --> 00:58:41,585
I'll take him somewhere else.

626
00:58:46,464 --> 00:58:47,825
But an amnesiac

627
00:58:48,384 --> 00:58:50,145
with no family background like him,

628
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,225
where could he go

629
00:58:53,105 --> 00:58:54,585
but a foster home?

630
00:58:56,864 --> 00:58:58,944
That's what you were going to do before.

631
00:58:59,024 --> 00:59:00,145
I guess it's fine.

632
00:59:03,545 --> 00:59:04,424
Good.

633
00:59:04,944 --> 00:59:06,984
You won't have to see him anymore.

634
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:09,665
You won't have to worry
when he does something wrong,

635
00:59:09,745 --> 00:59:11,864
or get paranoid about your ex.

636
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:14,464
Just go back to your old life.

637
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:17,464
The life you lived before he came along.

638
00:59:19,345 --> 00:59:20,984
Are you okay with that?

639
00:59:22,785 --> 00:59:23,984
Are you?

640
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:37,185
Just buy some new ones.

641
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:39,785
I can buy them if you don't have money.

642
00:59:39,864 --> 00:59:41,185
It's not the same.

643
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:44,825
It belongs to Mrs. Na.
It's more than just a slipper.

644
00:59:45,305 --> 00:59:46,625
It's like a friend.

645
00:59:48,225 --> 00:59:49,145
A friend?

646
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:52,864
Oh, I meant…

647
00:59:53,745 --> 00:59:55,265
A friend for your foot.

648
00:59:56,265 --> 00:59:58,705
Everything has its value.

649
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:00,545
Some things can't be replaced.

650
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:02,944
I see.

651
01:00:03,745 --> 01:00:05,065
Let's find it, then.

652
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:08,944
Tofu, help me!

653
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:10,065
Ms. Left Slipper.

654
01:00:10,145 --> 01:00:12,424
Tofu, help me!

655
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:13,504
Is that it, Tofu?

656
01:00:13,585 --> 01:00:14,825
Yes.

657
01:00:19,024 --> 01:00:20,105
Mr. Dog.

658
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:25,345
Calm down, Mr. Dog.

659
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,504
May I have Ms. Left Slipper back?

660
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:29,705
Ms. Left Slipper!

661
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:33,665
Mr. Dog, stop!

662
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:34,665
Ms. Left Slipper.

663
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:37,984
Please stop.

664
01:00:40,665 --> 01:00:41,504
Ms. Left Slipper.

665
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:43,745
Mr. Dog, stop.

666
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:46,265
Please let go of Ms. Left Slipper.

667
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:47,665
-Whoa.
-Oh, my.

668
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:49,265
Hey. Watch where you're going.

669
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,785
I'm sorry.

670
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,585
You've messed up all my stuff.

671
01:00:53,185 --> 01:00:54,105
I'm sorry.

672
01:00:58,345 --> 01:00:59,785
Mr. Dog, stop.

673
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:02,024
Mr. Dog!

674
01:01:07,024 --> 01:01:08,105
Tofu!

675
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:11,105
Tofu!

676
01:01:11,825 --> 01:01:13,024
Mr. Dog.

677
01:01:13,105 --> 01:01:14,265
You pervert!

678
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:16,305
My gosh.

679
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:20,705
I never thought a pretty boy
would be like this.

680
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:23,065
It's not like that.

681
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:24,984
I was looking for a dog.

682
01:01:25,065 --> 01:01:28,185
What dog? I didn't see one.
Don't lie to me.

683
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:30,024
Right. Let's take him to the police.

684
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:31,345
-Grab him.
-It's not that.

685
01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:33,625
The proof is in your hand.

686
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,225
-Look at that.
-It's right in your hand.

687
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:38,464
-Please let go.
-I need to take pictures.

688
01:01:38,545 --> 01:01:39,464
-Song, help.
-Look.

689
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:42,065
Excuse me. That's my friend.
He's not a thief.

690
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:44,345
You came together? Are you a pervert too?

691
01:01:44,424 --> 01:01:46,185
-I'm not.
-Great.

692
01:01:46,265 --> 01:01:47,265
-No.
-Hey, Oh!

693
01:01:47,345 --> 01:01:48,785
-Those are your bras.
-Miss.

694
01:01:48,864 --> 01:01:50,745
-That's not true.
-I'm not a pervert.

695
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:51,745
Come here, pervert.

696
01:01:51,825 --> 01:01:52,984
I wasn't doing anything.

697
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,745
I don't believe you.
Tell it to the police.

698
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:57,464
Such a pretty boy. What a shame.

699
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:00,305
Come here! Come on, pervert.

700
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,625
I didn't do anything.

701
01:02:01,705 --> 01:02:03,464
It was brand new.

702
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:06,105
What a pervert. Go inside!

703
01:02:06,745 --> 01:02:09,785
Wait. What happened?

704
01:02:09,864 --> 01:02:10,984
-Well…
-Well…

705
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:13,345
What is it? Tell me.

706
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,345
-The thing is…
-The thing is…

707
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:20,464
Song has probably taken him
far away by now.

708
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:23,464
You kicked him out, now you're worried.

709
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:25,424
How touching.

710
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:31,185
Nut.

711
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:34,625
Tell me what you want to do.

712
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:36,944
I'll support you.

713
01:02:38,745 --> 01:02:40,024
But I'm warning you,

714
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:42,504
if you leave this unresolved,

715
01:02:42,984 --> 01:02:45,984
you won't be able to focus on work.

716
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:48,944
I--

717
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,065
Nut.

718
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:53,864
Great timing.

719
01:02:57,225 --> 01:02:58,065
Sit!

720
01:02:58,705 --> 01:03:00,825
What's the commotion about?

721
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:04,625
It's this pervert.
He was stealing my bras.

722
01:03:04,705 --> 01:03:06,944
I caught him red-handed.

723
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:08,225
-Right.
-I see.

724
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:09,145
Wait.

725
01:03:09,225 --> 01:03:10,904
Last night, didn't you…

726
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:12,265
kiss a guy?

727
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:13,665
-Now,
-What?

728
01:03:13,745 --> 01:03:15,705
you're stealing women's bras?

729
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:17,464
What are you actually into?

730
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:19,225
It's not like that.

731
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:21,984
I was following a dog
and ran into the rack.

732
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:24,424
I told them that, but no one believed me.

733
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:26,065
Liar.

734
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:27,825
We saw with our own eyes

735
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,545
that you grabbed a handful of bras.

736
01:03:31,105 --> 01:03:33,185
Officer, here are the goods.

737
01:03:33,265 --> 01:03:34,585
-I…
-Right.

738
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:37,305
They got wrapped around my hands
when I was getting up.

739
01:03:38,504 --> 01:03:41,424
There you go. You're a pervert. A thief!

740
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:43,504
-Such a pretty boy. What a shame.
-Enough.

741
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:46,464
That's enough. I'll question him.

742
01:03:46,544 --> 01:03:47,984
Wait a minute, Lieutenant.

743
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:49,145
What is it?

744
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,745
No need to question him. Someone called
to confirm it was a misunderstanding.

745
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:54,705
-A misunderstanding?
-Gosh.

746
01:03:54,785 --> 01:03:55,785
Who is it?

747
01:03:57,904 --> 01:03:59,305
There. Here he is.

748
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:05,785
Go in, Nut.

749
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,065
What are you waiting for?

750
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,225
Hurry up.

751
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:17,625
What's the matter?

752
01:04:18,705 --> 01:04:19,825
I'm bailing someone out.

753
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:21,384
Who?

754
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,305
Someone said our friend got arrested

755
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,544
for stealing bras.

756
01:04:30,944 --> 01:04:32,024
I see.

757
01:04:33,825 --> 01:04:34,984
Wait.

758
01:04:35,065 --> 01:04:36,785
Oh, that's right.

759
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:40,105
The kid who said
he kissed you last night, right?

760
01:04:44,024 --> 01:04:44,984
Yes.

761
01:04:47,065 --> 01:04:48,145
Someone took him.

762
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:49,065
What?

763
01:04:49,145 --> 01:04:50,185
Just now.

764
01:04:50,745 --> 01:04:51,984
Who bailed him out?

765
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:08,864
Thank goodness you came to Bangkok,

766
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:10,904
or Tofu could've been arrested.

767
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:12,145
No.

768
01:05:12,225 --> 01:05:15,504
The security camera shows
that he didn't do anything.

769
01:05:17,185 --> 01:05:20,185
Thank you for helping me anyway.

770
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:23,305
No problem.

771
01:05:23,904 --> 01:05:25,384
Come on. Let's go inside.

772
01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:27,345
We'll decide what to do later.

773
01:05:30,424 --> 01:05:31,864
Don't worry.

774
01:05:32,424 --> 01:05:35,825
If you really can't go back,
I'll find a way to help.

775
01:05:42,944 --> 01:05:44,825
Don't worry. Let's go.

776
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:54,024
Nut.

777
01:05:54,944 --> 01:05:56,185
Where's Tofu?

778
01:05:57,424 --> 01:05:59,024
Is he in jail?

779
01:06:00,345 --> 01:06:01,384
I can't believe it.

780
01:06:01,464 --> 01:06:03,105
He seemed so innocent.

781
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:04,745
He was a poor choice.

782
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:06,625
When you're looking for a boyfriend…

783
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:07,904
Well,

784
01:06:07,984 --> 01:06:11,265
I mean someone to look after your mom,
you should be more careful.

785
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:25,305
Thanks for going with me.

786
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:27,464
Get home safely.

787
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:38,185
Excuse me.

788
01:06:39,544 --> 01:06:40,585
What?

789
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:43,424
You seem lonely,
like you have no friends to talk to.

790
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:47,544
Right. Nut told me you live alone.

791
01:06:48,145 --> 01:06:49,544
Your husband doesn't visit.

792
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:54,105
You should find something useful
to do with your spare time,

793
01:06:54,185 --> 01:06:56,105
so you don't have to butt in…

794
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:58,504
I mean bother yourself
with other people's matters.

795
01:06:58,585 --> 01:07:00,585
Thank you for bringing us the news.

796
01:07:00,665 --> 01:07:02,504
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Sad…

797
01:07:03,384 --> 01:07:04,225
jaree.

798
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:06,544
You punk! Come out!

799
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,225
You punk! Come back!

800
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:09,265
Come back!

801
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:33,384
You seem lonely,
like you have no friends to talk to.

802
01:07:34,024 --> 01:07:37,225
Right. Nut told me you live alone.

803
01:07:37,984 --> 01:07:39,625
Your husband doesn't visit.

804
01:08:34,664 --> 01:08:35,865
Why are you following me?

805
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:37,544
Who sent you?

806
01:08:37,624 --> 01:08:39,345
Who?

807
01:08:50,905 --> 01:08:51,985
VIEW SATHORN PROPERTY

808
01:09:03,384 --> 01:09:04,305
SAEN

809
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:09,025
Why are you calling?

810
01:09:09,704 --> 01:09:11,624
I'll visit you at home tomorrow.

811
01:09:20,544 --> 01:09:23,065
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

812
01:09:57,664 --> 01:10:00,545
To Nut, from Tofu.

813
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:12,305
Tofu kissed Nut.
He felt so good that he started crying.

814
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:14,985
Nut asked, "Why are you crying?"

815
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,985
Tofu answered, "I don't know.
I only know that it's sweet.

816
01:10:21,145 --> 01:10:22,465
It's so sweet I'm scared."

817
01:10:23,025 --> 01:10:24,985
Nut smiles sweetly at Tofu.

818
01:10:25,465 --> 01:10:26,784
Nut adores Tofu.

819
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,105
Tofu smiles back at Nut.

820
01:10:29,704 --> 01:10:32,265
Come on. Help me.
You should help your dad.

821
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:35,465
You do this one.

822
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:43,225
Nut.

823
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:46,545
If I were a screenplay writer,

824
01:10:47,784 --> 01:10:49,664
and I could write my own ending,

825
01:10:52,425 --> 01:10:54,385
I would want it to be like this.

826
01:10:57,905 --> 01:10:59,945
I want us not to fight.

827
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:03,025
I want us to be happy.

828
01:11:25,905 --> 01:11:27,345
Is it that moving?

829
01:11:32,265 --> 01:11:35,545
All right. Come, Tofu. Let's eat.

830
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,865
Then Song can take you upstairs.

831
01:11:39,624 --> 01:11:40,905
Come on. Give me a hand.

832
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:42,305
Here.

833
01:11:42,784 --> 01:11:43,784
Sure.

834
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,425
I'm full. Let's take a walk.

835
01:11:58,905 --> 01:12:02,385
Since you'll be staying here for a while,
you might as well look around.

836
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:04,585
Come on. I'll show you my favorite place.

837
01:12:05,465 --> 01:12:06,305
Here.

838
01:12:35,345 --> 01:12:37,385
Do you like basketball that much?

839
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:42,345
It's Neung's stuff.

840
01:12:42,985 --> 01:12:44,065
It's all old.

841
01:12:44,744 --> 01:12:46,025
Mine is in that box.

842
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,585
I would like you to stay in my room,

843
01:13:01,664 --> 01:13:03,105
but it's small and messy.

844
01:13:03,185 --> 01:13:05,025
Stay in Neung's room instead.

845
01:13:05,505 --> 01:13:06,905
You look the same anyway.

846
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,784
It will be like Neung still lives here.

847
01:13:27,865 --> 01:13:30,225
Yes, it will.

848
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:35,505
Is the room okay?

849
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,545
Yes.

850
01:13:39,465 --> 01:13:40,505
Wait a minute.

851
01:14:11,065 --> 01:14:13,065
Let's play games when you've had a shower.

852
01:14:14,025 --> 01:14:14,905
Okay.

853
01:14:42,784 --> 01:14:45,425
Am I really never
going to see Nut anymore?

854
01:14:55,945 --> 01:14:59,425
TOFU TOFU UPDATED HIS PROFILE PICTURE.

855
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:05,545
TOFU: I MISS NUT.

856
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:50,784
Why do I look like you?

857
01:15:55,345 --> 01:15:57,025
Why am I like this?

858
01:15:57,985 --> 01:15:59,425
What happened to me?

859
01:16:07,905 --> 01:16:10,145
I was Nut's teddy bear.

860
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:12,664
Why did I become your look-alike?

861
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:17,945
The person Nut loves…

862
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:25,305
Who did this to me?

863
01:16:40,704 --> 01:16:42,945
Where can I find the answers?

864
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:37,385
What are you doing, Dad?

865
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:44,505
What is it?

866
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:46,345
I saw someone.

867
01:17:46,905 --> 01:17:48,505
They're sneaking around outside.

868
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:51,704
Is it a burglar?

869
01:17:52,465 --> 01:17:53,345
I don't know.

870
01:18:07,185 --> 01:18:08,025
Dad, wait.

871
01:18:19,465 --> 01:18:20,905
I'll catch the burglar.

872
01:18:20,985 --> 01:18:22,105
What?

873
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:23,905
It's okay.

874
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:33,225
Are you leaving?

875
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:38,985
Did you come to see Tofu?

876
01:18:41,744 --> 01:18:42,744
Come inside.

877
01:18:55,784 --> 01:18:56,784
Thank you.

878
01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:01,145
You're Nut, aren't you?

879
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:06,305
Song told me.

880
01:19:08,185 --> 01:19:09,145
Yes.

881
01:19:11,824 --> 01:19:13,905
Did you think it through
before coming here?

882
01:19:17,744 --> 01:19:19,985
Although Tofu has lost his memory,

883
01:19:20,704 --> 01:19:23,065
he still has feelings.

884
01:19:24,744 --> 01:19:26,624
You're not just his employer,

885
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:28,585
and you didn't just save his life.

886
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,225
You're his whole world,

887
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:35,185
his sanctuary, and something to hang onto.

888
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:41,225
If you take Tofu back, I only hope

889
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:46,865
that he will get to stay with you
until his memory returns completely.

890
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,704
Nut!

891
01:20:30,465 --> 01:20:32,185
Let's go home.

892
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:55,265
Thank you, both of you.

893
01:20:57,545 --> 01:20:58,664
I'll get going now.

894
01:20:59,784 --> 01:21:00,664
Thank you.

895
01:21:03,345 --> 01:21:04,185
Let's go.

896
01:21:06,905 --> 01:21:07,744
Bye.

897
01:21:21,025 --> 01:21:22,425
Did we do the right thing?

898
01:21:22,985 --> 01:21:24,145
I don't know.

899
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:27,585
But since they miss each other
and they want to stay together,

900
01:21:27,664 --> 01:21:28,865
we have to let them be.

901
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:33,265
Now, we should go inside
and get some sleep.

902
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:34,624
Are you sleepy?

903
01:21:34,704 --> 01:21:36,305
-I am.
-Go to bed then.

904
01:21:40,905 --> 01:21:42,385
I thought about the difference

905
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:45,025
between not having you around,

906
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:48,585
and having you despite being suspicious.

907
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:52,505
Did you choose the latter?

908
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:54,545
No.

909
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:57,345
I just wanted to follow my heart.

910
01:21:58,425 --> 01:21:59,945
Whatever my heart wants,

911
01:22:00,025 --> 01:22:01,624
I want to let it be.

912
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:07,065
Right now, I want to be with you.

913
01:22:10,824 --> 01:22:12,905
But I don't know
if I'll get paranoid again.

914
01:22:17,865 --> 01:22:19,465
I don't know what I need to do,

915
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,025
but I want to move forward.

916
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:25,704
I don't want to leave it hanging.

917
01:22:31,105 --> 01:22:32,624
Please be patient with me.

918
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:37,025
I promise I'll never kick you out again.

919
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:40,824
And I'll try not to mention him.

920
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,345
I won't be able to forget him though.

921
01:22:51,985 --> 01:22:53,744
And I won't try to forget him…

922
01:22:57,465 --> 01:22:58,905
because our relationship

923
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:02,824
is the happiest memory
I have from that time.

924
01:23:17,865 --> 01:23:19,945
But I won't force you to be him,…

925
01:23:21,865 --> 01:23:23,225
because you are you.

926
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:27,145
He's in the past.

927
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:31,545
But you're right here

928
01:23:32,505 --> 01:23:33,744
with me.

929
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,225
I promise,

930
01:23:42,744 --> 01:23:44,465
I'll stay with you forever.

931
01:23:52,305 --> 01:23:53,505
Is that all?

932
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:56,905
What more should I say?

933
01:23:58,704 --> 01:24:00,185
I gave a whole speech,

934
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,105
and that's all you can say?

935
01:24:03,345 --> 01:24:05,265
I must look crazy.

936
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:17,225
In that case,

937
01:24:18,704 --> 01:24:20,744
I'll try to be good.

938
01:24:22,664 --> 01:24:24,744
I'll be trustworthy,

939
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:27,865
so that you can trust me,

940
01:24:29,865 --> 01:24:32,225
even though my identity

941
01:24:32,704 --> 01:24:34,624
might not seem so trustworthy.

942
01:24:36,545 --> 01:24:38,345
But everything I've done for you

943
01:24:39,585 --> 01:24:41,945
has always been sincere.

944
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:46,624
One day,

945
01:24:47,905 --> 01:24:50,664
you'll recognize my sincerity.

946
01:24:52,664 --> 01:24:53,905
I'll prove it.

947
01:24:55,945 --> 01:24:57,185
I promise.

948
01:25:00,465 --> 01:25:02,025
Does that sound good?

949
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:06,025
Okay. That's good.

950
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,465
You promised.

951
01:25:09,065 --> 01:25:10,345
I'll wait and see.

952
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:19,905
What now?

953
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:23,744
This is how we promise.

954
01:25:25,624 --> 01:25:27,385
You're such a baby.

955
01:25:28,505 --> 01:25:31,425
This is how adults make a promise.

956
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:10,185
Mom is probably asleep.

957
01:26:10,905 --> 01:26:12,225
We can tell her tomorrow.

958
01:26:30,624 --> 01:26:32,105
Welcome home.

959
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:43,465
Tofu, hurry up.

960
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:45,345
Okay.

961
01:27:00,585 --> 01:27:01,744
Good night.

962
01:27:02,305 --> 01:27:03,305
Wait.

963
01:27:07,385 --> 01:27:08,864
What is it?

964
01:27:09,585 --> 01:27:10,905
Did you forget something?

965
01:27:12,664 --> 01:27:13,784
What did I forget?

966
01:27:25,305 --> 01:27:26,265
This.

967
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:34,265
What are you doing?

968
01:27:34,824 --> 01:27:36,505
I'm following your script.

969
01:27:37,864 --> 01:27:38,985
Shall we start?

970
01:27:48,345 --> 01:27:50,145
I'm not really feeling it.

971
01:27:54,065 --> 01:27:55,905
You're so hard to please.

972
01:27:58,225 --> 01:28:00,704
-We can rebuild the mood.
-Sure.

973
01:28:01,545 --> 01:28:03,545
Should we start from the angry part?

974
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:08,545
Let's skip that.

975
01:28:09,105 --> 01:28:10,185
Then skip to your room.

976
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:12,345
I'm not in the mood now.

977
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:16,105
Nut.

978
01:28:16,945 --> 01:28:18,704
I'll skip forward for you.

979
01:28:19,664 --> 01:28:21,345
-Let's start at--
-Go.

980
01:28:22,585 --> 01:28:23,585
I'm going to bed.

981
01:29:05,664 --> 01:29:08,425
You've had him follow me
since we separated.

982
01:29:08,985 --> 01:29:10,425
Are you a psychopath?

983
01:29:10,505 --> 01:29:11,624
Why are you doing this?

984
01:29:12,225 --> 01:29:15,585
I'm doing all this because I love you.

985
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:18,624
If I can't be happy, then no one will be.

986
01:29:18,704 --> 01:29:20,545
If I wasn't indecisive,

987
01:29:22,105 --> 01:29:23,784
if I had been firm

988
01:29:24,664 --> 01:29:27,425
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

989
01:29:27,505 --> 01:29:29,105
She didn't really love him.

990
01:29:29,185 --> 01:29:31,385
I'm just a product of their mistake.

991
01:29:32,425 --> 01:29:33,784
Am I supposed to give up

992
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:35,824
and be a coward like you?

993
01:29:36,345 --> 01:29:38,385
And behave immorally like you?

994
01:29:38,945 --> 01:29:40,425
-I can't do it.
-Tarn!

995
01:29:42,465 --> 01:29:44,585
I already have plenty of friends.

996
01:29:45,664 --> 01:29:46,784
But now,

997
01:29:47,265 --> 01:29:48,664
I want you.

998
01:30:45,585 --> 01:30:50,585
