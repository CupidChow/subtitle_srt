1
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,505
Have you heard of miracles before?

2
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,344
Sometimes,

3
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,985
a miracle can happen in the late morning

4
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,385
of an ordinary day.

5
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:29,265
It happened yesterday.

6
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:31,985
I'm going to tell you

7
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,665
what happened between me

8
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,585
and Nut.

9
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:39,945
JULY 23

10
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:57,184
This comet only comes around

11
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:59,344
once in 6,800 years.

12
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:03,305
Many people, including me,
tried to look up in the sky,

13
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,825
but we couldn't see it.

14
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:06,025
It was too cloudy.

15
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:11,665
This footage was taken in Mae Rim
District, Chiang Mai, at 8.30 p.m.

16
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:13,305
before it rained last night.

17
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:16,225
-It's a very clear image.
-Yes, it is.

18
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:22,145
This image was captured by Princess
Sirindhorn AstroPark in Chiang Mai.

19
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:25,545
At least, we can witness the comet
via an image.

20
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:28,904
You can clearly see
its dust tail and gas tail.

21
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,425
I'm leaving now, Tofu.

22
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:40,425
I'm leaving now, Mom.

23
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,265
Nut, don't forget your lunchbox.

24
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,025
Thank you.

25
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:47,665
A miracle happened to me.

26
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,024
Since you might not get it,

27
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,824
let me go back to where it began.

28
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,144
As you can guess,

29
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,584
I'm actually a teddy bear.

30
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,185
10 YEARS AGO

31
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:15,545
I don't know how I woke up.

32
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,305
But the only thing I can remember

33
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:23,745
is Nut's face.

34
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,065
Nut became my master

35
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,945
the moment I woke up.

36
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:01,185
Whenever I spend time with Nut,

37
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,464
he hugs me.

38
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,824
He always puts me by his side.

39
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:25,625
We're moving house.

40
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,985
After Nut graduated,
he took me to a new house with him.

41
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:34,505
I was a little sad
that I couldn't be on his bed anymore.

42
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,745
But I've made a lot of new friends here.

43
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,065
My time with Nut went by…

44
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,665
Well…

45
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,785
quite happily, I guess.

46
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,425
Things were fine until yesterday

47
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:42,945
when something strange happened to me.

48
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,024
I suddenly turned into a human.

49
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,305
Stop right there, thief.

50
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:01,464
Stop.

51
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:02,385
Hey.

52
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,425
You might ask why Nut is chasing after me.

53
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:09,385
It's because…

54
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:10,464
Stop.

55
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:28,904
Where was I with our story?

56
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:31,745
Give me a second.

57
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:32,985
I need to rest a second.

58
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:41,985
Hey!

59
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:00,745
FOR SALE

60
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:17,785
How can I help you?

61
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,225
That boy just now.

62
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,265
He stole something from me.

63
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,465
I see. I'll find him for you.

64
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:48,544
Boy.

65
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,225
Hey. Stop.

66
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,385
Boy, stop.

67
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,585
Stop. Where are you going?

68
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:53,865
Hey.

69
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,025
Stop right there.

70
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,385
He keeps chasing me.

71
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,505
I bet Nut sent him to find me.

72
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,304
You're not going anywhere.

73
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,064
Where's Nut?

74
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,265
Come this way.

75
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,745
You're handsome.
It's a shame you are a thief.

76
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:09,865
Go away.

77
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:12,385
Don't come back again.

78
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,865
You can't run from me.

79
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:23,465
Come here.

80
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,985
Run while you still can.

81
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:26,865
I've seen people in movies do this.

82
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,385
Nut and I used to watch movies.

83
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,424
Nice try.

84
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,505
But I forgot

85
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:33,064
that Nut is a screenwriter.

86
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,064
Nut.

87
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,424
Don't send me to the police.

88
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,465
It hurts so badly.

89
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,505
It hurts so much more

90
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:52,225
than being attacked by Kuenchai.

91
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,704
You should be glad
I brought him to the hospital.

92
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,585
Can you bring Tofu home

93
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:00,304
once he gets discharged?

94
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:03,184
How can we bring him home?
We don't know who he is.

95
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:07,025
He's a good guy.
He can keep me company at home.

96
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,265
She is Nut's mother.

97
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,304
He can keep me company.

98
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:14,745
She has always been kind to me.

99
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:16,064
There was this one time.

100
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,025
I remember it vividly.

101
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:20,944
Kuenchai.

102
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,944
This dog is my number one enemy.

103
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,944
I don't know what I ever did to him.

104
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,145
He hates me so much.

105
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:32,105
He always finds chances to attack me

106
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,064
but Nut has saved my life every time.

107
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:51,785
Then Nut's mother

108
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,025
would fix me up.

109
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,544
But someone as kind as her

110
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,745
once put me in a hellish tunnel
that I hated very much.

111
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:03,745
It was dark and wet.

112
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,424
And it kept spinning and made me dizzy.

113
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:08,265
Still,

114
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,944
she's a very kind person.

115
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,385
Seriously?

116
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,704
You fell from the sky?

117
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,025
Yesterday,

118
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,385
she was the one who saved me.

119
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,145
I…

120
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:43,184
I'm a human now.

121
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:56,424
THE LITTLE PRINCE

122
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:57,785
Little Prince?

123
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,905
These are Nut's clothes.

124
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,345
They should fit you.

125
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:24,064
Put them on. Then come out and see me.

126
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:26,985
Thank you.

127
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,704
What happened to the teddy bear?

128
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:43,064
How did he turn into a human?

129
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,824
Is Heaven punishing you for something?

130
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,584
You need to pull yourself together.

131
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,225
There is a solution to every problem.

132
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,025
Oh, no.

133
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,745
Oh, my goodness.

134
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:09,464
-Oh, my…
-Oh, my…

135
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:11,304
Oh.

136
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:14,464
Wow.

137
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:18,665
I've only seen Nut's.

138
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,544
I never thought I would get one myself.

139
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:27,824
Little Prince, are you done?

140
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,145
Almost.

141
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:24,984
Stop barking, Kuenchai. Here's your food.

142
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,585
Is it itchy, Little Prince?

143
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,465
Were you bitten by ants?

144
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:53,905
No.

145
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,264
I'm just not used to it yet.

146
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:02,225
I've never worn proper clothes before.

147
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,425
All I had was a bandana.

148
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:07,425
I don't know why she's calling me

149
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,744
Little Prince.

150
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,465
But she can call me whatever she wants.

151
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:15,305
By the way, what were you doing
on the balcony?

152
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,665
Tell me.

153
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:18,705
You were naked too.

154
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,145
Well…

155
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:24,905
I…

156
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:33,024
Were you caught having an affair

157
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:34,105
with someone?

158
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:36,385
Is that why
you were running for your life?

159
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,744
No.

160
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,345
I just…

161
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:44,504
I…

162
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:46,425
Nut…

163
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,744
Are you Nut's friend?

164
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:52,825
I'm sorry then.

165
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,744
I watch a lot of dramas.

166
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,264
Don't mind me.

167
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,625
What's your name?

168
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:04,984
Well…

169
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:06,705
What should I say?

170
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:08,705
If I say my name is Tofu,

171
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,024
will it raise her suspicion?

172
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,345
Your skin is very fair.

173
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:19,744
It's super soft too.

174
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:23,825
You remind me of Nut's teddy bear.

175
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,305
The teddy bear's name is Tofu.

176
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:33,784
You can call me Tofu then.

177
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:36,385
I…

178
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,345
I…

179
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,024
I mean

180
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:42,665
it's up to you

181
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:44,665
what you want to call me.

182
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:58,264
JULY 24

183
00:19:58,345 --> 00:19:59,385
That was what happened

184
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,024
when his mother saved me yesterday.

185
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,385
Why do you care about him?

186
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,024
We don't know him.

187
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,185
We can't bring him home.

188
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:10,744
But I want him to live with us.

189
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:16,024
Nut.

190
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:19,024
Are you okay?

191
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:20,665
Are you hurt anywhere?

192
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,705
This is Nut's best friend,

193
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:23,905
Gen.

194
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,744
-I'm fine.
-He is Nut's colleague.

195
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,865
Ma'am.

196
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,145
Hello.

197
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:35,225
Pribpree.

198
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:37,185
You got here even before me?

199
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:38,945
I don't know this woman.

200
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,385
But since Gen knows her,
she's probably Nut's colleague too.

201
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,865
Didn't I just assign you a task?

202
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,264
Why are you here?

203
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:48,345
Are you here to flirt?

204
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:49,984
I didn't just get here.

205
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:53,264
I was at the scene of the accident.

206
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:56,225
I…

207
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:57,625
I…

208
00:20:57,705 --> 00:21:00,105
I hit him with my car.

209
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:04,504
I…

210
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:05,865
It wasn't you.

211
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:09,385
I hit him.

212
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:11,865
But…

213
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:14,905
-I hit him.
-It was me.

214
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,984
You should get your brain checked.

215
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:39,825
Your crazy brain is making up
an imaginary accident.

216
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:43,264
It's not imaginary. I really hit him.

217
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:46,984
Nut is a gentleman.
He's taking the blame for me.

218
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:50,504
Him? Nut would never do
such a thing for you.

219
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:53,024
Is this your plan to get close

220
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,905
to Nut?

221
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,145
Are you crazy?

222
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,465
I might be obsessed with Nut,

223
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:00,984
but this is a life-and-death situation.

224
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:02,625
Whatever.

225
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:04,385
At least, you have a conscience.

226
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:08,425
Still, I should take responsibility
for this too.

227
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:10,865
I scared him
and that's how Nut's car hit him.

228
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,465
Prib, you just won't
leave Nut alone, will you?

229
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,665
Look.

230
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,865
Little Prince, how are you feeling?

231
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:31,145
Who are you?

232
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:33,305
Tell me.

233
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,065
I'm…

234
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,305
I'm…

235
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:43,145
I don't know who I am.

236
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,625
I don't remember.

237
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,225
I don't know how I got here.

238
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,024
Did the accident affect his memory?

239
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:56,865
I didn't hit him hard. I just grazed him.

240
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:59,345
The doctor said he was fine.

241
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:01,345
His brain X-ray came out normal too.

242
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:07,984
Come home with me when you're better.
I'll cook you something delicious.

243
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:14,544
Who are you?

244
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:16,825
Tell me what you want.

245
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:19,065
-Tell me.
-Nut, don't hurt him.

246
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:20,345
-Tell me.
-You're hurting him.

247
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:22,625
Will you please calm down?

248
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,905
I'm sure he's not lying.

249
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:29,024
He might have lost his memory
during the accident.

250
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,185
Mom.

251
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:35,185
The doctor said he was fine.

252
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:37,264
Why don't you believe that?

253
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,865
Do you want to be responsible for him?

254
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:50,465
Gen.

255
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:52,145
Keep an eye on him.

256
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:54,385
-I'm going to talk to the doctor.
-Nut.

257
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:56,105
Nut.

258
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:01,425
What am I going to do

259
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:03,984
if Nut doesn't believe me?

260
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,385
The accident

261
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:09,065
may have caused a severe concussion,

262
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:10,825
causing his brain to shut down.

263
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,665
However, it will heal on its own.

264
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:16,065
I'll need to monitor him
for another day or two.

265
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:18,024
What if he doesn't get better?

266
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:19,705
If he still doesn't remember,

267
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,225
I will send him
to get another brain X-ray.

268
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,185
If his brain X-ray

269
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:26,225
doesn't show any physical abnormalities,

270
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:30,145
he may be suffering from trauma.

271
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:33,744
I will need to discuss his case
with a psychiatrist.

272
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,504
All right.

273
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,065
What did the doctor say?

274
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,065
He has to stay here for a few days.

275
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,065
They want to monitor him.

276
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:49,425
See?

277
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:53,024
Tofu wasn't lying about losing his memory.

278
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,665
He's not a bad guy.

279
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:00,065
When you came home drunk last night,

280
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:02,865
he carried you to bed upstairs.

281
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:10,665
Oh, right.
I totally forgot about last night.

282
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:13,425
Let's go back again to yesterday.

283
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,385
Yesterday,

284
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:17,465
lots of things happened.

285
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,865
Ever since I somehow became a human,

286
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:25,665
I've been trying to transform
back into a teddy bear.

287
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:44,024
But it's harder than it seems.

288
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,625
How about we use voodoo, Tofu?

289
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:07,024
Tofu.

290
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,865
How about you go back where it began?

291
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:10,905
Yes.

292
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,185
Nut will freak out seeing me like this.

293
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,825
And he might

294
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:19,145
abandon me.

295
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,744
I have to transform
back into a teddy bear,

296
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,385
so I can be with Nut forever.

297
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,784
I'm scared.

298
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:37,504
I have to tell Nut the truth.

299
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:03,225
Nut is back.

300
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,264
-We've arrived.
-Great.

301
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:11,784
Be careful.

302
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:14,065
Why is someone bringing him home?

303
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,865
-Sir, have we arrived?
-Yes.

304
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:21,865
It's okay.

305
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:23,665
You can leave. I'm fine.

306
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:58,304
Who's that?

307
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,425
Honey.

308
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:22,065
It's like his mother said.

309
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:23,744
Nut.

310
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,065
Nut got drunk.

311
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,145
The man who sent him home

312
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,064
was a driver he called from his phone.

313
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:37,784
It's so convenient being a human.

314
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:40,385
But because he came home drunk,

315
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:43,304
I couldn't tell him the truth.

316
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:57,225
Honey.

317
00:29:44,264 --> 00:29:45,304
Are you hot?

318
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,905
Yes.

319
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:14,865
It's so warm.

320
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:09,784
And that

321
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:13,865
was the end of yesterday.

322
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:17,585
But the story of Nut and I

323
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,145
didn't end there.

324
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,105
Neung.

325
00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:36,905
I don't know who that is.

326
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:41,865
Why don't I know anyone
now that I'm a human?

327
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:44,064
Wait.

328
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:47,825
You're not Neung.

329
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:55,225
Who are you?

330
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:08,504
I got so wasted last night.

331
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,345
I brought him home without knowing.

332
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:14,304
What did you say?

333
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:16,824
Nothing.

334
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,145
-I've got great taste in men.
-What?

335
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:25,984
Go home.

336
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,784
I'll walk you out.

337
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:31,984
Go.

338
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,625
I don't want to leave.

339
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:37,345
You have to go.

340
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:38,945
Go.

341
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:40,865
Go. Get up.

342
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:42,145
Leave before my mom wakes up.

343
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:43,264
Get up.

344
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,225
Go.

345
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:53,784
Where are your clothes?

346
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,784
Just take mine.

347
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:04,665
Turn around.

348
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:14,185
Here.

349
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:16,544
I'm going to take a shower.

350
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:23,304
What should we do?
Does he really have to leave?

351
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,385
All we can do is pray.

352
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:34,185
Hurry up.

353
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:36,145
Keep it down.

354
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,304
Nut.

355
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:40,625
Keep it down. You'll wake my mom up.

356
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:42,625
Nut.

357
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:45,905
What do you want?

358
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:49,425
Kuenchai.

359
00:33:50,744 --> 00:33:52,585
Be quiet. Come on.

360
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,544
Where are you taking Little Prince
at this hour?

361
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,024
Little Prince?

362
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:08,904
I'm talking about Tofu.

363
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:12,465
Do you know this guy?

364
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:14,065
Isn't he your friend?

365
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:19,105
He fell from your balcony
yesterday morning.

366
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:22,824
He isn't my friend. I don't know him.

367
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,465
-Who are you?
-Nut.

368
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:30,145
-What do you want from us?
-Calm down.

369
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:32,185
-Tell me.
-Calm down.

370
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:33,784
Are you deaf? Say something.

371
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:36,625
You won't talk, will you?

372
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:38,585
-Nut.
-Come with me.

373
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,185
-Nut, leave Tofu alone.
-Come with me.

374
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:44,465
Nut, calm down.

375
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:45,784
Walk.

376
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,105
-Get in.
-Nut.

377
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,744
-Get in.
-Nut, Tofu isn't a thief.

378
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,264
Mom, get out of my way.

379
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:57,585
If he isn't your friend, your dad
must have sent him to keep me company.

380
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,505
Will you stop talking about Dad?

381
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:07,424
Dad didn't send him. He's a thief.

382
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,864
He broke into our house.

383
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,745
I'm taking him to the police.

384
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,745
No, Nut.

385
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:17,625
Nut, don't take Tofu away from me. Nut.

386
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:19,545
Nut.

387
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:33,625
Get out.

388
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,705
I said, get out.

389
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:40,785
You're not moving, right?

390
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:50,665
Hey.

391
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:53,185
I'm sorry, Nut.

392
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:55,665
You brat.

393
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:57,225
Do you want to do this the hard way?

394
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:02,384
That's the whole story.

395
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,305
That's why Nut was chasing after me.

396
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,545
He brought me to the police station.

397
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:11,465
But in the end,

398
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,424
he had to take me to the hospital instead.

399
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:23,345
Is that all it takes for you
to think of him as a good person?

400
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:26,265
He could be fooling you.

401
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,065
No.

402
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,265
I'm not.

403
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:33,185
I believe him.

404
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,545
Once the doctor discharges him,

405
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,305
please take him home.

406
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,985
You hit him.

407
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:43,985
You must take responsibility.

408
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:47,185
Let me take responsibility too.

409
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:48,105
Stop.

410
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:51,585
I took responsibility

411
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:53,904
by bringing him here.

412
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:57,705
If he doesn't have any relatives,

413
00:36:57,785 --> 00:37:00,025
the doctor said we should
take him to the welfare center.

414
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,985
How can you be so heartless?

415
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:09,505
Bringing Tofu home
won't cause us any trouble.

416
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:11,464
I'll help take care of him.

417
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,464
Just worry about yourself.

418
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:17,904
Nut.

419
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,145
Calm down.

420
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:20,384
I'm trying.

421
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:22,065
But can't you see that she wants to bring

422
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:23,745
a stranger into our house?

423
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:27,225
There is an elderly person
and a dog in my house.

424
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:28,625
What if something happens?

425
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,625
You need to calm down though.

426
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:33,944
Why are you worrying about me now?

427
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,944
You're rarely home anyway.

428
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,225
I'm fine on my own.

429
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,505
Can you not cause me any trouble then?

430
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,705
Whether I'm home or not,

431
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,585
you cause me trouble anyway.

432
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:53,585
I hate staying home

433
00:37:53,665 --> 00:37:57,305
because we can never get along.

434
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:07,825
Little Prince, come home with me.

435
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:11,345
Come home with me.

436
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:16,505
-Nut.
-I said no. Why won't you listen?

437
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:18,145
Nut.

438
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,985
Will you stop acting this way?

439
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,025
It's exhausting.

440
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,825
Please listen to me for once.

441
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:29,305
Nut.

442
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:31,825
Don't be so harsh on her.

443
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:33,345
Stay out of it.

444
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:35,145
You're the reason she's like this.

445
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:40,904
Nut.

446
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,384
Let's talk it out.

447
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,025
Mom.

448
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:49,705
-Listen to me.
-No.

449
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,665
-Let's go home.
-No.

450
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,225
-I'm not listening.
-Leave him.

451
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:53,705
-I'm not listening.
-Please.

452
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:54,944
-Let's go.
-I won't listen.

453
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:56,505
Mom, please.

454
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,505
-Leave him here.
-No, I want to stay here with Tofu.

455
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:01,785
Stop acting this way. I'm begging you.

456
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:03,745
I'm begging you.

457
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,785
Will you please stop fighting?

458
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,545
Please do something.

459
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,705
What do you want me to do?

460
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:56,225
What's the matter?

461
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:59,065
Tofu got injured trying to help me.

462
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,464
And you told me
to leave him at the hospital.

463
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:06,825
I'm not going to leave him to die there.

464
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,745
I don't care. I'm going back there
to see Tofu tomorrow.

465
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,305
Before you worry about him,

466
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:14,944
worry about yourself first.

467
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:16,505
I'm fine.

468
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:19,545
You saw how he helped me.

469
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:23,145
This conversation is over.

470
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,665
Get some rest.

471
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:02,065
Is anyone here?

472
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:11,545
Can anyone hear me?

473
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:26,424
People get rid of things

474
00:41:27,505 --> 00:41:29,464
they don't need anymore.

475
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:34,025
But can they just get rid
of other people they don't need?

476
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:40,625
Nut.

477
00:41:41,424 --> 00:41:43,705
You're not going
to leave me here, are you?

478
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:11,384
JULY 25

479
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:42,985
-Who's that?
-Who's that?

480
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:45,265
How is it any of your business?

481
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:46,345
Gosh.

482
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:52,225
Hello.

483
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:54,505
Hello.

484
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:56,065
The weather is nice today.

485
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:57,785
-Yes.
-Right?

486
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:05,105
Leave them alone.

487
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,625
Hey, come here.

488
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,025
Is your name Tofu?

489
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,864
I don't remember.

490
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:44,944
But that's what your mother calls me.

491
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:47,625
He reminds me of your teddy bear.

492
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:49,625
You don't mind, do you?

493
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:51,225
It's just a name.

494
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:53,065
I don't care about that.

495
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,345
I'll let you stay here.

496
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,145
Temporarily though.

497
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:04,785
-Nut.
-That's the best I can do.

498
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:07,424
He can't stay here forever.

499
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,585
As soon as his memory comes back,
he's packing his bag.

500
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:15,944
All right.

501
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:17,665
While you are here,

502
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:20,505
your job is to take care of the house,

503
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:22,984
clean the house,
and keep my mother company.

504
00:44:23,904 --> 00:44:24,785
Okay.

505
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,864
I'll do as you say.

506
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,424
Good.

507
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:30,424
And don't worry.

508
00:44:30,944 --> 00:44:32,665
I'll help you get your memory back.

509
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:35,265
Because I want to know

510
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:36,585
who you are too.

511
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:42,145
-I'll see you later, Mom.
-Nut.

512
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:43,904
Wait, Nut.

513
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:44,825
Don't…

514
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:48,185
Don't forget your lunchbox.
I've warmed it up for you.

515
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,785
Sure, as for the tie-in,

516
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:07,585
I've taken care of it.

517
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:09,424
Which type of product is it?

518
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:11,065
Nut.

519
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:13,545
Okay.

520
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:16,705
Nut.

521
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:19,105
-I'm talking. Okay.
-Nut.

522
00:45:21,864 --> 00:45:23,585
This is amazing.

523
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:24,545
I like it.

524
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:25,464
I do.

525
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:28,145
-Thank you, Juea.
-It doesn't make sense to me though.

526
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,904
I don't get it.

527
00:45:29,984 --> 00:45:30,904
Screw it.

528
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,785
I won't fix it anymore.
Give it to the staff.

529
00:45:34,424 --> 00:45:35,505
They're almost done filming.

530
00:45:35,585 --> 00:45:38,305
-Okay.
-Let's talk about the next project later.

531
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:39,825
-Do you mean it?
-Hold on.

532
00:45:41,745 --> 00:45:43,545
Jaew, got the coffee yet?

533
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,745
Make it quick.

534
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,825
Gosh.

535
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:51,225
You have to come up with a new idea.

536
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:53,825
Actually, I already have
something in mind.

537
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:03,864
Nut.

538
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,625
Stop sulking already.

539
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:10,065
It's not that Juea doesn't like the idea.

540
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:11,384
It's a good idea.

541
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:13,505
It's just new for the company.

542
00:46:13,585 --> 00:46:14,745
They find it risky.

543
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:20,904
I said, stop sulking already.

544
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:23,904
You just need to work on it a bit.

545
00:46:24,505 --> 00:46:26,065
Juea trusts you.

546
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,025
I trust you too.

547
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:30,864
You can do it.

548
00:46:30,944 --> 00:46:32,424
I know that.

549
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:34,505
I'm not going to give up.

550
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,904
A chance like this doesn't come often.

551
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:38,305
I'll do my best.

552
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:41,105
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Nut.

553
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:43,904
Nut.

554
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:55,424
Prib.

555
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:57,625
Did you put GPS on Nut?

556
00:46:57,705 --> 00:46:59,384
You keep running into him.

557
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:00,825
Come here.

558
00:47:02,065 --> 00:47:03,944
It's destiny that brings us together.

559
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:05,625
-How silly.
-Hey.

560
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:07,585
Spit it out.

561
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:08,984
What brings you here?

562
00:47:09,065 --> 00:47:11,665
-Let's go to the new…
-No.

563
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:15,984
We are in this mess
because you invited me out to drink.

564
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,384
You drank the whiskey yourself.
How can you blame me for it?

565
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:23,464
Do you think I didn't know
you were trying to get me drunk?

566
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,185
Come here.

567
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:29,305
You're an idiot.

568
00:47:31,145 --> 00:47:32,545
Nut.

569
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:35,545
So, are you really going to let Tofu
stay at your place?

570
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:37,305
It's only for my mom.

571
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:39,625
I don't fully trust him.

572
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:41,864
I'm not sure what he's up to.

573
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,665
It was part of my plan.

574
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:48,305
Was the whole thing an act?

575
00:47:48,384 --> 00:47:50,384
No, it wasn't.

576
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:52,384
During my fight with Nut,

577
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:55,105
I planned to faint,

578
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:57,585
so our argument would end.

579
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:01,464
But somehow, I couldn't move my legs
and fell down.

580
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,705
You must keep it a secret.

581
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:18,105
Let's make it a little secret between us.

582
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:19,505
Okay.

583
00:48:21,305 --> 00:48:22,384
See?

584
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:23,904
I told you.

585
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,065
Even a kind person like her
has a dark side too.

586
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:34,424
Once I'm done cleaning Nut's room,
I'll clean the guest room for you.

587
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:36,065
It's next to this one.

588
00:48:36,145 --> 00:48:38,345
It's okay.

589
00:48:38,825 --> 00:48:40,424
I can sleep with Nut.

590
00:48:40,505 --> 00:48:41,705
We've shared a room before.

591
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:47,625
I see.

592
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:49,345
Are you talking about

593
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:51,025
the day Nut came home drunk?

594
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:52,545
Yes.

595
00:48:53,145 --> 00:48:55,424
Make yourself at home then.

596
00:48:55,505 --> 00:48:56,825
I'll cook you some food.

597
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:58,944
-Do you need help?
-It's okay.

598
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:00,384
I've got my husband to help me.

599
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:14,625
I'm back, everyone.

600
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,585
Finally, the teddy bear is back.

601
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:21,225
Welcome home, Tofu.

602
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:22,305
Thank you.

603
00:49:24,345 --> 00:49:26,464
I forgot to introduce you to my friends.

604
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:28,745
Have you got a few minutes?

605
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:31,305
I will introduce you.
Let's start with the first one.

606
00:49:31,864 --> 00:49:33,505
Mr. Notebook.

607
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:46,265
10 YEARS AGO

608
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:52,345
OR DON'T WEAK GUYS

609
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:55,825
DESERVE TO BE BORN?

610
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:36,984
4 YEARS AGO

611
00:51:10,424 --> 00:51:13,904
I don't care if you're still here or not.

612
00:51:14,545 --> 00:51:15,904
But let me ask you one thing.

613
00:51:15,984 --> 00:51:17,025
What's your plan?

614
00:51:18,265 --> 00:51:19,665
This is Ms. Bolster.

615
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:22,025
She doesn't seem to like me.

616
00:51:22,585 --> 00:51:24,185
She's always mean to me.

617
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:27,944
It's okay, Tofu.
I know you are doing your best.

618
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:32,585
This is Ms. Blanket.

619
00:51:33,145 --> 00:51:34,904
She is kind and loving.

620
00:51:35,705 --> 00:51:37,305
She reminds me

621
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:40,384
of Nut's hugs.

622
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:43,424
She's right.

623
00:51:44,065 --> 00:51:45,665
Don't lose hope.

624
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:48,225
Think of every problem
as a reward in your life.

625
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,864
It will teach you how to be more mature.

626
00:51:51,785 --> 00:51:53,545
This is Mr. Desk.

627
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,705
He's the life coach of this house.

628
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,265
But what I'm going through right now

629
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:01,225
is beyond any life coach's help.

630
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:04,105
What should I do?

631
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:06,464
I don't want to be a human.

632
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:09,265
I'm afraid Nut will kick me
out of the house.

633
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:11,345
I don't know

634
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:13,464
if this is a good idea or not.

635
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:16,145
I almost forgot to introduce her.

636
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,105
This is Ms. Chair, our shy girl.

637
00:52:19,185 --> 00:52:21,225
She's so shy

638
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:23,864
that Mr. Desk has to cheer her up
all the time.

639
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:26,665
But since you have no other choice,

640
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:28,424
would you like

641
00:52:28,504 --> 00:52:30,145
to give it a try?

642
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:34,145
Sure.

643
00:52:34,225 --> 00:52:36,384
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

644
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:38,145
What should I do?

645
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,665
Here is what you do.

646
00:52:53,025 --> 00:52:54,384
I got the peas.

647
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:58,625
Peel them and put them in this bowl.

648
00:53:07,705 --> 00:53:09,065
As you can see,

649
00:53:09,825 --> 00:53:11,984
Ms. Chair told me to do nothing.

650
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:14,345
That's right.

651
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:16,265
I have to do nothing.

652
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,504
In order to stay with Nut,

653
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:20,745
I just have to pretend to be human.

654
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:25,225
That's not how you do it.

655
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:30,345
This is how you do it.

656
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:34,225
Squeeze it and remove the sides.

657
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:36,545
How are we supposed to eat that?

658
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:40,384
Yes.

659
00:53:40,464 --> 00:53:41,665
Remove both sides.

660
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,745
I'm sorry.

661
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:52,145
That's okay.

662
00:53:52,225 --> 00:53:56,065
Get a mop to clean it up
or we might slip on it.

663
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,825
Try this.

664
00:54:14,464 --> 00:54:15,904
-It's good.
-Do you like it?

665
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:22,145
Kuenchai.

666
00:54:23,185 --> 00:54:24,585
Kuenchai!

667
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:28,864
Kuenchai, stop!

668
00:54:31,464 --> 00:54:32,464
Go away.

669
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:33,705
Kuenchai!

670
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:35,825
Kuenchai, no!

671
00:54:35,904 --> 00:54:37,585
Kuenchai, no!

672
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:39,585
What's wrong with you? Stop.

673
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:23,625
Here you go.

674
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:26,944
Wow.

675
00:55:31,984 --> 00:55:33,345
You're giving me your lunchbox.

676
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:35,745
He gives everyone his lunchbox.

677
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:37,665
There's nothing special about it.

678
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:42,545
Gen, it took me three months
to get one from him.

679
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:45,545
I've been here for three months already.

680
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,265
This is the first one he has given me.

681
00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:50,665
You aren't special to him after all.

682
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:53,185
Let me tell you something.

683
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,504
I was the first to get one.

684
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:59,305
I might be the last person to get one.

685
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:00,864
-Prib.
-Prib.

686
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,545
Hey, my mother isn't dying.

687
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,904
She can make a lot more.

688
00:56:04,384 --> 00:56:05,464
Wait.

689
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:08,025
Why do you give the food
your mom cooks for you

690
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:09,424
to other people?

691
00:56:09,504 --> 00:56:11,504
You talk too much. Give it back.

692
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:25,944
You know,

693
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:27,504
I can't wait to try my mother-in-law…

694
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:30,145
your mother's cooking.

695
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:32,345
You are crazy.

696
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:36,225
I'm eating with Gen. I've asked
the housekeeper to order food for us.

697
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:45,105
What is it, Mom?

698
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:49,145
I'll be right there.

699
00:56:49,225 --> 00:56:50,864
-I have to go.
-Nut.

700
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,185
-Where are you going?
-Tofu has caused a problem.

701
00:56:56,785 --> 00:56:57,705
Nut.

702
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:11,984
-Kuenchai.
-Nut.

703
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:12,904
Stop.

704
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:27,984
What happened?

705
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:31,345
I don't know.

706
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:33,305
I was helping your mom cook

707
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:34,825
and Kuenchai chased after me.

708
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:39,545
Why would he chase after you?

709
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:41,145
Are you sure you're not lying?

710
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,745
Why would Tofu lie to you?

711
00:57:44,825 --> 00:57:45,984
Mom.

712
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:47,825
Kuenchai is a peaceful dog.

713
00:57:47,904 --> 00:57:49,785
He never chases anyone

714
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:51,625
unless someone frightens him.

715
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:02,545
They understand each other.

716
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,625
Tofu.

717
00:58:04,545 --> 00:58:05,864
I…

718
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,384
I didn't start it.

719
00:58:08,825 --> 00:58:10,665
You can ask your mom.

720
00:58:10,745 --> 00:58:11,825
He's right.

721
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:15,984
Kuenchai suddenly started barking at Tofu.
He wouldn't listen to me too.

722
00:58:16,065 --> 00:58:17,625
What got him riled up?

723
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:19,185
I don't know.

724
00:58:20,265 --> 00:58:21,665
Tofu.

725
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:23,705
I'm asking you for the last time.

726
00:58:23,785 --> 00:58:25,944
Are you sure you weren't snooping
around the house?

727
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,065
Do you really think he's a thief?

728
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:41,225
Gosh, Nut.

729
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:42,984
This is a big misunderstanding.

730
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:45,024
I don't want to steal anything.

731
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:48,225
I'm just pretending
like what Ms. Chair told me.

732
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,825
But this dog

733
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,305
almost ruined my plan.

734
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:57,345
Tofu and Kuenchai
are not used to each other yet.

735
00:58:57,424 --> 00:58:59,705
They'll learn to get along.

736
00:59:00,504 --> 00:59:01,785
I will

737
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:03,904
punish Kuenchai

738
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:06,464
by not feeding him a meal

739
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:08,265
and locking him away in his crate.

740
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:10,825
Come with me.

741
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:12,384
Come.

742
00:59:19,024 --> 00:59:20,464
Stop worrying so much.

743
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:22,825
Tofu can't take care of himself.

744
00:59:23,464 --> 00:59:24,745
How could he steal anything?

745
00:59:25,705 --> 00:59:27,265
I agree.

746
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:29,305
He looks too innocent.

747
00:59:29,384 --> 00:59:31,904
The only thing he could steal is my heart.

748
00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:34,864
They're the ones to watch out for.

749
00:59:36,904 --> 00:59:38,024
What's your plan then?

750
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:40,105
Take him to the police?

751
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:42,225
That's not a good idea.

752
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:43,984
You might make things worse again.

753
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:50,464
The accident may have caused
a severe concussion,

754
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,585
causing his brain to shut down.

755
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:54,105
However, it will heal on its own.

756
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:01,705
Let's wait until his memory is back.

757
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,864
If you don't trust him that much,

758
01:00:06,944 --> 01:00:08,785
just install cameras around the house.

759
01:00:10,745 --> 01:00:12,904
Yes, that's a good idea.

760
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:15,665
Nut, come back.

761
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,024
I was being sarcastic.

762
01:00:17,105 --> 01:00:19,305
Are you going upstairs? I can…

763
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,745
Stay here.

764
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:26,705
Your job is to clean up the house.

765
01:00:26,785 --> 01:00:28,225
Seriously?

766
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:29,825
Yes.

767
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,705
Is he ruining my life

768
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,265
or am I ruining my own life?

769
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:53,785
I'll help you clean up.

770
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:32,384
Nut.

771
01:01:34,185 --> 01:01:35,024
Mom.

772
01:01:35,785 --> 01:01:36,944
Have you seen Tofu?

773
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:40,545
He's behind you.

774
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:41,864
I'm not talking about him.

775
01:01:41,944 --> 01:01:44,265
I'm talking about Tofu, my teddy bear.

776
01:01:44,345 --> 01:01:45,785
Have you seen him?

777
01:01:45,864 --> 01:01:48,504
I went to clean your room today as usual,

778
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:50,225
but he wasn't there.

779
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:53,065
If you didn't take it, who did?

780
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:23,665
Kuenchai.

781
01:02:24,504 --> 01:02:26,225
Did you take Tofu to the trash again?

782
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:29,424
Did you?

783
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:30,745
Did you?

784
01:02:32,145 --> 01:02:33,185
Damn it.

785
01:02:34,705 --> 01:02:35,625
Nut.

786
01:02:35,705 --> 01:02:37,984
-Nut.
-Where are you going, Nut?

787
01:02:40,745 --> 01:02:42,185
Wait, Nut. Slow down.

788
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:43,305
Where are you going?

789
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:47,705
What are you looking for?

790
01:02:48,825 --> 01:02:49,984
A teddy bear.

791
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:52,185
It's white
and a little over one meter tall.

792
01:02:52,265 --> 01:02:53,424
Have you seen it?

793
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,464
No.

794
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:59,105
But a garbage truck just came
to collect the trash ten minutes ago.

795
01:02:59,825 --> 01:03:00,665
Shit.

796
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:02,265
Stop, Nut. Where are you going?

797
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,745
-I need to follow the trucks.
-Do you know where they went?

798
01:03:04,825 --> 01:03:06,145
-Yes.
-How many trucks?

799
01:03:06,225 --> 01:03:08,504
Two, one runs in front
and one behind the village.

800
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:10,625
They come Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays.

801
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:11,944
That's really informative.

802
01:03:12,024 --> 01:03:14,705
You go out the front
and I'll go out the back. Split up.

803
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:17,705
-I'm going with you.
-You're coming with me.

804
01:03:17,785 --> 01:03:19,825
Look at them go.

805
01:03:20,424 --> 01:03:22,665
What's wrong with them?

806
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:24,065
I'm going to shoot now.

807
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:25,145
Shoot.

808
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:28,384
-What a perfect shot.
-Great shot.

809
01:03:34,464 --> 01:03:35,665
Nut.

810
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:43,544
Nut.

811
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:48,984
-What is it?
-Nut, it's no use.

812
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:50,464
The truck is long gone.

813
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:52,984
We won't be able to find the teddy bear.

814
01:03:53,065 --> 01:03:54,504
Don't come if you are too tired.

815
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:57,265
There it is.

816
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:58,665
Mister.

817
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:01,944
-Mister.
-Nut.

818
01:04:03,944 --> 01:04:04,944
I'm tired.

819
01:04:05,904 --> 01:04:08,825
I can't breathe anymore.

820
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:09,785
Me too.

821
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:13,065
Why didn't we call a cab or take the car?

822
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:15,185
No one's using the car.

823
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,585
We obviously didn't think of it.

824
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:19,665
We have no choice but to keep going.

825
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:21,504
Are you not going to help Nut?

826
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,464
Imagine what a hero you would be

827
01:04:24,544 --> 01:04:25,825
if you found the teddy bear.

828
01:04:30,145 --> 01:04:32,825
As soon as I mention a man, she's off.

829
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:36,065
Stop the truck.

830
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:38,625
Mister.

831
01:04:39,105 --> 01:04:39,944
Nut.

832
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:42,944
-Nut.
-Mister.

833
01:04:44,984 --> 01:04:46,145
Mister.

834
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:50,705
Mister.

835
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,944
Gen, I see the garbage truck.

836
01:05:08,024 --> 01:05:09,384
I see it.

837
01:05:09,464 --> 01:05:10,665
Stop. Wait.

838
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,984
Wait.

839
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:15,864
Wait.

840
01:05:17,984 --> 01:05:19,024
-Shit.
-Gen.

841
01:05:19,585 --> 01:05:21,544
Gen, are you okay?

842
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:25,225
Do you have any broken bones?

843
01:05:25,305 --> 01:05:28,504
Is the biker hurt?

844
01:05:28,585 --> 01:05:30,625
-Let me check on him.
-My glasses.

845
01:05:30,705 --> 01:05:31,825
Where are my glasses?

846
01:05:35,544 --> 01:05:38,024
Hey, are you okay?

847
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,065
He's handsome.

848
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,065
I mean,

849
01:05:47,145 --> 01:05:49,225
are you okay?

850
01:05:50,065 --> 01:05:51,864
I'm fine.

851
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:53,265
-It's nothing.
-Oh, no.

852
01:05:53,345 --> 01:05:55,785
You're bleeding.
Do you want to go to a hospital?

853
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:57,665
I'm really fine.

854
01:05:59,464 --> 01:06:01,145
You spilled all your drinks.

855
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:04,625
I can buy new ones.
I'm just glad to be alive.

856
01:06:11,904 --> 01:06:13,305
By the way,

857
01:06:13,984 --> 01:06:15,185
is your boyfriend all right?

858
01:06:15,265 --> 01:06:16,265
He seems old.

859
01:06:17,345 --> 01:06:18,665
Old, my butt.

860
01:06:18,745 --> 01:06:20,065
I'm only 27 years old.

861
01:06:20,145 --> 01:06:22,464
And she isn't my girlfriend.

862
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,345
He looks younger than 18 years old though.

863
01:06:26,424 --> 01:06:28,145
You are old compared to him.

864
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:33,625
If you're shouting at me,
you must be fine.

865
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,265
I'm sorry for being careless.

866
01:06:36,345 --> 01:06:37,944
Let me call my insurance.

867
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:39,464
We don't have time for that.

868
01:06:39,544 --> 01:06:41,024
That's right.

869
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:42,785
How about this?

870
01:06:42,864 --> 01:06:43,904
Save his number.

871
01:06:43,984 --> 01:06:47,464
-Call him to sort out the damage later.
-Sir, please stop.

872
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:52,464
Go straight.

873
01:06:55,225 --> 01:06:56,225
Get on.

874
01:07:03,105 --> 01:07:04,864
Gen, wait for me.

875
01:07:06,825 --> 01:07:08,225
Nut.

876
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,984
Mister, have you seen a teddy bear?

877
01:07:11,065 --> 01:07:12,265
Hold on.

878
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:16,185
There's one in the truck about this size.
I don't know whose it is.

879
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,544
It's mine.

880
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,105
-Can I have it back?
-You have to get it yourself.

881
01:07:22,745 --> 01:07:23,665
Nut.

882
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:28,585
Where is it?

883
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:30,625
I saw it somewhere over there.

884
01:07:30,705 --> 01:07:31,705
Nut.

885
01:07:39,145 --> 01:07:40,345
This isn't mine.

886
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:42,984
Never mind then.

887
01:07:44,544 --> 01:07:45,665
Stop.

888
01:07:48,585 --> 01:07:49,665
Nut.

889
01:07:49,745 --> 01:07:51,544
Did you just search a garbage truck?

890
01:07:53,864 --> 01:07:55,745
Tofu, get him down.

891
01:07:56,825 --> 01:07:58,145
It's okay.

892
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,225
Let's go.

893
01:08:04,305 --> 01:08:05,504
Nut.

894
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:06,785
Did you not find it?

895
01:08:10,105 --> 01:08:11,305
We're sorry.

896
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:12,984
We couldn't catch the other truck.

897
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,544
Some brat almost hit me

898
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,265
with his bike.

899
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:24,704
Does the teddy bear mean so much to you?

900
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:32,664
It was a gift from someone special.

901
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:43,265
Maybe Kuenchai
didn't take him to the trash.

902
01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:45,504
We will help you look for it at home.

903
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:47,025
We will find it.

904
01:08:47,105 --> 01:08:49,065
There are no thieves in this area.

905
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:51,784
-It can't just disappear. Am I right?
-Yes.

906
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:57,584
I wish I could go back
to being his favorite toy.

907
01:09:00,664 --> 01:09:02,704
But I'm a human now.

908
01:09:03,225 --> 01:09:05,065
I'm no longer something he holds dear.

909
01:09:36,664 --> 01:09:38,345
Did you find the teddy bear?

910
01:09:38,985 --> 01:09:40,384
No.

911
01:09:43,624 --> 01:09:45,384
I'm going to take a shower

912
01:09:45,464 --> 01:09:46,744
then head back to work.

913
01:09:56,465 --> 01:09:58,425
Why do you look like that?

914
01:09:59,265 --> 01:10:00,784
Did something happen?

915
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:04,265
We had a small accident.

916
01:10:11,145 --> 01:10:12,265
Here's your medicine.

917
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:13,345
Thank you.

918
01:10:15,624 --> 01:10:16,825
This sucks.

919
01:10:16,905 --> 01:10:18,825
We're wasting time by being here.

920
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:20,465
It's all that brat's fault.

921
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:23,664
Are you mad at him for hurting you

922
01:10:23,744 --> 01:10:25,664
or calling you old?

923
01:10:27,065 --> 01:10:28,624
-Are you with him?
-I didn't run.

924
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:30,585
I was the one who hit him.

925
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:33,905
That uncle looked fine though.

926
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:37,305
He gave me his number, but it's okay.

927
01:10:37,385 --> 01:10:39,105
The insurance company will cover it.

928
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:40,704
You don't have to come.

929
01:10:40,784 --> 01:10:43,784
It's just a scratch. It's not deadly.

930
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:47,985
Once I get my salary,
I'll treat you to a meal.

931
01:10:48,465 --> 01:10:50,425
Mr. Aneung Tanakul,
please collect your medicine.

932
01:10:51,945 --> 01:10:53,145
I have to go, Dad.

933
01:10:53,225 --> 01:10:55,945
I need to get back to work
after I pay the bill.

934
01:11:03,145 --> 01:11:04,465
Mister.

935
01:11:04,545 --> 01:11:05,945
Are you seeing a doctor?

936
01:11:06,025 --> 01:11:07,345
What I do is my business.

937
01:11:07,825 --> 01:11:09,465
Stay out of it.

938
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:10,825
And that

939
01:11:10,905 --> 01:11:12,025
is your compensation.

940
01:11:16,265 --> 01:11:17,624
It's okay.

941
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:20,265
I can pay for it myself.

942
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:29,624
Don't be arrogant.

943
01:11:29,704 --> 01:11:31,545
Young people like you
need money for things

944
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:33,265
and money to send to your family.

945
01:11:33,345 --> 01:11:34,624
Just take it.

946
01:11:36,945 --> 01:11:38,704
-Wait.
-Listen.

947
01:11:38,784 --> 01:11:41,385
It's his way of apologizing
for causing the accident.

948
01:11:41,945 --> 01:11:43,105
It's just how he talks.

949
01:11:43,585 --> 01:11:45,545
I hope you get better soon.

950
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:47,825
-Wait.
-Mister.

951
01:11:48,865 --> 01:11:49,985
Your medicine.

952
01:11:58,505 --> 01:12:00,305
Everyone has lost something before.

953
01:12:01,945 --> 01:12:03,624
Nut has lost stuff many times.

954
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:06,385
He found some of it,

955
01:12:06,465 --> 01:12:08,105
but not all.

956
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:11,345
But he has never been this way before.

957
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:14,865
I never thought

958
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,545
that me turning into a human

959
01:12:18,545 --> 01:12:20,305
would cause Nut this much pain.

960
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,185
I don't want to cause him pain,

961
01:12:24,225 --> 01:12:25,744
but there's nothing I can do.

962
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,664
Until now,

963
01:12:43,744 --> 01:12:46,425
I still don't know
how the miracle happened.

964
01:12:48,385 --> 01:12:49,945
But that morning,

965
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:52,825
I remember

966
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,945
something strange happening to me.

967
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:00,784
After Nut left for work,

968
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:03,985
my friends and I woke up as usual.

969
01:13:05,225 --> 01:13:06,265
That morning,

970
01:13:06,825 --> 01:13:08,265
something weird happened.

971
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:13,585
Suddenly, I felt this electricity
running through me.

972
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:17,985
I've never been electrocuted before.

973
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:23,385
But I imagine that the feeling
must be similar to getting defibrillated

974
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,744
by doctors in movies.

975
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:28,225
The moment I got defibrillated,
I started to hear a heartbeat.

976
01:13:29,185 --> 01:13:31,624
I almost thought it was my heartbeat.

977
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:44,105
But then I saw Kuenchai.

978
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:46,025
Kuenchai is here.

979
01:13:46,105 --> 01:13:47,465
Run now.

980
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:50,305
Put your legs up, Tofu.

981
01:13:51,185 --> 01:13:53,345
I wish it was just a dream

982
01:13:53,425 --> 01:13:55,585
or my imagination,

983
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:56,905
but it really happened.

984
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:00,105
-Tofu.
-Kuenchai.

985
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,784
-Go away.
-Run from Kuenchai.

986
01:14:03,784 --> 01:14:05,905
-Tofu, come this way.
-Be careful.

987
01:14:05,985 --> 01:14:07,744
-Get on it, Tofu. Hurry.
-Be careful.

988
01:14:07,824 --> 01:14:09,704
You have to get on it, Tofu.

989
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:11,305
-Now, Tofu. Get on.
-Step on me.

990
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:12,585
Kuenchai, go away.

991
01:14:12,664 --> 01:14:15,265
-Bad dog. Don't do this.
-Go away.

992
01:14:15,345 --> 01:14:17,865
-Don't touch me.
-Tofu, be careful.

993
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:19,744
Tofu.

994
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:22,305
-Tofu, be careful.
-Kuenchai.

995
01:14:22,385 --> 01:14:24,425
He's biting me.

996
01:14:25,065 --> 01:14:26,624
-Stop it.
-Tofu.

997
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:28,065
Go now, Tofu.

998
01:14:30,744 --> 01:14:33,465
I really felt my heart beating.

999
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:35,624
Some might find it unfortunate.

1000
01:14:36,425 --> 01:14:37,865
But to me,

1001
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:39,465
it was a miracle.

1002
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,465
#SAVEFORESTWO

1003
01:15:12,225 --> 01:15:13,265
Didn't he go?

1004
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:23,945
Hello.

1005
01:15:26,345 --> 01:15:28,145
Yes, I'm his friend.

1006
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,945
What? What did you say?

1007
01:15:31,505 --> 01:15:32,905
Tarn is at the hospital?

1008
01:15:39,704 --> 01:15:41,145
I'M TAKING TODAY OFF, GEN

1009
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:43,025
OKAY

1010
01:15:50,465 --> 01:15:52,545
Are you still watching footage of Tofu?

1011
01:15:53,145 --> 01:15:54,065
I'm not watching him.

1012
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:56,624
I need to find out where my stuff went.

1013
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:05,105
Wait.

1014
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:06,025
Look at him.

1015
01:16:07,185 --> 01:16:09,744
I can't believe
he was naked in your house.

1016
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:11,624
His skin is so fair.

1017
01:16:11,704 --> 01:16:13,744
This is why I don't trust him.

1018
01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,465
People don't walk naked
into someone's house.

1019
01:16:21,345 --> 01:16:22,425
Wait.

1020
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:24,905
Not only was he naked,

1021
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:27,945
but he was also talking to himself.

1022
01:16:28,025 --> 01:16:29,345
Was he talking to a ghost?

1023
01:16:30,704 --> 01:16:31,744
Seriously?

1024
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:33,824
How superstitious are you?

1025
01:16:36,545 --> 01:16:39,664
Is it possible that he had lost his memory
before the accident?

1026
01:16:40,945 --> 01:16:42,065
I don't know.

1027
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:44,945
But I'm sure he's at my house
for a reason.

1028
01:16:45,824 --> 01:16:47,145
He was up to something.

1029
01:16:47,225 --> 01:16:49,545
You think he was naked
and stole a teddy bear?

1030
01:16:49,624 --> 01:16:51,744
What kind of person
would steal a teddy bear

1031
01:16:51,824 --> 01:16:53,425
while naked?

1032
01:16:53,505 --> 01:16:54,585
Hey.

1033
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:57,385
The footage doesn't show your teddy bear

1034
01:16:57,465 --> 01:16:59,945
falling off the balcony with him.

1035
01:17:00,905 --> 01:17:02,265
Why don't you just ask him

1036
01:17:02,345 --> 01:17:03,465
about the teddy bear?

1037
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:07,225
I wouldn't be looking at footage

1038
01:17:07,305 --> 01:17:08,704
if he had an answer for me.

1039
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:11,385
You're right.

1040
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:14,624
Come on. I'll help you look.

1041
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:19,585
The truth is

1042
01:17:20,545 --> 01:17:22,105
he looks familiar to me.

1043
01:17:22,185 --> 01:17:23,704
Like I've seen him somewhere.

1044
01:17:50,865 --> 01:17:52,545
ADD FRIEND

1045
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:55,865
Hey.

1046
01:18:57,585 --> 01:18:59,824
Hey, are you okay?

1047
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:13,225
Hey.

1048
01:19:14,185 --> 01:19:15,465
Hey.

1049
01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:19,425
Nut.

1050
01:19:20,624 --> 01:19:21,905
Neung.

1051
01:19:24,985 --> 01:19:26,105
Nut.

1052
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:33,945
Why didn't you knock?

1053
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:36,305
I have to knock first?

1054
01:19:43,225 --> 01:19:44,425
What are you looking at?

1055
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:46,905
I'm looking at you.

1056
01:19:51,824 --> 01:19:52,744
Stop it.

1057
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:56,225
Why are you here?

1058
01:19:56,784 --> 01:19:58,185
I'm here to sleep.

1059
01:20:02,225 --> 01:20:03,824
Wait, Tofu.

1060
01:20:03,905 --> 01:20:05,185
Tofu, come here.

1061
01:20:05,265 --> 01:20:06,624
Nut.

1062
01:20:06,704 --> 01:20:07,945
Who said you could stay here?

1063
01:20:08,624 --> 01:20:10,025
I've slept here before.

1064
01:20:11,065 --> 01:20:12,025
When?

1065
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,065
I…

1066
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:15,704
Well…

1067
01:20:16,465 --> 01:20:18,985
I slept here on the day
I carried you upstairs.

1068
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,905
I was here all night.

1069
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,465
You even said you were hot.

1070
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:27,664
So I took off your…

1071
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:28,585
Stop it.

1072
01:20:29,465 --> 01:20:30,905
Don't say another word.

1073
01:20:31,945 --> 01:20:33,664
I don't care what happened,

1074
01:20:33,744 --> 01:20:35,624
but you can't sleep here tonight.

1075
01:20:36,465 --> 01:20:37,905
-Get out.
-Nut.

1076
01:20:37,985 --> 01:20:39,265
-Nut.
-Get up.

1077
01:20:39,345 --> 01:20:40,265
-Nut.
-Get up.

1078
01:20:42,185 --> 01:20:43,784
-Tofu, get up.
-I'm sleeping.

1079
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:47,145
Will you leave willingly
or do I need to beat you up first?

1080
01:20:47,225 --> 01:20:48,624
-Nut.
-Get out.

1081
01:20:50,704 --> 01:20:52,465
-Go.
-Nut, but…

1082
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:58,185
This is your room.

1083
01:20:58,265 --> 01:20:59,824
Stay away from mine.

1084
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:03,385
Nut.

1085
01:21:06,265 --> 01:21:07,704
Get inside.

1086
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:35,425
Hello.

1087
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:38,824
Is anyone here?

1088
01:21:39,505 --> 01:21:40,865
My name is Tofu.

1089
01:21:43,704 --> 01:21:44,865
Hello, Ms. Fox.

1090
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:05,905
Do I have to sleep here alone tonight?

1091
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:37,265
NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED…

1092
01:22:39,145 --> 01:22:40,265
Hey.

1093
01:22:40,345 --> 01:22:42,305
Hey, are you okay?

1094
01:23:06,505 --> 01:23:10,664
WHETHER IT ENDED WITH A SMILE

1095
01:23:11,265 --> 01:23:16,905
OR TEARS…

1096
01:23:16,985 --> 01:23:19,985
SOME MEMORIES

1097
01:23:20,065 --> 01:23:26,145
CANNOT ERASE YOUR FEELINGS

1098
01:23:43,824 --> 01:23:45,865
Hey, don't sit on me

1099
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:47,624
or I have to remain stiff just for you.

1100
01:23:55,225 --> 01:23:59,065
What are you complaining about?
Justice is nothing but discourse.

1101
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:02,065
Calm down, Honey.

1102
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:03,545
You shouldn't fight.

1103
01:24:03,624 --> 01:24:05,265
Tofu is stressed out right now.

1104
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:09,145
A monk once said

1105
01:24:09,225 --> 01:24:10,385
"smart people

1106
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:14,945
turn misfortune into opportunities

1107
01:24:15,025 --> 01:24:18,824
while careless people
turn opportunities into misfortune."

1108
01:24:19,585 --> 01:24:20,664
Sathu to that.

1109
01:24:23,664 --> 01:24:25,145
I forgot to introduce you.

1110
01:24:26,065 --> 01:24:28,065
These are my new friends downstairs.

1111
01:24:28,145 --> 01:24:29,385
First, there's Ms. Sofa.

1112
01:24:30,664 --> 01:24:32,425
She's a true fashionista.

1113
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:35,105
She often uses English words,

1114
01:24:35,664 --> 01:24:37,505
but somehow,
we all seem to understand her.

1115
01:24:37,585 --> 01:24:40,025
And that is Mr. Right Slipper.

1116
01:24:41,025 --> 01:24:42,865
He's a hot-headed

1117
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,905
and progressive guy
who is fully devoted to idealism.

1118
01:24:46,945 --> 01:24:49,225
Ms. Sofa doesn't seem to like him much.

1119
01:24:49,865 --> 01:24:51,744
They argue about everything.

1120
01:24:52,265 --> 01:24:54,824
His girlfriend, Ms. Left Slipper,

1121
01:24:54,905 --> 01:24:56,585
always has to calm things down.

1122
01:24:58,345 --> 01:24:59,305
And that

1123
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:01,105
is Mr. Rocking Chair.

1124
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,624
Nut's mom falls asleep on him
waiting for Nut every night.

1125
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,305
And that's her phone.

1126
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,865
She always leaves her phone downstairs.

1127
01:25:13,945 --> 01:25:15,585
I got to know everyone

1128
01:25:16,385 --> 01:25:18,744
on the day I fell off the balcony.

1129
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:22,225
Fine, since Tofu
is so stressed out right now,

1130
01:25:22,305 --> 01:25:23,385
I'll let him sit on me.

1131
01:25:24,425 --> 01:25:26,265
Sit down, Beary.

1132
01:25:27,865 --> 01:25:29,105
It's okay.

1133
01:25:29,664 --> 01:25:30,985
I can just sit here.

1134
01:25:36,185 --> 01:25:38,345
I'm sorry for bothering you.

1135
01:25:39,664 --> 01:25:41,345
But I have no one to turn to.

1136
01:25:43,865 --> 01:25:47,425
How can I help you?

1137
01:25:49,425 --> 01:25:51,225
Now that I'm a human,

1138
01:25:51,985 --> 01:25:53,265
I can talk to Nut,

1139
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:55,105
touch his hands,

1140
01:25:55,185 --> 01:25:57,385
and even hug him.

1141
01:25:57,465 --> 01:25:58,465
-Wow.
-Oh, my god.

1142
01:25:59,425 --> 01:26:01,065
-They can hold hands.
-How exciting.

1143
01:26:01,145 --> 01:26:03,704
-They can hug too.
-Oh, my…

1144
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:05,425
-Oh, my goodness.
-It's just a hug.

1145
01:26:05,505 --> 01:26:07,905
-I'm so happy for you.
-It's not a big deal.

1146
01:26:07,985 --> 01:26:09,624
But…

1147
01:26:09,704 --> 01:26:11,624
I can't go inside his room.

1148
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:14,945
It sucks being a human.

1149
01:26:16,425 --> 01:26:18,265
Should I find a way to turn back?

1150
01:26:18,824 --> 01:26:22,345
A lowly toy like you is full of nonsense.

1151
01:26:22,425 --> 01:26:24,105
How can you turn back into a bear

1152
01:26:24,185 --> 01:26:26,505
when you don't even know
how you became a human?

1153
01:26:28,585 --> 01:26:31,905
What woke us up then?

1154
01:26:31,985 --> 01:26:36,145
When we woke up, we were already
in this average human's house.

1155
01:26:39,385 --> 01:26:41,065
Did we wake up

1156
01:26:41,585 --> 01:26:43,345
because we were brought into the house?

1157
01:26:44,025 --> 01:26:47,025
Not every piece of furniture
is awake though,

1158
01:26:47,105 --> 01:26:48,704
Teddy.

1159
01:26:48,784 --> 01:26:50,225
You are right.

1160
01:26:50,985 --> 01:26:53,345
No furniture in the guest room

1161
01:26:53,425 --> 01:26:55,585
is awake at all.

1162
01:26:56,585 --> 01:26:58,505
Something must have woken us up.

1163
01:26:59,065 --> 01:27:00,305
Something important.

1164
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:04,824
Does the teddy bear mean so much to you?

1165
01:27:05,985 --> 01:27:07,864
It was a gift from someone special.

1166
01:27:12,704 --> 01:27:14,025
Neung.

1167
01:27:15,345 --> 01:27:16,545
Neung.

1168
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:21,305
Neung.

1169
01:27:21,864 --> 01:27:22,864
-Who's that?
-Neung?

1170
01:27:22,945 --> 01:27:23,905
-Neung.
-Who's "Neung".

1171
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,265
-Who's that?
-Who is he?

1172
01:27:26,864 --> 01:27:28,505
-Neung?
-Who are you talking about?

1173
01:27:28,585 --> 01:27:30,824
Nut has mentioned Neung's name twice.

1174
01:27:31,824 --> 01:27:35,385
If the fact that being brought
inside the house didn't wake us up,

1175
01:27:36,345 --> 01:27:38,305
the reason could be about two people.

1176
01:27:41,185 --> 01:27:43,545
Maybe I have something to do
with this Neung guy.

1177
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:44,824
Neung?

1178
01:27:44,905 --> 01:27:46,465
-Who is he?
-Neung?

1179
01:27:46,545 --> 01:27:48,305
-Who is he?
-I want to know.

1180
01:27:48,385 --> 01:27:49,784
-What's the answer.
-Who is he?

1181
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:52,145
-Analyzing again.
-How are you related to him?

1182
01:27:53,025 --> 01:27:55,185
-I don't understand.
-Who's Neung?

1183
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:10,985
What the…

1184
01:28:12,105 --> 01:28:13,185
Nut.

1185
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:15,345
Why aren't you dressed?

1186
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:18,265
Clothes make me itch.

1187
01:28:18,345 --> 01:28:20,345
I don't care. You have to keep them on.

1188
01:28:21,425 --> 01:28:22,784
You're not dressed either.

1189
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,345
How did you come inside?
Didn't I lock the door?

1190
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:31,185
You locked the door,

1191
01:28:31,864 --> 01:28:33,145
but not the balcony.

1192
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:55,585
You try too hard.

1193
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,105
I do. Humans should be ambitious.

1194
01:28:58,664 --> 01:29:00,545
I'm insulting you right now.

1195
01:29:00,624 --> 01:29:04,065
You aren't allowed to come in here
through any entrance.

1196
01:29:04,145 --> 01:29:05,305
I'll count to three.

1197
01:29:05,385 --> 01:29:06,425
-But Nut…
-One.

1198
01:29:07,265 --> 01:29:08,385
-Two.
-Nut.

1199
01:29:08,465 --> 01:29:11,265
-You didn't count until three.
-I can't wait that long.

1200
01:29:11,345 --> 01:29:12,585
Shall I kick you again?

1201
01:29:12,664 --> 01:29:13,624
One.

1202
01:29:13,704 --> 01:29:15,025
-I'm leaving.
-Two.

1203
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:19,985
Nut.

1204
01:29:21,305 --> 01:29:22,784
Can I leave through the door?

1205
01:29:22,864 --> 01:29:24,145
-One.
-Nut.

1206
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,265
Two.

1207
01:29:36,864 --> 01:29:38,105
He may have told me off,

1208
01:29:38,945 --> 01:29:41,265
but I got to sleep with Nut last night.

1209
01:29:50,025 --> 01:29:53,744
I wonder if Na knows how far

1210
01:29:53,824 --> 01:29:55,585
her son and the caretaker have gone.

1211
01:29:55,664 --> 01:29:57,945
Please stop your madness!

1212
01:29:58,025 --> 01:29:59,824
I'm embarrassed!

1213
01:29:59,905 --> 01:30:01,585
If you want to stay in this house,

1214
01:30:01,664 --> 01:30:05,225
-I don't--
-I'll take good care of you and your mom.

1215
01:30:05,305 --> 01:30:07,784
You'll leave once your memory is back.

1216
01:30:07,864 --> 01:30:10,265
You might not even remember me then,

1217
01:30:10,345 --> 01:30:12,105
since I'm not that important.

1218
01:30:13,145 --> 01:30:15,905
Do you think high school love is all pure?

1219
01:30:16,385 --> 01:30:18,664
I'm sure you've read my synopsis.

1220
01:30:19,305 --> 01:30:21,265
Don't get on my nerves, Biker Boy.

1221
01:30:21,345 --> 01:30:22,505
-Myself and--
-Nut.

1222
01:30:23,265 --> 01:30:24,265
Neung!

1223
01:31:20,305 --> 01:31:25,305
