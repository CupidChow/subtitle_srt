1
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:06,664
Didn't I tell you

2
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,385
not to talk to her

3
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,585
as long as you're living here?

4
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,105
When I locked eyes with Nut earlier,

5
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,385
-my heart was beating really fast.
-What?

6
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,105
You're just like him, Little Prince.

7
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,545
You really care for me.

8
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,785
Now that you know
I'm not related to Neung,

9
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,425
you won't kick me out, will you?

10
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,425
If I wanted to,

11
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:33,425
I would've left you
at the temple that day.

12
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,464
I'm a bear, not a dog.

13
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,945
Listen. He's just a kid.

14
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:41,985
Haven't you heard people say
that you should never work with kids?

15
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,665
If you don't trust me…

16
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:48,904
you could try going out with me.

17
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,665
Everyone, look.

18
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:20,105
Teddy is acting
more and more like a human.

19
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:22,784
How?

20
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:24,904
You seem to have a lot on your mind,

21
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:27,025
like there's something you want to say

22
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:28,825
but you won't say it.

23
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,784
You used to say all your thoughts
when you were a teddy bear.

24
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:35,145
I guess the more time I spend with humans,

25
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:39,184
the more I know that
there are some things we shouldn't say,

26
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,464
because they can hurt someone.

27
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,665
But some things, I just don't understand,

28
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,224
so I don't know what to say.

29
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:52,545
If being a human is so hard,
turn back into a teddy bear.

30
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:53,985
Come back to us.

31
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,545
I'm trying.

32
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:00,425
I almost found out who gave me to Nut,

33
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,145
but I was still wrong.

34
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:07,985
Maybe Nut won you
after playing darts at a temple fair?

35
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,265
No!

36
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,865
He said someone important gave me to him.

37
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:15,105
I must be more important
than a prize at a fair.

38
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:17,025
Calm down, Tofu.

39
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:21,144
Look, he gets angry
like a real person now.

40
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:25,065
-He's kind of similar to Nut.
-He's kind of similar to Nut.

41
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,185
Hey!

42
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,345
Why are you here?

43
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,105
I brought in your laundry.

44
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:56,465
What should I do next?

45
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,305
You need to go and iron them.

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,105
-Iron?
-Yes.

47
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,945
Don't tell me you don't know how to do it.

48
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,704
Listen.

49
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,264
This is linen,

50
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:15,785
so it needs high heat.

51
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:18,905
Put the heat on high for linen.

52
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,185
Then start ironing.

53
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,785
Go slowly, see?

54
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,144
Go over the whole thing.

55
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,584
That's it.

56
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,264
You try this side.

57
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:44,745
Slowly.

58
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:46,345
Yes.

59
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:51,105
Don't iron over the buttons.

60
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:53,385
Here.

61
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:54,584
What you do

62
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:58,185
is gently push the iron
between the buttons like this.

63
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:00,185
Slowly.

64
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:03,745
See?

65
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,385
Yes.

66
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:07,264
Try it.

67
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:10,704
Here.

68
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,065
Oh, Tofu.

69
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,185
Here.

70
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,904
Like this, slowly.

71
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:38,865
Hold the fabric with one hand.

72
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:39,985
Yes.

73
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:24,785
Nut, are you hurt?

74
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:30,225
No,

75
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:31,385
it's just hot.

76
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:34,505
Was it hot?

77
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,185
Touch your earlobes.

78
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:38,425
Is it better?

79
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,105
A little bit.

80
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,665
Hold your earlobes.

81
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:45,945
What for?

82
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,824
Just do as I say.

83
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,625
No.

84
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:52,105
-Like this.
-No.

85
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,425
Like this.

86
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,024
It's all right, it's not hot anymore.

87
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:32,544
Why do I feel so hot?

88
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,784
Is this the sound of my heart or yours?

89
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,745
Get out. You're not good.

90
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:48,905
I'll do it myself. Go.

91
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,225
Go on.

92
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:44,985
Beary,

93
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,944
why are you all hot and sweaty?

94
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:52,465
I was ironing.

95
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:54,424
Maybe it gave me fever.

96
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:56,825
Can ironing cause fever?

97
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:58,785
Right?

98
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,745
Tell me how you feel.

99
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,184
I'm not sure.

100
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,225
I feel hot all over.

101
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,184
There are butterflies in my stomach.

102
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:17,785
My heart is beating fast too.

103
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:21,064
You don't sound like you have fever.

104
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:24,225
Oh, he can't understand you.

105
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,064
Hey, Tofu,

106
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:27,105
are you sure

107
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:30,105
that the only thing you did was iron?

108
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:32,944
It really was.

109
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,145
But while I was ironing,

110
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:38,145
Nut said he was hot,

111
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,944
so I held his earlobes.

112
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,625
-Held his earlobes?
-Held his earlobes?

113
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,825
Did you hold anything else?

114
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:47,865
No.

115
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,064
You did just that and then got all hot?

116
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:02,665
Ha, what do single people know?

117
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,544
Little One, tell them.

118
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:08,824
I think you like Nut, Tofu.

119
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:11,145
That's why your heart beats fast

120
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:14,265
and you get butterflies
when you're near him.

121
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:18,824
It's that feeling you get
when you really like someone.

122
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,225
When you're near them

123
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,505
and lock eyes with them,

124
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,025
your heart starts beating fast.

125
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:30,865
But I'm just a teddy bear.

126
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,424
How can I like my owner?

127
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,064
Don't forget, Beary,

128
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:38,304
you're not just a teddy bear anymore.

129
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,304
But I have to turn back
into a teddy bear anyway.

130
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:09,064
I don't know
when I'll turn back into a teddy bear,

131
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,865
but I've decided that

132
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:13,905
before that day comes,

133
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:17,225
I'll make the most of my time with Nut.

134
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:33,585
Nut, are you hurt?

135
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:38,944
No,

136
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,064
it's just hot.

137
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:41,585
Hold your earlobes.

138
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:42,865
What for?

139
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,704
Just do as I say.

140
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:46,865
-Like this.
-No.

141
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:48,225
Like this.

142
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,465
Why do I feel so hot?

143
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,625
Is this the sound of my heart or yours?

144
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:43,665
I'll be off, Mom.

145
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,145
Nut.

146
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,025
It's my first time making it.

147
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,145
It might not be very good.

148
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,905
By the way, how's the shirt?

149
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,424
Oh,

150
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:06,424
where's Mom?

151
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:08,985
Nut.

152
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,785
I'm sorry, I overslept.

153
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,424
Oh, and your lunch?

154
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:20,665
I already made it for him.

155
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,424
I'm off to work, Mom.

156
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,025
You should go back to sleep.

157
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:30,105
Bye.

158
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:40,505
I can't even wake up
to make lunch for Nut.

159
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,785
How am I supposed to do
other things for him?

160
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,505
Don't worry, Mrs. Na,

161
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:49,184
anyone can oversleep.

162
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:52,665
As long as you stay healthy,
Nut will be happy.

163
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:00,145
Have some apple juice.

164
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:03,304
Song's father said
it's good for the heart.

165
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,385
I want you to try some.

166
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,304
Thank you.

167
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,505
You're so lovely, Little Prince.

168
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:28,944
I'm sorry, Mrs. Na.

169
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:32,385
I made you oversleep.

170
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:40,665
But if I didn't do this…

171
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:43,944
Nut wouldn't be happy.

172
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,345
Go on.

173
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:51,865
What are you making?

174
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,064
Apple juice.

175
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:55,584
Thank you.

176
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,625
FIRST LOVE

177
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:39,584
It's my first time making it.

178
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,424
It might not be very good.

179
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:57,505
Want to try it?

180
00:16:58,424 --> 00:16:59,265
Yuck.

181
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,184
Try it. I put a lot of effort into it.

182
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:03,105
Here.

183
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,224
How is it?

184
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:08,984
Delicious, right?

185
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,464
Hey,

186
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:12,424
it's great.

187
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,065
Iced Americano with no sugar,

188
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:30,024
but with all my heart,
in exchange for your lunch.

189
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:36,305
How come your food looks terrible today?

190
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,825
The pork is all burnt.

191
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,065
There's no food for me today then.

192
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,225
I'll throw it out for you.

193
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,024
No,

194
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:45,825
I can eat it.

195
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:58,264
Gen,

196
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,865
Nut's taste is so weird.

197
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,865
He gives yummy-looking food
to other people,

198
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,345
but eats burnt pork by himself.

199
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,425
What's so special about that pork?

200
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:19,585
If he can eat stuff like that,
all is not lost for me.

201
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,024
I have an idea.

202
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,264
You're crazy.

203
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:31,465
What's up?

204
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:33,905
What?

205
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,504
You bought an air fryer?

206
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:36,425
Why?

207
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,185
I'm going to learn to fry pork.

208
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:41,305
I'll impress Nut with my cooking skills.

209
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,744
You never cease to amaze me.

210
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,744
I'll bring you some to try later.

211
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:48,825
Bye now.

212
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:54,825
Oh, Prib.

213
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,625
Oh, Mr. Anik.

214
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:02,984
Any updates on Tarn's case?

215
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:05,945
The police
still haven't ruled out anything,

216
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,705
for both the conflict with TRD
and his personal problems.

217
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,984
In his personal life,

218
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:14,984
I'm certain there's no woman involved.

219
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:17,744
What makes you think so?

220
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:21,185
Since he came back to Thailand
two years ago,

221
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:22,945
he hasn't dated anyone.

222
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:25,385
He never forgot his first love

223
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,744
and he never got serious with anyone.

224
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,185
I was really touched by that,

225
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:33,625
so I created a page called

226
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,865
"Once Upon Our Time" to tell his story.

227
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:40,625
If you check it out,
you might understand him more.

228
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,145
ONCE UPON OUR TIME

229
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,984
I didn't know
that Tarn could never love me,

230
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,065
so I made a move on him.

231
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:53,705
In the end, I failed.

232
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:56,145
We became good friends instead

233
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,024
and grew a lot closer.

234
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:03,984
After you've read the page, if you want
to know anything else about Tarn,

235
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,784
you can ask me.

236
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:09,705
Hey!

237
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,385
You puppy,

238
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:14,225
you're such a child.

239
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,305
Dad,

240
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,625
are you a BL fanboy?

241
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,984
Are you crazy?

242
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,825
It has to do with my case.

243
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:25,185
You have cases like this now?

244
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:26,625
That's pretty trendy.

245
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:28,784
Of course.

246
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,264
It's Neung's friend's case.

247
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,065
I just realized

248
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,865
that he's not manly.

249
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:37,065
Not manly?

250
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,145
Just the fact that he's a guy
who likes guys

251
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:40,585
makes him not manly?

252
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:43,024
Hey, wait,

253
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,385
what do you think I mean?

254
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,024
What I mean by manly is masculinity.

255
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,305
A person of any gender can be manly.

256
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,784
How did you understand it?

257
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,065
Dad,

258
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:02,385
keep working.

259
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,345
I'll be the chef tonight.

260
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:07,065
What do you want,
omelet, fried egg, or steamed egg?

261
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:08,865
No thanks.

262
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,945
Chef Dad will take care of it.

263
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,625
Go take a shower.

264
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,264
You stink. Go.

265
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,784
Stink? Take that.

266
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:19,264
Go on, you puppy.

267
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,305
Oh, dear.

268
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,625
Come have some fruit, Mrs. Na.

269
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:48,145
What are you looking for?

270
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:52,385
Saen.

271
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,264
I haven't seen him.

272
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,024
Did he come home last night?

273
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:01,984
I think so.

274
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,385
He probably left before you woke up.

275
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:06,625
Right,

276
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:08,305
I woke up late today.

277
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:11,945
I should scold him though.

278
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:13,825
He could have woken me up.

279
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:19,544
I don't know
how long he'll be gone this time.

280
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:22,744
He used to work in a factory
outside Bangkok

281
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,385
and he would come home every week.

282
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,264
Sometimes he would be gone for a few weeks

283
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:29,865
or even months.

284
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:34,744
I'm not coming back to Bangkok
this weekend.

285
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:36,065
Again?

286
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:38,585
But it's my birthday this Saturday.

287
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:40,905
Saen?

288
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:43,065
Saen?

289
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:45,105
Hello?

290
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:04,744
Did you get cut off?

291
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:08,465
Saen is in a meeting.

292
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,665
Do you have a message for him?

293
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:13,105
Please let it be about work only, though,

294
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,225
because he's working right now.

295
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:16,865
I'm sorry.

296
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,065
I'll call again later.

297
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,305
Since that year,

298
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:30,984
he and I haven't celebrated
a birthday together.

299
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,145
That's okay,

300
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,984
we can celebrate together

301
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,345
and make it a huge party.

302
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:42,425
But I just had my birthday.

303
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:44,784
But Nut's birthday

304
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:46,185
is coming up this month.

305
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,625
That's right.

306
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:49,984
It's only a while

307
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:51,425
until September 8.

308
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,905
You know his birthday?

309
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,305
He told me once.

310
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,185
Nut is back.

311
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,625
Hi, Mom.

312
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:30,665
Here.

313
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,665
Didn't you eat my food?

314
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,744
Don't look so sad. Open it up first.

315
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:10,065
YOURS. MOM'S.

316
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,065
Tofu pudding.

317
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,264
Beans in syrup.

318
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:22,024
-Fried tofu.
-Yes.

319
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:24,065
You got these for me?

320
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:25,905
Can't you read?

321
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:28,425
KEUNCHAI'S

322
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:30,825
Keunchai's,

323
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:33,865
Mom's,

324
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,264
yours.

325
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,024
Mine.

326
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:45,825
Thank you, Nut.

327
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:47,625
I'll finish all the tofu pudding.

328
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,304
By the way,

329
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:57,784
who gave you that pork recipe?

330
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,665
I just followed my gut,

331
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:03,345
why?

332
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,905
Nothing.

333
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:11,345
But next time, use less heat.

334
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,625
If I keep eating that,

335
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,024
I'll get cancer.

336
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:16,984
Okay,

337
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:19,024
it won't be burnt next time.

338
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,105
I said don't burn it.

339
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:24,385
Yes, not burnt.

340
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,105
I gathered some more evidence.

341
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:45,905
Before Tatarn was attacked,

342
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:49,825
apart from his co-worker,
Mrs. Sajjaree Burarat also called him.

343
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:52,825
-That's Saen's surname.
-Yes.

344
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,425
She's his wife and Tatarn's aunt.

345
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:58,385
Isn't that odd?

346
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,065
She lives in Bangkok,

347
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:01,665
but someone saw her in Chiang Mai

348
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:03,625
when Tatarn was attacked.

349
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,744
Saen never said that his wife
was in Chiang Mai.

350
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,225
It seems like he's hiding something.

351
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:11,665
Find out

352
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,065
when Sajjaree arrived and left,

353
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,145
and where she went.

354
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:16,544
Yes, sir.

355
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:19,705
Please put that away.

356
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,145
Your lieutenant called about the case?

357
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:24,504
Yes.

358
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,984
We got new evidence
in Neung's friend's case.

359
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:28,905
So,

360
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:31,665
do they know who did it?

361
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,225
We still can't say,

362
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:40,185
but it looks like this wasn't
a normal robbery and attack.

363
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:43,544
Neung's friend is an activist

364
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,544
and he comes from a wealthy family.

365
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:46,945
He inherited a lot of money,

366
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,665
so maybe someone is trying to harm him.

367
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,024
The thing I least want to happen

368
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,865
is a family conflict.

369
00:27:58,425 --> 00:27:59,625
That's true, Dad.

370
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,425
If the perpetrator
is someone close to you,

371
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,905
that hurts like nothing else.

372
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,705
Dad,

373
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:12,665
when do you have to get back to work?

374
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,905
Tomorrow, why?

375
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:19,905
Nothing.

376
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,544
BRAT

377
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,705
Brat.

378
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:50,865
BRAT

379
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,385
BRAT

380
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:14,905
BRAT

381
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:18,705
What is it, you imp?

382
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:22,504
Man, you're so cold.

383
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,185
Say what you have to say.

384
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,304
I'm about to sleep.

385
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,304
We start filming next week.

386
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:32,225
So?

387
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,784
Will I get to see you?

388
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:37,064
I don't think so.

389
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:39,585
But I want to see you.

390
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,504
Why do you want to see me?

391
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,544
Well,

392
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,865
my dad is busy,

393
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:50,304
so I want an older relative
to come and give me support.

394
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:54,905
When did I become your relative?

395
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:56,705
I keep treating you like an uncle

396
00:29:56,784 --> 00:29:58,585
because I wish you were my family.

397
00:29:58,665 --> 00:29:59,625
Oh,

398
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:01,385
or should I call you

399
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,665
little brother?

400
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:05,304
You punk, brat, hoodlum,

401
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:06,984
disrespectful crazy person!

402
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:09,665
Now, I can sleep soundly.

403
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:12,185
You're such a psycho.

404
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:13,865
See you around.

405
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,665
Sweet dreams. Good night.

406
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:17,585
Kiss, kiss.

407
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,504
Song, you idiot!

408
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:46,145
I don't know why
I'm so sleepy all the time these days.

409
00:30:46,665 --> 00:30:50,504
If I didn't set three alarms,
I wouldn't have woken up.

410
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,105
I think it's good to rest a lot.

411
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,905
You look much stronger now,

412
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:57,225
and more energetic during the day too.

413
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:03,905
-Mom.
-Yes?

414
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:07,385
We start shooting today,
so you don't need to make me lunch.

415
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:08,865
I'll eat on the set.

416
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:10,945
Bye now.

417
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,145
Nut.

418
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:44,425
Chu.

419
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:45,945
-Hello.
-Hi.

420
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:52,225
We went to the market and got you this.

421
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:53,385
Thank you.

422
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:54,784
-I'll hold it for you.
-What?

423
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:57,824
It smells so good.

424
00:31:57,905 --> 00:31:59,665
Hey, listen.

425
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:03,145
Tofu, do you know where Jan went?

426
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:04,705
Oh,

427
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:06,064
is she not home?

428
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:11,544
No. When I woke up this morning,
I saw her get into a taxi with a suitcase.

429
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:14,465
She probably…

430
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:16,824
went to see Mr. Saen in Chiang Mai.

431
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:21,905
No wonder. They just had a fight.
She must be trying to make it up to him.

432
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,225
Why are you so nosy?

433
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:27,064
You're unbelievable.

434
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,105
By the way,

435
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,665
how's Na, Tofu?

436
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:32,585
She hasn't been out to give alms lately.

437
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:35,625
She's fine.

438
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:39,905
Tofu,

439
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,744
you know you can talk to me.

440
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:45,865
Well…

441
00:32:47,504 --> 00:32:48,945
Mrs. Na

442
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:52,385
hasn't been cooking for Nut.

443
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,425
And she's been feeling sad

444
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:57,465
and even blaming herself.

445
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,345
She feels worthless.

446
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:01,945
I understand her, Tofu.

447
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,705
She wants to do things for her son,

448
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:05,784
like cook for him.

449
00:33:05,865 --> 00:33:08,064
She wants to do
whatever that makes him happy.

450
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,385
But now that he's a grown-up

451
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,345
and he goes to work,

452
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:14,185
she feels like

453
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,425
she's not useful anymore.

454
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:16,665
Do you understand?

455
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,465
And Na is always at home.

456
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,544
She never goes out.

457
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,264
So now

458
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,465
that she's not cooking for her son,

459
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,784
she probably feels worthless.

460
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:31,465
And what is it like
to feel you're worth something?

461
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:32,705
Well,

462
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:34,824
that has to do with…

463
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:37,544
I'll let Nhong explain.
He studied engineering.

464
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,945
-Nhong, explain it.
-I went to culinary school.

465
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,385
Come on, explain it.

466
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:45,665
To feel like you're worth something? Well…

467
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,824
What?

468
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:51,064
I guess it's when you make
someone else happy.

469
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:54,705
But it doesn't have to be anything big.

470
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,185
It can be small things,

471
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:58,865
like giving them support
and making them smile.

472
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,225
And you also feel happy with them.

473
00:34:01,784 --> 00:34:03,705
I guess that's the feeling

474
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:04,945
of being worth something.

475
00:34:07,984 --> 00:34:09,065
Thank you.

476
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:11,304
You two are worth a lot to me today.

477
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,625
-Thank you.
-Hey…

478
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:17,585
-The fried dough?
-What?

479
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:19,824
Oh, it's so nice. Let me have one more.

480
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:22,025
I'll be off now.

481
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:23,985
Why did you eat it?

482
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:25,344
We bought it for him.

483
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:27,585
-It's for him.
-It's really good.

484
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,985
How can you say that?
Why didn't you give it to him?

485
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:31,145
Because it's good.

486
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,505
-Try some.
-No.

487
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,864
-It's great.
-You're so bad.

488
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:39,585
It's really great.

489
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:42,985
I think I understand now what it means

490
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:44,944
to feel like you're worth something.

491
00:34:45,545 --> 00:34:47,304
When I was a teddy bear,

492
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:49,065
I listened to Nut

493
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:50,585
when he was happy

494
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:52,105
and when he was sad.

495
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:53,744
Now that I'm a person,

496
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,665
I feel I'm worth even more

497
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,825
because I don't just listen,

498
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:01,465
but I can help Nut and Mrs. Na
with a lot of things.

499
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:02,745
At least,

500
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:05,345
I don't have to wait to be hugged anymore.

501
00:35:05,424 --> 00:35:08,985
I can hug someone
to make them feel better.

502
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:11,904
Even though being a human isn't easy,

503
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,904
I'm enjoying it more and more.

504
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:51,985
Mrs. Na,

505
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,185
shall we make some snacks?

506
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,424
Do you like this location?

507
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:17,785
The place we booked canceled on us.

508
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:19,985
Luckily,

509
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,985
my cousin is the deputy director here.

510
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:24,265
Who?

511
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:25,944
Joonjuea.

512
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:29,265
Oh, hi, Pritr.

513
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:32,665
-I would be in trouble if not for you.
-Yes.

514
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:34,944
You never come to me
when you're not in trouble.

515
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,265
Hey…

516
00:36:39,745 --> 00:36:40,625
Oh,

517
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,825
aren't you Peeranut?

518
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:56,505
This school doesn't actually accept
students in the second semester,

519
00:36:56,585 --> 00:36:58,705
but Na is my friend

520
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:01,585
and Sib has helped me in the past,

521
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:04,065
so I begged the director to let you in.

522
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,025
Study hard

523
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:08,105
and don't get me in trouble,

524
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,505
okay?

525
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:13,745
Don't forget that your parents asked me
to keep an eye on you.

526
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,505
I thought you wouldn't remember me.

527
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:28,785
It has been around seven to eight years
and you haven't been back once.

528
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,825
Did you write the script for this series?

529
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,145
What's it about?

530
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,025
-Hey!
-Hey!

531
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,345
About life in high school?

532
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:48,625
You didn't use your experience
as material, right?

533
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,384
Of course, I did,

534
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:52,505
but not all of it.

535
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:56,025
I have both good memories of this place

536
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:57,864
and not-so-good ones

537
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,505
that I personally want to tell.

538
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:07,464
But this story isn't just about
the daily lives of kids.

539
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:11,065
It explores society within a school,

540
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,424
the class system,

541
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:16,424
power,

542
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:18,625
and oppression.

543
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,705
Interesting.

544
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:23,745
Does it

545
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,105
also include your love story?

546
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:33,265
Of course.

547
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:35,625
And it's not an odd thing anymore.

548
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,025
But it's still not normal.

549
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,025
If for you, normal means

550
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:46,065
only thinking the way you do,

551
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:49,384
then half the world would be abnormal.

552
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,625
For me,

553
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:55,825
everyone is normal.

554
00:38:58,265 --> 00:38:59,864
Just because I'm not like you

555
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:01,864
or other people

556
00:39:02,904 --> 00:39:04,785
doesn't mean that I'm not normal.

557
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,665
Please watch this show once it airs.

558
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:15,505
Maybe

559
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,625
it will help you understand
sexual diversity more

560
00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:21,665
and be respectful to everyone,

561
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,305
no matter their age

562
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:26,545
or gender.

563
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:32,025
Please excuse me.

564
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:13,545
Cut!

565
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,944
See, Gen?

566
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:17,105
His acting is superb.

567
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:20,424
It isn't superb.

568
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,505
And he isn't acting.

569
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:24,625
He's being himself.

570
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,345
If he irritates you so much,

571
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,985
I can deliver the photos to the client

572
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:35,025
instead of you.

573
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,745
I don't avoid my responsibilities.

574
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:40,265
And I'm here

575
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,785
to support Nut.

576
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,864
Are you sure you're here just for Nut?

577
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:49,985
Aren't you here

578
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,785
especially for me?

579
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:54,665
I'm here to laugh when you fail.

580
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:58,265
Song,

581
00:40:58,345 --> 00:40:59,864
go get changed right now.

582
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:01,225
Cameras, lights,

583
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,785
move to the basketball court.

584
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:04,864
Hurry up.

585
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:05,864
Come on.

586
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,665
Juea.

587
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:09,625
What now?

588
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:11,864
The extra playing
the rival basketball captain

589
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:14,305
crashed his bike and is in the hospital.

590
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,105
What do we do?

591
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:22,105
Who can play basketball?

592
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:26,065
Call and see if we can get

593
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:27,265
someone in time?

594
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:33,305
I think we have someone.

595
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:42,864
I brought some food for Nut.

596
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,745
Isn't that kid with Nut?

597
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:46,705
That's right.

598
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:48,665
He plays basketball?

599
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,705
He doesn't just play. He's a god.

600
00:41:55,464 --> 00:41:56,864
And…

601
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:57,985
action!

602
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:17,625
Okay.

603
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:18,864
One more time.

604
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,145
What do you want to eat?

605
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:33,785
Daydreaming again.

606
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:10,825
Hey,

607
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:12,625
Nut!

608
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:40,745
Neung.

609
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:43,745
Are you okay?

610
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:49,545
Hey,

611
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:51,665
Tofu!

612
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:13,464
Hey.

613
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:15,305
Here we are.

614
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:17,305
Are you okay, Tofu?

615
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:18,424
Can you keep playing?

616
00:47:19,384 --> 00:47:21,464
Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore.

617
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:24,384
What's wrong with you, Nut?

618
00:47:24,464 --> 00:47:26,225
Why did you barge into the set?

619
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:33,825
I'm sorry.

620
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:35,625
I was distracted.

621
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:38,705
Are you okay?

622
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,705
I am.

623
00:47:44,105 --> 00:47:45,505
-Juea.
-What?

624
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:47,785
Keep shooting.

625
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,984
I'll go to the toilet.

626
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:50,785
-It's over there.
-I know.

627
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:55,904
Hey, I own this company.

628
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:01,025
Is it because we're at his school?

629
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:03,825
Why does he seem so distracted?

630
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:07,345
This is Nut's school?

631
00:48:07,424 --> 00:48:08,625
I just found out too.

632
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:11,585
I met my cousin, the deputy director here,
this morning.

633
00:48:11,665 --> 00:48:13,745
She said hello,
but he completely ignored her.

634
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:15,225
I guess he doesn't like her.

635
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:17,944
He's really stressed out

636
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:19,345
that we're shooting here.

637
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:23,105
Maybe he has some bad memories
about school?

638
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:36,665
Peeranut.

639
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:44,585
I know what you did.

640
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:47,305
Because of that,

641
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:51,984
I'll have to tell your parents
what you did.

642
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,065
Hey,

643
00:49:20,145 --> 00:49:21,984
why aren't you in the girls' toilet?

644
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:24,065
You want to see our junk?

645
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:29,145
Does your dad know you're a sissy?

646
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:33,265
Hi, sissy!

647
00:49:34,185 --> 00:49:35,384
Think you can fight me?

648
00:49:35,464 --> 00:49:38,025
Why don't you go
ask your beloved Neung for help?

649
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:40,705
Oh, sissy!

650
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:46,545
This is a toilet, not a kennel.

651
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,105
If you're not peeing, get out!

652
00:49:48,705 --> 00:49:51,105
If you want to gang up,
meet me on the court.

653
00:49:51,585 --> 00:49:52,904
I'll play all of you.

654
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:56,864
Hey, let's go.

655
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:10,025
Are you okay, Nut?

656
00:50:12,665 --> 00:50:13,825
I'm fine.

657
00:50:14,705 --> 00:50:16,025
Thank you.

658
00:50:38,225 --> 00:50:39,225
Nut.

659
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,025
I'm sorry.

660
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:52,904
It's okay,

661
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:54,265
it's just the film.

662
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:55,464
I'll get it replaced.

663
00:50:57,504 --> 00:50:59,384
How did you become an extra?

664
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:02,345
Oh, I…

665
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:04,025
Jeez.

666
00:51:06,745 --> 00:51:08,265
I brought you a snack.

667
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:10,504
Your mom and I made it.

668
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:13,625
There were a lot of apples in the fridge,

669
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,105
so we made apple jelly for you.

670
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:21,305
I won't eat that.

671
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:24,864
Please try it. It's good.

672
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:27,424
How many times did I tell you

673
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:28,785
there's food on the set?

674
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:30,384
You don't need to bring anything.

675
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,464
But thanks

676
00:51:37,145 --> 00:51:38,265
for trying to help me.

677
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:41,145
But don't do it again.

678
00:51:43,305 --> 00:51:44,464
Why not?

679
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:50,545
People shouldn't get hurt for me.

680
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,545
I don't want you to get hurt either.

681
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:02,585
If you won't let me help,
then take good care of yourself.

682
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:06,105
I know.

683
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:08,305
I won't walk
onto a basketball court again.

684
00:52:08,384 --> 00:52:09,345
Don't worry.

685
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:13,665
Nut.

686
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:20,705
Nut.

687
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,585
What were you staring at
so intently just now?

688
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:30,944
Song likes to stare
at something like that too.

689
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:33,105
Facebook.

690
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:36,424
Facebook?

691
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:39,705
It's like a notebook for your memories,

692
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:41,305
for contacting people.

693
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:44,745
Memories?

694
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,065
Why do you need to record them?

695
00:52:47,145 --> 00:52:48,464
Why not just remember them?

696
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:50,464
Who can remember everything?

697
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:52,785
What if I get Alzheimer's

698
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:54,504
or lose my memory, like you?

699
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:59,265
Hey,

700
00:53:00,025 --> 00:53:01,265
you should have a Facebook.

701
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,105
If we try to find it,

702
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:04,504
maybe we'll know who you are.

703
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:10,345
I don't have one.

704
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:16,065
Well,

705
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:17,585
how can I?

706
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:18,984
I don't even know what it is.

707
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:22,785
Can you teach me how to use Facebook?

708
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:27,665
You said that

709
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:30,105
if I remember who I am,

710
00:53:31,305 --> 00:53:32,825
I have to leave.

711
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:37,025
I want to record my time with you,

712
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:39,225
so it can be my memory.

713
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,864
Cut.

714
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,625
That's a wrap!

715
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:08,145
Good job, everyone.

716
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,944
See you next week.

717
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:13,745
Let's go.

718
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:20,065
Mister,

719
00:54:20,145 --> 00:54:22,625
how was I today?

720
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:27,785
As annoying as ever.

721
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,705
Oh, come on. I'm being serious.

722
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:33,904
What's your score
for my first day of acting?

723
00:54:36,384 --> 00:54:37,265
Ten.

724
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:40,705
Out of a hundred.

725
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:44,145
Hey, that's not true.

726
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:47,665
I got through every scene in two
to three takes. Even Juea said I was good.

727
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:49,825
How can you give me just ten?

728
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,984
You've already complimented yourself.

729
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:53,225
You need me to do it too?

730
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:55,625
Well, I want you to praise me.

731
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,065
Doesn't your dad do that?

732
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:03,944
What do you need me for?

733
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:12,504
Song,

734
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,265
please go get changed.

735
00:55:15,825 --> 00:55:16,785
Yes.

736
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:32,345
Hey, Song,

737
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:35,065
come eat with us.

738
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:36,065
Oh,

739
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:37,785
no thanks, Juea.

740
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:39,904
I have to go submit a report.

741
00:55:39,984 --> 00:55:41,864
Okay then.

742
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:43,065
See you next week.

743
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:44,665
See you, Juea.

744
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:47,384
Hurry up.

745
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:02,384
Are you really mad at me?

746
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:10,944
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:13,504
I didn't know you were sensitive…

748
00:56:14,665 --> 00:56:15,904
about your dad.

749
00:56:20,145 --> 00:56:21,665
If you feel bad

750
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,585
about hurting my poor little heart,

751
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:27,785
I'll let you make up for it

752
00:56:28,705 --> 00:56:30,785
by driving me home.

753
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:33,025
What?

754
00:56:33,545 --> 00:56:34,665
Wait,

755
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:35,625
are you high?

756
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:38,225
Why do I have to drive you home?

757
00:56:38,705 --> 00:56:40,305
Just ride your bike home.

758
00:56:40,384 --> 00:56:42,185
How can I?

759
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,944
I left it at home.

760
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:47,305
I knew you would drive here,

761
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:50,305
so I didn't bring my bike.

762
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:55,545
Please take me home.

763
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:57,904
Please, please,

764
00:56:57,984 --> 00:56:59,424
please, please.

765
00:57:00,145 --> 00:57:01,785
I promise

766
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,424
I won't be mad at you anymore.

767
00:57:04,305 --> 00:57:05,904
Please, mister.

768
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:09,265
Get your head here.

769
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:11,105
Get your head here!

770
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:12,345
Take that!

771
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,384
Come on, take me home.

772
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:17,545
Go home by yourself.

773
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,504
You're being funny?

774
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:21,225
Come on,

775
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:23,585
I'm all sweaty now.

776
00:57:44,305 --> 00:57:45,424
Isn't your dad home?

777
00:57:48,864 --> 00:57:50,265
He works in Chiang Mai.

778
00:57:51,105 --> 00:57:52,384
He rarely comes home.

779
00:57:54,185 --> 00:57:55,785
Why don't you go live with him?

780
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:58,345
I'm an adult.

781
00:57:58,424 --> 00:57:59,745
I can take care of myself.

782
00:57:59,825 --> 00:58:01,145
Besides,

783
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:03,105
I want to go to university here.

784
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:06,345
Where's your mom?

785
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,345
She…

786
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:11,305
died soon after Neung did.

787
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:15,984
Hey,

788
00:58:16,065 --> 00:58:18,424
if you're going to ask so many questions,

789
00:58:19,065 --> 00:58:20,145
why don't you come in?

790
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,145
I promise

791
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,464
to tell you my whole life story tonight.

792
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:27,424
Come on in,

793
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,785
huh?

794
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:31,944
No, I'm leaving.

795
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:36,705
Drive safely.

796
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:39,785
Don't just think about me

797
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:41,545
and hit someone's car.

798
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:44,464
Go inside now,

799
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:47,024
Song, you little brat.

800
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:48,745
Thanks for bringing me home.

801
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,185
Hey, Song, come eat with us.

802
00:59:30,745 --> 00:59:32,785
Oh, no thanks, Juea.

803
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:34,984
I have to go submit a report.

804
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:39,504
You're a delivery boy.

805
00:59:39,585 --> 00:59:41,625
If you can't find food, that's on you.

806
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:46,424
Oh, man.

807
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:03,504
Hello?

808
01:00:03,585 --> 01:00:05,145
Hello, sir.

809
01:00:05,225 --> 01:00:08,265
Would you like an egg
with your congee or not?

810
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,225
What?

811
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:11,984
I didn't order any congee.

812
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:14,944
Someone ordered it for you.

813
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:24,464
Really?

814
01:00:24,545 --> 01:00:27,145
Then no egg please.

815
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:29,024
Okay, thank you very much.

816
01:00:44,504 --> 01:00:49,545
SONG: YOU COULD HAVE JUST SAID
YOU WANTED TO SURPRISE ME.

817
01:00:50,464 --> 01:00:53,265
SONG: WHAT IF I HAD A HEART ATTACK?

818
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:57,384
SONG: YOU WOULD HAVE WASTED MONEY
AND ALSO BE SAD.

819
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:06,105
GENSIT: WOULD IT KILL YOU
TO SAY THANK YOU?

820
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:19,504
SONG: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, KISS, KISS.

821
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:37,944
Hi, Tofu.

822
01:01:51,384 --> 01:01:54,345
Today, Nut is wearing a dark blue shirt,

823
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:56,785
grey trousers,

824
01:01:57,424 --> 01:01:59,464
a black backpack,

825
01:02:00,545 --> 01:02:02,745
and a silver bracelet.

826
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:07,545
He's leaving the house at 9:06 a.m.

827
01:02:10,024 --> 01:02:12,944
He looks confused

828
01:02:13,024 --> 01:02:15,345
and so adorable
that I have to take a picture.

829
01:02:16,424 --> 01:02:17,384
What are you doing?

830
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:20,585
Recording my memories with you.

831
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,065
I have a Facebook now.

832
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:24,625
Well,

833
01:02:24,705 --> 01:02:26,464
you had locked your door last night,

834
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:29,384
so I called and asked Song to teach me.

835
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:32,265
You can't even type properly

836
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:34,065
and you still want one?

837
01:02:35,145 --> 01:02:36,745
What's so special about it

838
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:38,825
that you needed Song's help?

839
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:41,424
Do you really want to use it

840
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:43,065
or do you…

841
01:02:43,665 --> 01:02:45,225
Song said

842
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:47,185
I had to have a Facebook first

843
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:48,984
before I can add you as my boyfriend.

844
01:02:50,024 --> 01:02:51,065
Add what now?

845
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:52,825
Boyfriend.

846
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,065
Song said

847
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:56,545
I can't add you as a friend

848
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,545
since I don't want to be friends with you.

849
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:01,225
Boyfriend my ass.

850
01:03:02,065 --> 01:03:03,384
What did Song teach you?

851
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:05,545
Don't let me catch him.

852
01:03:10,464 --> 01:03:11,825
Wait, Nut.

853
01:03:32,944 --> 01:03:34,024
What is it now?

854
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:37,545
Please accept my boyfriend request?

855
01:03:38,504 --> 01:03:39,904
Boyfriend my ass.

856
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:44,544
Nut.

857
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:50,825
Nut,

858
01:03:51,464 --> 01:03:52,825
be honest with me.

859
01:03:54,145 --> 01:03:55,904
Have you not been in love for a while?

860
01:03:57,705 --> 01:03:59,305
You didn't have to choke.

861
01:04:00,345 --> 01:04:02,504
So? Tell me.

862
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:04,345
I was startled.

863
01:04:05,665 --> 01:04:07,225
Why did you ask me that?

864
01:04:07,305 --> 01:04:08,585
Because of this.

865
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:11,504
I read your script. It's terrible.

866
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:13,504
The cutesy, romantic scenes

867
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:15,024
aren't cute or romantic at all.

868
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:16,065
I almost fell asleep.

869
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:19,024
You said you wrote it from experience.

870
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,464
What's the matter?

871
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:22,384
Real life

872
01:04:22,464 --> 01:04:24,105
isn't sweet like candy, you know.

873
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:25,785
This is a BL series.

874
01:04:25,864 --> 01:04:29,504
You need cute and romantic scenes
to please the audience.

875
01:04:30,305 --> 01:04:31,504
I know,

876
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:33,504
but I'm not good at it.

877
01:04:34,065 --> 01:04:35,984
You keep saying that,

878
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:37,185
and I understand.

879
01:04:38,424 --> 01:04:42,105
You're used to writing realistic,
socially reflective scripts,

880
01:04:42,185 --> 01:04:44,464
but the network doesn't want that.

881
01:04:44,544 --> 01:04:46,105
They want something new.

882
01:04:47,305 --> 01:04:48,345
Nut,

883
01:04:48,904 --> 01:04:51,625
I think you're stuck in a rut.

884
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:55,145
I don't know what your problem is.

885
01:04:56,745 --> 01:04:59,825
But I feel like
there's a wall in front of you.

886
01:05:01,145 --> 01:05:04,665
I gave you a ladder, but why don't you
have the courage to climb it?

887
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:08,745
Go back

888
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:11,864
and think about
what your problem is and fix it.

889
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:17,185
I don't want to see a wall
in front of you your whole life.

890
01:05:45,305 --> 01:05:48,464
We've already started shooting. Hurry up.

891
01:05:49,024 --> 01:05:52,024
I don't want to give your ladder
to someone else.

892
01:05:52,105 --> 01:05:53,665
Go find some references.

893
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:38,625
BE WITH YOU

894
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,145
Nut.

895
01:06:54,384 --> 01:06:56,145
Why didn't you knock first?

896
01:06:57,984 --> 01:06:59,745
Won't you accept my boyfriend request?

897
01:07:02,504 --> 01:07:03,825
Get out.

898
01:07:03,904 --> 01:07:04,825
Go.

899
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:07,625
Such nonsense.

900
01:07:08,185 --> 01:07:09,024
Nut!

901
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:10,544
I'm working!

902
01:07:16,384 --> 01:07:18,065
I can't add you as a boyfriend

903
01:07:18,145 --> 01:07:19,665
or a friend.

904
01:07:21,185 --> 01:07:23,504
What must I do to see your profile?

905
01:07:24,785 --> 01:07:26,065
Just keep going at it,

906
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,984
and he'll soften up.

907
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:33,384
Believe me, Tofu, I have experience.

908
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:35,265
Really.

909
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:39,265
Oh, I have to go now.

910
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:52,065
Is it still edible?

911
01:08:15,185 --> 01:08:17,145
Look,

912
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:19,305
-I'm eating the congee.
-Hey,

913
01:08:19,384 --> 01:08:20,744
you're eating it just now?

914
01:08:22,424 --> 01:08:27,544
Well, you bought it for me,
so I wanted to treasure it.

915
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:30,584
Then let it spoil
because that's all you'll get from me.

916
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:33,185
Oh, you're so mean.

917
01:08:33,265 --> 01:08:34,825
How can I throw it away?

918
01:08:35,424 --> 01:08:38,464
If I did, it would be like
throwing away your heart.

919
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:40,384
That's enough. Bye.

920
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:42,225
Enjoy your food.

921
01:08:56,624 --> 01:08:58,065
Did you wolf it all down?

922
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:01,744
Come here.

923
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:04,825
We're friends now.

924
01:09:05,945 --> 01:09:08,424
From now on, you're part of my memory,

925
01:09:08,504 --> 01:09:09,664
Kuenchai.

926
01:09:13,825 --> 01:09:15,265
Let's make up.

927
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:19,584
Yeah.

928
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:29,305
If I go back to being a teddy bear,

929
01:09:29,784 --> 01:09:32,025
will I still have my memories as a human?

930
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,664
But people's memories
also fade every day, right?

931
01:09:39,744 --> 01:09:42,105
That's why they use things to record them,

932
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:54,065
like photos, notebooks,

933
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:55,065
Facebook,

934
01:09:55,784 --> 01:09:57,425
or even text messages.

935
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:16,025
Nut's Facebook

936
01:10:16,664 --> 01:10:19,265
is probably full of his memories.

937
01:10:20,145 --> 01:10:21,505
And maybe it also includes

938
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:24,385
what I'm looking for.

939
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:35,865
Nut's old school,

940
01:10:37,744 --> 01:10:39,305
his Facebook,

941
01:10:42,145 --> 01:10:43,825
and people from his past.

942
01:10:52,265 --> 01:10:53,865
LANNA HOSPITAL

943
01:10:53,945 --> 01:10:55,545
EMERGENCY

944
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:05,265
If you want it,

945
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:07,624
wait until I'm dead.

946
01:11:10,185 --> 01:11:11,624
Your land is next to mine.

947
01:11:11,704 --> 01:11:12,945
Just sell yours.

948
01:11:13,505 --> 01:11:15,465
The client wants a big plot.

949
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:17,465
If you won't sell yours, I can't either.

950
01:11:18,185 --> 01:11:21,065
Since you're not using it for anything,

951
01:11:21,145 --> 01:11:22,225
just sell it.

952
01:11:22,305 --> 01:11:24,704
Wasn't this your intention all along

953
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:26,784
when you bought the land next to Dad's?

954
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:29,704
I was just trying to make a profit.

955
01:11:31,865 --> 01:11:34,945
You want a big plot
to sell to a financier, don't you?

956
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:37,385
Whoever I sell to is my business.

957
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:40,145
Are you going to sell it or not?

958
01:11:40,225 --> 01:11:41,784
If they plan to build a factory

959
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,664
that will affect the environment there,

960
01:11:43,744 --> 01:11:44,624
I'm not selling it.

961
01:11:44,704 --> 01:11:45,704
I don't need money.

962
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:47,385
Oh,

963
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:49,185
you big environmentalist.

964
01:11:49,265 --> 01:11:51,945
You care about saving the world
and helping other people,

965
01:11:52,025 --> 01:11:54,744
but you won't help a relative like me?

966
01:11:57,385 --> 01:11:59,065
You still consider me a relative?

967
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:00,825
When Mom and Dad died,

968
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:02,825
I didn't even see your name
at the funeral.

969
01:12:04,865 --> 01:12:07,105
Don't call me family
only when you need something.

970
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:10,664
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

971
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:13,664
Your parents benefited
from the family business too!

972
01:12:13,744 --> 01:12:17,385
That plot of land and your house
should have gone to me,

973
01:12:17,465 --> 01:12:20,825
not a brat like you who has never
contributed to the family business.

974
01:12:24,985 --> 01:12:26,225
If you want it,

975
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:28,265
wait until I'm dead.

976
01:12:51,985 --> 01:12:52,825
Jan.

977
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:03,465
When did you arrive?

978
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:08,065
You said I didn't care about him.
Well, here I am.

979
01:13:09,145 --> 01:13:12,025
I don't believe that you would come here
just because I said so.

980
01:13:13,065 --> 01:13:14,345
Something is up, isn't it?

981
01:13:21,545 --> 01:13:25,985
I did arrive in Chiang Mai
one day before Tatarn was attacked.

982
01:13:26,065 --> 01:13:28,065
We met up at a cafe

983
01:13:28,145 --> 01:13:30,784
near my hotel to talk about land.

984
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,865
Land?

985
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:33,385
Yes,

986
01:13:33,465 --> 01:13:36,505
the piece of land in Ratchaburi
that he inherited.

987
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:40,585
A buyer is interested and contacted me
because I'm his last living relative.

988
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:43,425
I was arranging the business deal.

989
01:13:44,145 --> 01:13:45,865
But after that,

990
01:13:45,945 --> 01:13:47,744
I didn't see him again,

991
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,505
because I returned to Bangkok
the following day.

992
01:13:54,945 --> 01:13:56,305
But you took a late flight.

993
01:13:57,664 --> 01:13:59,505
Where did you go and what did you do?

994
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:02,545
Oh,

995
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:05,744
do you need to know all that?

996
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:06,985
Yes,

997
01:14:07,465 --> 01:14:10,824
I need to talk to everyone
who is involved with Tatarn.

998
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:12,985
Please cooperate.

999
01:14:15,105 --> 01:14:16,105
Yes.

1000
01:14:19,624 --> 01:14:22,704
Well, I didn't do much.

1001
01:14:22,784 --> 01:14:24,225
I stayed at the hotel.

1002
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:30,425
In the evening, I went out for dinner…

1003
01:14:32,945 --> 01:14:35,145
then I went to the airport.

1004
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:42,025
Even though Tatarn and I
had some problems,

1005
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,624
I never wanted to kill him.

1006
01:14:45,704 --> 01:14:47,025
I assure you,

1007
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:50,824
I had nothing to do with the attack.

1008
01:15:11,664 --> 01:15:13,465
SARAPEE POLICE STATION

1009
01:15:20,664 --> 01:15:22,744
She may have a financial motive,

1010
01:15:23,744 --> 01:15:26,065
but there's no evidence that she did it.

1011
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:29,425
When I asked Saen

1012
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:32,065
if Tatarn had any problems with anyone,

1013
01:15:33,345 --> 01:15:35,905
he didn't mention Sajjaree at all.

1014
01:15:35,985 --> 01:15:39,105
Is it possible that they're in
on it together?

1015
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:48,545
Why did the police question you?

1016
01:15:49,624 --> 01:15:51,265
Were you here when he was attacked?

1017
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:54,905
Why should I tell you?

1018
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:57,105
You never tell me where you're going.

1019
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:01,265
If you want to know so much,
I'll tell you.

1020
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:03,585
I came to talk to Tatarn that day
about land.

1021
01:16:05,305 --> 01:16:06,225
Is that all?

1022
01:16:08,145 --> 01:16:10,065
Do you think there's something more?

1023
01:16:11,465 --> 01:16:13,865
Do you think I hurt him?

1024
01:16:18,664 --> 01:16:19,585
Listen.

1025
01:16:19,664 --> 01:16:21,784
If you want to know more,
go ask the police.

1026
01:16:21,865 --> 01:16:23,945
I already told them everything.

1027
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:25,025
I'm leaving now.

1028
01:16:44,065 --> 01:16:45,305
Man,

1029
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:46,744
people are so complicated.

1030
01:16:47,225 --> 01:16:48,824
What's that, Tofu?

1031
01:16:49,385 --> 01:16:51,385
He's so eloquent now that he's human,

1032
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:54,185
so highbrow.

1033
01:16:55,065 --> 01:16:56,624
It's Nut.

1034
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,784
He's so good-looking.

1035
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,985
Seriously? How?

1036
01:17:01,065 --> 01:17:02,985
He looks mad all the time.

1037
01:17:03,065 --> 01:17:06,305
But okay, I get that he's like your god,

1038
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:08,824
so say whatever you want.

1039
01:17:09,385 --> 01:17:10,704
He's so cute

1040
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:12,465
and he's usually kind,

1041
01:17:13,065 --> 01:17:14,385
but he was really mean today.

1042
01:17:14,465 --> 01:17:17,905
What did he do to you?

1043
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:27,025
Nut.

1044
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:32,505
I brought you some milk.

1045
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:34,824
Nut.

1046
01:17:41,305 --> 01:17:42,945
FIRST LOVE

1047
01:17:52,065 --> 01:17:53,465
Nut, do you want some fruit?

1048
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:01,385
Yes,

1049
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:02,585
I'm revising it now.

1050
01:18:07,865 --> 01:18:10,105
LET'S EAT. YOUR MOM IS WAITING.
I'M HUNGRY TOO.

1051
01:18:14,225 --> 01:18:15,784
He does nothing but work.

1052
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:17,744
I don't know what to do.

1053
01:20:11,385 --> 01:20:12,225
Kuenchai.

1054
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,105
Kuenchai.

1055
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,305
Get down.

1056
01:20:20,385 --> 01:20:21,704
Get down.

1057
01:20:29,385 --> 01:20:30,545
Tofu!

1058
01:20:59,905 --> 01:21:01,385
Tofu,

1059
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:03,945
where did you get a key to my room?

1060
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:10,225
Well…

1061
01:21:10,945 --> 01:21:12,065
Who gave it to you?

1062
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:19,985
It's my Mom, isn't it?

1063
01:21:21,145 --> 01:21:22,265
Isn't it?

1064
01:21:24,425 --> 01:21:25,784
Why did you go in there?

1065
01:21:25,865 --> 01:21:27,025
What do you want?

1066
01:21:28,105 --> 01:21:29,865
-Nut.
-Why did you go inside my room?

1067
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:30,905
I'm sorry.

1068
01:21:31,465 --> 01:21:32,824
Mrs. Na was worried about you.

1069
01:21:40,065 --> 01:21:41,945
You're doing this again, Mom!

1070
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:45,185
When will you understand

1071
01:21:45,704 --> 01:21:48,105
that going into someone's room
without permission

1072
01:21:48,185 --> 01:21:50,025
is an invasion of privacy?

1073
01:21:52,545 --> 01:21:54,265
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1074
01:21:54,345 --> 01:21:55,624
You did!

1075
01:21:56,585 --> 01:21:58,664
Both then and now.

1076
01:21:58,744 --> 01:22:00,265
You meant to.

1077
01:22:02,145 --> 01:22:04,305
Stop using love as an excuse.

1078
01:22:05,065 --> 01:22:07,385
You just want to control everything

1079
01:22:08,225 --> 01:22:10,105
without respecting my rights.

1080
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:11,905
What happened?

1081
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:16,265
I…

1082
01:22:16,345 --> 01:22:17,704
Stop talking!

1083
01:22:18,305 --> 01:22:19,945
It won't make anything better.

1084
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:23,505
Nut, calm down.

1085
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:24,585
Are you hungry?

1086
01:22:25,345 --> 01:22:27,744
I made some of that burnt pork you like.

1087
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:31,065
I won't eat it!

1088
01:22:32,985 --> 01:22:33,945
Nut,

1089
01:22:34,025 --> 01:22:36,545
come with me right now.

1090
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:40,065
Come here this instant.

1091
01:22:48,025 --> 01:22:49,345
What's wrong with you?

1092
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:51,065
You're out of control!

1093
01:22:52,025 --> 01:22:53,624
Didn't you hear what my mom did?

1094
01:22:53,704 --> 01:22:54,824
What your mom did,

1095
01:22:55,425 --> 01:22:58,065
she did it
because she's worried about you.

1096
01:23:00,505 --> 01:23:01,664
Okay.

1097
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:03,505
Her method may have been wrong,

1098
01:23:03,585 --> 01:23:05,305
but you're guilty too.

1099
01:23:06,265 --> 01:23:08,385
It's because you're doing this.

1100
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:11,225
You lock yourself in your room
and just work.

1101
01:23:11,704 --> 01:23:13,385
You never pick up my calls,

1102
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:14,824
isn't that true?

1103
01:23:19,824 --> 01:23:20,905
Honestly,

1104
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:24,145
what's your problem?

1105
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:29,865
I'm stressed about work.

1106
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:33,065
I can't write romantic scenes for Juea.

1107
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:36,824
Why? I thought the story
was based on your life.

1108
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,385
Or did things between you and Neung

1109
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:42,624
not end well?

1110
01:23:44,105 --> 01:23:45,505
I never went out with him.

1111
01:23:46,505 --> 01:23:47,585
Then who did you date?

1112
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:54,985
Nut,

1113
01:23:55,065 --> 01:23:57,345
whatever makes you unhappy,

1114
01:23:57,425 --> 01:23:58,545
don't think about it.

1115
01:23:58,624 --> 01:24:00,105
Don't obsess over it.

1116
01:24:02,585 --> 01:24:04,065
Look ahead,

1117
01:24:04,704 --> 01:24:06,185
look around you,

1118
01:24:06,865 --> 01:24:08,704
and open up your heart.

1119
01:24:09,265 --> 01:24:11,545
It might make you happier.

1120
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:13,664
What are you saying?

1121
01:24:14,465 --> 01:24:15,744
You'll find me a boyfriend?

1122
01:24:17,704 --> 01:24:20,025
Well, the best way
to get over your old love

1123
01:24:20,545 --> 01:24:22,105
is to find a new one, right?

1124
01:24:23,704 --> 01:24:24,905
If you're happy,

1125
01:24:25,385 --> 01:24:27,945
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

1126
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:30,065
will come to you naturally.

1127
01:24:32,784 --> 01:24:34,105
That's easier said than done.

1128
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:36,624
I've been looking,

1129
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,185
but I haven't found anyone.

1130
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:39,465
You know that.

1131
01:24:41,465 --> 01:24:42,865
Shall I find someone for you?

1132
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:43,905
It's easy.

1133
01:24:43,985 --> 01:24:45,545
Two people you know,

1134
01:24:45,624 --> 01:24:47,025
they're crazy about you.

1135
01:24:48,824 --> 01:24:50,425
It's either Prib or Tofu.

1136
01:24:53,305 --> 01:24:55,105
I'm sorry, Prib.

1137
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,784
You cooked for Nut,

1138
01:24:57,865 --> 01:24:59,624
but I made him angry,

1139
01:25:00,385 --> 01:25:01,704
so…

1140
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:04,305
It's fine.

1141
01:25:05,345 --> 01:25:06,624
It's not your fault.

1142
01:25:07,305 --> 01:25:08,545
Not Nut's fault either.

1143
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:10,865
It was an accident.

1144
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:12,345
I understand.

1145
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:14,585
I can cook again another time.

1146
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:31,145
It's okay. I'll clean it up.

1147
01:25:37,945 --> 01:25:39,265
By the way,

1148
01:25:39,345 --> 01:25:41,664
how come Nut's work
has to be revised so much?

1149
01:25:42,505 --> 01:25:43,545
Do you know?

1150
01:25:44,824 --> 01:25:48,025
Juea said his romantic scenes
still aren't good enough.

1151
01:25:48,905 --> 01:25:51,225
I guess his past is pretty bitter.

1152
01:25:53,185 --> 01:25:54,465
What does his past

1153
01:25:55,065 --> 01:25:56,704
have to do with his work?

1154
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,664
He's writing about his life.

1155
01:25:59,145 --> 01:26:00,985
Even if it's a little sad,

1156
01:26:01,784 --> 01:26:02,704
that's okay,

1157
01:26:02,784 --> 01:26:05,985
because I'll add sweetness to his life,

1158
01:26:07,065 --> 01:26:08,865
and then things will go well.

1159
01:26:17,784 --> 01:26:19,065
I'm sorry, Prib.

1160
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:21,985
You too, Tofu.

1161
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:24,624
Sorry for losing my temper.

1162
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,744
It's okay, Nut.

1163
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:29,905
I understand everything.

1164
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:32,345
I'll make you fried pork another time.

1165
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:34,824
You can look forward to that.

1166
01:26:40,385 --> 01:26:41,465
Something wrong, Gen?

1167
01:26:41,945 --> 01:26:43,225
I have an emergency.

1168
01:26:43,305 --> 01:26:45,465
Sorry, Prib. Go home by yourself.

1169
01:26:45,545 --> 01:26:46,624
What?

1170
01:26:54,545 --> 01:26:55,945
Nut.

1171
01:26:59,545 --> 01:27:00,824
All right,

1172
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:03,425
I'll call you a taxi.

1173
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:21,385
You're doing this again, Mom!

1174
01:27:23,265 --> 01:27:24,784
When will you understand

1175
01:27:25,345 --> 01:27:27,664
that going into someone's room
without permission

1176
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,545
is an invasion of privacy?

1177
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:44,624
What are you doing?

1178
01:27:47,505 --> 01:27:49,305
I just want to know what you wrote.

1179
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:54,065
What I write is my business.

1180
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:11,425
NEXT EPISODE

1181
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:12,864
Mister.

1182
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:14,704
Song!

1183
01:28:17,265 --> 01:28:19,185
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

1184
01:28:19,265 --> 01:28:21,225
But you chose to get involved.

1185
01:28:21,305 --> 01:28:24,345
I hope you can put an end
to this problem soon

1186
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:26,145
without affecting our work.

01:28:27,585 --> 01:28:29,145
Mrs. Na!

1188
01:28:33,465 --> 01:28:34,945
Are you happy, Nut?

1189
01:28:38,425 --> 01:28:39,385
Woo-hoo!

1190
01:28:39,864 --> 01:28:41,265
Your lips…

1191
01:28:43,704 --> 01:28:45,465
are sweet and soft like jelly.

1192
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:47,265
Why do you sound like…

1193
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:49,105
Who the hell are you?

1194
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:52,465
Why are you doing this?

1195
01:28:53,025 --> 01:28:54,744
What do you want from me?

1196
01:29:49,744 --> 01:29:54,744
