1
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,944
Do you want to be an actor?

2
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:11,065
If I play a character written by you,

3
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,065
I'll get to see you more, won't I?

4
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:15,985
Not to crush your dreams,

5
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,064
but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

6
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:20,745
Now that I have the opportunity,

7
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,785
I want to give it a shot.

8
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,344
Which one is your dad then?

9
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:30,985
Who does he think he is

10
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:33,025
to poke his nose into our business?

11
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:35,344
Before you lay blame on other people,

12
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,064
why don't you ask yourself

13
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:38,785
who it is

14
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,145
that's causing her the most distress.

15
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,184
Does that mean--

16
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,865
Na's husband is not Saen.

17
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:50,665
I only found out later
that he was dating Na.

18
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,865
You think

19
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:55,505
that I stole Saen from Na, don't you?

20
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:57,464
I…

21
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,545
Well…

22
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,064
That's okay.

23
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,865
A lot of people think like that.

24
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,705
But the truth is,

25
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,904
it was Na who left Saen.

26
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:11,145
She chose to marry Sibmeun.

27
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,985
She left him?

28
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,665
She seemed to love him very much.

29
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,665
I think I know why she did it.

30
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,305
She was dealing with many problems

31
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:25,025
with her house and her grandmother.

32
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,745
Saen was too busy working.

33
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:30,105
She ended up turning to Sibmeun.

34
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:32,545
He was a dependable military man.

35
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,464
He was someone she could rely on.

36
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:38,464
That's how they became close
and got married.

37
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,425
When I married Saen,

38
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:45,064
Nut was around two years old.

39
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:12,145
I don't know how to describe
the way I'm feeling.

40
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,985
It's like the world
has suddenly turned upside down.

41
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,425
Bottom becomes top.

42
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:21,665
Left becomes right.

43
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:28,505
Like a tree

44
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:31,225
whose branches grow into the ground,

45
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,225
pointing its roots to the sky.

46
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,065
Like rain

47
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:43,305
which pours reversely to the sky.

48
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:47,785
Like a cocoon that turns into a dragonfly.

49
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:52,745
The human world is different
and more much complicated than my world.

50
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:57,704
One person's truth might not be another's.

51
00:04:58,704 --> 00:05:02,824
When I was a teddy bear,
I never knew what pain was.

52
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:05,305
But I know it now.

53
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,065
It is this kind of pain

54
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:15,584
that makes Mrs. Na wish
to forget the past.

55
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,785
Come eat and take your pills, Grandma.

56
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:26,865
Grandma!

57
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,345
Grandma!

58
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,385
Grandma.

59
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,905
What's wrong, Na?

60
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,625
I don't know. Please help her, Sibmeun.

61
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:44,065
Thanks again for your help.

62
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,305
Without you, who knows
what would have happened?

63
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,185
I'm glad I could help.

64
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:54,225
Luckily, Saen called and told me
he was caught up at work.

65
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:57,144
He asked me to check
on your grandmother for him,

66
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,584
so I got there in time.

67
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,745
He said

68
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:03,704
that he wanted to come and see her
once he was finished working,

69
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:07,144
but he said something else came up.

70
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:08,665
He may not be able to come.

71
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:14,105
In that case,
let me buy you dinner to say thank you.

72
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:16,865
I insist.

73
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,704
This dish is really delicious.
Here are their recommended dishes.

74
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,625
This one is really good.

75
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:35,264
Right.

76
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:42,065
Here's what I owe you.
This is the first installment.

77
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:45,144
I'll pay you back

78
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,505
all the money you loaned me.

79
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:49,225
You knew?

80
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:51,945
Who told you?

81
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,785
It doesn't matter who told me.

82
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,785
Just know I won't take advantage of you.

83
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,785
But I wanted you to have this money.

84
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,105
I don't want it back.

85
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,024
But I must repay you.

86
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:10,865
Thank you…

87
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:14,425
for the trouble you went to.

88
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,824
You paid my mortgage

89
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:19,945
and my grandmother's medical bills.

90
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,024
You must be sick of helping me.

91
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,105
You won't have to anymore.

92
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:36,065
I'm returning this to you.

93
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:41,225
What do you mean?

94
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:48,704
It's Sibmeun, isn't it?

95
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,464
It has nothing to do with him.

96
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,545
I made this decision on my own.

97
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,584
The other night,
Grandma's condition got worse.

98
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,945
Sibmeun promised her
he would take care of me.

99
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,904
And I think it makes sense.

100
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,545
We're getting married,
so Grandma won't have to worry.

101
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,464
Here he is.

102
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,665
Please excuse me.

103
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,264
Bye.

104
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:01,825
Whether you are separated
in life or by death, the pain is the same.

105
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:08,905
It's because of this torture and pain

106
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:11,705
that humans choose to forget.

107
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:24,544
-Where are you?
-Mrs. Na.

108
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:30,345
When you face
the worst kind of grief like that,

109
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:33,505
the only way to survive

110
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:37,304
is to forget and create a new reality.

111
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:49,905
One where you won't get hurt
or be upset ever again.

112
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:09,184
Don't worry.

113
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:14,424
Thank you, both of you,

114
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,025
for convincing Mom to go see a doctor.

115
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:21,385
Na isn't a stranger to us.
We're happy to help.

116
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:29,304
I didn't know that she had stopped
taking her medication.

117
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,785
She always goes by herself

118
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,665
for her appointments.

119
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:37,265
But she lied to the doctor.

120
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,105
Don't blame yourself.

121
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,705
Now that you know about it,

122
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:49,665
you can take better care of your mom.

123
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:53,705
And her condition isn't as bad
as it was before.

124
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,025
I think that's a good sign.

125
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,465
But I still don't get it.

126
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:04,705
Why won't Mom accept the truth?

127
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:10,304
Some truths are not easy to accept,

128
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:15,385
especially the ones that left scars.

129
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,225
You want to bury them as deep as possible.

130
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,585
Those who are strong can handle the truth.

131
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:27,265
It doesn't affect them.

132
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,944
But for some people,

133
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,465
it's just too much to bear.

134
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,785
In order to accept the truth,

135
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:43,865
you must first accept
that you have been scarred.

136
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:52,064
Your mom may have some scars

137
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:54,865
that she can't bear to face right now.

138
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,625
You've got to give her time.

139
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,985
Give her some time, Nut.

140
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,064
Hang in there.

141
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,225
-Mom.
-Na.

142
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:10,304
Na.

143
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,465
Come to our house sometime, Nut.

144
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,785
Bring your mom with you
for a change of pace.

145
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:20,785
I'll cook you guys something nice.

146
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,785
I'll take your offer for that.

147
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,345
Don't bail on us,
or I'll have to eat everything.

148
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:31,184
I'll take my mom home, then.

149
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:33,865
Thank you.

150
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,625
Na.

151
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,064
Excuse me.

152
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:55,625
Mr. Saen?

153
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,304
-You are…
-I'm Sitha.

154
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:13,785
Have some coffee.

155
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,385
Thank you.

156
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:20,985
Long time no see.

157
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:24,385
It must be eight or nine years
since Sibmeun passed away.

158
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:28,785
I don't come around this way very often.
Just once in a while.

159
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:30,944
I had some business today.

160
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,025
I just saw Nut and Na.

161
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,265
Is Na sick?

162
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:39,105
Well, it's her old condition.

163
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,345
It has come back?

164
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,704
I've heard she got better.

165
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,985
She is better, but she's still sick.

166
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,824
Nut just found out
that she stopped taking her pills,

167
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,465
so her condition got worse.

168
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:01,225
But she's seeing a doctor now.
That should help.

169
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:04,265
Nut found someone to look after her.

170
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:09,745
If you're worried about her,
go visit her sometime.

171
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,745
She would be happy to see you.

172
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,025
Are you hungry, Mom?

173
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:04,064
I'll order you something.

174
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,064
You can eat and take your pills.

175
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,584
Mom.

176
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,345
I have to get back to work.

177
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:45,424
Call me if you need anything.

178
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,865
Your mom

179
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,985
may have some scars

180
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,785
that she can't bear to face right now.

181
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,025
Give her some time, Nut.

182
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,105
Have you told Nut about this?

183
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:12,665
He wouldn't want to hear it.

184
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:15,985
You know when I talk about Saen,

185
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:19,184
Nut always gets angry.

186
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:25,145
I wonder if he's angry
because he doesn't believe me…

187
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:30,025
or that he doesn't like me.

188
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,584
Everything I do seems to be wrong.

189
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:42,064
Mom.

190
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,785
I'm sorry…

191
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,585
Although she isn't ready
to see the picture,

192
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,665
I still think you should keep it.

193
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:32,905
She might want to see it someday.

194
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:49,825
Before you worry about me,

195
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,425
worry about yourself first.

196
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,305
I know what happened

197
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,625
between your mom and Mr. Saen.

198
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,145
Jan told me everything.

199
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,385
Didn't I tell you

200
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:55,385
not to talk to her
as long as you're living here?

201
00:18:58,024 --> 00:18:59,225
I know that.

202
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,905
But she's telling the truth, isn't she?

203
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,065
Your mom has the wrong idea about Saen.

204
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,945
That's why you try to make her forget him.

205
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,185
But I can't do it.

206
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,024
Now, my mom is in love
with someone else's husband.

207
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,225
It's too bad.

208
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:27,105
You know about it,
but you can't do anything.

209
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,984
That's worse than not knowing.

210
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:35,425
You must have been shocked
when you found out.

211
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:40,585
I was so shocked
that I didn't know what to say.

212
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,504
I don't know what to do about it.

213
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,945
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:58,545 --> 00:19:59,784
What for?

215
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:05,705
I've always thought
that you were mean to your mom.

216
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:10,024
But she was mean to you too,

217
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,665
even if she didn't mean it.

218
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:20,385
I'm sorry too.

219
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,145
Why?

220
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:24,984
I hurt you,

221
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,705
though you did nothing wrong.

222
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,385
You just didn't know.

223
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:39,305
Everyone who comes near me gets hurt.

224
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,345
It's all right.

225
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:47,305
I wasn't hurt or angry with you.

226
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:50,385
I know how much pain you're in.

227
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:54,065
It must be a hundred times
worse than this wound.

228
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:59,425
How come you get me,
even with your amnesia?

229
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,744
Even my friends and family don't get me.

230
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,305
It's all right, Nut.

231
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:58,744
Even if the world doesn't get you,

232
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:03,145
I'll always try to understand you.

233
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,305
I will be here for you.

234
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:36,744
You don't have to be strong all the time.

235
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:40,625
Don't fake a smile

236
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:43,585
when you want to cry.

237
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:49,744
When you're sad,
don't think that no one is there for you.

238
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:52,945
Although that teddy bear is gone,

239
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:56,385
you still have me.

240
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:01,984
I will hold you in its place.

241
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,504
Horrible things happened
to Nut and his mom yesterday,

242
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:51,865
but at least something good came of it.

243
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,665
Hang on.

244
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:05,145
It's not what Jan and Nhong
always gossip about.

245
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:10,264
The good thing that happened

246
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,625
is I got to hug Nut last night,

247
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,024
and he hugged me back.

248
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,825
I hope it cheered him up a little.

249
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:26,705
That would make me so happy.

250
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:32,665
Why am I thinking about him?

251
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:34,784
I'm going crazy.

252
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,504
Come on, son.

253
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,225
Here's some hot shrimp porridge.

254
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:01,024
Wow.

255
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,185
It looks great, Dad.

256
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:05,705
Eat up, then. Isn't it your favorite?

257
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,065
It was Neung's favorite.

258
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:12,544
But…

259
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,385
But I like it too.

260
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:17,905
If Neung was still here,
there wouldn't be any left for me.

261
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:22,544
It has been ten years now.

262
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,665
Time flies.

263
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,744
Dad, let's go make merit for Neung.

264
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:34,585
Sure, choose where we'll do it.

265
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:36,825
I already have an idea.

266
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:38,345
What is it?

267
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,425
I want to donate some sports equipment

268
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,544
to a school that needs it.

269
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,825
Neung loved basketball.

270
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:48,665
How about we donate some basketballs?

271
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:50,625
Sure, son.

272
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:52,705
I know a guy
who owns a basketball factory.

273
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,665
He should give us a discount.

274
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:57,024
That's great, Dad.
We can get a good price.

275
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:00,585
All right. Eat your food
before it gets cold.

276
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:08,784
No. You eat up.

277
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,585
Won't you season it?

278
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:15,065
No need, Dad. Your cooking is the best.

279
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:18,264
Wow.

280
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,945
It's delicious, Dad.

281
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:19,744
Whoa.

282
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:23,744
You just appeared like a ghost.

283
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,705
No ghost is this handsome.

284
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:33,865
Hey.

285
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:35,984
What do you want?

286
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,105
I came to see if you were up.
Did you sleep well?

287
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,065
I did.

288
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:49,625
What about you?

289
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,425
Does your wound still hurt?

290
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:55,625
Seeing you happy takes my pain away.

291
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,585
If you need someone to hold you again,

292
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:02,225
just let me know.

293
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:04,145
I will happily volunteer.

294
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,625
Mom.

295
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,425
I woke up late and got flustered.

296
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,185
I guess we should give him a bath.

297
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,784
What a drag.

298
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:48,544
I'll help.

299
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:02,905
I'm ready, Nut.

300
00:29:05,905 --> 00:29:07,945
What are you doing with a toothbrush?

301
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:09,304
Well…

302
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,705
You told me to brush my teeth
after a bath.

303
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:14,945
I'm giving Kuenchai a bath, not you.

304
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:20,744
Put that away and get me the hose.

305
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,784
I'll get back at you later, Kuenchai.

306
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:35,984
What did you say?

307
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:37,865
Nothing.

308
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:40,504
Turn the water on.

309
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:42,544
Okay.

310
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:47,705
Stop it, Tofu!

311
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,784
Hose Kuenchai down, not me.

312
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,345
Okay.

313
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:58,984
Tofu! Stop it!

314
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,744
That's it.

315
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,465
I'll do it myself. You hold Kuenchai.

316
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,544
Go on.

317
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,345
Hold him down.

318
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:22,905
Nut, Tofu.

319
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:24,945
What are you guys doing?

320
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,264
It was nothing.

321
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:49,984
We were giving the dog a bath
and we slipped.

322
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:51,544
That's all.

323
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:54,425
Really?

324
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:57,544
Yes, Nut slipped.

325
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,225
I was going to help him up,

326
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:01,185
but then he got up.

327
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:03,425
And then…

328
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:04,665
And then?

329
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:06,905
And then what?

330
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,945
And then you walked in.

331
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,865
It's always like this.

332
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:16,385
Kuenchai won't stay still,
and he's very strong.

333
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:19,784
Nut and I always fall on our faces
when we give him a bath.

334
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,865
You must have been shocked.

335
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:24,905
Stay and have dinner with us.

336
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:26,504
It's my treat.

337
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:28,185
Okay, Mrs. Na.

338
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:34,705
Hey.

339
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:36,625
What are you doing here?

340
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:39,345
Don't tell me you don't have food at home.

341
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:42,105
Come on. Dinner is just a bonus.

342
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:45,905
I need you to check my work.

343
00:34:00,824 --> 00:34:03,304
Pribpree.

344
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,945
Why can't we speak inside?

345
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:08,064
I need to clear things up with you.

346
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:11,784
I want to know
whether you like Nut or not.

347
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,264
What?

348
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:15,025
Why are you surprised?

349
00:34:15,105 --> 00:34:17,665
Nut is so irresistibly charming.

350
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,145
No man or woman can resist his charm.

351
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,185
Plus, you've lost your memory.

352
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:26,944
I don't know if you were into men
or women before this.

353
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,585
I don't trust you.

354
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:32,145
So, do you want Nut to be your boyfriend?

355
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:35,264
Boyfriend?

356
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:39,304
What do you mean?

357
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:41,105
I only want to be a bear.

358
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:43,824
A bear?

359
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:47,545
I guess your memory is still hazy.

360
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,784
Let's put it like this.

361
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:50,824
Seeing someone romantically…

362
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:53,784
it's that feeling you get
when you really like someone.

363
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,424
When you're near them

364
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:58,225
and lock eyes with them,

365
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,305
your heart starts beating fast.

366
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:11,305
But my heart is beating right now.
Does this mean I like you?

367
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:14,545
Come on. Everyone has a heartbeat.

368
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,545
Or else you would be dead.

369
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,585
It's another kind of heartbeat.

370
00:35:18,665 --> 00:35:22,265
It's like your heart will beat
through your chest.

371
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:25,785
You feel like you're floating on air,

372
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:28,985
and you're the only people in the world.

373
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,904
When I locked eyes with Nut earlier,

374
00:35:38,145 --> 00:35:40,585
-my heart was beating really fast.
-What?

375
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,785
But I think it was from chasing Kuenchai.

376
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:47,985
I saw a documentary.

377
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:51,225
When you're tired,
your heart beats a little faster.

378
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:54,185
I don't think I like Nut like that.

379
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:56,785
Really?

380
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:58,185
Really.

381
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:07,864
If he's not your type,

382
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,904
can you do me a favor?

383
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,384
What favor?

384
00:36:13,864 --> 00:36:17,105
Can you get Nut to like me?

385
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,145
Make him want to be my boyfriend.

386
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:24,625
Of course.

387
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:25,745
Really?

388
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,025
You're the sweetest.

389
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,785
Thank you so much.

390
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,065
So tell me,

391
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,225
what's a boyfriend?

392
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,545
Do I have to explain it all over again?

393
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,105
Yes.

394
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:48,904
Whatever you know about Nut, spit it out.

395
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,384
I'm ready to hear it.

396
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,985
Then let's start.

397
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,345
Nut likes to read.

398
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,145
He likes to read everything.

399
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:05,384
He likes poems, novels,
history, and travel guides.

400
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,225
He also likes picture books.

401
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:09,265
I remember there's one book
he really likes.

402
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,705
He once told me

403
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:14,185
that besides reading books,

404
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,384
you can also read people who read books.

405
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,985
That's cool. It sounds like something
a writer would say.

406
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:22,625
What else does he like, other than books?

407
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:25,065
Well…

408
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:28,665
He likes to watch TV series.

409
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:31,225
He enjoys watching everything.

410
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:33,944
He can stay up all night
watching something he likes.

411
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,785
Sometimes he even forgets about his mom.

412
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,985
I see.

413
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:43,065
That's why he never replies
to my late-night texts.

414
00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:46,025
And things he doesn't like?

415
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:49,025
He doesn't like vegetables.

416
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:53,384
He doesn't like anyone
going into his room.

417
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,025
He doesn't like the lady next door.

418
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:01,464
And…

419
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:04,904
he doesn't like having me around.

420
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:07,545
Come on. You're overthinking it.

421
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:11,625
Who wouldn't want
a cute little guy like you around?

422
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:14,904
Am I right? Don't be so dramatic.

423
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:16,225
Let's continue.

424
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,185
Okay.

425
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:21,384
Do you know any of his secrets?

426
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:24,225
Something nobody else knows.

427
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:28,785
Things he does in the bedroom
or what he keeps under his bed.

428
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,225
There's nothing under his bed.

429
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,305
I mean…

430
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,864
I mean that kind of stuff.

431
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,625
You know?

432
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:47,065
I see. Nut likes to sleep shirtless.

433
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:49,625
Shirtless?

434
00:38:51,985 --> 00:38:54,305
When he's drunk, he sleeps
with no pants on.

435
00:38:54,904 --> 00:38:56,305
No pants?

436
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:00,424
He gets hot easily.

437
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:37,625
He always comes out of the shower naked.

438
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:40,625
But when I do it, he gives me an earful.

439
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,345
Pribpree.

440
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:51,105
Pribpree.

441
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:58,065
Do you both take your pants off?

442
00:39:58,825 --> 00:39:59,985
That's right.

443
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:03,585
Wait a minute.
I thought you didn't remember anything.

444
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:07,225
You know so much about him.
It's like you've known him for years.

445
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:09,625
And that shower thing,

446
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,464
how did you see that?

447
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:13,625
-Well--
-Spit it out.

448
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,705
I…

449
00:40:17,464 --> 00:40:21,225
I heard about it from his mom and Gen.

450
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,505
I haven't been here long.

451
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:26,985
I don't know him as well as you do.

452
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,785
I don't know what he likes

453
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:33,105
or how he is when he's at work.

454
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,545
These things take time.

455
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,225
I've worked with him for three months.

456
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:45,305
But it feels like three years.

457
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:46,985
Is that so?

458
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,185
So what is Nut like at work?

459
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:54,105
He's very focused on his work.

460
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,305
When he's working,

461
00:40:56,785 --> 00:40:59,864
he's all cool and serious.

462
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:03,025
He looks ten times cooler than usual.

463
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,345
But when there's urgent work,

464
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:09,825
he likes to go off and work by himself.

465
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:12,705
When he has writer's block,

466
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,825
he likes to make himself strong coffee.

467
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:20,345
No milk, no sugar.

468
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:24,745
He made coffee for me once.

469
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:27,745
That's right. He likes coffee.

470
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:29,785
I should make him coffee.

471
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,585
Where's the coffee maker, Tofu?

472
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:45,185
Here's some strong, hot coffee

473
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:49,825
with a little sweetness
from the maker for you.

474
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,265
Nut.

475
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:07,305
That's Nut's shirt.

476
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:12,464
Kuenchai. No.

477
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,944
Don't you think you went too far?

478
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:20,985
Pribpree bought me that shirt.
I can do whatever I want with it.

479
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:24,665
She bought you that shirt
because she adores you.

480
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,505
But I'm not into her.

481
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:30,944
It's my day off and she's at my house.

482
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:35,625
I sneaked out here to work.
Can you be quiet?

483
00:42:35,705 --> 00:42:37,065
Jeez, Nut.

484
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:40,665
Whose house are you at? Mind your manners.

485
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:41,825
It's my house.

486
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:44,665
Eat up. Let me know if you want more.

487
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,665
-Thank you.
-Gosh, Mom.

488
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:50,305
I'm your son and you never do this for me.

489
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:53,625
Is he actually your son,
and I'm just adopted?

490
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,505
Have you worked it out just now?

491
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:56,705
What?

492
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:00,105
Gosh. Mr. Sitha.

493
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:03,145
Don't come crying
when I'm not around anymore.

494
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:05,225
-Gosh.
-How fierce.

495
00:43:05,305 --> 00:43:07,185
I think I would be glad.

496
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:08,785
-Dad.
-Hey.

497
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:11,864
You should start looking
for your real parents.

498
00:43:12,944 --> 00:43:15,345
Have you found your parents yet?

499
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:18,065
Stop it, Dad. You too, Mom.

500
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:19,225
-You're adopted.
-Stop.

501
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,145
I opened the door one day
and found you in a box.

502
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,305
Come on, Mom.

503
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:43,545
Nut and I have chosen our actor.

504
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,464
I want to do the fitting today.

505
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:49,145
Here, Pribpree. Pitch this to the clients.

506
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:50,585
This actor is the best.

507
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:53,424
Ask for a lot of money.
This actor is extraordinary.

508
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,665
Tell them to pay up front as well.

509
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:58,864
-All right.
-Right on.

510
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:09,745
Juea.

511
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:11,864
Are you really going
with this little punk?

512
00:44:13,225 --> 00:44:14,225
What's wrong?

513
00:44:16,105 --> 00:44:17,105
Juea.

514
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,424
You can pick anyone you want.

515
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:23,305
You can pick this one, this one,

516
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:24,705
or this one.

517
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:27,384
But you can't pick this guy.

518
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:31,065
-Why not?
-Yes, why not?

519
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,464
He's male, aged 17 to 18.

520
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,105
He's friendly, he plays basketball,
he plays instruments,

521
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:37,464
and he can ride a motorbike.

522
00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:39,705
-He's perfect.
-That's true.

523
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,265
What's the problem?

524
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:44,705
-Shut up.
-What's wrong with him?

525
00:44:46,265 --> 00:44:48,265
Listen. He's just a kid.

526
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,025
And he has no experience.

527
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,745
Can we really trust him?

528
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:55,464
Haven't you heard people say
that you should never work with kids?

529
00:44:55,545 --> 00:44:56,785
If you don't trust me…

530
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:02,225
you could try going out with me.

531
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:07,225
Hey!

532
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:10,225
What is he doing here?

533
00:45:10,305 --> 00:45:11,665
-Surprise!
-Juea.

534
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:16,705
I'm just kidding. You're way too serious.

535
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:20,705
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi.

536
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,464
Hello.

537
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:25,864
-Hello, Juea.
-Long time no see.

538
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:27,745
This is my guy.

539
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,904
Prepare the set. Get the costumes.
Get the cameras ready.

540
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,665
I want everything ready. Go.

541
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:34,904
Let's go.

542
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:36,345
-Juea, no.
-Knock it off.

543
00:45:36,424 --> 00:45:38,705
-No, Juea.
-Stop it.

544
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:40,265
-Juea, please.
-Calm down, Gen.

545
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:42,105
Gen, calm down.

546
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:44,705
You should keep work
and your private life separate.

547
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,424
Keep that in mind.

548
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:48,065
Can you even do that, Pribpree?

549
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,384
Sure, I can.

550
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:56,864
Honey, can you hand me the shovel?

551
00:46:00,904 --> 00:46:02,225
Thank you.

552
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:12,505
Okay.

553
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:14,984
Isn't it pretty?

554
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:19,505
It's like the one
in my grandmother's house.

555
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:24,705
Honey.

556
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:27,745
Where should I put this?

557
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,145
Honey!

558
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:48,065
Honey!

559
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:50,185
Mrs. Na, what's wrong?

560
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,745
Little Prince.

561
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:53,424
I can't find Saen.

562
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:55,944
Did you see him?

563
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:57,464
Did he say where he went?

564
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:00,785
Do you know where he is?

565
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:02,464
If Mom takes her medication,

566
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:05,065
the doctor said
she will gradually stop hallucinating.

567
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:08,745
She might be frightened sometimes.

568
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,625
Please look after her for me.

569
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,305
If she mentions my dad,

570
00:47:18,025 --> 00:47:19,665
just listen to her

571
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,665
and then change the subject.

572
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:24,705
Take her mind off him.

573
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:28,105
I haven't seen him.

574
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:36,225
It's almost noon. No wonder I'm so hungry.

575
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:39,065
Can you make me something delicious?

576
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:41,625
Is that the time?

577
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:45,265
-I'll see what we have in the fridge.
-Okay.

578
00:48:06,265 --> 00:48:08,305
Next one.

579
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:09,384
Good job.

580
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:11,505
Hey…

581
00:48:11,984 --> 00:48:14,265
Song, are you good at basketball?

582
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:17,345
-I'm pretty good.
-Okay.

583
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,345
Give the script a read.
We'll continue next week.

584
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:23,265
-Okay.
-Listen.

585
00:48:23,345 --> 00:48:25,745
Study the script.
Immerse yourself in the character.

586
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:28,864
Also, you need to work on your skills.

587
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:31,065
You've got to look cool
while you're dribbling.

588
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:32,345
It will be awesome.

589
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:34,625
-Okay.
-Show me what you can do.

590
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:36,105
Thank you, guys.

591
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:39,545
I'll go get changed and take off, then.

592
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,585
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for today.

593
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:44,145
Goodbye.

594
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,625
I'll borrow your partner to train.

595
00:48:54,305 --> 00:48:55,345
What partner?

596
00:48:56,944 --> 00:48:58,225
Did he mean my wife?

597
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:05,345
Do you miss Neung?

598
00:49:05,864 --> 00:49:07,505
I think of him all the time.

599
00:49:08,105 --> 00:49:09,625
He passed away so suddenly.

600
00:49:10,545 --> 00:49:12,145
Who would have known

601
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:14,904
that I would never get to hug him again?

602
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:26,625
Why did you love him so much?

603
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:30,864
Is it because he was always there for you
to help you with things?

604
00:49:33,265 --> 00:49:36,065
Love is not about just being around

605
00:49:36,145 --> 00:49:38,665
or doing things for your partner.

606
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,984
When you love someone,

607
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:47,864
you do things for them
because you care about them.

608
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:51,705
Saen has always cared for me.

609
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:04,065
You're just like him, Little Prince.

610
00:50:05,825 --> 00:50:08,345
You really care for me.

611
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:11,305
Thank you.

612
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:15,025
Someone else cares about you.

613
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:17,984
He may not always be around,

614
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:20,225
but he always cares about you.

615
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,424
Who's that?

616
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,504
Nut.

617
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,145
He might not show it,

618
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,345
but he loves you very much.

619
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,345
He always looks after you when you sleep.

620
00:50:57,065 --> 00:51:00,665
When he hears you scream,
he's the first one to run and see you.

621
00:51:02,585 --> 00:51:04,265
When you cry,

622
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:06,785
he secretly cries with you.

623
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:10,745
When you smile,

624
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:12,984
I think it makes him smile too.

625
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:16,384
That's not right.

626
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:20,145
You only need one.

627
00:51:33,984 --> 00:51:35,185
Mrs. Na.

628
00:51:36,185 --> 00:51:38,984
It's good to think about someone

629
00:51:39,745 --> 00:51:41,065
who's far away.

630
00:51:42,585 --> 00:51:44,665
But you should also think of those

631
00:51:45,384 --> 00:51:47,384
who are close by.

632
00:51:49,585 --> 00:51:50,665
If someone is far away,

633
00:51:51,145 --> 00:51:53,225
all you can do is think about them.

634
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,424
It's those who are close by

635
00:51:56,504 --> 00:51:58,384
that you can do things for.

636
00:52:11,305 --> 00:52:12,825
It's time to take your medicine.

637
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:24,265
Who's at the door?

638
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:25,825
I'll go check.

639
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:50,665
Song.

640
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:52,545
Who is it, Tofu?

641
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:56,185
-Hello, Mrs. Na.
-Hello.

642
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:57,464
This is Song.

643
00:52:57,545 --> 00:53:00,065
He's Neung's brother.
Neung was at school with Nut.

644
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:02,705
Are you here to see Nut?

645
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:05,585
No, I came to see Tofu.

646
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:09,864
Are you busy? I need your help.

647
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:25,705
You said you've never played before.

648
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:29,025
I don't remember playing before.

649
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:30,545
My hands moved on their own.

650
00:53:31,345 --> 00:53:32,745
You're quite good.

651
00:53:35,785 --> 00:53:37,025
Let me ask you something.

652
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:38,545
Sure.

653
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:41,785
Did Neung ever buy
a teddy bear for anyone?

654
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:47,864
Neung's girlfriend
didn't like teddy bears.

655
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:49,585
She liked flowers.

656
00:53:50,745 --> 00:53:52,065
Flowers?

657
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:55,705
Nut doesn't like flowers.

658
00:53:57,065 --> 00:53:57,904
Nut?

659
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:01,265
Do you mean Donut?

660
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,105
No. Neung's girlfriend was Nhing.

661
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:07,065
She's Donut's best friend.

662
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,464
Nhing was really pretty.

663
00:54:10,424 --> 00:54:12,145
-Nhing?
-Yes.

664
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,785
I can't really remember
what she looked like.

665
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:20,105
I only remember that she was gorgeous.

666
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:22,984
I was in second grade back then.

667
00:54:24,025 --> 00:54:25,625
If you want to know more,

668
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:30,464
you'll have to ask my dad.

669
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:37,504
Let's play some more.

670
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:47,025
This is Tofu, a friend of mine.

671
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:53,345
You look just like him.

672
00:56:58,825 --> 00:56:59,825
Hello.

673
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:07,024
Dad.

674
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:10,105
Come on. Let's play.

675
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:13,504
-Here.
-Okay.

676
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:22,265
Come on.

677
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:29,305
Bring it on.

678
00:57:57,145 --> 00:57:58,384
Are you tired, Dad?

679
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,904
I'm a police officer.

680
00:58:00,984 --> 00:58:02,625
-This is nothing.
-No.

681
00:58:03,185 --> 00:58:05,024
I mean are you tired from smiling?

682
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:08,625
You son of a gun. Are you teasing me?

683
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:12,825
It has been a while
since I heard you laugh this loudly.

684
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:15,585
Gosh. Are you mocking me?

685
00:58:15,665 --> 00:58:19,745
I'll teach you a lesson.

686
00:58:33,904 --> 00:58:35,585
-Mom.
-Yes?

687
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:38,024
-Where's Tofu?
-He went to his friend's house.

688
00:58:39,545 --> 00:58:41,225
-His friend?
-Yes.

689
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:42,345
What friend?

690
00:58:42,825 --> 00:58:44,825
His name is Song.

691
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:47,305
He asked Tofu to play basketball with him.

692
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:50,345
Tofu said he would text you.

693
00:58:57,705 --> 00:59:00,065
Don't bother if it's too much trouble.

694
00:59:01,024 --> 00:59:01,864
What was that?

695
00:59:03,345 --> 00:59:04,345
It's nothing.

696
00:59:05,464 --> 00:59:07,825
Take a shower and then come eat.

697
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:09,625
Okay.

698
00:59:23,785 --> 00:59:25,185
The bulb is gone again.

699
00:59:25,745 --> 00:59:27,305
Come on.

700
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:29,105
Go on, shoot!

701
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:30,024
Hey!

702
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:31,065
-Yes!
-Oh, wow!

703
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:32,785
Wow!

704
00:59:40,265 --> 00:59:41,705
You're good.

705
00:59:41,785 --> 00:59:44,265
You don't look sick
like Song told me you were.

706
00:59:45,545 --> 00:59:47,305
I just do what Song taught me.

707
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:53,705
Tofu, don't you want
to ask my dad something? Go on.

708
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:56,105
What is it?

709
00:59:56,585 --> 01:00:00,665
Tofu wants to know
about Neung's girlfriend.

710
01:00:05,424 --> 01:00:09,145
You see, Tofu's living with Nut.

711
01:00:09,825 --> 01:00:13,024
He's the screenwriter
for the series I'm going to be in.

712
01:00:13,105 --> 01:00:15,825
He was also Neung's junior at school.

713
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:19,345
I know Tofu through Nut.

714
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:23,265
Tofu probably wants to know
about Neung's girlfriend,

715
01:00:23,345 --> 01:00:24,904
so he knows how to act

716
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:28,345
in case they meet each other.

717
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,065
Is that right, Tofu?

718
01:00:32,225 --> 01:00:33,504
That's right.

719
01:00:36,024 --> 01:00:38,424
I met Neung's girlfriend
a couple of times.

720
01:00:38,944 --> 01:00:40,225
She was quite sweet.

721
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:44,185
She was chatty,
and she was a good influence on him.

722
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,225
They got into the same college.

723
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:50,585
I was hoping they could help each other
study in college.

724
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:52,384
It's too bad

725
01:00:53,504 --> 01:00:55,185
that Neung had an accident.

726
01:00:59,065 --> 01:01:00,785
Other than his girlfriend,

727
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:04,345
did Neung ever bring anyone else here?

728
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:06,984
Just his friends.

729
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,464
They're all grown up now.

730
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:14,745
But he never brought
any of his juniors home.

731
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:16,745
Not even Nut?

732
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:20,185
He's the guy I just told you about.

733
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:21,825
I see.

734
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:24,424
I've never heard of Nut before.

735
01:01:25,504 --> 01:01:28,185
And Neung never mentioned him.

736
01:01:30,024 --> 01:01:31,225
How is that possible?

737
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:35,464
Neung was the most important person
in Nut's life.

738
01:01:37,785 --> 01:01:40,265
But to him, Nut didn't exist at all.

739
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:44,464
Could it be

740
01:01:45,225 --> 01:01:48,105
that Neung wasn't the one
who brought me to life?

741
01:01:58,265 --> 01:01:59,265
Tofu.

742
01:02:00,225 --> 01:02:01,225
Tofu.

743
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:03,545
We're here.

744
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:07,305
Right.

745
01:02:12,305 --> 01:02:13,305
Thank you.

746
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:18,024
Please tell your dad that I'm sorry

747
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,665
if I asked anything inappropriate.

748
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:22,904
He was actually glad to see you.

749
01:02:23,585 --> 01:02:25,265
You should come by again.

750
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:29,065
My dad would be thrilled
to see your face more often.

751
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:37,345
Why is the front gate open like that?

752
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,145
Isn't Mrs. Na home alone?

753
01:02:40,225 --> 01:02:42,105
It's very dangerous.

754
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:44,185
You don't know who might pass by.

755
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:33,745
No.

756
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:35,024
Be careful!

757
01:04:15,145 --> 01:04:16,265
Saen.

758
01:04:18,864 --> 01:04:19,864
Na.

759
01:04:29,585 --> 01:04:31,305
It's really you, Saen.

760
01:04:50,145 --> 01:04:51,185
It's me.

761
01:05:08,024 --> 01:05:09,185
I have to go.

762
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,024
Where are you going?

763
01:05:15,265 --> 01:05:16,265
Hey, kid.

764
01:05:17,984 --> 01:05:19,065
Take care of her.

765
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:20,825
I will.

766
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:23,504
Wait.

767
01:05:28,864 --> 01:05:31,185
-Where are you going, Saen?
-Mrs. Na.

768
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:37,625
Please go after him.

769
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:40,265
Where is he going this late at night?

770
01:05:43,984 --> 01:05:45,625
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

771
01:05:46,585 --> 01:05:48,345
You should go inside.

772
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:50,305
Nut will be angry if he sees you outside.

773
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:06,785
Weren't you going to come see your wife?

774
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:22,065
Come sit down.

775
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,345
Are you hurt?

776
01:06:32,464 --> 01:06:33,504
I'm fine.

777
01:06:34,464 --> 01:06:36,305
Can you go after Saen?

778
01:06:37,424 --> 01:06:38,585
Please.

779
01:06:41,145 --> 01:06:43,225
Please go after him.

780
01:06:43,305 --> 01:06:44,384
All right.

781
01:06:44,464 --> 01:06:45,864
What's wrong, Mom?

782
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:49,864
I heard you scream.

783
01:06:52,265 --> 01:06:53,825
She fell off a ladder.

784
01:06:55,225 --> 01:06:56,745
Why would you climb a ladder?

785
01:06:56,825 --> 01:07:00,864
The lightbulb burned out.
I thought I could change it, but I fell.

786
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:02,944
Why didn't you ask me?

787
01:07:03,024 --> 01:07:05,065
You were in your room.

788
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:06,625
I didn't want to disturb you.

789
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:09,105
As for you, you jerk.

790
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:11,665
You were busy flirting outside.

791
01:07:13,105 --> 01:07:14,864
Don't tell him off.

792
01:07:16,024 --> 01:07:18,464
And don't call him that.

793
01:07:19,504 --> 01:07:21,105
What should I call him?

794
01:07:22,024 --> 01:07:23,904
Baby brother Tofu?

795
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:27,825
That's cute, actually.

796
01:07:34,424 --> 01:07:35,944
Sweet baby brother Tofu.

797
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:38,065
Has your ass…

798
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:40,384
Have you eaten yet?

799
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,225
No.

800
01:07:43,305 --> 01:07:44,904
Please cook something for him.

801
01:07:45,785 --> 01:07:48,225
You little shit… I mean…

802
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:49,705
my dear Tofu.

803
01:07:50,185 --> 01:07:51,544
Help me change the lightbulb.

804
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:52,864
Let's go.

805
01:08:02,424 --> 01:08:04,544
Please don't be mad at your mom.

806
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:07,065
It was my fault for leaving her alone.

807
01:08:07,705 --> 01:08:09,984
I thought I wouldn't be gone too long,

808
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:13,745
but I got carried away
chatting with Mr. Anik and Song.

809
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:16,345
Mr. Anik?

810
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:18,145
He's Song's dad.

811
01:08:19,065 --> 01:08:21,584
When he first saw me, he was shocked.

812
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,704
Just like Song was.

813
01:08:25,784 --> 01:08:26,945
Anyway,

814
01:08:27,025 --> 01:08:28,584
aren't you curious

815
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,865
why I look exactly like Neung?

816
01:08:42,504 --> 01:08:44,065
If I weren't,

817
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:46,225
I wouldn't have let you live here

818
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:48,784
or taken you to Neung's house.

819
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,704
I used to think
that you might be a relative,

820
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:56,265
even a sibling.

821
01:08:56,744 --> 01:08:58,544
But Neung's father doesn't know you.

822
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,345
So, you're not their family.

823
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:11,504
Now that you know
I'm not related to Neung,

824
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:14,544
you won't kick me out, will you?

825
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:18,145
If I wanted to,

826
01:09:18,624 --> 01:09:20,825
I would've left you
at the temple that day.

827
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:22,905
Gosh.

828
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:25,424
I'm a bear, not a dog.

829
01:09:27,025 --> 01:09:28,305
What did you say?

830
01:09:30,345 --> 01:09:31,345
I said…

831
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:34,384
I'm a nice guy, not an asshole.

832
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:40,985
Anyway, Tofu.

833
01:09:42,025 --> 01:09:45,185
When I was upstairs,
I saw a guy rushing out.

834
01:09:47,345 --> 01:09:48,464
Was it Uncle Saen?

835
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:52,624
Yes, he saved your mom.

836
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:55,265
But it's strange.

837
01:09:55,825 --> 01:09:57,265
He seemed to be in a hurry.

838
01:09:57,865 --> 01:10:01,105
It was like he was avoiding someone,
but he was also worried about her.

839
01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:06,704
You haven't had dinner, have you?

840
01:10:07,225 --> 01:10:08,585
Go eat something.

841
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:11,585
Where are you going?

842
01:10:39,305 --> 01:10:40,465
Hey.

843
01:10:41,465 --> 01:10:43,825
The food is cold. I'll warm it up for you.

844
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:45,065
I'll help.

845
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:58,225
Is Nut getting his dad to have dinner?

846
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:14,865
Take your medicine.

847
01:12:26,185 --> 01:12:28,185
You shouldn't drink so much.

848
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:30,905
You're not young anymore.

849
01:12:31,465 --> 01:12:32,744
You might fall ill.

850
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:36,744
Are you worried or are you jinxing me?

851
01:12:38,305 --> 01:12:39,585
Think what you will.

852
01:12:40,145 --> 01:12:43,624
I know. You want me dead, right?
So you can go back to her.

853
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:46,265
You got back and went straight to her

854
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:48,744
when your wife was right next door.

855
01:12:49,305 --> 01:12:51,505
Are you that worried about her?

856
01:12:51,585 --> 01:12:52,865
Yes.

857
01:12:53,465 --> 01:12:57,265
I came to see a doctor in Bangkok
because I was worried about her.

858
01:12:57,345 --> 01:12:58,465
Are you happy now?

859
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:02,145
In that case,

860
01:13:02,225 --> 01:13:03,985
the doctor must have told you

861
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:06,825
that your little angel has gone insane.

862
01:13:06,905 --> 01:13:08,624
Even if I agreed to a divorce,

863
01:13:08,704 --> 01:13:10,305
you couldn't go back to her,

864
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:13,505
unless you want a lunatic for a wife.

865
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,784
What difference would it make?

866
01:13:15,865 --> 01:13:18,465
I already have a crazy wife.

867
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:20,065
Saen!

868
01:13:20,545 --> 01:13:24,065
Go back to her, then.
You've already slept with her.

869
01:13:24,145 --> 01:13:26,345
Are you crazy?

870
01:13:26,425 --> 01:13:28,624
Na and I never did that.

871
01:13:29,704 --> 01:13:30,905
If you didn't,

872
01:13:30,985 --> 01:13:33,545
why did your brother get jealous
and lock you out?

873
01:13:33,624 --> 01:13:36,985
Enough with this love affair nonsense.

874
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:39,624
Stop being paranoid and open your eyes.

875
01:13:40,105 --> 01:13:43,105
Your nephew is in a coma.
Do you ever think about him?

876
01:13:44,744 --> 01:13:46,345
Why should I?

877
01:13:46,824 --> 01:13:49,545
I didn't put him in a coma.

878
01:13:52,225 --> 01:13:55,385
Even if I do think of him, what can I do?
I'm not a doctor.

879
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:58,465
And your company is taking care
of his medical bills.

880
01:13:58,945 --> 01:14:00,025
In fact,

881
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:01,744
he's better off dead.

882
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:04,945
-Then I'll get the money my dad gave him.
-Jan!

883
01:14:05,664 --> 01:14:08,624
I'll pretend that
this is the drink talking.

884
01:14:08,704 --> 01:14:09,545
I'm not drunk.

885
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:10,505
I meant what I said

886
01:14:10,585 --> 01:14:12,305
about Tarn and your mistress.

887
01:14:12,385 --> 01:14:15,065
You better show me some respect.

888
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:16,545
We're not divorced yet.

889
01:14:16,624 --> 01:14:17,744
You're still my husband.

890
01:14:17,824 --> 01:14:19,265
Then give me a damn divorce.

891
01:14:19,345 --> 01:14:22,265
How many times have I sent you
the papers? Just sign them.

892
01:14:22,345 --> 01:14:24,704
No. I won't let you be with her.

893
01:14:31,025 --> 01:14:33,305
You can hold on
to that marriage license, then.

894
01:14:33,985 --> 01:14:36,865
Saen, where are you going? Come back here.

895
01:14:36,945 --> 01:14:38,265
Saen, stop!

896
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:39,784
-Saen.
-Hey.

897
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:41,945
You can't leave me like this.

898
01:14:42,425 --> 01:14:44,545
You're drunk. Get back inside.

899
01:14:44,624 --> 01:14:46,905
-Have you no shame?
-No!

900
01:14:47,385 --> 01:14:49,145
You're one to talk.

901
01:14:49,225 --> 01:14:50,744
Do you think I don't know?

902
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:53,345
You love Nut because he's your son.
Isn't that right?

903
01:14:53,425 --> 01:14:54,865
-Jan!
-Ouch!

904
01:14:57,385 --> 01:14:58,305
Nut.

905
01:15:02,145 --> 01:15:04,744
Where are you staying?
I'll give you a ride.

906
01:15:04,824 --> 01:15:06,545
Saen.

907
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:08,145
Don't go.

908
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:10,185
We're done here.

909
01:15:10,744 --> 01:15:12,664
Saen.

910
01:15:12,744 --> 01:15:14,345
Saen, don't go!

911
01:15:14,425 --> 01:15:15,945
Get back here, Saen!

912
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:17,065
-Come back!
-Stop it!

913
01:15:26,865 --> 01:15:28,105
Saen.

914
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:29,824
Saen.

915
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:32,425
Saen!

916
01:15:32,985 --> 01:15:33,985
Nut.

917
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:41,105
It's late. Where has Nut gone?

918
01:15:42,145 --> 01:15:43,744
I don't know.

919
01:15:48,425 --> 01:15:50,824
I'll go and see if Jan is okay.

920
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:57,185
Jan.

921
01:15:58,185 --> 01:15:59,265
Mr. Saen.

922
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:01,185
What's all the commotion about?

923
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,505
Jan is home, but her husband left.

924
01:16:03,985 --> 01:16:06,624
I wasn't prying.

925
01:16:06,704 --> 01:16:08,905
-Hey.
-I just poked my face out and saw her

926
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:10,585
having a fight with her husband.

927
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:12,425
Then he left in a car with Nut.

928
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,305
Nut went with Mr. Saen?

929
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:18,265
That's right. I may be old,
but my eyes are like an eagle's.

930
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:21,624
Should we go check on Jan?

931
01:16:21,704 --> 01:16:22,865
There's no need for that.

932
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:26,305
Jan is a strong woman. She's fine.

933
01:16:26,385 --> 01:16:28,105
She probably just threw a tantrum.

934
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:32,425
Don't be too quick to judge
who's strong or weak.

935
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:35,585
You're not in their shoes.

936
01:16:35,664 --> 01:16:37,425
So don't judge them, okay?

937
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,065
-Okay.
-All right?

938
01:16:39,145 --> 01:16:42,784
Let's go before they run out
of deep-fried dough sticks and soy milk.

939
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,664
-It's already late. Don't be so nosy.
-Okay.

940
01:16:45,744 --> 01:16:48,025
Stop poking your nose in others' affairs.

941
01:16:48,505 --> 01:16:51,425
-Aren't you sick of soy milk yet?
-Never.

942
01:16:51,505 --> 01:16:53,265
I could have it every day.

943
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,824
I've done so much for you.

944
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:20,145
Are you really going to leave me?

945
01:17:57,664 --> 01:17:58,824
Thank you, Nut.

946
01:18:00,945 --> 01:18:01,985
It's fine.

947
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:07,865
I barged into your house today.

948
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:09,185
I'm sorry about that.

949
01:18:09,265 --> 01:18:10,585
You don't have to be sorry.

950
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:13,945
You should visit us sometime.

951
01:18:14,704 --> 01:18:16,185
We're family after all.

952
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:19,385
And my dad is already gone.

953
01:18:35,145 --> 01:18:36,305
I forgot.

954
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,065
Jan doesn't want you to see us.

955
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:44,385
I don't care what she thinks.

956
01:18:44,465 --> 01:18:46,945
She's mistaken
and she has the wrong idea about things.

957
01:18:47,585 --> 01:18:50,025
But I don't want her
to pick a fight with your mom.

958
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:52,505
Your mom is a poor soul.

959
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:55,265
I don't want to cause her
any more trouble.

960
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,784
How is she doing?

961
01:19:33,025 --> 01:19:34,025
Uncle Saen.

962
01:19:36,225 --> 01:19:37,065
Hello.

963
01:19:40,704 --> 01:19:43,025
How's your mom? Is she doing okay?

964
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:44,585
She's fine.

965
01:19:44,664 --> 01:19:46,985
Do you want to come inside?
Dad is also home.

966
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:49,985
I've got an errand to run.

967
01:19:52,065 --> 01:19:54,185
-Can you give this to your mom?
-Sure.

968
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:55,824
Thank you.

969
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:00,145
Take good care of your mom.

970
01:20:01,945 --> 01:20:02,985
I will.

971
01:20:12,865 --> 01:20:13,865
Who was it?

972
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:15,145
It was Uncle Saen.

973
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,345
Here's a gift from Chiang Mai.

974
01:20:25,305 --> 01:20:27,664
Do not accept anything
from Saen from now on.

975
01:20:39,905 --> 01:20:41,664
Why did Dad do that, Mom?

976
01:20:42,385 --> 01:20:44,265
Uncle Saen is his brother.

977
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:03,025
You ask the same question
every time we meet.

978
01:21:07,305 --> 01:21:08,664
You've seen how she is.

979
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,385
I asked Tofu to help look after her,

980
01:21:13,025 --> 01:21:15,465
but he had gone out
when she fell off the ladder.

981
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,824
Thank God you got there in time.

982
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:22,225
Is that kid a houseboy?

983
01:21:24,585 --> 01:21:27,185
He's a friend of mine, not a houseboy.

984
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:29,545
He's a little bit goofy.

985
01:21:30,704 --> 01:21:33,905
Don't mind him if he does anything weird.

986
01:21:36,185 --> 01:21:37,704
From what I've seen,

987
01:21:37,784 --> 01:21:41,025
he seems like an innocent,
trustworthy kid.

988
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:43,545
You work hard.

989
01:21:43,624 --> 01:21:45,824
It's good he's helping you
look after your mom.

990
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:55,225
It would've been nice

991
01:21:56,105 --> 01:21:57,624
if she had married you.

992
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,345
She would have you to care for her.

993
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:07,945
If I had a loving father like you,

994
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:12,905
my mom and I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

995
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:20,905
If we could see the future,

996
01:22:22,624 --> 01:22:24,905
no one would ever make a mistake.

997
01:22:28,305 --> 01:22:30,585
But once you make a mistake,

998
01:22:32,545 --> 01:22:34,265
you're bound to do it again.

999
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:56,425
I'm home, Dad.

1000
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:57,945
You were gone a long time.

1001
01:22:58,425 --> 01:23:01,105
I stopped by a popular porridge stall
and got you some.

1002
01:23:01,664 --> 01:23:03,425
It's near Tofu's house.

1003
01:23:03,985 --> 01:23:06,585
The queue was so long I almost gave up.

1004
01:23:08,065 --> 01:23:09,145
Thank you, son.

1005
01:23:10,425 --> 01:23:11,784
You're welcome.

1006
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:13,704
You're not home very often.

1007
01:23:14,985 --> 01:23:18,065
I just wanted you to have a good meal.

1008
01:23:20,305 --> 01:23:22,624
I wasn't thanking you for the porridge.

1009
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:24,784
I meant Tofu.

1010
01:23:29,225 --> 01:23:32,225
Thank you for introducing him to me.

1011
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,824
I know you did it because I miss Neung.

1012
01:23:50,265 --> 01:23:51,265
Hey, Dad.

1013
01:23:51,905 --> 01:23:53,465
Let me ask you something.

1014
01:23:54,225 --> 01:23:55,225
What is it?

1015
01:23:55,305 --> 01:23:58,345
Did you have a lovechild
with a secret mistress?

1016
01:23:58,425 --> 01:24:01,145
You little devil. Watch your mouth.

1017
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:04,065
Look at me. I'm working my ass off.

1018
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:06,185
Would I have time for a mistress?

1019
01:24:06,265 --> 01:24:07,624
It's strange.

1020
01:24:07,704 --> 01:24:09,505
Tofu looks exactly like Neung.

1021
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:11,305
Wait a second.

1022
01:24:11,824 --> 01:24:13,385
Maybe Neung has been reincarnated.

1023
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:17,345
Dad. You watch too much TV.

1024
01:24:17,425 --> 01:24:19,905
Neung has only been dead for ten years.

1025
01:24:19,985 --> 01:24:23,025
There's no way he could be reincarnated
as someone my age.

1026
01:24:23,585 --> 01:24:25,624
That's true.

1027
01:24:27,624 --> 01:24:28,624
Hey, Dad.

1028
01:24:29,545 --> 01:24:33,065
Why don't you do some digging into Tofu?

1029
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:39,105
Do you think I have time for that?

1030
01:24:39,905 --> 01:24:41,465
Please, Dad.

1031
01:24:41,545 --> 01:24:44,545
Aren't you a tiny bit curious?

1032
01:24:47,105 --> 01:24:48,345
I'll look into it.

1033
01:24:48,945 --> 01:24:51,704
Enough chit-chat. Eat up.

1034
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:54,385
Here.

1035
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:56,905
-Take a spoon.
-Thank you.

1036
01:24:57,624 --> 01:24:58,824
I got it.

1037
01:24:58,905 --> 01:25:00,345
Eat up. Don't wait for me.

1038
01:25:16,025 --> 01:25:18,585
The ones who love each other
aren't together.

1039
01:25:18,664 --> 01:25:21,305
And the ones who are together
don't love each other.

1040
01:25:27,025 --> 01:25:28,624
Who do you mean, Ms. Left Slipper?

1041
01:25:29,105 --> 01:25:30,865
You've been a human for ages,

1042
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:32,945
but you're just as dumb as before.

1043
01:25:33,025 --> 01:25:35,225
Why do you have to be mean to Tofu?

1044
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:38,225
Are you jealous that he got to be human?

1045
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:41,985
Why would I be jealous of a teddy bear
who lives a pathetic life

1046
01:25:42,065 --> 01:25:46,265
without any vision, ideology,
nor the spirit of a free man.

1047
01:25:46,345 --> 01:25:48,345
That's enough.

1048
01:25:48,425 --> 01:25:50,385
What I just said…

1049
01:25:50,465 --> 01:25:54,985
I was talking about Mrs. Na, Mr. Saen,

1050
01:25:55,065 --> 01:25:57,265
and Jan.

1051
01:25:58,585 --> 01:26:00,784
Do you mean Mr. Saen loves Mrs. Na,

1052
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:02,865
but he can't be with her?

1053
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,305
Does that mean he doesn't love Jan?

1054
01:26:08,305 --> 01:26:10,624
You've been married to Mr. Saen
for a long time.

1055
01:26:11,425 --> 01:26:13,704
How come I've never seen him here?

1056
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:18,985
My husband works in Chiang Mai.

1057
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:21,225
He rarely flies back home.

1058
01:26:21,305 --> 01:26:23,744
But I fly over there quite often.

1059
01:26:25,425 --> 01:26:29,105
You must be lonely
since you rarely get to see him.

1060
01:26:30,425 --> 01:26:32,345
Why don't you move to Chiang Mai with him?

1061
01:26:33,585 --> 01:26:36,985
Well, I guess it's my bad luck.

1062
01:26:37,065 --> 01:26:40,345
Soon after we got married,
our company started failing.

1063
01:26:40,425 --> 01:26:43,985
My dad had to let other investors
help run the company.

1064
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,824
Saen took responsibility by quitting

1065
01:26:46,905 --> 01:26:48,704
and he got a new job in Chiang Mai

1066
01:26:49,265 --> 01:26:51,505
even though it wasn't his fault.

1067
01:26:51,985 --> 01:26:53,784
The economy was just bad.

1068
01:26:54,664 --> 01:26:58,585
In the end, we couldn't hold on
and we had to sell our factory.

1069
01:26:59,624 --> 01:27:03,824
I heard Sibmeun had invested his money
in a house in this neighborhood.

1070
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:06,425
It was in a good spot
and the price was reasonable,

1071
01:27:06,505 --> 01:27:08,225
so I bought one for myself.

1072
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:12,624
I spent all my savings on this house.

1073
01:27:12,704 --> 01:27:14,905
How can I leave it?

1074
01:27:16,385 --> 01:27:18,864
I never thought that one day,

1075
01:27:18,945 --> 01:27:22,345
Nut would move in next door with his mom.

1076
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:29,385
Actually, I feel just as sorry for Jan
as I do for Mrs. Na.

1077
01:27:33,305 --> 01:27:36,824
There must be something else
between Mrs. Na, Mr. Saen, and Jan

1078
01:27:37,345 --> 01:27:39,505
that I don't know about.

1079
01:27:39,585 --> 01:27:42,505
But it goes to show
that everyone has problems to deal with.

1080
01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:45,185
And their problems

1081
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:48,624
are way too complicated for me
to understand in such a short time.

1082
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:58,905
About life in high school?

1083
01:27:58,985 --> 01:28:00,744
And it's not an odd thing anymore.

1084
01:28:00,824 --> 01:28:02,864
But it's still not normal.

1085
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:05,905
If for you, normal means
only thinking the way you do,

1086
01:28:05,985 --> 01:28:07,744
then half the world would be abnormal.

1087
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:11,345
That plot of land and your house
should have gone to me,

1088
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:14,505
not a brat like you who has never
contributed to the family business.

1089
01:28:14,585 --> 01:28:15,744
If you want it,

1090
01:28:16,265 --> 01:28:17,664
wait until I'm dead.

1091
01:28:17,744 --> 01:28:18,744
Tofu!

1092
01:28:21,664 --> 01:28:23,385
Where did you get a key to my room?

1093
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,545
Well…

1094
01:28:24,624 --> 01:28:27,145
Well, the best way
to get over your old love

1095
01:28:27,225 --> 01:28:29,025
is to find a new one, right?

1096
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:31,704
If you're happy,

1097
01:28:32,185 --> 01:28:34,864
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

1098
01:28:35,385 --> 01:28:36,704
will come to you naturally.

1099
01:28:36,784 --> 01:28:39,225
Shall I find someone for you?
They're crazy about you.

1100
01:28:39,305 --> 01:28:40,505
It's either Prib or Tofu.

1101
01:29:36,385 --> 01:29:41,385
