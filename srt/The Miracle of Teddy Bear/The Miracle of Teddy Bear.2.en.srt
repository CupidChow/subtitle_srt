1
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,265
I suddenly turned into a human.

2
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:16,344
Who are you?

3
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,425
Tell me what you want.

4
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,105
I'll help you get your memory back.

5
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:21,745
Because I want to know

6
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:22,904
who you are too.

7
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,425
Mom.

8
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:25,705
Have you seen Tofu?

9
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:27,385
Wait.

10
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,505
Hey, are you okay?

11
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:34,865
He's handsome.

12
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,865
-Neung.
-Nut.

13
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,705
Nut!

14
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:47,865
Why aren't you dressed?

15
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,464
You're not dressed either.

16
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,865
Saen, can you get me a spoon?

17
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,344
Thank you.

18
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:08,385
Little Prince, that's not how you cut it.

19
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,184
You have to take this out.

20
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:16,385
Saen.

21
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:20,064
Let's eat at the garden again,
with Little Prince.

22
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:23,184
All three of us. Sounds good?

23
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,184
Yes.

24
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:32,705
I'm off, Mom.

25
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,585
Stay for breakfast. It's almost done.

26
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:37,184
No, I'm in a hurry.

27
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,624
Then take this lunchbox.

28
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,305
Your dad and I made it.
They're your favorites.

29
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,665
Can you stop talking about Dad?

30
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,265
I'm off to work.

31
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,745
That's just how he is.

32
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:03,184
Don't mind him.

33
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,025
No, don't do it yourself. It's hot.

34
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,145
I'll open the gate for Nut.

35
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:11,064
Okay.

36
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:15,145
Little Prince.

37
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,944
Saen and I will wait at the garden.

38
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:19,384
Okay.

39
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,584
Don't be alarmed.

40
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,545
We're Na's neighbors.

41
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,665
I saw a glimpse of you. Do you live here?

42
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,905
What's your name? Where are you from?

43
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,625
Is it temporary or permanent?

44
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,745
You can't answer. Is it a secret?

45
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,905
It's not a secret.

46
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,945
I just don't know when to answer,
or who to answer first.

47
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,865
You're a funny guy.

48
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,985
Hey, we're not trying to snoop around.

49
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,185
We just want to get to know you,
since we're neighbors.

50
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,225
That's right. I'm Jan.

51
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:09,465
I'm Nhong.

52
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:12,264
I'm Chu. Here with Nhong and Jan.

53
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:16,704
I'm Tofu. I just moved into Nut's house.

54
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:18,625
I'm taking care of his mom.

55
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,584
Tofu sounds like a delicious name.

56
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:24,144
You can ask me anything.
I'm happy to help.

57
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,824
-Of course. Thank you.
-Right.

58
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:30,024
Little Prince, come on. Let's eat.

59
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,625
I think she's is calling me. I have to go.

60
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,505
Right.

61
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,505
Okay.

62
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,225
That's odd.

63
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:48,225
Na lived alone all these years
without anyone taking care of her.

64
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,824
Why did Nut suddenly hire a caretaker?

65
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:54,425
That's because
he's not a simple caretaker.

66
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:56,264
What?

67
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:01,905
JULY 23RD

68
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,385
An image from Mae Rim, Chiang Mai,
last night.

69
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,385
Little Prince.

70
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,425
THE LITTLE PRINCE

71
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,545
Little Prince.

72
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,345
-What?
-What?

73
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:38,024
-He was naked?
-What?

74
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,824
He fell from Nut's balcony?

75
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:42,225
Isn't this household interesting?

76
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:46,785
Who knows what kind of detailed care
he provides that he has to be naked.

77
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,225
And Na was calling him "Little Prince".

78
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:52,264
Only a sick person can do this.

79
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,345
Are you thinking too much into it?

80
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,985
I don't think that's what it is.

81
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,824
-Then what is it?
-Hey.

82
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:05,865
Maybe he was taking a shower,

83
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:21,024
and remembered
that his towel was on the balcony.

84
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,545
So he came to grab it.

85
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,144
And he accidentally fell from the balcony.

86
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,385
That's not it.

87
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,985
He wasn't wet when he fell.

88
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,584
There wasn't a towel either.

89
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,024
He might have been cleaning the balcony,

90
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:43,264
and he took off his clothes
to prevent them from getting dirty.

91
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:47,065
Then he slipped and fell while scrubbing.

92
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:51,385
-My goodness. Do you live in a dreamland?
-Gosh.

93
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,824
Stop being so optimistic.

94
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:56,704
Kids these days move fast.

95
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:59,385
How fast do you mean?

96
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:04,344
I saw him climbing
onto Nut's balcony last night.

97
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:13,784
He was sneaking into the room
in the middle of the night.

98
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:16,584
It couldn't have been
much different that morning.

99
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,464
Gosh.

100
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,064
Oh, my goodness.

101
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:38,585
Eventually, they ended up in bed.

102
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,664
I wonder if Na knows

103
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:47,865
how far her son and the caretaker
have gone.

104
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:48,785
Oh, my.

105
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:53,184
She'll go crazy when she finds out.

106
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:55,745
Wow.

107
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,505
Whoa. Oh, a woman.

108
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,665
Mad dog!

109
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,865
-Who's mad?
-Jan is.

110
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,465
Does it look good?

111
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:15,865
Little Prince is here.

112
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,025
Saen likes orange juice.

113
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,705
This is Saen.

114
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,825
Let's continue The Little Prince later.

115
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,025
It was so funny that day.

116
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:44,064
I was reading The Little Prince,
and he actually fell from the sky.

117
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:46,064
I almost had a heart attack.

118
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:49,625
Luckily, you told me you sent him here.

119
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:17,745
Did you fix it?

120
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:21,625
I did. I added so much to please him.

121
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,225
I would be speechless
if he doesn't approve it.

122
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:26,424
You seem to be fixating on it.

123
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,745
Is there something you're hiding?

124
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,424
Does this mean…

125
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,064
What are you trying to say?

126
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:41,985
The opportunity is here.

127
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,184
I've been wanting to do it.

128
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,025
I think it's about time.

129
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:51,465
Time for what?

130
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,225
Time for the meeting.

131
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:56,265
Get Prib. Where is she?

132
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,824
It's her day off.

133
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,265
I see. That's why
I feel focused this morning.

134
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:03,265
It's her day off?

135
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:05,064
Where did she go?

136
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:07,944
No idea. She said it was urgent.

137
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,225
Can she do that?

138
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,064
We have a meeting with Juea today.

139
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:13,345
Right.

140
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:16,304
That's why she asked you
to do the presentation in her place.

141
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,705
As for this, I'll take it.

142
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:24,345
Bye.

143
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:28,105
What the hell?

144
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:39,625
TATARN KLAIANANT

145
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:43,625
CHIANG MAI

146
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,544
How is my nephew, Doctor?

147
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,785
There's a crack in his skull.

148
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,745
It has collapsed into his cranial cavity.

149
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,824
I've already operated on him.

150
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,145
When will he wake up?

151
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,265
We have to estimate his consciousness.

152
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:02,625
He had a cardiac arrest
during the procedure.

153
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:05,985
I brought his vitals back to normal.

154
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:10,385
We would have to wait
and see how fast he recovers.

155
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,544
How long do we have to wait?

156
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,064
I can't be sure.

157
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:17,465
It depends on the patient.

158
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,225
In the worst case,
if he still doesn't gain consciousness,

159
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,745
he might remain
in this state all his life.

160
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:38,225
Hello, sir. I'm Tarn's junior.

161
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:40,064
What happened to him?

162
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,424
I would also like to know.

163
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,585
This is where Mr. Tatarn was found.
He was attacked.

164
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:01,304
At dawn that day,
the local villagers happened to be here.

165
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,905
Hey, is that a person?

166
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:10,905
Hey.

167
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,304
-The train is coming.
-Get him out.

168
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:33,465
Fortunately, they were able
to get Mr. Tatarn out in time,

169
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,585
or he would've been crushed by the train.

170
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,785
How did Tarn end up here?

171
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:41,225
It's a desolated area
without any security cameras.

172
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:44,304
We don't know how he ended up here either.

173
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,944
However, it is possible
that he was mugged.

174
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,225
-Mugged?
-Yes.

175
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,544
The local police searched for evidence,
but we couldn't find anything.

176
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:58,544
We only found his car
parked about a kilometer from here.

177
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,585
In the beginning,

178
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:01,145
nobody knew who he was

179
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,385
until someone in the hospital
recognized him.

180
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:07,905
We contacted the phone network company
to check the record of all his calls.

181
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:11,025
That's how we knew you were
the last two numbers who called him.

182
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:15,225
That's why we're asking
to interrogate you.

183
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:29,184
I used to know him.

184
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:32,184
We were close because we went
to the same university in Japan.

185
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,745
Tarn and I see each other sometimes.

186
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,225
Not often though.

187
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:39,944
I called him
for the usual family conversation.

188
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,704
-Are you his family?
-I'm his uncle.

189
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,625
How about you?
What's your relationship with Mr. Tatarn?

190
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,745
Technically, we're just friends.

191
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,225
But, I wanted to be more than that.

192
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:58,824
Tarn's parents passed away.
He's their only son.

193
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,985
The rest of his relatives are in Bangkok.

194
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:03,505
They barely talk.

195
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:06,424
I thought I should check on him
occasionally

196
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,304
since he was here alone.

197
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,625
Not often though.

198
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,665
He likes to keep to himself.

199
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:14,465
Artists are like that.

200
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:19,184
Yes, Tarn is an artist
and an award-winning advertiser.

201
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,665
He opened his own studio recently.

202
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,385
He would hike in his free time

203
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,985
or join student organizations
to do some social work.

204
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,785
Why did you call him that day?

205
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:32,184
I was just going to visit him at home.

206
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,584
When I got there,
we had the usual conversation,

207
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,985
and then he had to run an errand.

208
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:40,665
What errand?

209
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,105
He didn't tell me about it.

210
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,424
What happened after that?

211
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:46,824
We left the house together after that.

212
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,385
I was driving behind him.

213
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:54,025
I lost him when I hit a person
and took them to the hospital.

214
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:56,304
I went straight home from there.

215
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:59,745
Before that, I sent him a work e-mail,

216
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,225
but he didn't reply.

217
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:04,704
So I called him, but he didn't answer.

218
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:08,184
I thought he was busy,
so I didn't contact him again.

219
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:11,745
I saw the protest on the news,
and there's still no sign of Tarn.

220
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:15,385
I was about to call him
when you called me.

221
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,824
Do you know if he had
any disagreements with anyone?

222
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:22,304
I don't think so.

223
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,304
He's a good kid.

224
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:28,785
That's right. He's a good man
with strong ideology.

225
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:31,665
He is deeply serious about work.

226
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,665
Then do you think

227
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:37,265
that someone might intentionally hurt him
but not for his possessions?

228
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,265
I'm not sure about that.

229
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:43,944
I think if there's anyone
who wants him hurt,

230
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,505
it would be…

231
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:51,184
the company he's protesting against.

232
00:16:57,064 --> 00:17:00,704
It's too serious. Okay?

233
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,345
How is it serious?

234
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,865
Didn't you say they want this genre?

235
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:08,545
It's true that they want
this genre of boys' love,

236
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:14,024
but it has to be bright and light,
lovey-dovey first love.

237
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,585
Who would want to watch this?

238
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:18,665
It's darn serious.

239
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:22,785
Do you fear people not watching it
or that we'll get no sponsors?

240
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:24,264
Come on.

241
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:26,504
Nut, what don't you understand?

242
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:30,225
If the channel can't get any sponsors,

243
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:33,825
what would happen after that?

244
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,305
The sponsors won't pay the channel.

245
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:38,865
The channel won't pay us.

246
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:40,785
What about my savings and investments?

247
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:43,264
Right? They would be all gone.

248
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,504
No money for you guys.

249
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:47,705
Right? Think!

250
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,065
Revise it.

251
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:50,984
Fix it.

252
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:02,385
Nut.

253
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:06,465
I understand both you and Juea.

254
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:11,225
Come on. You had the chance to work on it.

255
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:14,504
Just try again.

256
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,785
Either way, Juea trusts you.

257
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:22,425
Here. Relax with this coffee.

258
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:30,984
You don't need to take it.

259
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,425
Should we get drunk? Let's go get drunk.

260
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,425
Get drunk to light up your brain.

261
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,984
We have to take the opportunity
as Prib isn't here.

262
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,264
Or else…

263
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,185
she would've followed us.

264
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,305
Tofu.

265
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,984
Put this in the fridge for me.

266
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:51,585
Yes.

267
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,705
Do Nut and you like apples?

268
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,585
The fridge is full of them.

269
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:10,425
Nut doesn't, but I do,

270
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:11,744
so he buys those for me.

271
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,345
He knows I like them just as you do.

272
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,665
Do you remember?

273
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,585
After you found out I like apples,
you bought them for me every day.

274
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:31,145
Do you remember that?

275
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:35,905
Didn't I tell you
to stop talking about Dad?

276
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,264
Why?

277
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:42,665
I'm just talking to him about the old days
before you were born.

278
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:43,625
That's all.

279
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,585
Do you know how long I've put up
with this side of you?

280
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:55,545
Nut.

281
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,545
I thought you really wanted to eat
these stupid apples,

282
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,825
but they're just a reminder of Dad.

283
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,305
Then don't eat them.

284
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,145
Why did you do that?

285
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:21,865
If I hadn't done that,
would you have stopped talking about Dad?

286
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:23,825
He's not here anymore.

287
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,185
You're lying.

288
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,825
He's always with me.

289
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,465
When you go to work,

290
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,744
we dine at the garden.

291
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,425
We just did it this morning.

292
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,145
I invited Tofu, too.

293
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,425
How could you say he's not here?

294
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:45,625
Can you stop lying to yourself?

295
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,385
He's not here anymore.

296
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,345
He's dead!

297
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,945
Saen, can you get me a spoon?

298
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:14,705
Thank you.

299
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:20,264
Little Prince, that's not how you cut it.

300
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,024
Saen.

301
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:25,705
Let's eat at the garden again,

302
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,145
with Little Prince.

303
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:30,784
All three of us.

304
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:32,984
I'm off, Mom.

305
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:36,545
Then take this lunchbox.

306
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:41,024
Your dad and I made it.

307
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:43,865
They're your favorites.

308
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:47,784
Can you stop talking about Dad?

309
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:50,305
I'm off to work.

310
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,865
That's just how he is.

311
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:56,865
Don't mind him.

312
00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:59,345
No, don't. It's hot.

313
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,465
-I'll open the gate for Nut.
-Okay.

314
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,105
Little Prince.

315
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:07,984
Saen and I will wait at the garden.

316
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,544
Saen likes orange juice.

317
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,065
This is Saen.

318
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:36,264
Saen, after we eat,
let's continue The Little Prince later.

319
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,984
It was so funny that day.

320
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:42,264
I was reading The Little Prince,
and he actually fell from the sky.

321
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:43,945
I almost had a heart attack.

322
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:48,665
Luckily, you told me you sent him here.

323
00:22:58,185 --> 00:22:59,705
Can't you hear me?

324
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,425
Dad is dead!

325
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:08,665
Where are you going, Saen?

326
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,544
I can't stop you from hating him,

327
00:23:17,225 --> 00:23:18,784
but don't say that again.

328
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,105
He didn't go anywhere. He's with me.

329
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,544
And he brought Tofu here.

330
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,665
Mom.

331
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,425
That's enough.

332
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,105
I'm begging you. Please stop it.

333
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:29,504
Please stop!

334
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:31,625
I don't believe you.

335
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,865
He's with me.

336
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,585
He's right here with me.

337
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,984
How can you say that he isn't?

338
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,945
He didn't go anywhere.

339
00:23:46,865 --> 00:23:48,984
Please stop your madness!

340
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,784
I'm embarrassed!

341
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:54,544
I said I'm embarrassed!

342
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:56,264
It's not true.

343
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,385
He's here with me.

344
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:08,544
He's right here with me.

345
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:11,185
He's with me.

346
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,504
When I was on the chair by the window,

347
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:24,185
I heard Mrs. Na
calling Mr. Saen at the garden,

348
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:27,865
but I never saw him out there.

349
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:32,905
No wonder Nut is always angry

350
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:35,585
whenever she talks about Mr. Saen.

351
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,504
When I was a teddy bear,

352
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:05,905
I got to be with Nut.

353
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,385
He would hug me every time he cried.

354
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:11,425
Now,

355
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:13,905
I'm a person with two hands.

356
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:16,385
He doesn't have to hug me,

357
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,665
but I can't do anything at all.

358
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:22,665
It's really terrible.

359
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:02,145
What are you doing here?

360
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:04,984
Don't you remember what I tell you?

361
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:08,264
I know,

362
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,425
but you were crying last night.

363
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,905
I was worried about you.

364
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:16,145
I couldn't go inside the room,
so I slept out here.

365
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:22,905
Just leave. I have to go to work.

366
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:36,945
I'm off, Mom.

367
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,264
Kuenchai.

368
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:58,585
Where's Mom?

369
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:08,865
Kuenchai.

370
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:26,984
Nut.

371
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:31,064
I haven't seen your mom. Where did she go?

372
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,744
Isn't that Na?

373
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:26,585
Stop the car.

374
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,825
-Hey, what's going on?
-I think I saw Na.

375
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:30,945
She was just standing there.

376
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:32,385
-Where?
-Over there.

377
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:33,825
Let's get out of the car.

378
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:37,905
-Oh.
-Be careful.

379
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,984
Where is she?

380
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:40,105
Where did she go?

381
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:41,345
She was just right here.

382
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,544
Where? Gosh.

383
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:44,744
Is she here?

384
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,304
Someone is drowning!

385
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,705
-Hey!
-Over there!

386
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,385
-Is that…
-Na?

387
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,105
Yes, Nhong.

388
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:02,145
I'll be right there.

389
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:04,264
Stupid caretaker.

390
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,585
I'll kill you
if anything happens to my mom.

391
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:13,225
Nut, take me with you.

392
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:14,744
Nut!

393
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:25,264
Tofu.

394
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,465
Are you hurt?

395
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:30,304
A little bit.

396
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,145
Have you seen Mrs. Na?

397
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:35,264
No, I just woke up.

398
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:37,984
That wasn't nice.

399
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:39,264
Nut is too hasty.

400
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:42,865
Come with me. I'll treat your wound.

401
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:43,784
Come on.

402
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,304
Thank you,

403
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,185
but I should wait inside the house.

404
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,504
Right.

405
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:00,225
A lifelong troublemaker.

406
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:01,465
Hurry up.

407
00:31:02,064 --> 00:31:03,345
Gosh.

408
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:05,345
Oh, my.

409
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:06,625
-Will she die?
-Hurry.

410
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,905
Move out of the way! It's my mom.

411
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,465
Mom!

412
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,504
I told you not to be hasty.

413
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:33,345
I'm sorry, Nut.

414
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,945
I misunderstood.

415
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:37,865
I tried to call you many times,
but you wouldn't answer.

416
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:42,345
I did see Na
wandering around here, though.

417
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,825
I really did. I didn't…

418
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,865
Look what you did…

419
00:31:57,544 --> 00:31:58,824
RECENTS

420
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:03,945
NHONG

421
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:12,024
Ms. Left Slipper.

422
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:14,625
Can you still not find Mrs. Na?

423
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:21,345
I think she planned to go somewhere,

424
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,625
or she wouldn't change shoes.

425
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:25,705
She put you away neatly too.

426
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:29,264
She must have run away from home.

427
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,504
That is why she left me here on purpose,

428
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:35,024
so that no one can find her.

429
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:42,185
No way.

430
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:44,905
She must have forgotten you.

431
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:49,665
Had she really run away from home,
she would've taken a luggage.

432
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,945
Like in the movies.

433
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:56,665
Did anyone see her doing strange things
before she left?

434
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:01,905
I don't think anything was strange.

435
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:05,425
Little One, do you have
only 80,000 cells in your brain?

436
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:08,024
Can't you remember
that after she came down…

437
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:58,744
An old keyring.

438
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,585
Is she…

439
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:06,145
What did you say?

440
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,585
Your mom is missing?

441
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,025
Where are you now?

442
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,465
Gen, get in.

443
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:18,344
Gen! Nut! Where are you going?
I'm going with you.

444
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,304
I'm going with you.

445
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:22,985
Where are you going?

446
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:30,185
I knew it. They wouldn't leave me here.

447
00:34:32,744 --> 00:34:33,625
Hey.

448
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,065
Tell Juea that we would like to postpone
the meeting.

449
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:38,264
Nut's mom is missing. Hurry up.

450
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,505
Take me with you.

451
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:41,505
Come on.

452
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:43,904
What?

453
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:45,505
Nut's mom is missing?

454
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:47,505
That's trouble.

455
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,864
Exactly, Nut is in trouble.

456
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,465
I'm the one in trouble.

457
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:53,585
How can we hold the meeting without him?

458
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:56,505
Uncle Juea. Just postpone the meeting.

459
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,665
His mom is missing.
How can he join a meeting?

460
00:34:58,745 --> 00:34:59,745
Oh, my.

461
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:01,745
Why are all my employees

462
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:04,185
so self-centered?

463
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:07,505
I haven't scolded you
about not turning in your work either.

464
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:08,944
Why did you go to Chiang Mai?

465
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,944
Was it to visit a guy who dumped you?

466
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,384
Uncle Juea.
Why are you bringing it up again?

467
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:16,944
Everyone has reasons
when they take off from work.

468
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:20,384
You're supposed to be an executive.
Empathize with your employees.

469
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:22,145
Don't say I didn't warn you.

470
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,225
Warn yourself.

471
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:25,505
Let me know when Nut gets here.

472
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:26,665
I have good news.

473
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:28,225
What good news?

474
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:31,864
Let's try finding with an application.

475
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:33,944
She left her phone at home.

476
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:39,025
Let's check in her favorite places then.

477
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:41,825
I checked the market a few times already.

478
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:44,904
-Did she visit the doctor?
-Her appointment is in two months.

479
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:47,864
Gosh. Let's just call the police.

480
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:53,705
What?

481
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,785
-Mom.
-Nut.

482
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,424
I know where your mom went.

483
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:03,345
I think she went to the old house.

484
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:05,305
The one before we moved here.

485
00:36:05,904 --> 00:36:06,904
How do you know?

486
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:08,944
I…

487
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:11,305
I'm just speculating.

488
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,585
She likes to talk about it.

489
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:15,265
I think she misses the house.

490
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:18,545
Pick me up so we can go together.

491
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,145
Nut?

492
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:27,825
Nut?

493
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:31,145
Nut hung up.

494
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:33,545
I don't think Nut believes you.

495
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,785
It's all right.

496
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:36,465
If he doesn't believe you,

497
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:39,065
you can look for Mrs. Matana yourself.

498
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:41,105
I know the house is in Soi Butterfly,

499
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:43,745
but I don't know where it is.

500
00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:46,025
Search on the phone then.

501
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,665
Doesn't Nut always do that?

502
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:53,424
Wait a minute.
Mrs. Matana never updated me.

503
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:56,265
I do not know if that will work.

504
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:00,464
SEARCH HERE

505
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,145
Did you find Soi Butterfly?

506
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:08,424
The phone is frozen.

507
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:11,904
Should I call a taxi?

508
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:20,545
Is Na back?

509
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,105
Not yet,

510
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:24,025
but I found out where she went.

511
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:25,185
Where?

512
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,505
The old house in Soi Butterfly.

513
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,825
Can you two take me there?

514
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,585
The house in Soi Butterfly.

515
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:35,384
Do you know it?

516
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:36,545
I don't.

517
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,424
It's okay. I'll call a friend.

518
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:39,464
-I know it.
-Quickly.

519
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:41,105
I'll take you there.

520
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:42,025
What?

521
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,904
I don't think it's this house.

522
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,424
We have to park here

523
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:11,904
and walk the rest of the way.

524
00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:13,305
Hey.

525
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:15,265
Tofu.

526
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:16,944
Wait, Tofu.

527
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:21,185
Hey. Where are you going?

528
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:23,505
Do you know which house it is? Tofu!

529
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:25,545
-Tofu!
-Miss.

530
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,904
How can you park here?

531
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:28,384
Move back. I need to get out.

532
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:29,384
But…

533
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:32,305
All right. Fine.

534
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:52,384
Why wouldn't I know?

535
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,625
I used to live here.

536
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:23,464
I remember that
there was Nut, Mrs. Na, and Mr. Saen.

537
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:26,345
Mrs. Na would wash
and dry me occasionally,

538
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,145
so I got to see the outside world.

539
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,985
I've never seen Mr. Saen though.

540
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:38,345
For Mrs. Na and Nut,

541
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,985
there must be many memories here…

542
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:44,145
before I woke up.

543
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:02,424
Mrs. Na.

544
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:06,185
Mrs. Na.

545
00:42:50,345 --> 00:42:51,265
I…

546
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:53,464
woke up in this room…

547
00:42:54,345 --> 00:42:55,305
on that bed.

548
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:07,944
Gosh.

549
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:12,665
My goodness.

550
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:19,705
Jan.

551
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:22,944
Well…

552
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:25,545
I drove Tofu here.

553
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:29,585
Thank you.

554
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:31,825
I can't believe Na is really here.

555
00:44:31,904 --> 00:44:34,025
She has gone mad
from being stuck in the past.

556
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,944
It's such a shame.

557
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:43,745
People who are stuck in the past
don't always go mad.

558
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:47,265
Those who can't stand others' happiness

559
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:50,145
or those who have evil thoughts
day and night

560
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:53,745
are the ones going mad.

561
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:58,345
If you know someone like that,

562
00:44:58,424 --> 00:45:01,185
you should take her to the hospital
before it's too late.

563
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:02,984
Hey.

564
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:04,665
Hey!

565
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,345
Hey. What are you doing?

566
00:45:06,424 --> 00:45:07,345
Gosh.

567
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:10,065
In case you didn't get that,

568
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:12,105
Nut is asking you to leave.

569
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:13,025
Bitch.

570
00:45:18,464 --> 00:45:19,585
Please leave.

571
00:45:19,665 --> 00:45:20,585
Gosh.

572
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:30,825
Mrs. Na.

573
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,545
How did you know I was here?

574
00:45:38,185 --> 00:45:39,424
Did Saen tell you?

575
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:42,665
Come sit here.

576
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:50,585
What are you looking at?

577
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:56,944
It's a picture of us.

578
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:01,345
The first picture
that Saen and I took together.

579
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:08,145
We met each other when I lived here
with my grandmother.

580
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:15,065
I still remember the first day we met

581
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:20,984
as if it was yesterday.

582
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:26,545
The season was changing.

583
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:28,984
I went out on a tutoring job.

584
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:31,625
My grandmother had really high fever,

585
00:46:32,864 --> 00:46:36,464
so she called me at my student's house
from the number I left her.

586
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:38,904
Hello?

587
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:40,545
But she dialed the wrong number.

588
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:41,904
Please

589
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:44,665
call Matana

590
00:46:45,384 --> 00:46:48,545
for me.

591
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,065
She called Saen's house.

592
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,984
I'm sorry. You got the wrong number.

593
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,384
Are you all right?

594
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,345
-Are you Matana?
-Yes.

595
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:05,305
Your grandmother is in the hospital.

596
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:08,505
We didn't know each other,

597
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:11,745
but Saen drove here
following my grandmother's directions,

598
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:13,705
and took her to the hospital.

599
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:18,424
Then he took me to see her.

600
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:26,505
Thank you again for bringing her here.

601
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:28,065
You're welcome.

602
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:34,464
Hello, ma'am.

603
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,464
Hello.

604
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,225
Hello, Na.

605
00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:41,305
Hello, Saen.

606
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:43,785
I bought this for you.

607
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,665
Thank you,

608
00:47:47,145 --> 00:47:49,705
but we couldn't finish the apples
you bought yesterday.

609
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:54,225
My grandmother can't really chew on them.

610
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,944
Na.

611
00:47:57,025 --> 00:48:00,745
Saen didn't buy them for me.

612
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:19,025
Do you believe in miracles?

613
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,105
I do.

614
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:26,105
I'll tell you a story.

615
00:48:28,545 --> 00:48:31,984
The day my grandmother was sick
and called Saen's house

616
00:48:32,065 --> 00:48:35,185
was the first day
that he had been home in a year

617
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:40,424
and the first time in two years
that he picked up the phone himself.

618
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:44,225
Do you think that's a miracle?

619
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:46,105
Yes, it is.

620
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,025
Have you told Nut about this?

621
00:48:55,545 --> 00:48:57,185
He wouldn't want to hear it.

622
00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:02,944
You know when I talk about Saen,

623
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:06,185
Nut always gets angry.

624
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:11,025
Sometimes I wonder…

625
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:18,065
if he's angry
because he doesn't believe me…

626
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,305
or that he doesn't like me.

627
00:49:26,745 --> 00:49:29,025
Everything I do seems to be wrong.

628
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:31,944
That's not it.

629
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:34,025
Nut really loves you.

630
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,384
He almost cried when you've gone missing.

631
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,145
He rushed out to find you.

632
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:44,424
Is that so?

633
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:46,424
Yes.

634
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:54,745
I just wanted to…

635
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:00,065
stay in a peaceful place.

636
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:04,145
A place where I'm happy.

637
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,984
I think…

638
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:12,185
if Nut didn't see me for a while,

639
00:50:13,665 --> 00:50:15,825
he would be happier.

640
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:26,585
Did I get my own son in trouble again?

641
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:32,665
I'm such a terrible mother.

642
00:50:35,345 --> 00:50:37,145
I always have been.

643
00:50:41,065 --> 00:50:42,065
Mrs. Na.

644
00:50:48,305 --> 00:50:49,145
Mom.

645
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:06,504
Let's go home.

646
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:27,185
So that's what it was about?

647
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:28,545
This afternoon,

648
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:31,105
I saw Jan alone,
so I went to ask her something.

649
00:51:31,185 --> 00:51:33,665
But she yelled at me
to mind my own business.

650
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:34,625
Right.

651
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:38,384
I guess she's mad at me
for leaving her in the car.

652
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:40,785
She shouldn't be mad about that.

653
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,345
Actually,

654
00:51:42,825 --> 00:51:45,384
it's right that you should care
for Na's safety.

655
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:47,185
Come on. Don't worry about it.

656
00:51:47,265 --> 00:51:49,904
If she realizes it's not your fault,

657
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:51,785
she'll get over it herself.

658
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:53,984
All right?

659
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:56,105
Don't worry.

660
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:09,625
-I have to go.
-Okay.

661
00:52:13,384 --> 00:52:14,864
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

662
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:22,745
Put these on some plates.

663
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,984
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

664
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:50,464
What is it?

665
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:55,145
I want to thank Jan and apologize.

666
00:52:57,705 --> 00:52:58,625
Apologize, why?

667
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:01,625
She took me to see Mrs. Na,

668
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:03,145
but I left her in the car.

669
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:06,424
Nhong said she was furious
when she got back.

670
00:53:07,105 --> 00:53:08,785
She must be really mad at me.

671
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:10,065
It's not you.

672
00:53:11,265 --> 00:53:12,464
How do you know?

673
00:53:13,345 --> 00:53:14,585
I just do.

674
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:18,785
Hey, I'm warning you.

675
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:21,345
If you want
to stay in this house, I don't--

676
00:53:25,864 --> 00:53:26,745
Really?

677
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:28,904
Can I really stay here?

678
00:53:30,504 --> 00:53:31,424
Tofu.

679
00:53:32,185 --> 00:53:33,384
Listen to me.

680
00:53:34,424 --> 00:53:35,545
First,

681
00:53:36,265 --> 00:53:39,185
don't go near Jan
unless it's really necessary.

682
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,305
Do you understand?

683
00:53:44,384 --> 00:53:45,384
Two,

684
00:53:45,904 --> 00:53:48,105
if you cause trouble, disobey,

685
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:49,984
or act suspicious,

686
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:51,305
you can leave.

687
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:02,464
I'm glad we can eat together today.

688
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:09,904
Unfortunately, I couldn't cook for us.

689
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:16,504
You can cook tomorrow.

690
00:54:16,984 --> 00:54:18,424
What do you want to eat?

691
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:20,665
I'll do my best to help.

692
00:54:25,185 --> 00:54:26,185
I'm full.

693
00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:28,185
I need to work.

694
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,504
Do you want some fruit?

695
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,504
I'll get you an apple.

696
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:35,864
I'll help.

697
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:37,545
I'm not eating that.

698
00:54:44,424 --> 00:54:45,705
Tofu.

699
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:47,864
Come to my room when you're done.

700
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:28,225
Aren't you hurt?

701
00:55:29,424 --> 00:55:30,545
No.

702
00:55:31,345 --> 00:55:32,745
You must have been mad at me.

703
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:34,625
I wasn't.

704
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:38,225
Are you not admitting it

705
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:40,665
because you don't want to leave?

706
00:55:42,145 --> 00:55:43,265
I really wasn't mad.

707
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:45,225
I understood you.

708
00:55:46,225 --> 00:55:47,345
What did you understand?

709
00:55:48,424 --> 00:55:50,185
That you were worried about your mom

710
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:52,825
and you didn't mean to hit me.

711
00:56:04,384 --> 00:56:05,464
Go. We're done.

712
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:14,424
Thank you.

713
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:19,504
I promise I'll take good care
of you and your mom.

714
00:56:20,785 --> 00:56:22,384
Don't make empty promises.

715
00:56:23,105 --> 00:56:25,625
You'll leave once your memory is back.

716
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:28,464
You might not even remember me then,

717
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:31,145
since I'm not that important.

718
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:36,625
You are important to me.

719
00:56:42,305 --> 00:56:43,265
What did you say?

720
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:51,625
I said…

721
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:54,625
you are…

722
00:56:54,705 --> 00:56:55,825
I'm what?

723
00:56:58,345 --> 00:56:59,705
You are important to me.

724
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:07,944
Leave.

725
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:11,745
I think you're crazy
on top of the amnesia.

726
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:13,345
-Nut.
-Leave. We're done.

727
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:19,464
I know.

728
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:21,665
He doesn't want me here

729
00:57:22,345 --> 00:57:24,105
as Tofu the Amnesiac.

730
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:28,825
But one day, I'll find a way
to turn back into a teddy bear,

731
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:30,984
Nut's important person.

732
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:54,625
Ouch.

733
00:57:57,585 --> 00:58:00,785
My goodness. Why are they all burnt?

734
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:02,585
I'll do it myself.

735
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:04,825
Ouch.

736
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,904
What?

737
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:08,745
Was it hot?

738
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:11,745
-Yes.
-Touch your earlobes.

739
00:58:14,904 --> 00:58:17,024
Not mine, yours.

740
00:58:17,585 --> 00:58:18,705
Will it get better?

741
00:58:18,785 --> 00:58:21,665
I don't know. I saw them do it on TV.

742
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:22,785
Is it better?

743
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:26,265
A little bit.

744
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,225
Next time, if you want to eat it,

745
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:34,225
use the fork and blow on it first,

746
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:36,345
-so that it's not too hot.
-Yes.

747
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:40,024
Use a napkin to pick up and throw out
the one on the floor,

748
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:41,585
so your hands don't get burnt.

749
00:58:57,464 --> 00:58:59,504
Even the dog is smarter than me.

750
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:03,265
If being a human is as easy
as stealing freedom from the people,

751
00:59:03,345 --> 00:59:04,705
we would all turn human.

752
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:06,745
You have a lot to learn, Bear.

753
00:59:07,305 --> 00:59:11,864
Can we talk casually
without leading into politics?

754
00:59:13,305 --> 00:59:15,625
Politics is about everyone.

755
00:59:15,705 --> 00:59:19,105
I have the right to speak my mind.

756
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:20,944
Just let him be, Tofu.

757
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:26,504
Anyway, I think being a human,
having senses,

758
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:29,665
and having the freedom to go anywhere
and do anything

759
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:31,984
is worth the hardship.

760
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:33,904
What an optimist.

761
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:38,665
Mom, I'm off to work.

762
00:59:49,705 --> 00:59:50,545
Mom.

763
00:59:59,665 --> 01:00:00,504
Just in time.

764
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:03,745
Little Prince and I made it.

765
01:00:06,105 --> 01:00:06,944
Thank you.

766
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:26,065
Good morning, Nut.

767
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,864
-Come here.
-Hey.

768
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:33,225
What is it?

769
01:00:33,305 --> 01:00:35,904
So that you don't have to bring it to me.

770
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:52,665
Wow.

771
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:56,345
Your mom is so sweet.

772
01:00:56,424 --> 01:00:59,504
What a cute mom.

773
01:01:02,265 --> 01:01:03,105
Oh, my.

774
01:01:03,944 --> 01:01:08,625
Does someone want to tell me something?

775
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:11,185
You can just tell me about it in person.

776
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,265
Stop imagining things and go to work.

777
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:22,105
Here, Nut.

778
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:26,585
Get going.

779
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:28,825
Whether that's eating or working.

780
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,665
I'm sorry for causing you trouble
yesterday.

781
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:40,904
I'll try to not cause any more trouble.

782
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:50,145
Mom, I'm off to work.

783
01:01:53,464 --> 01:01:54,384
Mom.

784
01:01:58,225 --> 01:01:59,265
Just in time.

785
01:01:59,904 --> 01:02:01,464
Little Prince and I made it.

786
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:04,904
Thank you.

787
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:06,825
I'll be the best mom there is.

788
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:10,585
I'll always take care of you

789
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,825
as best as I can.

790
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:17,225
With love and care,

791
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:19,864
Mom.

792
01:02:20,585 --> 01:02:22,864
Enjoy your meal, Tofu.

793
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,065
ENJOY YOUR MEAL, TOFU

794
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,504
Handwriting like in kindergarten.

795
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:34,984
Prib!

796
01:02:36,904 --> 01:02:38,864
Prib, isn't that his lunch?

797
01:02:38,944 --> 01:02:42,464
I'm hungry, and it looks so good.

798
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:44,265
I really couldn't help myself.

799
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:55,545
So where is my souvenir from Chiang Mai
that you talked about?

800
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,864
Oh, right.

801
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:00,305
Here.

802
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:03,345
Is this it?

803
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:05,825
That's good enough.

804
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:07,545
Gen, you know what I got?

805
01:03:08,265 --> 01:03:09,265
This.

806
01:03:10,065 --> 01:03:11,464
Cheapskate!

807
01:03:11,545 --> 01:03:14,305
I'm not. It's based on how much I care.

808
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:16,825
That is how much I care about you.

809
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:19,545
Gosh. What's that?

810
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:21,105
These are Nut's souvenirs.

811
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,145
Sausages. Nam prik num.

812
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:27,424
A shirt. Pork rinds.

813
01:03:28,265 --> 01:03:29,185
What's this?

814
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,424
Coconut pie?

815
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:34,345
Why did you go to Chiang Mai?
You can just get it here.

816
01:03:34,825 --> 01:03:36,944
This is from a famous bakery.

817
01:03:37,024 --> 01:03:40,225
And the fact that I brought them
from 700 kilometers away

818
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:41,984
means I love him a lot.

819
01:03:44,464 --> 01:03:45,424
-Gosh.
-Wow.

820
01:03:45,504 --> 01:03:46,384
Prib.

821
01:03:49,345 --> 01:03:50,504
Let's look at the budget.

822
01:03:52,105 --> 01:03:53,424
Why the toilet?

823
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:55,145
-Nut!
-Why is it ten million?

824
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:58,384
Right, Prib.

825
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,145
What were you doing in Chiang Mai?

826
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:05,665
My senior from Japan was attacked
and he went into a coma.

827
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:08,665
Why was he attacked?

828
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:09,984
He was mugged.

829
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:12,544
From what I saw
on activists' Twitter posts though,

830
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,464
they said it was to silence him.

831
01:04:14,544 --> 01:04:16,265
But there's no news coverage about it.

832
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:19,504
Oh, my. If that's true,
then they're trying to keep it quiet.

833
01:04:19,585 --> 01:04:21,024
That's not right at all.

834
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:24,705
It would be right if you worked harder.

835
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:26,665
Understood? Go.

836
01:04:27,145 --> 01:04:28,745
-Let's go to work.
-Yes.

837
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:30,904
-Go on.
-Yes.

838
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:33,305
Okay. Great.

839
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:34,825
CHIANG MAI

840
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:37,944
I'm here today to personally support
the medical team

841
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:40,424
treating Mr. Tatarn.

842
01:04:40,984 --> 01:04:45,625
I'm not sure how this information
got out to the press.

843
01:04:45,705 --> 01:04:49,345
Though, I do have to thank you
for showing interest.

844
01:04:49,424 --> 01:04:51,145
Actually,

845
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:54,665
I contacted the director
and Mr. Tatarn's family

846
01:04:54,745 --> 01:04:56,225
since the first day I found out

847
01:04:56,305 --> 01:04:58,944
and I asked them
to do their best to treat him.

848
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:01,665
TRD will be responsible for all the costs,

849
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:06,185
not because we want to cover up the news,

850
01:05:06,265 --> 01:05:10,265
but because we sincerely care about him.

851
01:05:11,464 --> 01:05:12,864
As a fellow human being.

852
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:15,384
That's his family.

853
01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:22,585
We know each other. Come here, Mr. Saen.

854
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:35,345
This is Mr. Saen, one of TRD's managers.

855
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:40,185
Don't worry.

856
01:05:40,265 --> 01:05:43,145
Tatarn is your family, so he's one of us.

857
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:45,345
We will not abandon him.

858
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,225
Thank you.

859
01:05:47,705 --> 01:05:49,904
Hello, Mr. Saen and Ms. Kaew-ching-duang.

860
01:05:52,145 --> 01:05:55,265
I didn't expect to see
both of you here together.

861
01:05:57,984 --> 01:05:59,145
I'm here to visit Tarn.

862
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:02,384
I'm here to support the medical team.

863
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:04,544
I didn't expect to see Mr. Saen here.

864
01:06:08,504 --> 01:06:10,305
What about you? Why are you here?

865
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,145
I'm here to see you.

866
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,544
Have you received the summons?

867
01:06:18,944 --> 01:06:22,145
Yes. I will be heading to the precinct
right after I'm done here.

868
01:06:22,665 --> 01:06:23,864
Should we leave together?

869
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:28,544
Or would you like
to talk to the victim's family first?

870
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:31,504
If there's any progress,

871
01:06:32,585 --> 01:06:34,185
we'll ask you to come in.

872
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:41,424
Please allow me to go and see Tarn.

873
01:06:59,424 --> 01:07:00,504
Tarn.

874
01:07:03,024 --> 01:07:06,585
I never thought it would end up like this.

875
01:07:16,105 --> 01:07:17,785
-Mrs. Na.
-Yes?

876
01:07:17,864 --> 01:07:20,665
Someone is delivering a package.
They need a signature.

877
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,185
Then put these clothes
in the machine for me

878
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:28,265
and do as I taught you this morning.

879
01:07:31,665 --> 01:07:32,825
Well…

880
01:07:36,065 --> 01:07:37,065
Are you all right?

881
01:07:41,504 --> 01:07:42,544
I'm fine.

882
01:07:56,544 --> 01:07:58,065
I'm a big man now.

883
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,544
This hellish tunnel can't hurt me anymore.

884
01:08:16,784 --> 01:08:17,744
I did it.

885
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:42,464
Why is the house spinning?

886
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:46,464
Am I turning back into a teddy bear?

887
01:08:57,225 --> 01:08:58,905
Why am I seeing that day again?

888
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:00,504
The day I woke up.

889
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:03,905
Did I turn back into a teddy bear?

890
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:10,544
I think I heard Mr. Saen
and Mrs. Na fighting.

891
01:09:11,784 --> 01:09:12,865
Mrs. Na was crying.

892
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:14,945
Nut was also crying.

893
01:09:16,145 --> 01:09:17,784
Mr. Saen was probably crying too.

894
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:28,544
Why did I wake up on the day
when everyone was so sad?

895
01:09:38,544 --> 01:09:39,664
Tarn.

896
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:43,865
Doctor! He's awake! Doctor!

897
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:45,825
He's awake.

898
01:09:45,905 --> 01:09:47,664
Please step outside, sir.

899
01:10:02,704 --> 01:10:03,704
Little Prince.

900
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:07,225
Little Prince.

901
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:11,425
Little Prince.

902
01:10:25,624 --> 01:10:27,065
That's not a teddy bear's hand.

903
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,185
Am I still a human?

904
01:10:34,345 --> 01:10:36,185
You were born a human.

905
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:39,905
Did you have a nightmare
that you turned into a teddy bear?

906
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:43,865
I'm actually a teddy bear
that turned into a human.

907
01:10:49,865 --> 01:10:52,145
So that is what fainting is like.

908
01:10:52,825 --> 01:10:55,425
Mr. Right Slipper was absolutely right.

909
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:58,825
I have a lot to learn about being human.

910
01:11:12,425 --> 01:11:13,624
Is he better?

911
01:11:14,385 --> 01:11:16,265
From what I've seen, he's the same.

912
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:19,305
What about the fact
that he opened his eyes?

913
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:20,865
I'm not sure about that either.

914
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:22,385
It's strange.

915
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,865
I can't believe that he can open his eyes.

916
01:11:26,505 --> 01:11:28,704
I'll check on him again.

917
01:11:29,505 --> 01:11:30,425
Please excuse me.

918
01:11:30,505 --> 01:11:31,545
-Thank you.
-Yes.

919
01:11:40,624 --> 01:11:42,624
You take responsibility for Mr. Tatarn

920
01:11:43,105 --> 01:11:47,704
when TRD's project barely progressed
due to his protest?

921
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:51,105
Yes.

922
01:11:51,744 --> 01:11:53,865
Just as I told the press,

923
01:11:53,945 --> 01:11:56,905
we want to show our sincerity
that we're not involved

924
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:59,185
as the protesters suggest we are.

925
01:11:59,985 --> 01:12:03,545
In all honesty, how do you
feel about Mr. Tatarn?

926
01:12:04,105 --> 01:12:07,784
Wouldn't it be better for you
if he was dead?

927
01:12:10,305 --> 01:12:15,105
If we could clear things with the locals
without an outsider's intervention,

928
01:12:15,185 --> 01:12:16,664
of course, that would be better.

929
01:12:17,225 --> 01:12:18,105
But…

930
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:21,105
I do understand these organizations.

931
01:12:21,185 --> 01:12:23,784
If they don't protest or put on a facade,

932
01:12:23,865 --> 01:12:25,585
they wouldn't get any donations

933
01:12:25,664 --> 01:12:27,505
and foreigners wouldn't support them.

934
01:12:29,185 --> 01:12:31,065
I guarantee you

935
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:33,985
that we hold no personal grudge
against Mr. Tatarn.

936
01:12:34,945 --> 01:12:37,585
He's just a mainstay of the protest.

937
01:12:37,664 --> 01:12:41,624
Getting rid of him
doesn't mean there will be no protest.

938
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:44,585
There will be no leader, no one in charge.

939
01:12:45,545 --> 01:12:46,624
That's right.

940
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:50,105
But even if there are new groups
of protesters,

941
01:12:50,744 --> 01:12:52,185
TRD is not frightened.

942
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:56,145
Our construction projects
are legally sound.

943
01:12:57,145 --> 01:13:00,225
We don't need to attack anyone
to stop this construction.

944
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:12,105
Thank you for your cooperation.

945
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:15,105
TRD cooperates with all sides.

946
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:17,265
Excuse me.

947
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:19,945
May I ask one more thing?

948
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:21,624
How long have you known Mr. Saen?

949
01:13:23,385 --> 01:13:25,145
After the incident,

950
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:28,505
someone saw the news
and told me he's Mr. Tatarn's family.

951
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:30,865
I'm still sorry about it.

952
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:32,865
Had I known earlier,

953
01:13:32,945 --> 01:13:35,905
I would have cleared things
with Mr. Tatarn before it happened.

954
01:13:40,225 --> 01:13:41,385
Thank you.

955
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:44,025
If we're done, please excuse me.

956
01:13:44,505 --> 01:13:45,585
Sure.

957
01:13:53,744 --> 01:13:55,225
I received some information

958
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,065
about the day Mr. Tatarn was attacked.

959
01:13:57,824 --> 01:14:01,744
Ms. Kaew-ching-duang
was seen at a seminar in Bangkok.

960
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:04,505
Ms. Pribpree was at her office.

961
01:14:05,145 --> 01:14:09,744
Security cameras caught Mr. Saen
driving behind Mr. Tatarn

962
01:14:09,824 --> 01:14:12,505
before an accident near Sarapee Temple.

963
01:14:13,305 --> 01:14:14,145
Good.

964
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:17,824
Look for more phone numbers.

965
01:14:18,465 --> 01:14:22,545
And check all security cameras
near Mr. Tatarn's house.

966
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,545
Yes, sir.

967
01:14:23,624 --> 01:14:27,105
And don't forget to try
and rush the doctor's report.

968
01:14:27,185 --> 01:14:28,225
Yes.

969
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:34,105
Awesome.

970
01:14:35,784 --> 01:14:39,784
The opening was so exciting
and interesting.

971
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:42,465
What you added was fun.

972
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:43,945
It's fresh.

973
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:50,505
Especially the mysteries and how
the characters go around solving those.

974
01:14:50,585 --> 01:14:53,425
I was like, "Wow, that was unexpected."

975
01:14:54,025 --> 01:14:57,465
This is your first boys' love series

976
01:14:57,545 --> 01:14:58,905
and this is what you got.

977
01:14:58,985 --> 01:15:00,025
That's great.

978
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,865
-A boys' love series is just romance.
-Right.

979
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:05,265
Just changing from boy and girl
into boy and boy.

980
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:06,185
Great.

981
01:15:06,265 --> 01:15:09,505
I've always been writing romance.
It's not that different.

982
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:11,225
Right, but…

983
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:13,744
It's too serious.

984
01:15:14,784 --> 01:15:15,905
And I don't feel elated.

985
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:19,465
How elated do you need to be?

986
01:15:20,025 --> 01:15:21,664
I added things for you.

987
01:15:21,744 --> 01:15:24,784
I don't mind it, but the channel does.

988
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:27,945
They want pure, high school love.

989
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:29,225
Lovey-dovey stuff.

990
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,585
Do you think high school love is all pure?

991
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:36,385
I'm sure you've read my synopsis.

992
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:39,145
I don't want it to be just romance.

993
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:41,465
I want to get my message across too.

994
01:15:42,345 --> 01:15:45,545
I want it to be rich and serious
just like how you said.

995
01:15:46,105 --> 01:15:47,225
I'm sorry.

996
01:15:48,105 --> 01:15:50,784
Are you too into it?

997
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:53,465
Is this story based on your stress?

998
01:15:53,545 --> 01:15:55,065
Is this your life?

999
01:15:55,624 --> 01:15:58,624
Every piece of writing
contains a piece of its author.

01:15:59,105 --> 01:16:00,185
Right.

1001
01:16:00,985 --> 01:16:03,185
If you insist on being elated,

1002
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:05,425
-I'll try my best.
-Okay.

1003
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:08,065
Please excuse me if we're done here.

1004
01:16:13,345 --> 01:16:14,505
Whoa.

1005
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:16,945
If this is his life,

1006
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:19,345
what will Pribpree do?

1007
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:23,744
What did you buy?

1008
01:16:23,824 --> 01:16:26,145
I didn't buy these.
Someone gave these to me.

1009
01:16:26,704 --> 01:16:28,185
Who went to Chiang Mai?

1010
01:16:28,945 --> 01:16:29,985
Prib did.

1011
01:16:31,385 --> 01:16:34,065
Wow. There's a shirt.

1012
01:16:34,145 --> 01:16:35,345
Prib is so nice.

1013
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:44,985
LOVE CHIANG MAI

1014
01:16:50,425 --> 01:16:52,305
LOVE CHIANG MAI

1015
01:16:59,065 --> 01:17:01,985
EPISODE 1 BY PEERANUT

1016
01:17:02,865 --> 01:17:03,985
Are you too into it?

1017
01:17:04,065 --> 01:17:06,345
Is this story based on your stress?

1018
01:17:07,025 --> 01:17:07,985
Is this your life?

1019
01:17:13,065 --> 01:17:14,225
EPISODE ONE BY PEERANUT

1020
01:17:19,905 --> 01:17:22,664
Is this the same picture after ten years?

1021
01:17:26,585 --> 01:17:28,985
Nut, may I come in?

1022
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:34,744
Who allowed you to come in?

1023
01:17:36,225 --> 01:17:37,505
Nobody answered me.

1024
01:17:42,865 --> 01:17:43,865
What's this?

1025
01:17:44,624 --> 01:17:45,865
In case you get hungry.

1026
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:47,664
Did Mom put you up to this?

1027
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:49,624
No.

1028
01:17:50,185 --> 01:17:52,065
I saw it in a show I watched with her.

1029
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:54,824
You can faint if you work late.

1030
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:56,305
I fainted today.

1031
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:58,704
The house was spinning
and I had a nightmare.

1032
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:01,225
You talk so much.

1033
01:18:04,225 --> 01:18:05,305
I'm sorry.

1034
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:09,465
Just go. Leave.

1035
01:18:20,505 --> 01:18:23,744
You know I don't have a place to go.

1036
01:18:25,345 --> 01:18:26,664
I know that.

1037
01:18:27,664 --> 01:18:30,025
I'm looking for a way to take you home.

1038
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:37,065
Here you go.

1039
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,225
Leave.

1040
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:43,985
Leave.

1041
01:18:57,744 --> 01:18:58,664
Come on.

1042
01:18:59,225 --> 01:19:00,145
Okay?

1043
01:19:04,385 --> 01:19:05,505
I'm really leaving.

1044
01:19:15,345 --> 01:19:16,265
Tofu.

1045
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:18,945
Do you think I'm stupid?

1046
01:19:20,585 --> 01:19:21,585
Leave!

1047
01:19:22,985 --> 01:19:24,025
Yes, Nut.

1048
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:54,945
Hey, is this the place?

1049
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:56,824
Whose house is this?

1050
01:19:58,664 --> 01:20:00,824
The person who can tell us who Tofu is.

1051
01:20:04,704 --> 01:20:06,505
Why did you stick your face near me?

1052
01:20:08,025 --> 01:20:09,145
Wait here.

1053
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,225
I'll go make sure.

1054
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:12,905
-Let's go, Gen.
-Let's go.

1055
01:20:18,905 --> 01:20:20,784
-Is this it?
-Over there.

1056
01:21:08,465 --> 01:21:09,345
Who is it?

1057
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:16,425
It's you.

1058
01:21:17,945 --> 01:21:18,865
What's your name?

1059
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:23,545
I'm Nut.

1060
01:21:24,465 --> 01:21:25,664
How did you find my house?

1061
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,265
A club member told me.

1062
01:21:48,505 --> 01:21:49,905
This is what you asked for.

1063
01:21:51,185 --> 01:21:52,345
That's it?

1064
01:21:53,585 --> 01:21:56,345
You could just give it to me at the club.
Thanks though.

1065
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:58,385
Yes.

1066
01:21:59,945 --> 01:22:01,824
Neung, where are you?

1067
01:22:01,905 --> 01:22:03,345
Help me move this thing.

1068
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:04,905
Yes, Dad.

1069
01:22:05,385 --> 01:22:06,345
Neung.

1070
01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:12,905
Goodbye.

1071
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:48,865
-Hey!
-Hey!

1072
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:51,425
Mister.

1073
01:22:52,065 --> 01:22:54,385
What are you doing here?

1074
01:22:54,465 --> 01:22:55,945
Do I have to tell you why?

1075
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:02,225
Great to see you.

1076
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:03,945
Here's your money.

1077
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:05,824
Here.

1078
01:23:07,105 --> 01:23:07,945
Take it.

1079
01:23:11,425 --> 01:23:14,265
No. It's for you, not a loan.

1080
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:16,265
Put it back.

1081
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:18,225
You said it.

1082
01:23:19,985 --> 01:23:21,505
Bless you. Thank you.

1083
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,185
Best of luck to you, mister.

1084
01:23:26,985 --> 01:23:29,744
If you call me that once more,
I'll pop your kidney.

1085
01:23:31,265 --> 01:23:33,465
According to article 295,

1086
01:23:33,545 --> 01:23:35,704
anyone who hurts another person

1087
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:38,865
and causes physical or mental trauma,

1088
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:41,744
will be sentenced
to no more than two years

1089
01:23:41,824 --> 01:23:44,505
or fined no more than 4,000 baht,

1090
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:47,505
or both arrested and fined.

1091
01:23:48,105 --> 01:23:49,345
Is your father a policeman?

1092
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:52,145
Talking about my father
is a type of bullying.

1093
01:23:52,225 --> 01:23:53,784
Do you want a fight?

1094
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:55,945
-Punk.
-Hey.

1095
01:23:56,025 --> 01:23:57,065
Hey.

1096
01:23:57,624 --> 01:23:59,385
I'm here to see the house owner.

1097
01:23:59,465 --> 01:24:00,664
The owner?

1098
01:24:01,545 --> 01:24:05,065
Right. If you're done with your delivery,
then leave. You're in the way.

1099
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:06,465
I'm not making a delivery.

1100
01:24:06,545 --> 01:24:07,905
It's my house.

1101
01:24:17,505 --> 01:24:20,065
Hi. Can you move the car for me?

1102
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:29,945
Don't get on my nerves, Biker Boy.

1103
01:24:30,624 --> 01:24:32,505
Gen, calm down.

1104
01:24:33,345 --> 01:24:34,425
Hear him out.

1105
01:24:35,824 --> 01:24:39,385
How can I make you believe
that I really live here?

1106
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:41,824
There are only two people here,

1107
01:24:41,905 --> 01:24:43,265
-myself and--
-Nut.

1108
01:24:45,505 --> 01:24:46,345
Well…

1109
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:47,824
Neung!

1110
01:25:01,945 --> 01:25:03,025
Make yourself at home.

1111
01:25:40,225 --> 01:25:41,824
Hey, Nut.

1112
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:45,744
He really looks like Tofu.

1113
01:25:49,105 --> 01:25:50,385
Is this Neung?

1114
01:25:51,824 --> 01:25:54,744
Can he tell me who I am?

1115
01:25:57,145 --> 01:26:01,065
Maybe Neung and that kid are your cousins.

1116
01:26:03,465 --> 01:26:05,025
How can I have cousins?

1117
01:26:05,585 --> 01:26:06,824
I'm a teddy bear.

1118
01:26:07,744 --> 01:26:11,345
But who knows,
I could be related to Neung.

1119
01:26:11,865 --> 01:26:13,545
I look identical to him.

1120
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:16,744
If I get to talk to Neung,

1121
01:26:17,664 --> 01:26:21,225
he might have an answer
to why I turned into a human.

1122
01:26:27,545 --> 01:26:30,865
Do you now believe that I live here?

1123
01:26:33,225 --> 01:26:34,784
Hey.

1124
01:26:34,865 --> 01:26:37,265
You said two people live here, right?

1125
01:26:37,345 --> 01:26:38,465
Yes.

1126
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:41,025
I live here with my dad.

1127
01:26:42,105 --> 01:26:43,225
Your dad?

1128
01:26:43,305 --> 01:26:45,185
Right. Is that a problem?

1129
01:26:45,985 --> 01:26:46,865
What about Neung?

1130
01:26:48,664 --> 01:26:50,105
Doesn't Neung live here?

1131
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:53,025
He isn't here anymore.

1132
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:57,905
Where did he go?

1133
01:27:08,664 --> 01:27:10,345
We still have no idea who Tofu is.

1134
01:27:10,824 --> 01:27:11,905
All we know for sure is

1135
01:27:12,985 --> 01:27:14,704
he has nothing to do with Neung,

1136
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:16,305
despite them looking identical.

1137
01:27:18,345 --> 01:27:19,465
Woah!

1138
01:27:22,225 --> 01:27:23,945
This is so fun. It's like a movie.

1139
01:27:24,025 --> 01:27:24,985
Oh, my gosh.

1140
01:27:25,065 --> 01:27:27,864
Tofu, why aren't you wearing underwear?

1141
01:27:27,945 --> 01:27:29,105
Open your mouth.

1142
01:27:29,905 --> 01:27:30,824
Don't bite it.

1143
01:27:33,824 --> 01:27:35,065
Go ahead.

1144
01:27:35,145 --> 01:27:36,225
-Whoa.
-Hey.

1145
01:27:42,704 --> 01:27:44,385
Which one was the real Mr. Saen?

1146
01:27:44,465 --> 01:27:45,945
The one that was your dad.

1147
01:27:46,905 --> 01:27:48,385
I only have one dad.

1148
01:27:49,065 --> 01:27:51,065
Remember, I only have one dad!

1149
01:28:48,385 --> 01:28:53,385
