1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:07,905
"First Love."

2
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,024
Does this mean…

3
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:12,464
What are you trying to say?

4
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:18,425
After you found out I like apples,
you bought them for me every day.

5
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:19,945
Do you remember that?

6
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:24,305
I thought you really wanted to eat
these stupid apples,

7
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,585
but they're just a reminder of Dad.

8
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:28,064
Then don't eat them.

9
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,985
I'm such a terrible mother.

10
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:35,545
Mom.

11
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,624
Let's go home.

12
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:41,025
If you want
to stay in this house, I don't--

13
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:44,985
Is this Neung?

14
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,225
Can he tell me who I am?

15
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,505
He isn't here anymore.

16
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:56,305
MR. ANONT TANAKUL

17
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,784
Dad told me

18
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,265
that Neung and his friends
were going on a trip to the province

19
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,545
to celebrate getting into university.

20
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,945
But on the way to the train station,

21
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,504
he was hit by a car and he died.

22
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,184
I'm…

23
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,425
sorry to hear that.

24
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,624
It's okay. It happened a long time ago.

25
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,705
Were you guys friends with him?

26
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,425
I wasn't.

27
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,705
I was his junior at school.

28
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:37,985
We were in the same club.

29
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,705
Dad said that he was close
with everyone in that club.

30
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,665
I would have thought everyone knew

31
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,025
he died ten years ago.

32
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:50,545
That's right. How could you not know?

33
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,705
We didn't stay in touch when he left.

34
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,385
The last time I saw him

35
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,184
was probably at graduation.

36
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,144
Neung.

37
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:21,624
What's up?

38
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,625
This is for you.

39
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:31,865
You got it for me?

40
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:35,905
When you leave,
you'll still play basketball, right?

41
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,865
You know me.

42
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,865
Thanks.

43
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:44,584
Did you get a place
on the sports science course?

44
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:47,144
Yes, sports science.

45
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:49,425
Are you pleased?

46
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,545
Of course.

47
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,345
I'm a bit apprehensive too.

48
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,065
I'll be the only one there.

49
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:57,024
Sho is taking management.

50
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,305
Prab is going to Rangsit.

51
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,385
And as for Tarn,

52
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:02,985
he's going to Chiang Mai.

53
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,185
We're actually planning a graduation trip.

54
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:10,345
Where are all your friends?

55
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,065
Over there, saying goodbye to the girls.

56
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,345
What are those?

57
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:22,785
Are they for everyone in the club?

58
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:25,704
You're more generous than I thought.

59
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:35,505
That's why Tofu looked so familiar.

60
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,024
Because I've seen Neung here.

61
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,905
You've had no contact with him since then?

62
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:41,945
Didn't you even have his Facebook?

63
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:45,024
No, I didn't ask.

64
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,505
That's why

65
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:48,865
you didn't know.

66
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,584
If it weren't for Tofu looking like him,

67
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,305
you would never have known.

68
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,185
You should thank him.

69
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,824
After all that,
we still have no idea who Tofu is.

70
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:02,584
All we know for sure is

71
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,185
he has nothing to do with Neung,

72
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,905
despite them looking identical.

73
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,505
Why are you so chatty?

74
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:11,865
While we were talking,

75
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,505
your friend barely said a word.

76
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,305
You kept going,

77
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:17,625
even though it's none of your business.

78
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,704
Why don't you just insult me?

79
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:22,105
Can I?

80
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:28,625
I have to get going.

81
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,144
I'm meeting my family.

82
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,584
Right. Today is your family day.

83
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,385
You should leave.
I'm going to stay for a bit.

84
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,345
Okay then.

85
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,824
How about I drive you?

86
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,945
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

87
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,144
I can call for a ride.

88
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:44,865
What for? Come with me.

89
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,865
-Let me take you.
-Let go.

90
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:12,625
MR. ANONT TANAKUL
BORN MARCH 1, 1991, DIED APRIL 11, 2009

91
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:22,545
Can you speed up? You're going too slow.

92
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,425
Hold on tight.
I'll get you there in no time.

93
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:31,545
Woah!

94
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,225
Hey.

95
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:43,144
Why did you stop? We're not there yet.

96
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,985
Give me a second. I'm taking an order.

97
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,385
Are you trying to annoy me?

98
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:48,185
Not at all.

99
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:50,425
We're going this way anyway.

100
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:52,225
We're going to pass the shop. See?

101
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:53,985
Let me make some money.

102
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:59,344
Seriously? If you wanted to make money,
why did you bring me with you?

103
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,985
Can't I do both?

104
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,505
You're making me late.
You said you would get me there quickly.

105
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,704
I'm not going with you.

106
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,344
You're in a hurry. I get it.

107
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,144
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

108
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,985
Hey, slow down!

109
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,465
Touch arms.

110
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,225
My arm.

111
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:57,304
Does the teddy bear

112
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,105
mean so much to you?

113
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:01,544
It was a gift from someone special.

114
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:06,505
Neung must have been
a very important person to Nut.

115
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:03,865
What are you doing?

116
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:05,225
We're at a temple.

117
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:07,785
Why did you do that?

118
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:09,665
Let's go home.

119
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,865
When I was a teddy bear,
you liked hugging me.

120
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:20,145
Now that I'm human,
why don't you like it anymore?

121
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:24,544
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you don't like to be hugged.

122
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,265
It's not that, but we're in a temple.

123
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:28,944
What do you mean?

124
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,304
I forgot that you have amnesia.

125
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:37,544
Is hugging in a temple wrong?

126
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:39,865
It's inappropriate.

127
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,225
Can we hug elsewhere?

128
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,625
Yes.

129
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,865
I mean, no.

130
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:48,145
Why would you want to hug me?

131
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:52,745
You were sad. The only thing
I could think of doing was hug you.

132
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,585
You didn't need to do anything.
I'll be fine.

133
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:02,665
Isn't it better
when someone's there for you?

134
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,345
I don't like seeing you sad.

135
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:08,944
Can I help you when you're sad?

136
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:13,944
When I'm with you,

137
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,585
I don't get to be sad.

138
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:17,544
You just give me a headache.

139
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,105
Do you have a headache again?

140
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:20,665
Do you want some medicine?

141
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:26,944
Nut.

142
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:28,745
Nut.

143
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,064
Hey!

144
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:42,145
Here.

145
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:45,824
Hey, wait.

146
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,145
Leaving just like that?

147
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,145
No goodbye?

148
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,304
I didn't ask you to drop me off.

149
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:53,025
But I did drop you off.

150
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,064
What do you want?

151
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:56,665
Do you want money?

152
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:59,025
No, I don't.

153
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,424
I still have the 3,000 baht you gave me.

154
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,424
I'm not a money-grubber.

155
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:09,304
You were nice to me,
so I wanted to return the favor.

156
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:12,745
Then what is it

157
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:14,985
that you want?

158
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,345
Well…

159
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:21,184
I already know your name.
I also have your number.

160
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,585
What about…

161
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,424
Can I--

162
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,705
How about I thank you sincerely?
Is that enough?

163
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:32,505
Now, go away before I kick you
and your bike.

164
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:35,304
Fine, I'll go.

165
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:39,184
Don't enjoy lunch too much.

166
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:40,745
You're getting fat.

167
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:42,145
I'm going.

168
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:51,944
You punk.

169
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,465
Who's fat?

170
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:01,785
-Haven't you been here before?
-No.

171
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,025
That's good.

172
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,704
I'm here, Mom.

173
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,985
Sit down.

174
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:07,865
Why did you order so much?

175
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:09,745
You said you were hungry.

176
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:13,665
Don't enjoy lunch too much.
You're getting fat.

177
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:20,944
Didn't you say you were with Nut?

178
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,345
Why didn't you invite him?

179
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:25,905
I asked, but he's busy.

180
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,385
Busy? He must be on a date.

181
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:30,745
Gen.

182
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:32,505
Your friend beat you to it.

183
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,824
You'll ruin my good name.

184
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:37,944
I told you I could introduce you
to handsome young soldiers,

185
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,025
but you refused.

186
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:39,944
Nice one.

187
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,665
Nut has an errand to run, not a date.

188
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,665
And I told you I could handle this myself.

189
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:45,585
Hey,

190
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:48,465
will I get to meet
your boyfriend before I die?

191
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,865
Why don't you tell me what your type is?

192
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:53,905
Why is it so difficult to find one?

193
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,625
Men in uniform are a no-no.

194
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,105
They're bossy

195
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,785
and they love to nag.

196
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:04,064
-Right, Mom?
-I totally agree.

197
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:06,105
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,665
I'm kidding.

199
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,145
You two are cruel.

200
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:13,824
I don't really have a type.

201
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:16,385
The only condition I have is

202
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:21,385
I won't date someone younger than me.

203
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:22,665
I see.

204
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:33,105
ANEUNG TANAKUL

205
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,064
Who is he?

206
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:38,025
ANEUNG TANAKUL

207
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:38,944
What?

208
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,064
He added me.

209
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:44,145
How did he get my Facebook?

210
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:47,944
Hey, it's me!

211
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:51,225
I accepted the friend request
to Neung from Nut.

212
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:54,505
I know Neung's password.
I was on his profile.

213
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:56,824
I was going through Nut's feed

214
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:58,785
and your name popped up.

215
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,665
Go on. Accept my request.

216
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,385
ANEUNG TANAKUL

217
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:06,865
I know you're thinking of rejecting me.

218
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,145
You're a coward.

219
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:14,985
Why am I dancing to his tune?

220
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,544
ACCEPT

221
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,584
Dad.

222
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:25,985
Why did you press that?

223
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,465
To accept, obviously.

224
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,225
You were hesitating.

225
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,505
I know you.

226
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:34,105
If you really wanted to reject him,
you would have done so in the first place.

227
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,225
You were playing hard to get.

228
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:37,265
I…

229
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:39,985
I was about to hit reject.

230
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:42,544
Why did you press accept?

231
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,785
Let it be. It's done now.

232
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:46,265
Listen.

233
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,184
You said you could handle it yourself.

234
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,544
Does that mean
you've already found someone?

235
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,025
Who's the guy?

236
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:54,385
Mom.

237
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,424
I haven't found anybody.

238
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:58,464
And this guy is no one.

239
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,184
He's just an annoying kid.

240
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,064
He's younger?

241
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,704
Again?

242
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:08,745
Getting what you don't like, I see.

243
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:09,665
Keep eating.

244
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,225
-I'm eating
-Eat up.

245
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,865
I'm eating here.

246
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,424
ANEUNG TANAKUL

247
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,064
Tasty?

248
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:27,265
Not really.

249
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:28,625
I meant the guy.

250
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,105
Dad.

251
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:33,505
I was about to ask if you meant the guy?

252
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:36,785
Dad.

253
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:03,824
Dad.

254
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,464
When did you come back?

255
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:18,264
Just now. I was about to text you.

256
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:20,024
Do you miss Neung?

257
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,545
I think of him all the time.

258
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:28,665
He passed away so suddenly.

259
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:30,744
Who would have known

260
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:33,345
that I would never get to hug him again?

261
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,984
Dad, you can hug me instead.

262
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:45,585
-Come on.
-Hold on.

263
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,185
Why so sentimental?

264
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,225
It doesn't suit you.

265
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:53,984
You started it.

266
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:56,504
Your mood swings get worse with age.

267
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,225
Come again?

268
00:17:58,305 --> 00:17:59,425
What did you just say?

269
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,945
You just got back,
and you're pushing me around.

270
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:05,625
I should call the police to report
domestic violence in this house.

271
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,905
Do you see this badge?

272
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,905
Come here and report it to me.

273
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,385
Sure.

274
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:21,905
Dad.

275
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:25,825
You can hug me anytime.

276
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,984
Whenever you feel like it.
Don't hold back.

277
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:37,865
You're the best, son.

278
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:01,024
Song is using Neung's account.
He accepted your request.

279
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,585
How did Gen know?

280
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,905
If it wasn't Neung…

281
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:06,105
I can't think

282
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,585
of anyone else important
who gave Nut that gift.

283
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:12,984
Are you really not related?

284
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,744
Why do you look like him?

285
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,185
I think Nut only let me stay here

286
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:24,305
because I look like Neung.

287
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,825
Could it be

288
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:30,825
that his soul inhabited the teddy bear,

289
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,705
making Tofu a human?

290
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:36,625
But Tofu is still Tofu.

291
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:39,185
He's not possessed.

292
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:41,905
Little One,

293
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:43,945
stop watching those soap operas.

294
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,225
The plots are cliché,

295
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,024
and full of violence and patriotism.

296
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:52,105
We're talking about Tofu.
Stop changing the subject.

297
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,585
Precisely.

298
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:56,225
It's a waste of brainpower and time.

299
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:58,865
You should learn to let go if possible.

300
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,744
Stop arguing, everyone.

301
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:04,024
I just want to know what I should do next.

302
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,305
If you want my advice,

303
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:09,465
with Neung out of the question,
you should find the next one.

304
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:12,024
I think someone close to Nut
will have an answer

305
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,225
as to why you're like this.

306
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:16,984
Someone close to Nut?

307
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:33,425
Haven't you left yet?

308
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:34,905
No.

309
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:36,264
What's this?

310
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:37,705
Are you still drawing him?

311
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,385
Of course.

312
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,305
My page has gained more followers.

313
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:46,024
If I'm contacted by a sponsor,

314
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,984
I will no longer work
as your graphic designer.

315
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,825
I'm going to become an influencer.

316
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,544
I think you're still drawing him
because you can't get over him.

317
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,465
He's the first person I ever loved.

318
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:01,425
First love, you know?

319
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,385
Your first love is gay?

320
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:04,865
Uncle Juea!

321
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:07,984
As soon as you were rejected,

322
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,105
you've turned to gay romance.

323
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:11,185
How in the world?

324
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,784
It's in my blood. I can't help it.

325
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,185
This new assignment should be
right up your alley then.

326
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,425
What assignment?

327
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,744
The new series.

328
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,465
I sent you the detail ages ago.

329
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,665
I'm sorry, Uncle Juea.

330
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,865
I just got back from Chiang Mai.

331
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:30,744
I haven't had time to go over it.

332
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:33,345
Jeez. You have
no clue about the new series.

333
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,825
Do you know that there's casting
scheduled for tomorrow?

334
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:40,065
Casting?

335
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:43,945
Turn off the lights when you go.

336
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,625
This isn't an action series.

337
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:49,865
It's a gay romance.

338
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:51,465
Get close.

339
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:53,705
Stand like this for a lighting check.

340
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,825
Ya, come here.

341
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:59,024
Their faces look so dark.

342
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,504
This is a gay romance.

343
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:03,665
I need innocent faces. Make them shine.

344
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:04,744
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

345
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,065
Quick.

346
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:11,544
Where's Nut?

347
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,984
I haven't seen him.

348
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:19,225
Definitely. I'm on my way.

349
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,305
Mom, I'm off.

350
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:21,784
Nut, take this…

351
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,024
I'll bring it to him.

352
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:36,225
Nut.

353
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:37,625
Nut.

354
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:40,145
Nut.

355
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:51,945
Where to?

356
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:53,305
Follow that car.

357
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:55,264
No problem. Put on the helmet.

358
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,185
Put it on. Like this.

359
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:03,264
Get on the bike

360
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:04,744
or we'll lose them.

361
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,465
Hurry up.

362
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:13,145
Hey.

363
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:14,865
Sit properly. I can't steer.

364
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:16,744
Am I not sitting properly?

365
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:20,065
Move back. You're squashing me.

366
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,585
This is so fun. It's like a movie.

367
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:35,825
How is it fun?
You're going to make us crash. Sit still.

368
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:39,425
There. Follow that car!

369
00:25:01,305 --> 00:25:02,225
Nut.

370
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:03,305
Nut.

371
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:10,304
Thanks.

372
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:13,024
Hold on.

373
00:25:13,665 --> 00:25:14,504
Pay me first.

374
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:15,905
For what?

375
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:17,264
For the ride.

376
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:19,185
Well…

377
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:21,304
I don't have any money.

378
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,304
I didn't know I needed money.

379
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:26,504
Are you trying to play dumb?

380
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:28,024
Are you playing dumb?

381
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:29,905
-I'm not.
-Well?

382
00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:31,065
Excuse me.

383
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:32,984
What's going on?

384
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,544
This guy refused to pay.

385
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:37,105
Did he?

386
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:39,544
Don't you have any money?

387
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,665
So,

388
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:41,744
why are you here?

389
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:43,304
I came to see Nut.

390
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:45,544
I see.

391
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:47,544
Are you here for the casting?

392
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,504
You better hurry.

393
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:49,504
It's starting soon.

394
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:51,105
I'll take care of it.

395
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:53,185
Thank you.

396
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:54,825
No problem. You better hurry.

397
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:00,385
-How much?
-One hundred and fifty.

398
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:01,865
-One hundred and fifty?
-Yes.

399
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,825
Sorry, Juea.

400
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:13,705
What's wrong?

401
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:18,984
Look at who's casting
for our innocent gay romance.

402
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:20,544
Innocent, my ass.

403
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,145
They look nothing like their photos.

404
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,304
This is just…

405
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:30,945
Come here.

406
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:32,544
Yes?

407
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,865
They're nothing like their photos.

408
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,024
Look at this.

409
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:39,225
Is this really them?

410
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:40,984
These are the photos they sent.

411
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,145
But…

412
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:44,784
Nut.

413
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:48,145
Find other people or we're finished.

414
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:49,225
Yes, sir.

415
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:51,585
What?

416
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,024
He's fair, innocent,

417
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:58,425
and young.

418
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,665
-I'll take him.
-Tofu.

419
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:03,744
-You know him?
-Why are you here?

420
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:04,984
What?

421
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:05,984
I…

422
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,905
-Do you know him?
-Give me a sec.

423
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,105
Who is he?

424
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,865
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?

425
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:23,225
Yes.

426
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:26,145
You forgot your lunchbox.

427
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:28,905
Thanks,

428
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,304
but don't bother next time.

429
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:32,024
It's just food. I can get something.

430
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:34,264
This is not just any lunchbox.

431
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,705
Your mom woke up early to prepare it.

432
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:38,865
You should eat this

433
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:40,544
or she will be sad.

434
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:45,905
Thanks.

435
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,784
Now that you've given it to me,
you should go.

436
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,185
How did you get here?

437
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:55,504
I--

438
00:27:57,145 --> 00:27:59,264
Nut, who is this guy?

439
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:03,185
He's a relative from the province.

440
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,105
He's staying with us for a while.

441
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,425
I forgot something, so he brought it.

442
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:08,984
He's about to leave.

443
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:10,385
Wait.

444
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:14,065
Turn around.

445
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:19,945
Not bad. Come and cast.

446
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,465
Juea.

447
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:22,544
I'm borrowing him.

448
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:26,024
It will be an innocent gay romance.

449
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,024
Awesome.

450
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:29,585
Will you introduce yourself?

451
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:33,345
My name is Tofu.

452
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:41,825
Is that it?

453
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:44,185
Do you want more?

454
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:47,145
Well…

455
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:49,544
Juea.

456
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:51,385
Can I talk to him?

457
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:52,705
Sure.

458
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:56,145
Do you know what's going on here?

459
00:28:57,385 --> 00:29:00,105
Yes. You're looking for an actor, right?

460
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,105
That's right. Do you want to be an actor?

461
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:04,665
Is that why you came in here?

462
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:06,905
If I were an actor,

463
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:09,345
I would play a character, right?

464
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,625
Yes.

465
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,625
If I play a character written by you,

466
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:18,625
I'll get to see you more, won't I?

467
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,665
I'll get to know more about you
through your work.

468
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,665
I can also help you with it.

469
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:31,784
I'll give it a try.

470
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:37,024
Are you two going to talk all day?
We're in a hurry.

471
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:38,544
Damn.

472
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:40,585
Listen.

473
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:43,145
Don't bother introducing yourself.

474
00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:45,504
Just do as I say.

475
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:47,345
Sure.

476
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:48,905
Nut,

477
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:50,345
you can help me.

478
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:53,784
Move closer.

479
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,665
You're not even on screen.

480
00:29:58,504 --> 00:29:59,905
Closer.

481
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:01,465
This is a gay romance series.

482
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:02,705
Closer.

483
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,504
Project your feelings.

484
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:07,425
You love him.

485
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:08,905
Smile.

486
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:15,024
Don't smirk. Look at his face.

487
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:18,225
You love each other. That's good.

488
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:20,544
Closer.

489
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:24,784
Nice.

490
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,264
Very nice.

491
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:34,225
Good.

492
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:40,585
Down.

493
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:45,825
Smile, Tofu.

494
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,264
A sweet smile, Tofu.

495
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:50,984
Sweeter, Tofu.

496
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:52,264
Nut.

497
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:54,064
You smile too.

498
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,825
Move your face closer.

499
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:58,105
Good.

500
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,105
Nut, behave.

501
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,024
Keep your faces close.

502
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,225
Gen, is Nut here today?

503
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:06,945
I'm sure he is.
He has high hopes for this series.

504
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:09,625
Really? I haven't read the synopsis.

505
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,544
His work is always good though.

506
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,425
It even got Uncle Juea to change his mind.

507
00:32:14,504 --> 00:32:16,784
I don't need to read it
to know it would be great.

508
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:21,984
Here.

509
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:24,585
Read it.

510
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:28,385
I wonder if you'll still be a fan
after you've read it.

511
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:30,865
Also, for your sake,

512
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:34,504
I should tell you that the storyline
is based on Nut's life.

513
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:36,665
It's about

514
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:38,504
his first love.

515
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:41,425
His first love?

516
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,385
That's right. Does that hurt?

517
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:45,665
I'm cool.

518
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,945
Everyone has their first love.

519
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:49,905
It's in the past. I'm okay with it.

520
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:53,544
You'll see.

521
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:58,625
The character is in high school.

522
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:01,145
I want you to try this uniform on.

523
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:03,024
Juea wants to see it.

524
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:04,064
Take this.

525
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:09,024
Do I go in there?

526
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:11,304
Yes, why?

527
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:15,385
Please let me handle this.

528
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:22,824
Tofu, will you hurry up and get changed?

529
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,585
Get in. I'll stand guard.

530
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,024
Stop dillydallying.

531
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:36,385
It's a gay love story?

532
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:40,744
Nut…

533
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:43,744
Nut is…

534
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:51,585
Tofu, are you done?

535
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:52,744
Yes, I'm done.

536
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,585
If you're done, come out.

537
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:57,625
Always dillydallying.

538
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,185
Why didn't you put on the pants?

539
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,665
How do I put them on?

540
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:07,465
It's not hard. Put them on, quickly.

541
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,505
Are you done?

542
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:14,304
I've put them on. What next?

543
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:16,545
Pull the zipper up.

544
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,824
Pull the zipper up?

545
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:19,985
Yes. What's so difficult to understand?

546
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:26,185
Tofu, I meant the zipper
on your pants, not the tent.

547
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:31,065
What is it stuck on?

548
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:39,585
How…

549
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:44,585
Oh, my gosh.

550
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,545
Look behind you.

551
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:56,185
Tofu, why aren't you wearing underwear?

552
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:57,424
Go in.

553
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:06,904
Nut.

554
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:10,384
Are you still angry?

555
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,985
I forgot that I should wear underwear.

556
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:16,225
You forgot to wear underwear?
Are you crazy?

557
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:17,904
It slipped my mind.

558
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,025
Your mom didn't tell me about it.

559
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:23,424
My mom probably forgot.

560
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,384
She even forgets about her own stuff.

561
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,305
Is your amnesia so serious

562
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:32,065
that you forgot the basics of living?

563
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:45,424
Tofu.

564
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:46,904
Get down.

565
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:48,545
Come here.

566
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:50,705
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,585
Why did you climb that? You shouldn't.

568
00:35:59,105 --> 00:35:59,985
Tofu.

569
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:02,185
Since you've been at my house,

570
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,505
have you even showered
or brushed your teeth?

571
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:08,665
A little bit.

572
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,745
But I'm not sure if I did it correctly.

573
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,225
I don't remember.

574
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:17,424
Tofu,

575
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:18,424
you're disgusting.

576
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:20,065
Nut.

577
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,465
Nut.

578
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:42,705
Tofu.

579
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,185
Why aren't you coming up?

580
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:47,225
The stairs are moving.

581
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:50,825
Wait there.

582
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,065
Tofu.

583
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:02,864
Why are you going up?

584
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:04,505
I told you to wait.

585
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,665
I couldn't wait.

586
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:16,864
Tofu.

587
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,185
Once you get up, stay put.

588
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:19,145
Don't move.

589
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:22,705
Wait there.

590
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:28,705
Tofu.

591
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,625
I told you to wait.

592
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:39,944
Have you never used an escalator?

593
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:43,464
No, I haven't.

594
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,665
I told you to wait.
Why didn't you do that?

595
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,145
The stairs didn't stop.

596
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,545
The stairs wouldn't stop, but you could.

597
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:41,105
I met a lot of friends.

598
00:38:57,904 --> 00:38:58,864
Friends.

599
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:24,545
Hello.

600
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:28,785
Hello.

601
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:36,705
Tofu.

602
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:38,665
What are you doing?

603
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:49,944
TWO SCOOPS FOR 39 BAHT

604
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,864
In the soap operas I've seen,

605
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,185
the characters always love this.

606
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:05,665
Tofu.

607
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:07,825
Are you a child?

608
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:09,904
Teddy bears and ice cream.

609
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:12,825
Nut.

610
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:14,384
I want to eat some.

611
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:17,705
Gen.

612
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:19,185
Is Nut back yet?

613
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:23,065
No. He said you could go ahead and choose.

614
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,145
He's not fussed.

615
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,145
Not fussed?

616
00:41:25,225 --> 00:41:26,665
I want his opinion.

617
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:28,545
Where is Prib?

618
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,305
I don't know where she went.

619
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:33,585
She just ran off.

620
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,345
My own niece suddenly goes missing.

621
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:37,985
Is anyone working?

622
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:40,305
-I can't contact any of them.
-So?

623
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:42,185
Do you not like any of the others?

624
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:43,464
What about Tofu?

625
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:44,585
He's too naive.

626
00:41:44,665 --> 00:41:48,105
If one day he brings a worm with him,

627
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:49,745
I might puke.

628
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:53,345
Coffee, over here.

629
00:41:58,345 --> 00:41:59,585
Where's my coffee?

630
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:01,745
-My bubble tea.
-Here you are.

631
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:03,105
-You.
-You.

632
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:04,745
Jesus.

633
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:08,384
What is this, reunion day or something?

634
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:10,585
Gen, is he your relative?

635
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:11,585
Relative my…

636
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:12,505
What?

637
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,505
He's just an acquaintance.

638
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:17,305
I see.

639
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:20,825
Come.

640
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:25,025
Excuse me.

641
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,065
Do you have other deliveries to make?

642
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,665
No.

643
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,825
We're casting for a series.

644
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,464
Are you interested in trying out?

645
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:37,785
With that face? Juea will say no.

646
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:41,545
Right now, I would take a dog.

647
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,105
Juea.

648
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,105
What?

649
00:42:44,785 --> 00:42:46,705
What do you say? Are you interested?

650
00:42:52,105 --> 00:42:53,065
Yes, I'm interested.

651
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:53,985
Great.

652
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:55,545
No.

653
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:08,265
Finally, we're here.

654
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:11,145
Go choose some underwear.

655
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:13,185
I'll buy you a dozen pairs.

656
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:15,745
Go on.

657
00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:23,864
Do you think these are too small?

658
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:31,105
Tofu.

659
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:33,384
Those are for girls, you idiot. Come on.

660
00:43:35,464 --> 00:43:37,225
These are for guys.

661
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:39,505
Choose some.

662
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:46,545
But I don't know my size.

663
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,505
Do I have to measure you?

664
00:43:52,785 --> 00:43:54,864
Take these.
Pick the ones you think will fit.

665
00:43:55,345 --> 00:43:56,505
Or ask a salesperson.

666
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,305
Go on. You're wasting time.

667
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:06,944
All right.

668
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:09,904
Since we're here, get some clothes too.

669
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:15,665
No.

670
00:44:23,665 --> 00:44:24,505
Nut.

671
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:29,145
How about this?

672
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:31,545
What's that?

673
00:44:32,305 --> 00:44:33,185
It's a bow.

674
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:34,665
Why do you want that?

675
00:44:43,185 --> 00:44:44,265
I have no words.

676
00:44:48,705 --> 00:44:50,265
Do you remember how to use it?

677
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:51,944
I don't.

678
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,065
I knew it.

679
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:56,625
Look there.

680
00:44:56,705 --> 00:44:57,864
Open your mouth.

681
00:44:58,705 --> 00:44:59,625
Don't bite it.

682
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,424
Brush.

683
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,145
That's right.

684
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:06,984
All the way around.

685
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:10,904
Do you understand?

686
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,145
I understand.

687
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:14,225
Good.

688
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:17,665
Don't move your head. Keep still.

689
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:22,105
Brush like this.

690
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:24,864
Keep still. Up, down.

691
00:45:24,944 --> 00:45:27,745
Then like this.

692
00:45:38,345 --> 00:45:39,225
Here.

693
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:42,424
Is that for me?

694
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:45,785
I'm handing it to you.
Who else would it be for?

695
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,785
You can just call me next time.

696
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:52,065
Don't follow me to work.

697
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,745
I can call you?

698
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:56,904
If you want to call Kuenchai, be my guest.

699
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:58,185
No thanks.

700
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,065
I'll only call you.

701
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:01,864
Even if I'm not with you,

702
00:46:01,944 --> 00:46:03,745
at least, I can hear your voice.

703
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:12,904
Thanks.

704
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:16,705
I spent over 10,000 baht on you today.

705
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:19,225
You'll need to work your ass off
to pay me back.

706
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:21,745
Here you are.

707
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:24,944
Hey.

708
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:26,944
Tofu, stop.

709
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:29,384
Can't you make it work?

710
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:31,545
I've forgotten.

711
00:46:32,025 --> 00:46:34,025
Like this. Tap.

712
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:35,984
Then slide.

713
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:38,105
Now, you can press it, okay?

714
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:41,384
To make a call, go here.

715
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:43,384
I'll add my number.

716
00:46:45,384 --> 00:46:46,424
Give it a try.

717
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:50,785
Good.

718
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:30,025
Hello, Na.

719
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,065
I haven't seen you in ages,

720
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:33,585
even though I live next door.

721
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:34,665
Can I have a word?

722
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:35,984
Come in.

723
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:40,185
I was just at the shopping mall
and I saw Nut.

724
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:42,305
At first, I thought you were with him.

725
00:47:42,384 --> 00:47:43,705
But then I saw

726
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:45,424
that he was with Tofu.

727
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:46,825
Just the two of them.

728
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:48,984
I see.

729
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:52,625
Tofu went to Nut's office this morning
to bring him some stuff.

730
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:56,185
Tofu doesn't know his way around Bangkok.

731
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,665
I guess Nut will bring him home later.

732
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:02,225
They must have gone shopping
on the way home.

733
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:06,384
I see. They really care for each other.

734
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,225
That's normal for people
who live under the same roof.

735
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:13,785
They must care a lot for each other.

736
00:48:13,864 --> 00:48:16,825
I saw them walking hand in hand,

737
00:48:17,585 --> 00:48:19,105
like he's scared of losing Tofu.

738
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:23,145
I'm not trying to make you worry
or anything.

739
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:25,345
I'm just telling you what I saw.

740
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:26,625
If you don't believe me,

741
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:27,825
I have a video clip.

742
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:34,984
You've been by yourself for so many years.

743
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:36,864
Then Nut gets someone to care for you.

744
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:39,904
He seems to really like this one.

745
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:42,384
They seem awfully close.

746
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:48,265
Please excuse me.

747
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:50,864
It's time to feed my dog.

748
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:05,265
Wow.

749
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:06,984
Splendid.

750
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:09,864
Well done, Song.

751
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:13,345
Hey, Pern.

752
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:14,705
Get his number.

753
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,065
I have it already.

754
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,665
Okay. See you later.

755
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:20,145
Thank you very much.

756
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:23,825
I'll get going.

757
00:49:23,904 --> 00:49:25,105
Goodbye.

758
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:26,984
Thank you.

759
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:29,984
Not to crush your dreams,

760
00:49:31,105 --> 00:49:33,065
but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

761
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:36,105
I would stick to food delivery
if I were you.

762
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:38,825
You've taken half a day off.

763
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:42,025
That's income lost, customers lost.

764
00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:45,785
I see.

765
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:47,864
Are you concerned about me?

766
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:52,825
No. I just said that
from the goodness of my heart.

767
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:58,585
If that's the case,

768
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:00,984
then thank you for your goodwill.

769
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:07,185
Now that I have the opportunity,

770
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:10,185
I want to give it a shot.

771
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:12,785
One more thing,

772
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:15,705
I didn't lose any customers.

773
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,025
In fact, I might even gain some.

774
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:23,384
I have to go now.

775
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:25,864
-Bye.
-See you next time.

776
00:50:25,944 --> 00:50:27,545
If you don't get it,

777
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,345
don't forget to deliver our coffee.

778
00:50:29,424 --> 00:50:30,424
I will.

779
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:32,345
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

780
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,025
Stop it.

781
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:39,025
I'm leaving then.

782
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,585
See you soon.

783
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:43,825
No. I don't want to see you. Get lost.

784
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:49,384
Goodbye.

785
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:16,825
What is it, Prib?

786
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:30,145
If Juea finds out that you disappeared
to get drunk,

787
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:31,225
he'll kill you.

788
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:34,305
I'm not in the mood to work.

789
00:51:35,504 --> 00:51:37,625
My heart is broken.

790
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:41,864
You are pranking me, aren't you?

791
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,025
Why didn't I know?

792
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,585
Why did no one tell me that Nut is gay?

793
00:51:48,665 --> 00:51:49,665
Listen, Prib.

794
00:51:50,145 --> 00:51:52,825
That's not something
you can just tell people.

795
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:57,785
You should notice these things yourself.

796
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:00,384
Once you find out about it,
you keep quiet.

797
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:02,545
People don't gossip about that.

798
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:08,105
But Gen…

799
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:11,825
Why did you put all this in here?

800
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,504
Will you eat it all?

801
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:15,705
Here.

802
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:17,904
This is cooked. Eat up.

803
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:20,745
Eat it. This one too.

804
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,745
Heartbreak won't kill you.

805
00:52:26,545 --> 00:52:29,145
Why am I so doomed?

806
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:33,265
Everyone I like is gay.

807
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:40,705
Prib.

808
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:43,105
You are not doomed.

809
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:45,185
You're just dumb.

810
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:47,665
You say you like Nut,

811
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:49,025
but you've never noticed it.

812
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:52,745
Nut doesn't keep it a secret.

813
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:54,065
Whatever he is,

814
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:55,105
he doesn't hide it.

815
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,305
He just doesn't say it explicitly.

816
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:01,504
This thing can change, right?

817
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:03,145
I still have hope, don't I?

818
00:53:05,545 --> 00:53:06,705
Are you insane?

819
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:08,625
It isn't a disease.

820
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:11,785
It doesn't just go away.

821
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:14,864
I know, but I want to give it a try.

822
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:16,825
I'm going to try.

823
00:53:16,904 --> 00:53:19,825
I'll continue flirting with him
until he tells me to stop.

824
00:53:20,384 --> 00:53:24,785
What is it about Nut
that you like so much?

825
00:53:24,864 --> 00:53:26,464
So many things.

826
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:33,065
Hey, is that girl Juea's niece?

827
00:53:33,145 --> 00:53:35,864
Yes. I heard she got a degree
in graphic design from Japan.

828
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,745
He hired her to do CGI on the new film.

829
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:40,944
Isn't it big-budget? Why are they
using a new graduate for the job?

830
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:42,904
Connections. Why else would she be hired?

831
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:49,145
Listen.

832
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,384
In this country,

833
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,904
you can never avoid favoritism completely.

834
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,705
Instead of gossiping about others,

835
00:53:57,345 --> 00:53:59,384
do what you're paid to do.

836
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:01,944
Then they won't have to replace you.

837
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:04,665
If that's all you think about,

838
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,105
you won't go very far.

839
00:54:26,424 --> 00:54:27,345
Here.

840
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,545
Looking to get close, are you?

841
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:44,384
Yes.

842
00:54:45,145 --> 00:54:46,145
Here.

843
00:54:46,225 --> 00:54:47,065
Take this.

844
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:10,225
I'm on my way.

845
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:12,265
I haven't had coffee yet.

846
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:28,825
Is that it?

847
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:33,265
Just that, and now you're in love?

848
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:35,345
So fickle.

849
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:36,424
Exactly.

850
00:55:37,185 --> 00:55:38,225
What the…

851
00:55:39,984 --> 00:55:41,185
You again?

852
00:55:49,585 --> 00:55:53,065
Our fates must be connected.
We've run into each other twice today.

853
00:55:53,825 --> 00:55:54,864
Is this

854
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:56,504
destiny?

855
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:58,105
What?

856
00:55:58,185 --> 00:55:59,705
Destiny, my ass.

857
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:02,785
It's more like Final Destination.

858
00:56:04,185 --> 00:56:06,785
Stop being so corny. I don't want to puke.

859
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:08,705
What are you doing here?

860
00:56:09,545 --> 00:56:11,864
I was delivering food
to a customer nearby.

861
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:13,825
I saw you sitting here, so I came over.

862
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,904
Are you a drug addict? A gambler?

863
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:18,145
Why do you work so much?

864
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:19,984
I'm earning an honest living.

865
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:21,545
Hello?

866
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,585
Can we get back to my problem?

867
00:56:23,665 --> 00:56:25,105
I'm still here.

868
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:28,424
Don't start on your issues yet.

869
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,585
Goodness.

870
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:32,825
Whatever you want to vent,

871
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:33,984
let it all out.

872
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:35,785
Once you're done, I'm leaving.

873
00:56:35,864 --> 00:56:36,944
This kid annoys me.

874
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:39,464
Hey. Why are you being so mean?

875
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:42,105
When I'm with you, my heart is warm.

876
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:45,384
It's like being with an elderly relative.

877
00:56:48,424 --> 00:56:49,705
Please pay attention to me.

878
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:52,424
Please listen to me.

879
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:55,105
What I want to say is,

880
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:57,665
Nut cares about me.

881
00:56:57,745 --> 00:56:58,745
I can tell.

882
00:56:59,305 --> 00:57:01,585
You can tell, can you? Dream on.

883
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:04,145
You're deluding yourself, idiot.

884
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:06,825
I'm not deluding myself.
He really cares about me.

885
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:08,464
That's totally fine.

886
00:57:08,545 --> 00:57:11,625
You should cling to hope.

887
00:57:12,785 --> 00:57:15,105
True love can be conquered with effort.

888
00:57:16,024 --> 00:57:17,864
Good luck. You can do it.

889
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:19,825
Back off.

890
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,145
Back off.

891
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:23,464
Don't encourage her.

892
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:25,785
You'll cause me more problems.

893
00:57:32,305 --> 00:57:33,904
Get your own.

894
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:38,024
Why is he doing this to me?

895
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:39,384
Prib.

896
00:57:40,145 --> 00:57:42,105
See? Now, it's my problem.

897
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,864
-Why?
-Got you.

898
00:57:45,105 --> 00:57:48,024
If your old bones are too weak, step back.
I can handle her.

899
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:52,225
Fine. If you want
to take her yourself, go ahead.

900
00:57:52,944 --> 00:57:54,024
-Whoa.
-Hey.

901
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:38,105
Hey, don't ignore me.

902
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:44,464
Hey.

903
00:58:45,424 --> 00:58:47,625
Don't ignore me.

904
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:50,345
Hang on.

905
00:58:50,984 --> 00:58:52,504
Carry her to the car.

906
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:54,464
I will

907
00:58:55,424 --> 00:58:56,545
drive her home.

908
00:58:58,944 --> 00:58:59,785
Okay?

909
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:02,785
I'm going.

910
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,665
Thank you for buying me all this stuff.

911
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:39,984
I promise

912
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:41,984
I'll use them with care.

913
00:59:42,065 --> 00:59:43,585
I'll keep them in good condition.

914
00:59:44,545 --> 00:59:45,504
I hope so.

915
00:59:45,984 --> 00:59:47,745
When you tried the clothes on,

916
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:48,864
you nearly tore them.

917
00:59:49,705 --> 00:59:50,944
It was still new to me.

918
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:54,105
I've memorized everything you taught me.

919
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:58,185
Showering, brushing my teeth, washing.

920
00:59:59,105 --> 01:00:01,705
I can put on my underwear
and zip myself up now.

921
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:05,904
I'll dress well

922
01:00:06,384 --> 01:00:07,785
and smell good,

923
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:09,384
so you'll like me.

924
01:00:11,464 --> 01:00:14,305
I didn't tell you to do those things
to appease me.

925
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:16,225
But I can't stand

926
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:17,785
seeing you so filthy.

927
01:00:19,504 --> 01:00:21,345
I'll make you like me.

928
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,545
You're giving me a headache.

929
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,745
You have a headache?

930
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:29,105
I'll get you a pill.

931
01:00:45,705 --> 01:00:46,705
Give me that.

932
01:00:55,225 --> 01:00:56,345
Are you back already?

933
01:01:08,105 --> 01:01:09,585
Were you lying the whole time?

934
01:01:11,785 --> 01:01:13,585
You never took the pills.

935
01:01:13,665 --> 01:01:15,145
That's why you're not better.

936
01:01:17,185 --> 01:01:18,345
It has been four years.

937
01:01:19,745 --> 01:01:21,665
You've been like this for four years, Mom.

938
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:26,785
The doctor said I was fine.

939
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,345
Why don't you believe me?

940
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:32,424
Nut noticed that I have trouble sleeping.

941
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:35,024
Sometimes,

942
01:01:35,105 --> 01:01:38,265
I fall asleep on a chair waiting for him
when he comes home late.

943
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,545
He must have been worried

944
01:01:41,145 --> 01:01:42,825
about my health.

945
01:01:45,904 --> 01:01:47,145
Do you think so too?

946
01:01:51,464 --> 01:01:53,504
My son must be right.

947
01:01:54,265 --> 01:01:56,424
When I asked my husband to come with me,

948
01:01:56,904 --> 01:01:58,585
he didn't say anything.

949
01:01:59,984 --> 01:02:02,065
Your son must be worried about you,

950
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:04,944
so he wanted you to see me.

951
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:05,864
Maybe.

952
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:08,424
You were worried too, weren't you?

953
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:12,864
Well,

954
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:17,105
I'll prescribe you some medicine

955
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:19,024
to help you sleep.

956
01:02:19,105 --> 01:02:20,225
Thank you.

957
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:28,145
Mom, if you really are fine,

958
01:02:28,904 --> 01:02:30,464
why did the doctor give you these?

959
01:02:31,424 --> 01:02:32,504
You're sick,

960
01:02:33,345 --> 01:02:35,424
but you refuse to accept it.

961
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,825
Nut noticed that I have trouble sleeping.

962
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:41,345
Sometimes,

963
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,345
I fall asleep on a chair waiting for him
when he comes home late.

964
01:02:45,904 --> 01:02:48,065
He must have been worried about my health.

965
01:02:48,785 --> 01:02:51,105
He said that I have lost weight,

966
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:53,384
that I didn't seem as energetic.

967
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:56,024
Do you think so too?

968
01:03:00,705 --> 01:03:03,145
Your mother has schizophrenia.

969
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:05,065
It's a psychological disorder.

970
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:07,504
Your mother's case is rare.

971
01:03:07,585 --> 01:03:10,585
She experiences auditory
and visual hallucinations,

972
01:03:11,065 --> 01:03:13,345
seeing things that aren't real.

973
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:15,504
What causes it?

974
01:03:16,464 --> 01:03:19,024
It could be genetic.

975
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,065
However, if there's no family history,

976
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:24,145
it might have come from trauma.

977
01:03:24,665 --> 01:03:27,785
Perhaps your mother was mentally frail

978
01:03:27,864 --> 01:03:30,825
and came under intense pressure.

979
01:03:30,904 --> 01:03:33,424
That could have caused this condition.

980
01:03:33,904 --> 01:03:39,265
In the past, has your mother ever suffered
any particularly severe trauma?

981
01:03:40,745 --> 01:03:42,625
She had a tough time when my dad died.

982
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:45,225
She was really upset.

983
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,665
Maybe that's why she sees him.

984
01:03:47,745 --> 01:03:49,424
That could very well be the case.

985
01:03:49,504 --> 01:03:54,665
Your mother's condition is linked
to something that happened in the past.

986
01:03:55,225 --> 01:03:58,544
When the chemicals in the brain
go haywire,

987
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,864
the brain becomes unable
to process everything.

988
01:04:01,345 --> 01:04:04,384
When her subconscious takes over,

989
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:08,825
she thinks she sees
what she feels subconsciously.

990
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:12,665
What can I do, doctor?

991
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:14,384
You don't have to worry.

992
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:17,585
I'll write a prescription for your mother
to take for a few weeks.

993
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:20,065
Her condition should start to improve.

994
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:23,665
I'll make another appointment
and we'll see how she's doing then.

995
01:04:24,585 --> 01:04:25,705
Thank you.

996
01:04:27,424 --> 01:04:28,825
Take these pills.

997
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:31,785
If you forget, call me.

998
01:04:34,145 --> 01:04:35,384
I won't forget.

999
01:04:36,464 --> 01:04:38,944
I'll have your dad remind me. Don't worry.

1000
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:44,585
Mom.

1001
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:46,585
I'm exhausted.

1002
01:04:47,904 --> 01:04:49,225
I'm trying to help you

1003
01:04:50,105 --> 01:04:51,504
to make things better.

1004
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:53,265
Why are you doing this?

1005
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:55,745
You're not helping me at all.

1006
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:08,825
I don't want to take them.

1007
01:05:09,384 --> 01:05:10,585
Why not?

1008
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:20,944
I'm leaving, Mom.

1009
01:05:21,745 --> 01:05:22,665
Don't forget these.

1010
01:05:25,145 --> 01:05:26,544
I won't forget.

1011
01:05:27,225 --> 01:05:31,345
I remember everything,
which pills to take, when, and how many.

1012
01:05:31,904 --> 01:05:34,504
I also remember
that you're coming home late tonight.

1013
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:37,225
Okay then. I'm off to work now.

1014
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:38,944
Take your lunchbox.

1015
01:05:57,705 --> 01:05:58,745
Dad?

1016
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:15,625
Where has he gone? He's never home.

1017
01:06:54,665 --> 01:06:56,345
I don't want to lose your dad.

1018
01:06:58,024 --> 01:07:00,424
If I take the pills, I won't see him.

1019
01:07:06,745 --> 01:07:10,105
Mom, will you stop lying to yourself?

1020
01:07:11,105 --> 01:07:13,065
Dad is no longer with us.

1021
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:15,384
He is dead.

1022
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,745
No.

1023
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,585
Dad is dead, Mom.

1024
01:07:19,145 --> 01:07:22,384
No! He's with me. He's here.

1025
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:25,864
Nut, can you go easy on her?

1026
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:32,305
He is here with me every day.

1027
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:36,345
You don't believe me.

1028
01:07:38,544 --> 01:07:40,024
I won't put up with this.

1029
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,105
If you don't take these pills,

1030
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,665
I'll take you to see the doctor

1031
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:46,984
for an alternative treatment.

1032
01:07:47,065 --> 01:07:48,065
I won't go.

1033
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:49,904
-Yes, you will!
-I won't go!

1034
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:51,185
Yes, you will!

1035
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:54,024
Please calm down, Nut. You're scaring her.

1036
01:07:54,944 --> 01:07:56,785
I won't go.

1037
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:03,785
If you want to stay this way,
then do as you please.

1038
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:06,585
I don't give a damn anymore.

1039
01:09:13,464 --> 01:09:14,945
I'm sorry, Nut.

1040
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:18,105
I can't let go of your dad.

1041
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:27,345
Are you hungry?

1042
01:12:06,585 --> 01:12:07,545
Hello?

1043
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,185
Will you…

1044
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:11,145
Please

1045
01:12:11,865 --> 01:12:14,065
call Matana

1046
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,465
for me.

1047
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:20,505
I'm sorry.

1048
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:22,345
You got the wrong number.

1049
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:26,505
Are you all right?

1050
01:12:28,505 --> 01:12:29,465
Who's calling?

1051
01:12:31,385 --> 01:12:33,225
Madam?

1052
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:34,585
Madam?

1053
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,385
Hurry up.

1054
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:41,985
Quick. I'll go to the other side.

1055
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:42,985
Hurry.

1056
01:12:46,305 --> 01:12:48,505
Go carefully. You drive.

1057
01:12:51,945 --> 01:12:54,624
Thank you again for bringing her here.

1058
01:12:55,185 --> 01:12:56,185
You're welcome.

1059
01:13:05,425 --> 01:13:06,425
Well…

1060
01:13:06,905 --> 01:13:08,185
This is Sibmeun.

1061
01:13:08,744 --> 01:13:10,145
We're twins.

1062
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:12,145
Hello.

1063
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:13,585
Hello.

1064
01:13:14,784 --> 01:13:17,105
When you called, he was with me.

1065
01:13:17,624 --> 01:13:20,425
He helped carry you to the hospital.

1066
01:13:20,505 --> 01:13:22,545
Thank you so much.

1067
01:13:32,185 --> 01:13:33,505
I bought this for you.

1068
01:13:34,385 --> 01:13:36,784
Thank you,

1069
01:13:36,865 --> 01:13:39,825
but we couldn't finish the apples
you bought yesterday.

1070
01:13:40,945 --> 01:13:43,945
My grandmother can't really chew on them.

1071
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:46,664
Na.

1072
01:13:46,744 --> 01:13:50,465
Saen didn't buy them for me.

1073
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:56,744
Hello.

1074
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:02,985
You're awake.

1075
01:14:03,545 --> 01:14:04,465
I am.

1076
01:14:06,065 --> 01:14:07,305
I brought you some apples.

1077
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:11,624
Saen also brought us some apples.

1078
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:18,744
What a coincidence.

1079
01:14:50,145 --> 01:14:51,265
Where are you?

1080
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:52,704
Mrs. Na.

1081
01:14:54,345 --> 01:14:55,545
Where are you?

1082
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,385
Saen?

1083
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,345
Why are there two Mr. Saens?

1084
01:15:22,545 --> 01:15:23,744
You changed the photo.

1085
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:29,305
Yes, I did.

1086
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,345
I saw her with it the other day.

1087
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:33,985
Mom.

1088
01:15:40,865 --> 01:15:42,585
I pretended not to notice.

1089
01:15:43,465 --> 01:15:44,664
I was biding my time.

1090
01:15:48,145 --> 01:15:50,145
How could you do this to me?

1091
01:15:50,225 --> 01:15:52,425
How could you do this to me?

1092
01:15:52,505 --> 01:15:54,225
I could do even more!

1093
01:15:54,945 --> 01:15:56,585
It's time to accept

1094
01:15:56,664 --> 01:15:58,385
that Uncle Saen is not Dad!

1095
01:15:58,465 --> 01:16:02,225
No. You're lying to me. I'm not listening.

1096
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:03,824
Listen to me!

1097
01:16:04,704 --> 01:16:06,225
Uncle Saen is not Dad!

1098
01:16:06,905 --> 01:16:07,865
Do you hear me?

1099
01:16:08,945 --> 01:16:10,865
Which one is your dad then?

1100
01:16:20,065 --> 01:16:20,905
Mom.

1101
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:23,784
Mom.

1102
01:16:24,425 --> 01:16:25,385
Nut.

1103
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:28,624
Mom.

1104
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:32,065
Mom!

1105
01:16:33,425 --> 01:16:34,585
Mom, come out!

1106
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:36,624
Mom!

1107
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,305
-Mrs. Na.
-Mom, come out!

1108
01:16:40,664 --> 01:16:41,505
Mom!

1109
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:44,824
Mom!

1110
01:16:49,704 --> 01:16:50,824
Mom!

1111
01:16:53,145 --> 01:16:53,985
Mom!

1112
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:55,585
Mrs. Na, are you okay?

1113
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:02,265
Come with me.

1114
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:06,905
This is your fault.

1115
01:17:07,704 --> 01:17:08,824
It's all your fault!

1116
01:17:09,385 --> 01:17:11,225
How dare you ask Mom that question?

1117
01:17:12,385 --> 01:17:13,824
Do you realize what you said?

1118
01:17:14,385 --> 01:17:17,145
I only asked which one
was the real Mr. Saen.

1119
01:17:17,225 --> 01:17:18,585
The one that was your dad.

1120
01:17:20,025 --> 01:17:21,664
How dare you ask that question?

1121
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,505
I only have one dad.

1122
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:28,425
Remember, I only have one dad!

1123
01:17:29,784 --> 01:17:31,025
Hey, wait.

1124
01:17:31,664 --> 01:17:33,784
I heard Na screaming. What's going on?

1125
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:34,985
I don't know.

1126
01:17:35,545 --> 01:17:36,465
Whose car is that?

1127
01:17:40,105 --> 01:17:41,704
Excuse me.

1128
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:44,624
I came to see Nut.
Why are you gathering here?

1129
01:17:44,704 --> 01:17:46,345
We…

1130
01:17:46,425 --> 01:17:47,985
Remember, I only have one dad.

1131
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:49,784
-Nut?
-Hey.

1132
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,385
Hold on.

1133
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:54,385
Don't go in.

1134
01:17:54,465 --> 01:17:57,345
Trespassing is under Section 362.

1135
01:17:57,425 --> 01:17:59,505
Trespassing without permission

1136
01:17:59,585 --> 01:18:00,905
can incur a year in jail.

1137
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:02,585
Or a fine of up to 20,000 baht.

1138
01:18:02,664 --> 01:18:04,145
Or both jail time and a fine.

1139
01:18:04,225 --> 01:18:05,345
-Got that?
-Got it?

1140
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:09,305
You shouldn't go in.

1141
01:18:11,704 --> 01:18:13,025
Nut.

1142
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,025
What are you doing?

1143
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:15,145
-Let go!
-What's wrong?

1144
01:18:15,225 --> 01:18:16,664
How dare you?

1145
01:18:16,744 --> 01:18:18,305
Let go of me!

1146
01:18:18,385 --> 01:18:19,345
Let go of me!

1147
01:18:19,425 --> 01:18:20,744
No, I won't.

1148
01:18:21,265 --> 01:18:22,105
What's happening?

1149
01:18:22,185 --> 01:18:23,345
Wait.

1150
01:18:23,425 --> 01:18:26,305
Take him away.
Talking now won't help. Go on.

1151
01:18:26,385 --> 01:18:28,025
-Let me go!
-Take him.

1152
01:18:28,105 --> 01:18:29,185
Let's go upstairs.

1153
01:18:29,265 --> 01:18:31,265
I said let go of me.

1154
01:18:33,784 --> 01:18:36,345
My goodness. Are you hurt?

1155
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,145
Tofu.

1156
01:18:39,225 --> 01:18:41,265
What has gotten into you?

1157
01:18:41,345 --> 01:18:42,945
-Move!
-No.

1158
01:18:43,025 --> 01:18:43,945
Get out of my way!

1159
01:18:44,025 --> 01:18:45,505
Will you calm the hell down?

1160
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:47,425
Calm down.

1161
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:48,744
How can I calm down?

1162
01:18:49,545 --> 01:18:52,585
Didn't you hear? He was insinuating
that my mom had an affair.

1163
01:18:52,664 --> 01:18:53,784
Would you let him off?

1164
01:18:53,865 --> 01:18:55,305
Well, did she?

1165
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:57,545
-You.
-Hit me then.

1166
01:18:58,305 --> 01:19:01,425
If hitting me will help you calm down,
go ahead and do it.

1167
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,025
Go on, hit me.

1168
01:19:12,425 --> 01:19:13,545
If you're so sure

1169
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,345
that your mom is not like that,

1170
01:19:15,824 --> 01:19:17,465
why are you getting so angry?

1171
01:19:18,744 --> 01:19:20,025
Even you, her son,

1172
01:19:20,664 --> 01:19:22,624
have doubts.

1173
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,265
Why are you getting angry with him?

1174
01:19:25,865 --> 01:19:27,025
He has no right

1175
01:19:27,744 --> 01:19:29,585
to question my mom like that.

1176
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:31,865
Who does he think he is

1177
01:19:31,945 --> 01:19:33,744
to poke his nose into our business?

1178
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:37,265
If you had seen

1179
01:19:37,824 --> 01:19:39,624
how my mom went mad after what he said,

1180
01:19:40,505 --> 01:19:41,784
you wouldn't side with him.

1181
01:19:47,465 --> 01:19:50,865
Do you really think it's Tofu's fault
that your mom is like that?

1182
01:19:51,545 --> 01:19:53,025
Isn't it because of you?

1183
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:56,185
You wanted her
to come to terms with the truth,

1184
01:19:56,664 --> 01:19:58,105
that's why you're doing this.

1185
01:20:00,585 --> 01:20:02,345
Before you lay blame on other people,

1186
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:04,505
why don't you ask yourself

1187
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:08,704
who it is that's causing her
the most distress.

1188
01:20:28,145 --> 01:20:29,225
Why?

1189
01:20:32,425 --> 01:20:33,824
If Mom didn't love Dad,

1190
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,345
why did they get married?

1191
01:21:23,985 --> 01:21:25,425
Nut shouldn't have done that.

1192
01:21:25,905 --> 01:21:27,664
You two could have talked it out.

1193
01:21:30,545 --> 01:21:32,385
He's very worried about his mom.

1194
01:21:33,985 --> 01:21:35,425
What actually happened?

1195
01:21:35,905 --> 01:21:38,185
Na seems to be in good health these days.

1196
01:21:38,664 --> 01:21:41,145
What made her scream like that?

1197
01:21:51,985 --> 01:21:53,704
It's because she saw this photo.

1198
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:56,465
I don't understand

1199
01:21:57,305 --> 01:21:59,105
why there are two Mr. Saens.

1200
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:04,985
They're not two Mr. Saens.

1201
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:08,744
If you want to know,
I'll tell you about it.

1202
01:22:21,784 --> 01:22:22,624
Come in.

1203
01:22:41,025 --> 01:22:42,265
Mr. Saen?

1204
01:22:43,185 --> 01:22:44,385
That's right.

1205
01:22:45,704 --> 01:22:48,305
That's Saen, my husband.

1206
01:22:52,145 --> 01:22:53,585
Does that mean--

1207
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:56,265
Na's husband is not Saen.

1208
01:22:56,345 --> 01:22:57,985
He's Sibmeun,

1209
01:22:58,065 --> 01:22:59,945
Saen's identical twin.

1210
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:10,105
These are photos from our wedding.

1211
01:23:21,465 --> 01:23:24,025
I met Saen 30 years ago.

1212
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:27,664
At the time, my father
was expanding his business.

1213
01:23:27,744 --> 01:23:31,265
Saen was an engineer
working on the new factory.

1214
01:23:32,185 --> 01:23:34,545
My father asked me to manage the factory.

1215
01:23:35,305 --> 01:23:36,664
That's how I met him.

1216
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:40,225
Come in.

1217
01:23:43,305 --> 01:23:44,985
You called me. Is something wrong?

1218
01:23:45,784 --> 01:23:47,185
Do you want the plans changed?

1219
01:23:47,824 --> 01:23:49,545
I want to introduce you to someone.

1220
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:52,345
Hello, Mr. Saen.

1221
01:23:54,065 --> 01:23:55,824
My name is Sajjaree.

1222
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:57,425
You can call me Jan.

1223
01:23:57,505 --> 01:23:58,385
Nice to meet you.

1224
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,784
Jan is my daughter.

1225
01:24:01,865 --> 01:24:03,265
She has recently graduated.

1226
01:24:03,824 --> 01:24:06,824
She will manage
the new factory we are building.

1227
01:24:06,905 --> 01:24:08,664
In the future, if you have any issues,

1228
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:10,585
you can contact Jan directly.

1229
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:14,865
My father speaks very highly of you.

1230
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:18,345
I hope to receive
useful guidance from you.

1231
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:19,905
Me too.

1232
01:24:24,145 --> 01:24:27,505
After that, we saw each other every day.

1233
01:24:27,585 --> 01:24:29,465
We were attached at the hip.

1234
01:24:29,545 --> 01:24:31,824
Saen taught me many things.

1235
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:34,265
He gave me advice on all kinds of things.

1236
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:37,824
Maybe because we were so similar.

1237
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:39,385
We shared many interests.

1238
01:24:50,345 --> 01:24:54,824
With us joining forces, it wasn't long
before the factory was built.

1239
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:56,585
Thank you.

1240
01:24:56,664 --> 01:24:59,585
I have many more projects

1241
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:03,185
that I would like you to help with.

1242
01:25:03,664 --> 01:25:04,945
What's going on?

1243
01:25:05,025 --> 01:25:06,664
I'm trying to convince Saen

1244
01:25:06,744 --> 01:25:10,025
to stay on to help us manage the factory.

1245
01:25:11,265 --> 01:25:15,945
The factory is already built.
What else do you want Mr. Saen to do?

1246
01:25:16,505 --> 01:25:17,624
To be a stakeholder.

1247
01:25:20,105 --> 01:25:21,865
Or do you want more?

1248
01:25:26,265 --> 01:25:27,385
To tell you the truth,

1249
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:29,824
if you agree to work for us

1250
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:33,945
I'm willing to pay you
any salary you like.

1251
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:35,585
I admit

1252
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:38,505
that I was quite taken with him.

1253
01:25:39,025 --> 01:25:41,465
Wasn't he dating Mrs. Na at the time?

1254
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:43,585
Yes.

1255
01:25:46,465 --> 01:25:50,145
I wasn't aware that Saen
already had a girlfriend.

1256
01:25:53,185 --> 01:25:54,345
After that,

1257
01:25:54,425 --> 01:25:57,105
Saen resigned from his job

1258
01:25:57,185 --> 01:26:00,385
and took a job
as assistant manager at our factory.

1259
01:26:01,505 --> 01:26:04,545
I always thought he was single.

1260
01:26:05,105 --> 01:26:06,505
I only found out later

1261
01:26:06,585 --> 01:26:08,145
that he was dating Na.

1262
01:26:09,065 --> 01:26:12,105
The first time I met her

1263
01:26:12,824 --> 01:26:15,385
was when I came to Bangkok
for a seminar with Saen.

1264
01:26:24,624 --> 01:26:25,545
Na.

1265
01:26:26,905 --> 01:26:29,865
This is Jan, Mr. Sakon's daughter
that I told you about.

1266
01:26:31,905 --> 01:26:33,545
Jan, this is Na,

1267
01:26:33,624 --> 01:26:34,784
my girlfriend.

1268
01:26:36,305 --> 01:26:38,305
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1269
01:26:38,385 --> 01:26:39,744
A pleasure to meet you too.

1270
01:26:42,505 --> 01:26:43,385
Have you eaten?

1271
01:26:44,225 --> 01:26:45,065
No.

1272
01:26:45,145 --> 01:26:48,905
Na was pretty and very polite.

1273
01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:52,704
While Saen was smart and kind.

1274
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:54,784
They were a perfect match.

1275
01:26:55,265 --> 01:26:59,664
If they had married,
they would have had a happy life.

1276
01:27:01,905 --> 01:27:03,185
Then what happened?

1277
01:27:04,105 --> 01:27:06,545
How come he ended up marrying you?

1278
01:27:07,664 --> 01:27:09,225
You think

1279
01:27:09,305 --> 01:27:11,864
that I stole Saen from Na, don't you?

1280
01:27:12,345 --> 01:27:13,664
I…

1281
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:20,985
This dish

1282
01:27:21,545 --> 01:27:22,744
is really delicious.

1283
01:27:23,624 --> 01:27:25,425
I'm returning this to you.

1284
01:27:26,265 --> 01:27:27,265
What do you mean?

1285
01:27:27,345 --> 01:27:29,025
Why won't Mom accept the truth?

1286
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,025
Some truths

1287
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:33,465
are not easy to accept.

1288
01:27:34,664 --> 01:27:35,905
Na.

1289
01:27:37,225 --> 01:27:38,065
Excuse me.

1290
01:27:38,664 --> 01:27:39,945
Mr. Saen?

1291
01:27:40,025 --> 01:27:42,425
I used to think
that you might be a relative,

1292
01:27:43,185 --> 01:27:44,385
even a sibling.

1293
01:27:44,465 --> 01:27:46,305
But Neung's father doesn't know you.

1294
01:27:47,385 --> 01:27:48,905
So, you're not their family.

1295
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:51,664
If I had a loving father like you,

1296
01:27:51,744 --> 01:27:53,784
my mom and I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

1297
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,025
If we could see the future,

1298
01:27:57,265 --> 01:27:59,465
no one would ever make a mistake.

1299
01:28:56,465 --> 01:29:01,465
