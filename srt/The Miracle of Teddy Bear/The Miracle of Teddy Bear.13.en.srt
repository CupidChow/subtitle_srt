1
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,344
Can you take me to see him?

2
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:10,825
I have to ask him something.

3
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:14,385
Tarn told me
that he wanted Nut to be happy.

4
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:16,065
He wants him to do the job he loves

5
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,705
and be surrounded by good people.

6
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,825
…You meet someone better than me,

7
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,025
someone you are happier with,

8
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:26,064
and isn't a burden like me?

9
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:29,385
Will you leave me for him?

10
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:31,064
Did you bring me here

11
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:33,464
for a particular reason?

12
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,705
Each of us is a unique flower.

13
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:37,904
You are a special flower

14
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,064
that belongs to me.

15
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:43,265
Tofu.

16
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:50,624
I'm glad I get to love you.

17
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,784
If death parts us one day

18
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,624
and a miracle brings us back together,

19
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,624
would we fall in love again?

20
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,865
If I died

21
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,145
and came back as a ghost,

22
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:22,504
would you run from me?

23
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,145
I wouldn't run even if you were ugly.

24
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,105
I see.

25
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:31,825
I should come back all handsome,

26
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,904
so you would fall for me first.

27
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,865
Is something wrong, Nut?

28
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:47,945
I'm fine.

29
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,385
To me,

30
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,064
the fact that we are together

31
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:55,985
is a dream come true.

32
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,585
Luck doesn't come by often.

33
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,145
You are being too modest.

34
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:07,665
I'm being ambitious.

35
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,344
I just don't want us to part ways.

36
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:24,704
What are you doing?

37
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,905
Well, I'm taking a photo as proof.

38
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,505
You promised to love me and only me.

39
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:31,865
Stop it.

40
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,025
Stop it, Tarn.

41
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,625
I'm sorry, Nut.

42
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,905
I didn't know how to tell you.

43
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:20,225
The person you recognized…

44
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:24,704
Was it really Tarn?

45
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,425
Yes.

46
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:35,905
I just found out

47
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:38,024
that Prib knows him too.

48
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,065
We came here together yesterday.

49
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,305
Yesterday?

50
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:51,185
You recognized Tarn.

51
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:54,505
You knew who he was.

52
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:58,545
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,985
And you still asked me those questions.

54
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:17,745
You know,

55
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:21,425
I wasn't delighted at all when you said

56
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:24,704
you recognized him.

57
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,144
I was scared.

58
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,505
I was scared that if I brought you to him,

59
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,065
I would lose you.

60
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:48,264
But if I held you back,

61
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:52,264
you would be hurt.

62
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:08,225
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,865
I hurt your feelings again.

64
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,945
I'm really sorry.

65
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,144
You didn't hurt me.

66
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:35,425
I was just surprised.

67
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:41,824
I thought of him…

68
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,545
but I didn't expect to see him
in that condition.

69
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,425
I didn't think

70
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:58,024
that you guys…

71
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,305
would know each other.

72
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,704
Aren't you happy

73
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,344
to see him again?

74
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:25,985
I never thought

75
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,824
about how I would feel
if I ever saw him again.

76
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,424
But just now,

77
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,144
when I saw him…

78
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:47,705
I realized that he wasn't just…

79
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:53,145
Just on your mind.

80
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,705
You miss him.

81
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,025
Do you still love Tatarn?

82
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,345
I don't know.

83
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:23,985
But I really love you, Tofu.

84
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:36,345
Thank you.

85
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,585
It's really funny.

86
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:56,905
How can the two people I love

87
00:09:58,745 --> 00:09:59,944
know each other?

88
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:06,745
Why did you have to see Tarn?

89
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:12,905
Why do you know each other?

90
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,184
AN OLD STORY RETOLD…
AFTER A LONG WHILE

91
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,824
Tofu told you all about it, didn't he?

92
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,944
I'm sorry

93
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:07,345
for causing trouble
and hurting your and Tofu's feelings.

94
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:13,465
I don't know if a miracle
will happen or not.

95
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,184
All I can do is hope.

96
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:18,905
If a miracle happens,

97
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,225
that would be good.

98
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,265
But if it doesn't…

99
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,184
Do you still love Tatarn?

100
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:53,985
I don't know.

101
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,225
But I really love you, Tofu.

102
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,025
Don't worry about it.

103
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:26,745
They used to date after all.

104
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,345
Nut is just showing his support.

105
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,345
Mr. Saen.

106
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:36,824
Jan.

107
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,304
I can't believe we all know each other.

108
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,064
People say it's a small world.

109
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,585
Everyone is family.

110
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,704
We are either related by blood

111
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:06,265
or by sex.

112
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,585
Stay quiet if you have nothing to say.

113
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,905
I was just making a joke.

114
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:15,385
You came all this way to make a joke.

115
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:17,505
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

116
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,665
Yes, I do.

117
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,824
I went to see Saen
after I collected the rent.

118
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:26,225
If I had known
you wanted to join our trip,

119
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,145
I would have invited you.

120
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:32,424
A trip with me wouldn't be as fun
as a trip with your gay…

121
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:36,225
I mean, your family.

122
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,025
Na must be really happy

123
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,665
that her son

124
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,304
and his friend took her on a trip.

125
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:45,585
Yes.

126
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,585
I was going to visit you with my mom.

127
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,304
You didn't have much time
to talk last time.

128
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,184
You guys get along really well.

129
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:55,704
She would be happy to see you.

130
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:57,704
Right, Tofu?

131
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:00,704
Yes.

132
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:05,704
Why don't you invite Na over for dinner?

133
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:08,025
-We can have a long conversation.
-No.

134
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,785
I'm sure their schedule is packed.

135
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:13,704
Why not? Are you afraid of something?

136
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,505
Don't you want to see an old friend?

137
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:18,865
Sure.

138
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:22,704
It has been a while
since we ate as a family.

139
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:37,865
If you and Tofu hadn't visited Tarn,

140
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,824
we wouldn't be having
a meal together like this.

141
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,145
Did you say Tarn?

142
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,905
Tarn, the guy Tofu recognized,

143
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,665
is Jan's nephew.

144
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:57,465
I don't know how close Tarn and Tofu were.

145
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:58,985
I hope

146
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,785
it is not what I think it is.

147
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:10,785
Everyone.

148
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,265
The food is here.

149
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,584
Let's all eat.

150
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,304
The food here is great.

151
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,865
My dad takes me here often.

152
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,865
Jan, do you happen to know

153
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,865
how close

154
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:26,704
Tarn and I were?

155
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,225
I don't know.

156
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,865
If I had known you,

157
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:39,184
I would have recognized you
from the beginning.

158
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:42,465
Tarn's mouth often got him in trouble,

159
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:43,944
so we weren't really close.

160
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,665
All I remember is

161
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,145
when he was in high school in Bangkok,

162
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,865
he got called into the principal's office.

163
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:54,584
I don't know what happened back then.

164
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,105
But I kind of

165
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,225
have an idea now.

166
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:01,265
I wonder whose toes
he stepped on this time.

167
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:02,704
That person put him in a coma.

168
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,824
We'll have to wait for him to wake up

169
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:09,345
to find out whose toes he stepped on.

170
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:13,584
Tarn wouldn't get involved

171
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,105
for no reason.

172
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,985
You seem to know a lot about him.

173
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,424
You must have been close.

174
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:24,424
If that's true,

175
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,584
I hope someone here doesn't mind.

176
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,944
It's none of your business.

177
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:31,745
Just eat.

178
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:36,865
Tarn and I used to be close.

179
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,505
We were a couple.

180
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:49,985
But right now,

181
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:51,985
Tofu and I

182
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:53,865
are a couple.

183
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:57,905
You finally came out.

184
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:04,105
Actually, I don't feel
the need to announce

185
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,345
what I am

186
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,545
and who I'm dating.

187
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:09,105
But if you really want to know,

188
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:10,545
I can tell you.

189
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,504
It's not something
to be embarrassed about.

190
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,944
We are just like a heterosexual couple.

191
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:20,424
We live in the same house,

192
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:22,105
spend time together,

193
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:24,305
and sleep together.

194
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,705
I think it's more embarrassing

195
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,305
to pretend to have a perfect relationship

196
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,825
when it's far from the truth.

197
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:39,785
I'm surprised

198
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:41,705
at how honest you're being.

199
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,905
The fact that you're okay with this

200
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:48,024
proves you are quite ignorant.

201
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:52,345
That's not true.

202
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,825
The ignorant one

203
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,385
is the person judging other people.

204
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,145
Is it wrong that some people
can't accept it?

205
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:00,545
No, it's not.

206
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,185
Whether someone can accept it or not,

207
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:04,225
it's their problem.

208
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,024
Everyone has rights.

209
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,625
I just realized

210
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:10,345
that you're not just a screenwriter,

211
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:12,665
but you are a human rights activist too.

212
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,705
Anyone can show interest in human rights.

213
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,825
It's up to us whether we care or not.

214
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:23,185
People have been paying attention

215
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,984
to human rights and equality.

216
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,065
You don't have to be an LGBTQ+

217
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:31,625
in order to fight for their rights.

218
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,385
You don't have to be a disabled person

219
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:37,145
in order to fight for their rights.

220
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:39,465
Your voice

221
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:40,984
can help other people.

222
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:45,784
I understand you need principle and reason
to talk to kids these days.

223
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,744
I might be old-fashioned,

224
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,145
but I will try to understand
your point of view.

225
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:51,905
People from my days

226
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:55,264
would call you guys "faggots,"

227
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,225
but people nowadays would probably say

228
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,625
you are just two people in love.

229
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:01,625
A genderless love.

230
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,784
Something like that, right?

231
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,585
Everybody has a gender.

232
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,225
You can be any gender you wish to be.

233
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:13,264
And every gender is equal.

234
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,665
The term "genderless love"

235
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:18,744
might sound romantic to you,

236
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:23,305
but it shows how
you do not accept our identities.

237
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:26,665
Specifying one's gender

238
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:29,105
is a way to show respect.

239
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:34,065
If you still don't get it,

240
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,065
I would be happy to explain it

241
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:37,145
when you are free.

242
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,185
There are many things

243
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:41,185
we need to discuss.

244
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,345
Got it?

245
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,264
Sajjaree.

246
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,225
Stop it, Jan.

247
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:49,865
-What?
-Come with me.

248
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:51,305
What is it?

249
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:01,665
I'm going to the toilet.

250
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,425
I'll go with you.

251
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:07,024
It's okay.

252
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,744
I can go alone. Please enjoy the meal.

253
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:27,585
This family gathering

254
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,585
is so damn heartwarming.

255
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,425
What is it? Let me go.

256
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:41,504
Stop it.

257
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,784
-Listen.
-Let go.

258
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,465
Why did you do that?

259
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,065
Do what?

260
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:51,264
You asked Nut about his personal life

261
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:52,705
and made him uncomfortable.

262
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:54,905
What good did it do?

263
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:56,705
Did it make your life better?

264
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:59,665
-They were rude to me first.
-Stop it.

265
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,105
Don't be silly.

266
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,065
You invited them to scold you.

267
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:05,825
-So why are you upset?
-Saen.

268
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:08,425
Do you think I don't know why you're here?

269
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:11,625
Enough with the stupid jealousy.

270
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:12,784
It's embarrassing.

271
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,145
If you can't do it for your sake,

272
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:18,905
then do it for the sake
of your so-called husband.

273
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:38,345
Aren't you hungry?

274
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:40,305
You keep staring at the food.

275
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,385
We are at a very famous restaurant.

276
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:46,425
We can't just sit here.

277
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:48,625
All right, I'll start the meal.

278
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:51,225
You guys go ahead and eat.

279
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:53,305
I'm going to check on Mom.

280
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:54,825
Nut.

281
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,105
Wait.

282
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:33,984
Nut.

283
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:35,585
Are you still upset with Jan?

284
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:40,825
There's no point in being upset.

285
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:43,945
We can't stop people's thoughts.

286
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:47,984
So let's focus on being happy.

287
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:10,825
I'm sorry

288
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:13,504
about what I said to Jan.

289
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,744
I should have asked you first.

290
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:23,544
But we really are a couple.

291
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,425
Nut.

292
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:40,345
Tofu.

293
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,425
Are you okay?

294
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,185
Do you want to leave?

295
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:51,744
Are you leaving?

296
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:55,825
Yes.

297
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:58,185
This trip must be tiring her out.

298
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,105
I'm taking her back to the hotel.

299
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,585
Do you want to see a doctor?
I can take you.

300
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,425
What's the rush?

301
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:09,625
We haven't finished eating.

302
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:13,385
Jan.

303
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:14,905
Enough.

304
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:16,345
What's wrong?

305
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:17,744
Are you afraid people

306
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,385
might find out about you guys?

307
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,105
Jan.

308
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,105
You are obviously concerned about her.

309
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:26,585
So why hide it?

310
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,905
Since we have many witnesses here,

311
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:31,585
just announce your relationship.

312
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:33,345
What are you saying?

313
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,705
Ask your mom

314
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,264
why your dad used to call you

315
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,905
-a bastard.
-Stop it.

316
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,665
What are you saying?

317
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,984
I'm saying the truth.

318
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:47,544
You are worried about Na and her son.

319
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,825
-Admit you're her lover and his father.
-What?

320
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,544
That's nonsense.

321
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,385
Nonsense?

322
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:55,465
How is it nonsense?

323
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:59,345
What were you guys doing
behind my back then?

324
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:02,065
When she ran here
after fighting with her husband,

325
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:03,945
you came to comfort her.

326
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,425
What was your wife supposed to think?

327
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:01,345
About what Jan said,

328
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,225
is it true?

329
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:17,865
You ran away from the house

330
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,784
to see Uncle Saen
like Dad said, didn't you?

331
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:23,905
Your mom is gone.

332
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:25,385
She's with your dad.

333
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,984
She packed up her bag
and went to see your uncle.

334
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,105
She would never do that.

335
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:32,465
I already checked.

336
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,264
She isn't with her relatives

337
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,585
or her friends.

338
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,465
Who else can she be with, if not Saen?

339
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:46,065
Your mom and your uncle
have been in love for a long time.

340
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,744
Although she's mine,
they've been cheating behind my back.

341
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:54,905
That scum

342
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:56,665
is a weak loser.

343
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,705
That's why his son is such a fragile homo.

344
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:02,945
You are too weak to be my son.

345
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:04,264
You are a bastard.

346
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,705
Did you go to Chiang Mai?

347
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,264
Do you and Uncle Saen
still love each other?

348
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:18,024
Am I really a bastard like Dad said?

349
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,665
Don't say that.

350
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:24,744
It's not what you think.

351
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:30,065
I don't want to.

352
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:33,225
But Dad used to call me that.

353
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,905
He made me feel like I wasn't his child.

354
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,825
The man in her heart

355
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:44,544
is you.

356
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:48,625
It's my fault.

357
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:53,264
Your dad misunderstood because of me.

358
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,984
I left a scar on his heart.

359
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,385
I admit

360
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:02,784
that I couldn't move on from her.

361
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,065
But I respected your mom's decision.

362
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:10,024
I tried to forget about her

363
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,544
because I loved both of them.

364
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,425
Saen.

365
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:26,185
I'm sorry I missed the morning ceremony.

366
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:31,784
Congratulations.

367
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,024
I wish you happiness

368
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:39,465
and to have a baby soon.

369
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:46,105
Thank you.

370
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:53,905
I'm sorry we are late.

371
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:56,264
I hope we are not too late

372
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:59,225
to congratulate both of you.

373
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,905
I watched your mom and Sib from afar

374
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,544
and found out they had you.

375
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:15,665
I thought your mom and I
could never be together ever.

376
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,984
That's why I married Jan.

377
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:25,185
Your dad was very happy
when you were born.

378
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,865
I was happy to hold my nephew too.

379
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:33,185
We became close again.

380
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:36,385
Saen.

381
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:39,385
There, there.

382
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,425
Can you hold him

383
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,345
for a second?

384
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:45,825
I will be back.

385
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:55,064
But little did I know that our closeness

386
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:57,024
was making Sib paranoid.

387
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:11,544
His paranoia destroyed everything.

388
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:13,984
He would turn

389
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:15,945
small issues into a big deal

390
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,304
and connect unrelated stuff.

391
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:22,465
The situation became worse.

392
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:49,625
CONGRATULATIONS. I WISH YOU HAPPINESS.
BEAR ME A NEPHEW SOON. FROM SAEN.

393
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:08,625
What are you doing?

394
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:12,064
Nothing.

395
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:14,504
-Then why were you looking at it?
-Sib.

396
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:16,465
Do you miss him?

397
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,984
Is it that bad to live with me?

398
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:23,544
-I haven't said a word.
-You haven't said a word,

399
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,705
but your actions send a clear message.

400
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:27,945
Don't start a fight.

401
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:31,784
I'm already worried about our son.

402
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:34,425
He's your responsibility.

403
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:37,865
How on earth did you raise him
to be like that?

404
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:40,264
Is it all my fault?

405
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:43,865
Both of us raised him together.

406
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,465
Raising our son is your job, not mine.

407
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,984
My job is to work and earn money.

408
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:51,585
You are the reason he's like this.

409
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:55,145
If it wasn't your fault,

410
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:57,984
I would blame it on his father's DNA.

411
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:01,185
What do you mean?

412
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:02,585
Do you think I don't know

413
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:04,425
that you and Saen are still in love?

414
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:06,185
You guys were rubbing it

415
00:32:06,264 --> 00:32:08,665
in my face.

416
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:10,225
What happens when I'm away?

417
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,824
-Are you saying Saen and I--
-Am I wrong?

418
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:14,544
Every time he visits,

419
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,744
you look happier to see him than me.

420
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:20,465
Is this blanket

421
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:22,304
something to remember him by?

422
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:24,024
No, honey.

423
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:25,145
If I'm wrong,

424
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:27,024
there's no need to keep it then.

425
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:28,824
-No.
-Why do you have it?

426
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,304
-Tell me.
-No.

427
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,385
I shouldn't have married you.

428
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:49,544
Give it to me.

429
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,865
-No.
-What are you doing?

430
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:52,105
-Do you love him?
-What?

431
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:53,705
-Don't do it.
-Do you love him?

432
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:54,824
No.

433
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:55,784
No.

434
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:57,145
Don't do this.

435
00:32:58,264 --> 00:32:59,905
Sib claimed to have loved her.

436
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:01,705
Yet he would hurt

437
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,665
the woman he loved whenever she upset him.

438
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:08,024
How could humans
hurt each other so easily?

439
00:33:10,504 --> 00:33:12,145
Did you fight with Dad…

440
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,225
because of me?

441
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,345
No.

442
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:24,385
It wasn't you.

443
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,905
The problem was between me and your dad.

444
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:34,905
Why did you run away to see Uncle?

445
00:33:37,304 --> 00:33:39,744
I didn't mean to go see him.

446
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,544
I had nowhere to go.

447
00:33:45,185 --> 00:33:46,385
I needed somewhere…

448
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,385
to clear my head.

449
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,185
I didn't expect to see Saen there.

450
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:15,145
Na.

451
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:18,264
Why are you here?

452
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:26,585
Wait.

453
00:34:27,384 --> 00:34:28,625
Did Sib hurt you?

454
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:31,304
What happened?

455
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:36,264
He…

456
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:41,585
He can't accept
the fact that our son is gay.

457
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:47,465
Saen told me on that day

458
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:50,784
that it wasn't anyone's fault

459
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:53,025
being like this.

460
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:57,545
The problem wasn't my bad motherhood.

461
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:00,225
You weren't wrong.

462
00:35:01,864 --> 00:35:03,065
It was just how you were.

463
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:07,785
He told me to love you the way you were.

464
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:23,825
I thought it would be best to pretend
as if nothing happened

465
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,665
to protect our family.

466
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,745
I thought time would heal our situation.

467
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:34,265
But with certain things,

468
00:35:36,265 --> 00:35:37,384
time

469
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:40,065
only makes them worse.

470
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:47,745
If I had been stronger…

471
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,305
and talked to you then…

472
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:58,825
we would have reached an understanding.

473
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:07,185
That's why you stopped visiting.

474
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,505
You avoided problems with Dad…

475
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:12,585
and Jan, didn't you?

476
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:20,025
Love can be destroyed easily

477
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,384
without trust.

478
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,265
I can't blame everything on Jan.

479
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:29,545
It's partly my fault

480
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:33,585
for agreeing to marry her
in return for favors.

481
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,545
Despite everything,

482
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:52,305
you made the right choice

483
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,305
standing up for yourself

484
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,825
and your relationships.

485
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:06,904
Maintaining a stable relationship

486
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:08,065
isn't easy.

487
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,505
As long as you guys are happy,

488
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:12,785
you have my support.

489
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,705
Can't you sleep?

490
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:49,185
You too, right?

491
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,665
Something is on my mind.

492
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,145
What's on your mind, Tofu?

493
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:57,384
Can you tell me?

494
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:09,145
I'm thinking of a way

495
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:11,625
to put you to sleep.

496
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:16,225
You always worry about me.

497
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:19,225
Just worry about yourself.

498
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:22,065
You are all

499
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:24,265
I can think about.

500
00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:30,864
I know

501
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:32,985
that I made you

502
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:35,424
uncomfortable today.

503
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,384
I just couldn't control myself.

504
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:40,785
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:45,625
It's okay.

506
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:49,384
I'm glad you can be yourself

507
00:38:50,384 --> 00:38:52,345
whenever you are with me.

508
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:56,225
If something is troubling you,

509
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:58,424
I'll be the one to ease your mind.

510
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:36,864
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:40,305
I had a long day.

512
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:32,145
TOFU HAS SENT YOU A PHOTO

513
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:34,785
TOFU HAS SENT YOU A PHOTO

514
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:38,145
TOFU

515
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:44,985
TOFU

516
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:26,105
You didn't wake me up.

517
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:33,825
But I knew you couldn't have gone far

518
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:35,904
in your pajamas.

519
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:40,904
Where could I go?

520
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:43,864
I told you

521
00:42:45,225 --> 00:42:46,785
that my heart is yours.

522
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:57,384
I'm sorry

523
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:00,464
for acting silly yesterday.

524
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:05,265
I knew

525
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:07,025
that you were hurt

526
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:09,625
and troubled as well.

527
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:16,625
You are right.

528
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:20,464
I haven't forgotten Tarn.

529
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:28,665
It's like I told you before.

530
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,185
Tarn was my first love.

531
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:34,864
He made me discover who I am

532
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:37,825
and taught me to love myself.

533
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,825
I've been feeling guilty…

534
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,065
about the way we broke up.

535
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:56,105
I was scared

536
00:43:56,944 --> 00:43:58,025
that the person you saw

537
00:43:58,745 --> 00:43:59,904
might be your past lover.

538
00:44:03,105 --> 00:44:04,545
But it's worse.

539
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:07,864
The person you saw

540
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:10,904
turned out to be Tarn.

541
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,864
I'm scared

542
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,785
you might be more than acquaintances.

543
00:44:19,464 --> 00:44:21,105
I want him to get better.

544
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:24,864
But if he gets better

545
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,025
and it turns out

546
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:31,944
that you two used to be lovers,

547
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:39,105
I would be very selfish

548
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:41,185
to keep you with me.

549
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:49,025
You don't want to lose me, do you?

550
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:55,185
Tarn

551
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:57,864
made me discover myself.

552
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,585
But you…

553
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,705
taught me how to love again.

554
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,424
Good people like you and Tarn

555
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,625
shouldn't suffer because of me.

556
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:16,785
It's impossible

557
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:19,585
for me and Tarn

558
00:45:21,225 --> 00:45:22,665
to be an item in the past.

559
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,505
The only person I love

560
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,225
is you.

561
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:35,345
Whether it's him

562
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:37,545
or anyone else,

563
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:41,984
no one can make me as happy as you do.

564
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:52,384
Why are you looking at me like that?

565
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:56,545
I'm glad

566
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,705
you are smiling.

567
00:46:01,745 --> 00:46:02,944
Sometimes, I wonder

568
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:04,904
where you came from.

569
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:08,025
How can you warm my heart this much?

570
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:16,625
Your family raised you well.

571
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:21,505
Who knows,

572
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:24,424
maybe I came from another planet.

573
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,705
Even your mom said

574
00:46:28,545 --> 00:46:30,944
I'm a Little Prince who fell from the sky.

575
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:33,705
You can't believe her.

576
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,424
Although you haven't gotten
your memory back,

577
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,424
don't worry.

578
00:46:48,025 --> 00:46:49,944
I'll help you find your family.

579
00:46:54,864 --> 00:46:56,265
Will you let me stay with you

580
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:00,665
if I don't want to leave?

581
00:47:10,225 --> 00:47:11,665
When you get your memory back,

582
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:16,424
you might be able to get by without me.

583
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:32,665
Don't sulk.

584
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,745
I'll help you.

585
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,265
I'm curious.

586
00:47:39,345 --> 00:47:40,984
If you and Tarn

587
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:42,065
weren't an item,

588
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:45,825
then how were you

589
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:48,065
connected?

590
00:48:41,225 --> 00:48:43,145
If you really knew Tarn,

591
00:48:43,705 --> 00:48:44,944
maybe you came here.

592
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:48,225
Something here

593
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:50,305
might trigger your memory.

594
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:55,665
Let's go inside.

595
00:49:21,984 --> 00:49:24,145
This is the first time
I'm learning about you

596
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:26,545
from your place.

597
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,384
No wonder

598
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:23,864
you've been in Nut's heart all this time.

599
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:54,105
Do you like it?

600
00:50:54,904 --> 00:50:56,065
It's cute.

601
00:50:59,065 --> 00:50:59,944
Like you.

602
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,984
How is it like me?

603
00:51:06,665 --> 00:51:08,025
Well,

604
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:10,305
you're covered in spines,

605
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:12,625
always protecting yourself.

606
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:15,424
You can endure extreme conditions,

607
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:17,785
but deep down,

608
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,825
you need someone to take care of you.

609
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,665
Aren't you afraid

610
00:51:26,504 --> 00:51:27,504
of the spines?

611
00:51:28,745 --> 00:51:29,665
No.

612
00:51:30,745 --> 00:51:31,785
Despite the spines,

613
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:33,545
you're still cute.

614
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:19,825
When I found that photo,

615
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:23,785
I took a picture of it,

616
00:52:23,864 --> 00:52:26,225
hoping to find Tarn's first love.

617
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:33,825
Tarn often told me about his first love,

618
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:36,065
but he never said who it was.

619
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:41,545
Tarn probably didn't want to trouble you.

620
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:46,185
It made Tarn happy

621
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:48,665
to see you happy.

622
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:53,225
What are you doing?

623
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:55,745
Well, I'm taking a photo as proof.

624
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:57,984
You promised to love me and only me.

625
00:52:58,904 --> 00:53:00,585
Stop it.

626
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:07,345
Prib.

627
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:10,585
Can you take me to Tarn's bedroom?

628
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,825
I used to envy you.

629
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:55,185
But I promise to envy you less.

630
00:53:56,265 --> 00:53:57,984
I want you to wake up soon.

631
00:53:59,464 --> 00:54:01,384
I can't bear seeing Nut sad anymore.

632
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:04,785
I'm dying to know

633
00:54:05,424 --> 00:54:07,864
how a teddy bear like me
turned into a human.

634
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,625
Did you say a teddy bear
turned into a human?

635
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,904
Who's talking to me?

636
00:54:24,864 --> 00:54:27,944
Did a teddy bear really turn into a human?

637
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,384
How is that possible?

638
00:54:33,464 --> 00:54:34,625
It's true.

639
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,745
I don't know how it happened.

640
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:41,065
I think it has something
to do with Tatarn.

641
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:43,345
Tarn?

642
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:44,984
Yes.

643
00:54:46,545 --> 00:54:48,785
But he can't tell me anything right now

644
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:51,864
because he was assaulted.

645
00:54:54,585 --> 00:54:56,065
Do you happen to know

646
00:54:56,145 --> 00:54:57,585
what happened to him?

647
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,424
The incident happened here.

648
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:04,745
Here?

649
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:08,384
Did you see the attacker?

650
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:09,984
I didn't see anyone.

651
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:12,225
But I heard Tatarn

652
00:55:12,305 --> 00:55:13,984
arguing with a man.

653
00:55:14,464 --> 00:55:15,864
I'm not going to back down.

654
00:55:27,864 --> 00:55:29,785
I heard a vase shatter.

655
00:55:31,864 --> 00:55:34,545
Then I heard a lot of people
coming inside the house

656
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:37,944
before everything fell quiet.

657
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:43,745
I don't know who they were.

658
00:55:44,464 --> 00:55:46,785
The last person who came
to clean up the scene

659
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:49,065
missed a spot.

660
00:55:52,464 --> 00:55:53,665
What do you mean?

661
00:56:21,384 --> 00:56:22,345
It's from the vase.

662
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:29,025
Did the attacker

663
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:31,145
hit Tatarn in the head with the vase?

664
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:33,625
I'm not sure.

665
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:36,864
But I'm certain that the last person

666
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,864
who came inside

667
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:40,384
was a woman.

668
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:44,145
A woman?

669
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:47,464
Is anyone inside the house?
Come out this instant.

670
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:51,625
It's her.

671
00:56:51,705 --> 00:56:52,665
It was her voice.

672
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:54,864
What did you say?

673
00:56:58,424 --> 00:56:59,464
You…

674
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:00,944
What are you doing here?

675
00:57:01,024 --> 00:57:02,345
Who gave you permission?

676
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:05,825
I did.

677
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:08,825
Saen.

678
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:14,665
Thank you for letting me

679
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:17,705
bring Tofu here, Uncle Saen.

680
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:19,825
You are welcome.

681
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:21,625
Mr. Anik called me.

682
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:24,504
It's a shame we can't help Tofu.

683
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:27,185
There's no link between Tofu and Tatarn.

684
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,984
You made up a theory

685
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:30,984
and came to search someone's house

686
00:57:31,065 --> 00:57:33,105
when the owner's relative
doesn't welcome you.

687
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,185
Why don't you want us here?

688
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:37,145
This house is beautiful.

689
00:57:38,145 --> 00:57:40,065
Are you hiding something from us?

690
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:46,825
This house is full of expensive artwork.

691
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:48,864
I'm Tarn's only relative.

692
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:50,145
With him in the hospital,

693
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,265
Saen and I need
to watch this house for him.

694
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:55,065
I will be held responsible
if anything goes missing.

695
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:58,904
Did you agree to look after it

696
00:57:59,545 --> 00:58:00,625
to offer help

697
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:02,944
or for something in return?

698
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:05,384
Nut.

699
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:08,024
Isn't your mom at the hotel?

700
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,065
You should check on her.

701
00:58:10,145 --> 00:58:11,345
I'll lock up the house.

702
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:12,944
We should go

703
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:14,585
before something goes missing.

704
00:58:15,305 --> 00:58:16,585
Hey.

705
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:19,305
-Listen to her.
-Stop.

706
00:58:23,665 --> 00:58:25,024
Teddy.

707
00:58:26,105 --> 00:58:28,944
The voices I heard that day

708
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:30,745
belong to these two people.

709
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:37,024
You must find Tarn's attackers.

710
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,625
How could you let them inside the house?

711
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:05,705
I had no choice.

712
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:07,984
The officer called to ask for a favor.

713
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,705
I couldn't trigger his suspicion.

714
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:12,625
Did you see the way
they were looking at us?

715
00:59:13,145 --> 00:59:14,024
Do you really think

716
00:59:14,105 --> 00:59:16,504
they came here to get Tofu's memory back?

717
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,625
TATARN KLAIANANT

718
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:45,745
AN ARTIST WHOSE VOICE IS HEARD THROUGH ART

719
00:59:46,825 --> 00:59:48,464
Tarn, the guy Tofu recognized,

720
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:50,185
is Jan's nephew.

721
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:52,825
My name is Tatarn.

722
00:59:53,545 --> 00:59:55,065
I just came back from Japan.

723
00:59:56,105 --> 00:59:57,105
Tatarn…

724
01:00:10,145 --> 01:00:11,024
Mom.

725
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,625
Is something wrong?

726
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:21,185
No.

727
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:26,665
Are you free later?

728
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:30,185
Where do you want to go?

729
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:32,384
I want to visit him.

730
01:01:13,585 --> 01:01:14,705
Who are you here to see?

731
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:16,024
Hello.

732
01:01:17,384 --> 01:01:18,665
I'm here to see Nut.

733
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:22,665
-Thank you.
-No problem.

734
01:01:26,345 --> 01:01:27,984
It's a shame Nut is out of town.

735
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,705
You came here for nothing.

736
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:32,065
It's fine.

737
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:34,904
I thought you were my student.

738
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,105
Are you Nut's friend?

739
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:38,625
Yes.

740
01:01:39,185 --> 01:01:40,745
What's your name?

741
01:01:43,984 --> 01:01:44,825
My name is Tatarn.

742
01:01:46,065 --> 01:01:47,265
I've returned from Japan.

743
01:01:47,345 --> 01:01:49,265
I heard Nut moved here.

744
01:01:49,345 --> 01:01:51,424
I have something to give him.

745
01:01:54,864 --> 01:01:55,705
Here it is.

746
01:01:57,145 --> 01:01:57,984
I drew it myself.

747
01:01:58,065 --> 01:01:59,345
-Really?
-Yes.

748
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:09,185
Wow, it's adorable.

749
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:14,864
IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE BY YOUR SIDE

750
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,825
"It's nice to have someone by your side."

751
01:02:21,065 --> 01:02:21,904
Right, honey?

752
01:02:27,185 --> 01:02:29,345
I'll give this to Nut

753
01:02:29,424 --> 01:02:30,504
when he returns.

754
01:02:31,785 --> 01:02:32,825
Thank you so much.

755
01:02:37,105 --> 01:02:38,024
By the way,

756
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:40,265
are you here alone?

757
01:02:40,345 --> 01:02:42,065
What are you talking about?

758
01:02:42,145 --> 01:02:44,904
I'm here with Nut's father

759
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:46,705
and Kuenchai.

760
01:02:54,745 --> 01:02:55,864
Nut's father?

761
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:03,185
Mom.

762
01:03:05,225 --> 01:03:07,105
Why did you want to see Tarn?

763
01:03:11,424 --> 01:03:12,984
He came to our house.

764
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:19,265
When?

765
01:03:24,545 --> 01:03:26,024
I don't remember.

766
01:03:27,864 --> 01:03:29,944
But it was after we moved
to the new house.

767
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:34,984
He brought

768
01:03:36,305 --> 01:03:37,225
the book…

769
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:41,625
Your favorite book.

770
01:03:43,745 --> 01:03:44,785
He brought it for you.

771
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:50,105
Kuenchai.

772
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:52,384
I've got snacks.

773
01:03:52,464 --> 01:03:53,745
Do you want some?

774
01:03:53,825 --> 01:03:55,065
Do you want some? Come.

775
01:03:55,904 --> 01:03:57,145
Show me a jump.

776
01:03:57,225 --> 01:03:58,145
Jump for me.

777
01:03:58,785 --> 01:04:00,705
Jump!

778
01:04:00,785 --> 01:04:01,785
Jump! Oh, no.

779
01:04:01,864 --> 01:04:03,384
-No.
-Hey.

780
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,305
-Oh, no.
-Gosh.

781
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,625
That was a pounce. Oops.

782
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:33,424
Is this your book?

783
01:04:34,265 --> 01:04:35,105
What?

784
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:36,785
It's yours.

785
01:04:38,585 --> 01:04:39,825
This isn't mine.

786
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,185
It's yours.

787
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:44,105
You should put it away.

788
01:05:06,745 --> 01:05:08,705
THE PERSON WHO ALWAYS LOOKS AT YOU

789
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:12,024
THANK YOU

790
01:05:12,105 --> 01:05:15,065
EVERY DAY WITH YOU

791
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:19,944
I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN OUR DAYS TOGETHER

792
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:24,464
THANK YOU

793
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:47,625
Tarn brought me that book.

794
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:50,145
Why didn't you tell me?

795
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:54,225
You always forget the important stuff.

796
01:05:58,145 --> 01:05:59,265
I've been sick.

797
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:03,345
I don't remember who gave you the book.

798
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:11,424
You weren't around much back then,
so I forgot.

799
01:06:14,024 --> 01:06:15,225
I'm sorry.

800
01:06:16,065 --> 01:06:17,065
Nut.

801
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:22,265
If you leave now,

802
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:25,225
you'll hurt her feelings.

803
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:29,745
Don't you think I'm hurt too?

804
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,904
I know you're hurt as well.

805
01:06:51,785 --> 01:06:52,705
You should know

806
01:06:53,185 --> 01:06:54,864
how disappointed,

807
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:55,984
sad,

808
01:06:56,065 --> 01:06:56,984
and upset I am.

809
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,745
But I'm angrier at my fate than my mom.

810
01:07:03,345 --> 01:07:05,225
How would my life be like

811
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:07,145
if she had told me?

812
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,864
Nut would be really happy

813
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:15,225
to have Tatarn next to him now,

814
01:07:17,225 --> 01:07:18,185
instead of me.

815
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,464
No one knows

816
01:07:21,544 --> 01:07:23,464
whether you would be happy or sad.

817
01:07:24,185 --> 01:07:25,504
You might think

818
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:27,384
that you guys would be together now.

819
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:29,145
But don't forget

820
01:07:29,225 --> 01:07:31,145
your mom was sick,
and she was conservative

821
01:07:31,745 --> 01:07:32,864
two years ago.

822
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:35,625
Your relationship with Tarn
would be a secret

823
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:37,745
unlike your relationship with Tofu now.

824
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:41,345
Tofu.

825
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:45,105
Everything requires good timing.

826
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,464
Two years ago,

827
01:07:47,544 --> 01:07:49,145
Tarn's timing was wrong.

828
01:07:49,225 --> 01:07:50,464
That's why they broke up.

829
01:07:52,464 --> 01:07:53,745
On the other hand,

830
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:56,145
you walked into Nut's life
at the perfect time.

831
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:00,705
But Tatarn is back in the picture now.

832
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:05,504
Is it possible that
this is the right timing

833
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:08,745
for them to reunite?

834
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,185
Being afraid of the future

835
01:08:12,265 --> 01:08:15,745
is as bad as wanting to fix the past.

836
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,305
You should live

837
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:19,504
in the present.

838
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:23,305
You should use the time to worry
about your loved ones' feelings.

839
01:08:24,105 --> 01:08:25,504
You are confusing Tofu

840
01:08:26,225 --> 01:08:29,305
by expressing countless concerns
toward your ex-boyfriend.

841
01:08:52,905 --> 01:08:53,905
I was looking for you.

842
01:08:56,185 --> 01:08:57,584
Me too.

843
01:09:00,544 --> 01:09:01,865
I know

844
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:03,384
it's hard to accept

845
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:06,624
that you had almost crossed paths with him

846
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:09,985
and could have gotten back together,

847
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:14,145
but your sick mom took away the chance.

848
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:18,345
I don't mind the situation.

849
01:09:19,945 --> 01:09:21,225
I'm just regretful.

850
01:09:22,105 --> 01:09:23,624
If I had met him back then,

851
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:25,744
I could have apologized.

852
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:28,384
But now,

853
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:31,384
I might not get a chance to apologize.

854
01:09:32,784 --> 01:09:34,384
He might not wake up

855
01:09:36,865 --> 01:09:38,424
to watch the series I produced.

856
01:09:41,825 --> 01:09:43,744
I'm sure he's going to wake up.

857
01:09:45,065 --> 01:09:46,664
You worked really hard on it.

858
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:48,744
Who knows,

859
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:51,945
a miracle might happen.

860
01:09:58,265 --> 01:09:59,225
Give me a hug.

861
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:10,305
Are you hungry?

862
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:12,704
My stomach didn't growl.

863
01:10:13,385 --> 01:10:14,345
It wasn't mine.

864
01:10:18,145 --> 01:10:19,425
It was mine.

865
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:22,065
-You.
-Hey.

866
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:24,945
Your stomach growled really loud.
Why don't you eat something?

867
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:26,345
Wait.

868
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:28,664
Didn't we just eat?

869
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:33,585
It took a lot of energy to get them

870
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:35,345
to make up.

871
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:37,905
Shall we go eat?

872
01:10:38,825 --> 01:10:39,744
-Yes.
-Let's go.

873
01:10:45,065 --> 01:10:46,105
Let me get my mom.

874
01:10:46,185 --> 01:10:48,145
This meal is on Nut then.

875
01:10:48,225 --> 01:10:51,265
He made up with his boyfriend after all.

876
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:53,585
-Yes!
-Yes!

877
01:10:53,664 --> 01:10:55,065
Yes!

878
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:57,105
-Let's go, Tofu.
-All right.

879
01:10:57,784 --> 01:10:59,945
We're getting a free meal. Let's go.

880
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:01,624
Come on.

881
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:10,865
Mom.

882
01:11:12,624 --> 01:11:13,585
Mom.

883
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:15,225
Let's grab some food.

884
01:11:17,465 --> 01:11:18,385
Mrs. Na.

885
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:23,225
Mom.

886
01:11:27,025 --> 01:11:27,865
Mom.

887
01:11:28,385 --> 01:11:29,585
Let's eat.

888
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:30,624
Mrs. Na.

889
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:37,865
Mom.

890
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,425
Mrs. Na.

891
01:11:43,744 --> 01:11:44,664
Mom.

892
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:49,225
Mom.

893
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:52,825
Nut.

894
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:23,185
-Gen, have you seen my mom?
-What?

895
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:24,945
-Your mom?
-She's missing.

896
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:28,145
Nut.

897
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:31,985
Nut.

898
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:34,105
-I'll check the front.
-Okay.

899
01:12:34,185 --> 01:12:35,065
See you.

900
01:12:35,145 --> 01:12:36,305
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

901
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,145
Have you seen the guest from Room 202?

902
01:12:38,225 --> 01:12:39,744
She's tall and thin.

903
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:40,985
Around 50 years old.

904
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:43,744
She's wearing a blue shirt
with grey pants.

905
01:12:44,704 --> 01:12:47,305
Yes, she left the hotel
about half an hour ago.

906
01:12:47,385 --> 01:12:48,945
Can we help you with anything?

907
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,945
Can you check the security footage?

908
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:52,985
Of course.

909
01:13:05,225 --> 01:13:06,225
How did it go?

910
01:13:06,305 --> 01:13:08,065
She walked out by herself

911
01:13:08,145 --> 01:13:09,545
without her wallet or phone.

912
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:12,185
Where did she go?

913
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:16,265
Maybe she's taking a walk.

914
01:13:18,624 --> 01:13:20,185
Is she that mad at me?

915
01:13:20,265 --> 01:13:22,784
Maybe she wants to be alone
to think things over.

916
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,465
Calm down.

917
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,744
How about we look for her?

918
01:13:27,425 --> 01:13:28,784
I told the hotel to call us

919
01:13:28,865 --> 01:13:30,385
if she comes back.

920
01:13:31,265 --> 01:13:32,664
She just left.

921
01:13:32,744 --> 01:13:34,185
She couldn't have gone far.

922
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:37,065
We should look for her in the city.

923
01:13:38,145 --> 01:13:38,985
Let's go.

924
01:13:39,065 --> 01:13:40,305
Come on.

925
01:13:40,385 --> 01:13:41,225
Come, Tofu.

926
01:16:09,744 --> 01:16:10,624
Excuse me.

927
01:16:11,225 --> 01:16:12,545
Have you seen this woman?

928
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:16,265
Yes, I saw her near the river.

929
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:18,505
Thank you.

930
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:19,425
Let's go, Tofu.

931
01:16:47,385 --> 01:16:48,465
-Mom.
-Mrs. Na.

932
01:16:51,025 --> 01:16:51,985
I'm sorry.

933
01:16:57,545 --> 01:16:58,545
Let's keep going.

934
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:32,505
Excuse me.

935
01:17:32,585 --> 01:17:33,664
I…

936
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:35,145
How can I help you?

937
01:17:36,545 --> 01:17:38,545
I want to go to…

938
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:41,425
Where are you going?

939
01:17:47,585 --> 01:17:49,824
Are you here alone?

940
01:17:51,824 --> 01:17:54,185
Why don't you call a relative
to pick you up?

941
01:17:54,784 --> 01:17:56,545
I didn't bring my phone.

942
01:17:57,664 --> 01:17:58,824
In that case,

943
01:17:58,905 --> 01:18:00,624
shall I take you home?

944
01:18:00,704 --> 01:18:02,025
Where do you live?

945
01:18:09,824 --> 01:18:13,465
Someone brought her here
after finding her near the river.

946
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:16,865
She said she's here
with her son named Nut and Tofu.

947
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:18,985
I thought of you.

948
01:18:20,105 --> 01:18:22,385
I totally forgot about you.

949
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:24,624
Unbelievable.

950
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:26,865
You didn't think of your father
who's a cop.

951
01:18:26,945 --> 01:18:28,545
I didn't know

952
01:18:28,624 --> 01:18:30,545
he was your father.

953
01:18:30,624 --> 01:18:33,425
It's such a small world.

954
01:18:35,145 --> 01:18:36,025
Mom.

955
01:18:36,505 --> 01:18:38,065
How did you end up there?

956
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:43,824
Nut.

957
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:46,545
Why don't we talk at the hotel?

958
01:18:51,824 --> 01:18:52,664
Nut.

959
01:18:53,545 --> 01:18:54,425
Can we talk?

960
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,025
Your mom said

961
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:24,265
she suddenly lost her memory

962
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:26,345
while taking a walk.

963
01:19:27,425 --> 01:19:30,065
She forgot where she was,
so she kept walking.

964
01:19:31,505 --> 01:19:34,985
The person who found her
also said she seemed strange.

965
01:19:35,065 --> 01:19:36,345
She sounded confused.

966
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:38,824
She couldn't answer her.

967
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:42,065
I think something is wrong with her.

968
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:46,465
You should talk to your mom
to see what the problem is.

969
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:52,545
I will, sir.

970
01:19:53,185 --> 01:19:54,025
Thank you so much.

971
01:20:03,945 --> 01:20:05,025
The reason you left…

972
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:08,425
you weren't mad, right?

973
01:20:11,465 --> 01:20:12,985
Was there another reason?

974
01:20:54,105 --> 01:20:55,664
How long has this been happening?

975
01:21:04,945 --> 01:21:06,345
I don't know.

976
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:14,465
I feel strange.

977
01:21:21,305 --> 01:21:22,265
I…

978
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:25,545
I'm getting very forgetful, Nut.

979
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,585
I forget…

980
01:21:35,345 --> 01:21:36,385
what I'm going to do.

981
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:41,465
I forget

982
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:43,945
what I've done.

983
01:21:48,744 --> 01:21:49,945
I forget days.

984
01:21:54,065 --> 01:21:55,385
I forget people's names.

985
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,025
Sometimes, I forget

986
01:22:01,185 --> 01:22:02,865
what I want to say.

987
01:22:11,905 --> 01:22:13,385
I went to see the doctor.

988
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,744
Dr. Kanya examined me.

989
01:22:25,145 --> 01:22:27,505
She said…

990
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,225
I'm showing symptoms of…

991
01:22:35,265 --> 01:22:36,185
Alzheimer's.

992
01:22:45,105 --> 01:22:46,465
I'm sorry, Nut.

993
01:22:52,744 --> 01:22:53,784
It's okay, Mom.

994
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:04,704
The truth is she has been
showing signs for a while.

995
01:24:07,265 --> 01:24:08,744
I didn't think much of them.

996
01:24:11,905 --> 01:24:12,905
These three, please.

997
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:16,704
Didn't I just buy some last week?

998
01:24:17,425 --> 01:24:18,465
Why have we run out?

999
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:22,585
Your mom has been feeding Kuenchai
a lot more often.

1000
01:24:23,065 --> 01:24:24,784
Some days she feeds him several times.

1001
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:31,865
I'm a horrible son.

1002
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:48,385
You've been working hard.

1003
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,985
You've got a lot on your mind.

1004
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:55,664
On the other hand,

1005
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:59,225
it's my job to take care of her.

1006
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:03,345
I've been with her the whole time.

1007
01:25:05,945 --> 01:25:07,664
I saw her abnormalities.

1008
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:18,025
Did I already feed you?

1009
01:25:20,025 --> 01:25:21,865
Kuenchai, come and eat.

1010
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:26,865
You already gave him his food.

1011
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:29,385
Did I?

1012
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:40,865
Are you looking for something?

1013
01:25:40,945 --> 01:25:42,784
I'm looking for the fruit knife.

1014
01:25:43,824 --> 01:25:45,545
I don't know where I put it.

1015
01:25:58,425 --> 01:26:00,225
I didn't suspect a thing.

1016
01:26:06,105 --> 01:26:07,505
I'm sorry, Nut.

1017
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:12,025
Why is this happening?

1018
01:26:15,065 --> 01:26:16,744
Everything was getting better.

1019
01:26:19,265 --> 01:26:21,145
Our family was about to be happy.

1020
01:26:24,704 --> 01:26:26,225
Don't I deserve

1021
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:29,585
to be happy?

1022
01:26:42,465 --> 01:26:43,945
Don't blame yourself.

1023
01:26:46,545 --> 01:26:48,225
No one is to blame here.

1024
01:26:52,744 --> 01:26:54,744
Since your mom is already sick,

1025
01:26:57,624 --> 01:27:00,065
why don't we find a way to help her?

1026
01:27:05,545 --> 01:27:06,864
This disease

1027
01:27:06,945 --> 01:27:08,385
can't be cured.

1028
01:27:10,824 --> 01:27:11,985
Soon…

1029
01:27:14,425 --> 01:27:15,824
she will forget you,

1030
01:27:18,065 --> 01:27:19,265
me,

1031
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,185
and even herself.

1032
01:27:41,305 --> 01:27:42,945
Let's come up with a way

1033
01:27:45,505 --> 01:27:47,265
to take care of her

1034
01:27:50,305 --> 01:27:52,185
before she forgets everything.

1035
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:10,824
Who do you suspect?

1036
01:28:10,905 --> 01:28:12,185
Tofu.

1037
01:28:12,265 --> 01:28:15,664
He could have been in the house that day
and saw the whole thing.

1038
01:28:16,265 --> 01:28:19,704
If you don't want
a twisted, tormented life like mine,

1039
01:28:20,185 --> 01:28:22,025
you'll have to live mindfully.

1040
01:28:23,265 --> 01:28:25,385
Correct your mistakes while you still can.

1041
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:27,545
One person lost his memory.

1042
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,105
Another person is losing hers.

1043
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:33,265
Who knows?

1044
01:28:34,025 --> 01:28:36,105
I might remember something soon.

1045
01:28:39,385 --> 01:28:41,385
You've been doing a great job.

1046
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:46,664
Don't blame yourself.

1047
01:28:49,744 --> 01:28:50,704
You did great.

1048
01:29:46,065 --> 01:29:51,065
