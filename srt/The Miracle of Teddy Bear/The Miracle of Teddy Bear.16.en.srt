1
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:10,705
What do you want?

2
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,945
You should be careful.

3
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,025
With some matters,

4
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,064
the more you know,
the more danger you are in.

5
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:23,464
Was hurting the kid not enough?
You sent someone to shoot the cop.

6
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,344
I was only going to handle that young man.

7
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,745
But you had him transferred here
and alerted the police.

8
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,305
I had to nip it in the bud.

9
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,305
I know about your argument,

10
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,665
about him knowing

11
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,265
that you killed Mr. Sibmeun,

12
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:48,305
That secret should have stayed
between the two of you,

13
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,624
but now it has spread.

14
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:53,705
Do you mean Tatarn?

15
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:59,745
THE END

16
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,225
Is it really the end?

17
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:14,945
I'm really going to miss it.

18
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:20,184
So many things have happened
while writing this screenplay.

19
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:23,105
The best thing, though,

20
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:25,865
was you helping me reconcile with my mom.

21
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,344
Thank you, Tofu.

22
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,464
I'm so pleased.

23
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:37,464
I couldn't have done it alone.

24
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:41,784
That's not true.

25
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:44,224
Even if I wasn't here,

26
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:46,665
you two would still have made up,

27
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:48,985
because you love your mom.

28
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:54,545
I also love you.

29
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:56,745
I love you too.

30
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:58,784
Very much.

31
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:04,464
I was born out of Tatarn's love

32
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:07,145
and Nut's memories.

33
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,224
But I think

34
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:13,624
my identity is also
linked to Nut's desire.

35
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,944
The desire he had to resolve things

36
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,345
with Tatarn

37
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,225
and his mom.

38
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,465
He just never had the courage.

39
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,345
Aren't you sleeping?

40
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,545
I can't sleep.

41
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,105
Humans have it rough.

42
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:39,144
Objects like us never struggle to sleep.

43
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,584
The bear is not the same anymore.

44
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,945
He has evolved
from a simpleminded teddy bear

45
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:51,185
into a fully-fledged human.

46
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,264
Human lives are never simple.

47
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:56,945
It's hard

48
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,385
and tiring.

49
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,465
I'm happy, though.

50
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,985
I got the chance to live as a human

51
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,065
and to love Nut.

52
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,385
When I was a teddy bear,

53
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:20,144
I could only comfort him
when he hugged me.

54
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:24,385
As a human,

55
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,945
I helped him reconcile with his mom

56
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,865
and move on from his painful past.

57
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:40,185
I gave him the courage
to write a screenplay about Tatarn.

58
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:46,105
I think that's more than enough.

59
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:55,305
If I really have to leave now,

60
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,905
I won't be sorry.

61
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,905
Come on, Kuenchai.

62
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,024
We have to take Mrs. Na
to the hospital later.

63
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:13,545
Let's go.

64
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:21,865
Kuenchai.

65
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:26,185
May I help you?

66
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,345
Are you free?

67
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,144
I'm donating some belongings.

68
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,464
Can you give me a hand?

69
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:38,904
What do you say?

70
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,745
Are you so afraid of me
that you won't come?

71
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,665
Let me tell Nut first.

72
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,665
I won't let you go.

73
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:52,305
Are you her servant?

74
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,105
She can do it herself.

75
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:57,824
Calm down, Nut.

76
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:02,225
Jan lives alone.
It's probably hard for her.

77
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,904
It would be nice
if Tofu could lend a hand.

78
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:09,105
We can go alone. Okay?

79
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,545
She asked me for a favor.

80
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,505
Why don't you go with your mom?

81
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,385
Of course. Why not?

82
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:22,745
Right?

83
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,264
Nut.

84
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:28,704
What is it?

85
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:33,424
Drive safely.

86
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,105
Okay.

87
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,505
I'll come straight home after.

88
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:42,144
You should

89
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,024
wait for me here, okay?

90
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,105
You should get going.

91
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,424
When you come back…

92
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,944
I might not be here anymore.

93
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:41,905
Goodbye, Nut.

94
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:50,705
Kuenchai.

95
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:56,025
You don't want me to go either, do you?

96
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:00,944
I've made up my mind, though.

97
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:04,985
All right.

98
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,304
Before I go,

99
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:09,424
let's play together one last time.

100
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,385
Let's play your favorite game.

101
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,025
Goodbye, Kuenchai.

102
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:32,985
I'm here.

103
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:49,785
CASHIER - PRESCRIPTIONS

104
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,105
Do you have an appointment?

105
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:55,824
Yes.

106
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:58,304
Where's Tofu?

107
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,184
He's not here.

108
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,824
He's helping Jan with her stuff at home.

109
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:12,785
I have to go. Please excuse me.

110
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:44,824
Thanks for helping me.

111
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,785
I barely did anything.

112
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:49,824
There wasn't much stuff.

113
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,665
It's better to have a helping hand.

114
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:56,505
Drink this to feel refreshed.

115
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,585
TOFU

116
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,944
TOFU - NHONG

117
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,385
NHONG

118
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,064
-Hello.
-Kuenchai is barking nonstop.

119
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,424
Tofu is not here
and he won't pick up his phone.

120
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,225
Well…

121
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:51,824
I don't know what to do,
so I'm letting you know.

122
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:55,905
-Excuse me, nurse.
-Nut.

123
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:58,544
Take care of Mom for me, Gen.
I'll be right back.

124
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:00,465
Nut!

125
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,625
Aren't you drinking, Tofu?

126
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,665
Do you really want me to drink this?

127
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:11,505
Yes.

128
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:13,304
Why?

129
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,105
Don't you like soft drinks?

130
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,105
Your first name is Sajjaree.

131
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,145
It means truth.

132
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:25,704
What are you trying to say?

133
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,625
You're not telling the truth.

134
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,265
You lied about needing a favor.

135
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:34,785
You knew,

136
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,064
but you came anyway.

137
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:40,544
I wanted to know
what you plan to do to me.

138
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,225
Are you doing all this

139
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,345
because you love Mr. Saen?

140
00:14:57,824 --> 00:14:58,905
What do you mean?

141
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:01,824
Everything you've done…

142
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,665
has been for Mr. Saen…

143
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:08,505
Right?

144
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,865
People will do anything
to protect their loved ones.

145
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,625
You have someone you love.

146
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:19,824
You should understand

147
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:22,304
that it hurts even more

148
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,465
to see your loved ones in pain.

149
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,145
For me,

150
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,665
nothing is more important
than their happiness.

151
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,785
If you were me,

152
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,105
you would have done the same.

153
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,145
I understand.

154
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,385
We all do things for the ones we love.

155
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,544
But you and I are different.

156
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:09,105
My love is based on truth

157
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,985
and righteousness.

158
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:37,385
Nut.

159
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,544
Wish me luck.

160
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,184
I must finish this.

161
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,704
I'm the only one…

162
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,464
who can do this.

163
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,585
It's sweet,

164
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,905
but it's not healthy.

165
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,945
You knew that, but you drank it anyway.

166
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:32,024
What an idiot.

167
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,984
I've been waiting for a miracle,

168
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,425
just like the others are waiting
for one for Tatarn.

169
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,065
Jan finally handed it to me.

170
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,225
Thank you

171
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,305
for making everything easier.

172
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:10,905
Forgive me.

173
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:13,744
I didn't want to do this.

174
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:15,305
It's too painful.

175
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,744
But this is the easiest way.

176
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,425
It's your fault

177
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:24,905
for being stubborn and asking for trouble.

178
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:29,425
If you hadn't tried to force Saen's hand,

179
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:31,905
I wouldn't have been bothered.

180
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,105
I know that Saen
is running out of patience.

181
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,825
That's why I had to step in.

182
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:43,305
Even if all I can do
is get rid of a puny pawn,

183
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,145
it's still better than doing nothing.

184
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:49,784
I understand.

185
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:53,105
I knew this day would eventually come.

186
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:56,145
I shouldn't be alive.

187
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:59,305
It's not fair on Tatarn.

188
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:03,585
Me, Mrs. Na,

189
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,665
you, and Mr. Saen,

190
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:10,945
Our lives have jeopardized Tatarn's.

191
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,945
I can't continue living like this.

192
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,984
Nut once told me,

193
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:25,504
Some use belief as a tool hiding the truth

194
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,225
to serve their purpose.

195
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:30,744
I don't want to be that kind of person.

196
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,625
The thing that Nut and I have…

197
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,465
came from Tatarn.

198
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,905
If I were to stay with Nut

199
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,905
and write our own story

200
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,585
while ignoring Tatarn…

201
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:21,105
I won't leave you alone.

202
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,385
I'll stay with you

203
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,225
until you slip away.

204
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,825
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

205
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:37,385
I know TRD can help me

206
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:39,065
since it would benefit them.

207
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:44,825
That is how this country works.

208
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:49,825
People with power and authority
are above the law.

209
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,545
-What the hell did you do?
-Stop!

210
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,504
What did you do?

211
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,024
I did the same thing you did for Na.

212
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,665
You killed your own brother
for someone you love.

213
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,185
I just did the same thing.

214
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:21,705
I poisoned his drink.

215
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,345
I killed Sib because he deserved it.

216
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:28,585
-Tofu is--
-He deserves it too

217
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:30,625
if he's keeping you from happiness.

218
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:32,145
Are you crazy?

219
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,425
You were crazy too.

220
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,185
You and I aren't so different.

221
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:38,665
We would do anything for those we love,

222
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:41,585
even when they don't love us back.

223
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:44,504
Stop.

224
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,544
Gosh.

225
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,065
What are you doing? Don't!

226
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:50,825
If he survives, you'll be arrested.

227
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:52,625
Then so be it!

228
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:54,225
I'm willing to go to jail!

229
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,465
I can't live like this anymore.

230
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:59,105
You can't do this.
I've done everything for you.

231
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,665
You can't get arrested.

232
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:01,665
-Let go!
-No!

233
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,504
-Don't.
-Tofu!

234
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,905
Tofu.

235
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:09,705
Get up, Tofu.

236
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:11,385
Tofu.

237
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:13,024
Tofu!

238
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:14,984
Tofu, what happened?

239
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,264
Tofu.

240
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:19,825
Tofu!

241
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:36,984
My life as a human was a miracle.

242
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,945
I learned a lot.

243
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:43,345
I got to know the people
and the world around me

244
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:46,504
little by little.

245
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:49,585
Just as Nut once said,

246
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:53,305
"History depends on who's writing it."

247
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,544
Now, I know

248
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:00,065
that a teddy bear like me,

249
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:02,264
even as a human,

250
00:23:02,744 --> 00:23:05,465
could never love Nut deeply enough

251
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,544
to bring about a miracle
like Tatarn's love did.

252
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,504
I just hope

253
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,784
that what I have done

254
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:16,705
has made some sort of difference.

255
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:21,865
Doing that has made my life worthwhile.

256
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,945
Before I go,

257
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:28,345
I remember a quote I once read.

258
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:31,945
"When someone passes on,

259
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,345
people recognize them
for who they really are,

260
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:38,984
as the best version of themselves."

261
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:44,465
I hope that the best version of me

262
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:46,865
remains

263
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:49,825
in everyone's memories.

264
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:42,105
Neung.

265
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:43,945
Is that you?

266
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,225
I'm Tofu.

267
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,345
Have we met before?

268
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,065
It doesn't matter.

269
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:56,504
What matters
is that you brought me to Nut.

270
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,264
Do you know Nut?

271
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:02,945
Thank you

272
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,145
for turning me into who I am

273
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:09,065
and giving me the chance
to spend time with Nut.

274
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:14,945
I don't know if I'll get another chance
to be that happy.

275
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,984
But that one chance

276
00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:20,225
was amazing.

277
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:30,744
Hey.

278
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:32,465
Hey.

279
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:48,625
Time of death, 5:13 p.m.

280
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,504
Nut,

281
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:57,945
I'm sorry that we won't grow old together.

282
00:25:58,465 --> 00:25:59,905
I'm sorry

283
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:03,024
that I won't get to hold you

284
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:06,585
when you're upset
or when you need someone by your side.

285
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,345
I know that you're strong enough.

286
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,385
Your strength

287
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:16,504
is what taught me to be strong.

288
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:19,504
I don't regret my decision.

289
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,984
Even though I'm alone now,

290
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,945
and no one else knows

291
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:26,465
or even understands why I did it,

292
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,225
as long as I understand,

293
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:31,865
isn't that enough?

294
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,145
Thank you

295
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:40,145
for teaching me to stand up
for truth and righteousness.

296
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,504
If we stand up for what's right,

297
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:48,225
there's nothing to fear.

298
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,145
-Are you a relative of Tofu?
-Yes.

299
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:05,065
How is he?

300
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,744
He suffered a cardiac arrest.

301
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,784
We tried our best to save his life.

302
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:13,585
I'm very sorry.

303
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:15,984
Please excuse me.

304
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,705
Tofu!

305
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,585
What happened?

306
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:40,544
What did you do to him?

307
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,185
What did you do?

308
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:45,744
Tell me!

309
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:47,825
I did it.

310
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,105
I'm sorry.

311
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:56,544
Tofu knew too many of my secrets.

312
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,865
Tofu.

313
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,585
Tofu.

314
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:04,945
Hold on.

315
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,105
I'll take you to the hospital.

316
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,465
Tofu. Stay with me.

317
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:11,625
Tofu.

318
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:13,865
Tofu!

319
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:23,665
I never thought someone like Mr. Saen
could hurt anyone,

320
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,225
especially his own family.

321
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:28,304
I hope you're right.

322
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:30,625
You love Mr. Saen a lot, don't you?

323
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:33,024
Maybe because I've always wished

324
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:35,304
he was my dad.

325
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:13,504
You have to tell them what I said.

326
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,105
Tell the police that I planned everything.

327
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:20,105
I was here because I planned to kill Tofu.

328
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,905
I saw the chance
when you asked him to help you,

329
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:25,345
and I poisoned his drink.

330
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:27,504
You didn't know anything about it, okay?

331
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:29,665
You just got caught in the middle.

332
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:33,385
You tried to stop me when you found out,
but it was too late.

333
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:34,385
Do you understand?

334
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:37,905
No. You didn't do it.

335
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,905
None of this

336
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:41,345
was your fault.

337
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:45,225
I'm solely responsible
for everything. Okay?

338
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:47,665
I'll take the rap.

339
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:39,625
I have something to tell you.

340
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:48,225
What is it?

341
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,425
It's about Saen.

342
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,225
I know you can't forgive him.

343
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:08,945
I just want you to know that what he did

344
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:10,945
was meant to protect us.

345
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:14,465
By murdering people?

346
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:22,105
What he did

347
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,705
was partially my fault.

348
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,665
I wasn't strong enough.

349
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,865
I let your dad hurt you.

350
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:38,145
I let him hurt me.

351
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:42,504
Saen!

352
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,585
I told you not to come here again.

353
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,945
I wouldn't have to come

354
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,264
if you didn't hurt your family.

355
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:52,705
Saen.

356
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,145
What?

357
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,024
What did she tell you now?

358
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:58,744
She didn't have to.

359
00:31:58,824 --> 00:32:01,504
I've seen with my own eyes
the terrible things you've done.

360
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,185
So what?

361
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,425
They're my family.

362
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:08,264
They're not yours. Why do you care?

363
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:10,264
Have you forgotten?

364
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,185
Before she became your family,
she almost became mine.

365
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:24,064
You have her.
Why can't you take care of her?

366
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:27,585
How dare you call yourself
a husband and a father.

367
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,544
Do you think

368
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,544
a loser like you could take care of her?

369
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:34,945
Don't do it, Saen.

370
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:36,225
You should leave.

371
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:38,625
I won't stand idly by

372
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:40,665
if I ever find out you hurt them again.

373
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:45,744
It wasn't just him hurting me.

374
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:51,105
I hurt him too.

375
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,544
Why?

376
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:56,625
Why?

377
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:01,064
I love Na too.

378
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,465
I'm no less devoted to her.

379
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,425
What's so bad about me?

380
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:17,544
Why does Na love a loser like you so much?

381
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:25,984
She never even tells me she loves me.

382
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,865
Why?

383
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,105
Why?

384
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:34,585
Not getting to be with the one you love

385
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:41,304
is no worse
than being with someone you love,

386
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,784
but who doesn't love you back.

387
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:50,304
THE LITTLE PRINCE

388
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,225
That one is old,

389
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:57,905
so I bought you a new one.

390
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:04,304
THE LITTLE PRINCE

391
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:07,064
They say

392
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,505
if you read The Little Prince
at different stages of life,

393
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:13,744
your interpretation changes.

394
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:21,225
I hope we get another chance
to read this together.

395
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:42,145
It was the turning point

396
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,264
that made me realize.

397
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:47,145
I decided to tell him I love him.

398
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:52,545
I've never loved Sib
the way a wife should love her husband.

399
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:57,705
From now on,
I've decided to be a good wife

400
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,745
and mother to my family.

401
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:05,904
Don't worry about me anymore.

402
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,705
I'll become stronger

403
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,904
for my family's sake.

404
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:14,625
I'm glad

405
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:16,465
that you're stronger.

406
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,265
I hope you're happy.

407
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:30,265
If you ever need a friend,

408
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:33,424
you can always let me know.

409
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:35,505
Thank you.

410
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,065
Saen!

411
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:47,825
What's the matter with you?

412
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:51,825
I should ask you why you keep
coming over to see my wife!

413
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:53,105
It's not what you think.

414
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,665
So what is it?

415
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,465
Do you dress up,

416
00:35:57,545 --> 00:36:00,345
clean the house, and cook for me?

417
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,265
How can you do this?

418
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:04,585
Your husband is lying sick upstairs,

419
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:07,705
and you're having an affair in our house.

420
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:09,105
How could you do it?

421
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,785
What are you saying?

422
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:13,065
You--

423
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:14,785
Oh, no.

424
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:17,585
Honey, don't.

425
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:19,345
Don't--

426
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:20,785
Na!

427
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:24,145
How dare you hurt her in front of me!

428
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:31,545
Honey.

429
00:36:32,785 --> 00:36:34,265
Let go.

430
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:36,585
Don't. Please don't fight.

431
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:39,185
He's very sick.
You should calm down and leave.

432
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:42,025
Okay? Sit down over there.

433
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:45,585
I'll get your medicine.

434
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:46,825
Don't.

435
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:48,985
I'll get it.

436
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:51,185
You should talk to him.

437
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:53,065
I'll get the medicine.

438
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:54,625
Where is it?

439
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:56,825
It's in the bedroom, by the bed.

440
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:55,825
Honey.

441
00:37:58,785 --> 00:37:59,785
What happened?

442
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:04,464
Did he take the medicine?

443
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:12,345
This isn't his medicine.

444
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:15,665
Honey.

445
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:17,705
Please stay strong.

446
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,185
How could you do this?

447
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:26,985
You can see he hasn't changed.

448
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:30,384
He even hurt you in front of me.

449
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:32,545
Without him,

450
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:35,904
you and Nut can be happy.

451
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:44,225
I can't let him die like this.

452
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:46,864
No, please stay with me.

453
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:49,145
Stay with me.

454
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,345
It was too late.

455
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:55,145
We took Dad to the hospital,

456
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:58,785
but it was too late.

457
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,625
I didn't know what to do.

458
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:06,265
I couldn't tell anyone.

459
00:39:07,785 --> 00:39:09,785
I was afraid.

460
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:19,384
The truth…

461
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,665
might upset you,

462
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:30,305
but I want to tell you everything…

463
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:34,345
while I still can.

464
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:41,665
I'm sorry.

465
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:40,424
I know you're lonely.

466
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:45,345
I won't let you be.

467
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:11,505
I wake up to see the happy face

468
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:15,545
Of the person in my heart

469
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:21,904
Why can't I forget this person's face?

470
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:27,185
Why is he so memorable?

471
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,145
It's strange

472
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:31,625
To think

473
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:37,825
Of those lost memories

474
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:39,785
Of beautiful

475
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:45,545
Days and nights

476
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:55,185
However much I cry

477
00:41:56,225 --> 00:42:00,505
I think about you

478
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:04,705
And the days

479
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:07,825
When you were with me

480
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:12,065
In the end
We still have to part ways

481
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:25,825
This…

482
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:32,944
This place means so much to me

483
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:36,105
And I have so many

484
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:39,464
Memories

485
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:45,424
Please stay here with me

486
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:50,185
There will be another day for us

487
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,424
A day when we will be together

488
00:42:58,265 --> 00:43:00,225
Again

489
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:11,105
Tofu.

490
00:43:15,265 --> 00:43:18,505
I don't know if I can be strong
like you wanted me to.

491
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:27,424
After everything that has happened
with my family,

492
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:35,225
I don't know if I can get through it
without you.

493
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:47,904
I don't know what will happen to me.

494
00:43:54,904 --> 00:43:57,225
I really want you here with me.

495
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,545
But I know…

496
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:08,424
that's not possible.

497
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:33,864
It's like I'm cursed.

498
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:37,345
The good things in my life

499
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,424
are short-lived.

500
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:44,705
In the end, they all leave.

501
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:49,345
My mom's memories,

502
00:45:50,944 --> 00:45:52,904
my trusted uncle,

503
00:45:56,864 --> 00:45:58,105
and you.

504
00:46:02,105 --> 00:46:04,384
I was afraid
that you wouldn't stick around,

505
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:08,225
and it turned out to be true.

506
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:12,225
I can't believe

507
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:14,345
that you're really gone.

508
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:19,145
I guess that's what life is like.

509
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:23,944
We all die in the end.

510
00:46:25,145 --> 00:46:27,665
We may stop breathing when we die,

511
00:46:30,145 --> 00:46:32,305
but memories never disappear.

512
00:46:33,145 --> 00:46:35,545
No matter how hard it is to say goodbye,

513
00:46:36,345 --> 00:46:38,345
we still have to move on.

514
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:41,384
The memories

515
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:43,665
will always stay in our hearts.

516
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:48,065
Memories also make us realize

517
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:50,745
that we're not alone in this world.

518
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:55,745
There are many people waiting for us.

519
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:06,785
They're waiting for us

520
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:09,065
to be a family again.

521
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:12,265
About Gen and me,

522
00:47:14,384 --> 00:47:16,864
you may not agree with it,

523
00:47:17,424 --> 00:47:19,625
but we won't just give up.

524
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:24,185
I want you to know

525
00:47:24,265 --> 00:47:26,105
that we are serious about each other.

526
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,265
We'll love each other whatever happens.

527
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:33,265
I'm sorry if I upset you.

528
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:36,745
I've actually known for a while.

529
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,825
Since the day I visited you on set.

530
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,345
-You knew?
-Yes.

531
00:47:44,305 --> 00:47:46,145
I didn't know what to do then.

532
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:48,864
I didn't know how to handle it.

533
00:47:49,505 --> 00:47:52,585
I never thought my son would like men.

534
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:57,145
It doesn't mean
that I can't accept it, though.

535
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:00,665
I was just worried.

536
00:48:06,464 --> 00:48:08,904
Now, I know that I don't have to be.

537
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,864
I can see you're happy
that you've found each other.

538
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:17,145
I can tell that you two
can take care of each other.

539
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:20,904
If it makes you happy, then be together.

540
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:26,785
Thank you.

541
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:32,025
I know that I'm not such a great dad.

542
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:37,305
My words might have hurt you in the past.

543
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:39,225
I'm sorry.

544
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,505
I'm sorry too.

545
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:50,145
We're both sorry.

546
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:52,864
Because we love each other, right?

547
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:10,705
Now, Song and Gen are a family.

548
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:13,825
It might not be a regular family,

549
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:16,065
but it's a very big one.

550
00:49:18,785 --> 00:49:20,464
So big that when you see them,

551
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:22,984
you would be happy for them too.

552
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:32,904
As for Tarn and me,

553
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,345
we got to meet again.

554
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:38,105
Tarn.

555
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:41,105
-I--
-I missed you.

556
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:46,025
I really missed you, you know?

557
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:49,145
You were right.

558
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:51,305
I did miss him.

559
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:55,864
But that doesn't mean I didn't love you.

560
00:49:58,384 --> 00:49:59,705
I miss you.

561
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,225
I miss your voice.

562
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:04,785
I miss your hugs

563
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:07,785
and your kisses.

564
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:10,984
Don't be afraid that I'll stop loving you.

565
00:50:12,424 --> 00:50:16,065
I know it hurt
that you couldn't compete with Tarn,

566
00:50:17,025 --> 00:50:18,665
that you couldn't help financially,

567
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:20,864
that you weren't popular like him.

568
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:24,305
But those things don't mean anything,

569
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:27,025
because who you are

570
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,025
is what made me love you.

571
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:34,864
Tarn showed me the reality of this world,

572
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:39,424
while you showed me the beauty in it.

573
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:42,705
I really wonder

574
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:45,265
where you came from.

575
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:49,504
If you really fell from the sky
like Mom said,

576
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,904
which galaxy are you from?

577
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:55,944
It's probably really far from my universe.

578
00:50:56,665 --> 00:51:00,105
Your mothership must have taken you back

579
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:02,984
to your place of happiness.

580
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:07,025
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

581
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:11,185
You had to live
with my dysfunctional family.

582
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:14,545
If it were possible,

583
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:18,185
I would forsake having ever met you,

584
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:22,904
if it meant you would have a better life,

585
00:51:23,984 --> 00:51:25,984
so you didn't have to meet me

586
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:29,105
and end the way it did.

587
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:39,984
My first boys' love series was released.

588
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,305
How is it?

589
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:43,545
I think you know.

590
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,705
I'm still my crazy self

591
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:46,864
writing love stories,

592
00:51:46,944 --> 00:51:50,384
but with political issues snuck in
and complicated storylines.

593
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:53,305
The reviews weren't as good
as Juea expected.

594
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:57,944
People still talk about it, though.

595
00:51:58,025 --> 00:52:01,145
A lot of people preferred
my complicated story

596
00:52:01,225 --> 00:52:03,105
to the usual lovey-dovey romance.

597
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:05,625
Song has so many fans now.

598
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:09,984
Gen had to step in as his manager.

599
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:12,625
It didn't turn out as well as you wished,

600
00:52:12,705 --> 00:52:14,665
but I'm happy that I wrote it.

601
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:16,025
Most importantly,

602
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:17,825
the person I wanted to show it to

603
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:19,345
got to see it.

604
00:52:21,065 --> 00:52:23,185
I love you, Tofu.

605
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:27,025
I have no doubt that anyone
who got to know you

606
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:29,145
would love you too.

607
00:52:29,225 --> 00:52:32,785
Thank you for always holding my hand

608
00:52:33,265 --> 00:52:34,665
and not thinking I was weird.

609
00:52:35,305 --> 00:52:37,785
You will always be a gift to me.

610
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:40,185
I wish you were here,

611
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:43,105
so you could live these stories
along with me.

612
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:45,145
I miss you.

613
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,545
Love from me.

614
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:56,384
I do know, though.

615
00:52:57,265 --> 00:52:58,384
I know everything

616
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,745
because I'm back.

617
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:16,665
You're probably wondering how I came back.

618
00:53:17,384 --> 00:53:19,785
It happened that day.

619
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,145
It wasn't just Tatarn
who received a miracle.

620
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:24,785
I did too.

621
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:00,185
I returned to my body…

622
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:03,545
just before I was…

623
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:05,424
cremated.

624
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:15,944
I don't know
how the miracle happened again.

625
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:18,345
I don't know if my waking up

626
00:54:19,504 --> 00:54:21,585
affected Tatarn in any way.

627
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:24,384
All I knew at that moment

628
00:54:24,864 --> 00:54:26,424
was I had to escape.

629
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:28,864
I wanted to go back to Nut.

630
00:55:29,305 --> 00:55:33,464
When will these dogs
stop targeting bears like me.

631
00:55:39,384 --> 00:55:40,545
Let's go.

632
00:55:44,025 --> 00:55:44,864
Gosh.

633
00:55:45,944 --> 00:55:47,705
Why is he so fast?

634
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,504
When will you stop?

635
00:55:59,545 --> 00:56:00,864
Wait a minute.

636
00:56:22,025 --> 00:56:23,185
What?

637
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:35,944
Ms. Left Slipper.

638
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,785
Why are you here?

639
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:46,025
Wait. It's coming back.

640
00:56:47,225 --> 00:56:49,545
Let's go, Ms. Left Slipper.

641
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:53,545
Can you tell me

642
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:56,065
how you ended up here?

643
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,024
After you lost me that day,

644
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,145
I was brought here.

645
00:57:07,944 --> 00:57:10,625
I thought nobody would find me,

646
00:57:10,705 --> 00:57:12,225
so I came to terms with it.

647
00:57:14,984 --> 00:57:17,225
It must have been hard out here.

648
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,705
I'm sorry.

649
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:21,585
Don't be.

650
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:24,625
It was no one's fault.

651
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:27,225
It's not easy to survive out here,

652
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,225
but I learned a lot.

653
00:57:31,065 --> 00:57:35,384
It made me prouder of myself
than when I was home.

654
00:57:35,904 --> 00:57:37,065
I know.

655
00:57:37,545 --> 00:57:38,785
At home,

656
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:41,745
you barely got to be yourself.

657
00:57:42,825 --> 00:57:46,225
Mr. Right Slipper really misses you.

658
00:57:47,105 --> 00:57:49,504
We all do.

659
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:52,024
I miss him too.

660
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:55,105
But look at me now.

661
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:57,545
Nobody will want me, even if I go back.

662
00:57:58,305 --> 00:57:59,745
Hasn't Mrs. Na

663
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:02,545
thrown him away?

664
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:04,864
Not yet.

665
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:06,864
I saved him for you.

666
00:58:07,424 --> 00:58:10,944
He was really sad that you disappeared,
so he went to sleep.

667
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:15,265
Maybe he'll wake up if you go home.

668
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:17,545
Let's go home together.

669
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:27,024
Were there really no remains?

670
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:28,825
Yes.

671
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:30,504
I was surprised too.

672
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:48,984
Right.

673
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:53,864
I found this by the crematorium door.

674
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,625
Does it belong to the deceased?

675
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,625
Yes.

676
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:04,825
Is this all that's left?

677
00:59:05,305 --> 00:59:06,305
Yes.

678
00:59:12,024 --> 00:59:13,384
It's like a dream.

679
00:59:16,225 --> 00:59:18,504
Tofu wasn't just a dream.

680
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:21,585
He didn't go anywhere.

681
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:24,904
He'll always be with us.

682
00:59:25,904 --> 00:59:28,864
That's right. I didn't go anywhere.

683
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:16,825
I knew Nut would return,

684
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,065
so I'll find a way to follow him home.

685
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:24,785
But that dog is back again.

686
01:00:25,265 --> 01:00:26,145
Gosh!

687
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:36,545
Let's go.

688
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:38,944
Come on.

689
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:00,185
Tofu, this way!

690
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:01,384
Ms. Left Slipper!

691
01:01:03,424 --> 01:01:04,265
Ouch.

692
01:01:11,185 --> 01:01:12,944
Go on, Tofu.

693
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,185
No, we have to go home together.

694
01:01:22,665 --> 01:01:24,424
Kuenchai!

695
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:28,024
Kuenchai!

696
01:01:33,825 --> 01:01:34,904
Stop, Kuenchai!

697
01:02:04,705 --> 01:02:05,545
Nut.

698
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:08,185
Where are you going, Nut?

699
01:02:44,585 --> 01:02:45,745
Tofu.

700
01:02:57,904 --> 01:02:59,825
Isn't this my slipper?

701
01:03:04,305 --> 01:03:05,625
That's your teddy bear. Tofu.

702
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:17,225
The missing teddy bear

703
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:20,745
and Mrs. Na's slipper
that Tofu was searching for.

704
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:23,185
They both ended up here.

705
01:03:24,024 --> 01:03:25,424
That's right.

706
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:42,185
I'm back, Nut.

707
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,745
Tofu is back!

708
01:03:57,825 --> 01:04:00,424
You're back, Tofu.

709
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:01,944
Hey, Tofu!

710
01:04:03,065 --> 01:04:05,225
Tofu. Good gracious.

711
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:07,504
You're really back.

712
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:10,424
-How are you?
-I knew you would come back.

713
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:25,464
Nothing is better than
when the people you love

714
01:04:25,944 --> 01:04:29,944
love you back and wait for you to return

715
01:04:30,585 --> 01:04:31,785
to them.

716
01:04:56,904 --> 01:04:58,145
Kuenchai.

717
01:04:58,904 --> 01:05:00,185
Tofu is gone.

718
01:05:00,265 --> 01:05:02,225
From now on, I'll play with you more.

719
01:05:30,265 --> 01:05:31,504
Is your name Tofu?

720
01:05:31,585 --> 01:05:33,065
I don't remember.

721
01:05:33,904 --> 01:05:35,585
But that's what your mother calls me.

722
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:39,504
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

723
01:05:52,864 --> 01:05:54,185
I guess…

724
01:05:55,504 --> 01:05:57,145
I really missed you.

725
01:06:37,464 --> 01:06:40,065
Even though Nut doesn't know
that I'm back,

726
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:42,984
I'm just glad

727
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:45,625
that a teddy bear like me

728
01:06:46,265 --> 01:06:47,904
can make him feel a little less sad.

729
01:06:55,665 --> 01:06:58,024
This is what love is.

730
01:07:04,665 --> 01:07:05,625
I get to love him,

731
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,105
and I get to watch him.

732
01:07:41,185 --> 01:07:42,265
I get to stay--

733
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:49,345
That's right. I'm always by his side,

734
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:52,185
or sometimes by the bed.

735
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,265
Mrs. Na's memory worsens every day.

736
01:07:57,345 --> 01:07:59,825
The pain of a person losing their memory,

737
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:02,944
and the pain of the person
who still remembers

738
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:05,225
are just as real.

739
01:08:06,825 --> 01:08:09,145
Mrs. Na isn't the only one who needs help.

740
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:13,105
Nut is seeing a doctor too.

741
01:08:15,305 --> 01:08:16,744
The doctor said

742
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:20,704
that Mrs. Na does what she does
because of Alzheimer's disease.

743
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:23,424
While Nut's accidental fits

744
01:08:23,945 --> 01:08:25,945
are due to cumulative fatigue.

745
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:29,504
Nut should take care of his mom with love.

746
01:08:30,464 --> 01:08:34,424
But he must also remember to take care
of his own heart.

747
01:08:42,345 --> 01:08:43,784
But I think

748
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:47,345
Nut has found someone
to take care of his heart.

749
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:54,905
I heard that your protest
against Hollow Forest

750
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,025
finally succeeded.

751
01:08:57,105 --> 01:08:58,265
Right.

752
01:08:58,744 --> 01:09:00,664
They halted the construction.

753
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:03,945
It's a shame

754
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:06,865
that the law can't touch TRD.

755
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,704
They didn't get the real culprit.

756
01:09:10,424 --> 01:09:12,145
What I did

757
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:13,985
might seem crazy,

758
01:09:15,145 --> 01:09:16,105
but sometimes,

759
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:19,025
miracles do happen.

760
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:24,905
You're still the same.

761
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:27,225
Yes.

762
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:28,865
I am.

763
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,225
Kuenchai. There you go again.

764
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:47,225
Come on, Kuenchai.

765
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:50,065
I was watching quietly.

766
01:09:52,424 --> 01:09:53,905
But now,

767
01:09:54,384 --> 01:09:56,744
I have to witness their love up close.

768
01:09:58,825 --> 01:10:00,025
I didn't think

769
01:10:01,025 --> 01:10:03,025
that you would keep this.

770
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,185
It has always been with me.

771
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:10,744
It suddenly disappeared
when Tofu came, though.

772
01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:15,265
They have the same name.

773
01:10:17,385 --> 01:10:19,145
He had lost his memory

774
01:10:19,664 --> 01:10:21,425
and Mom called him by that name.

775
01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:25,065
She said he looked like this teddy bear.

776
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:30,225
When the teddy bear disappeared,

777
01:10:30,744 --> 01:10:33,664
I even thought that he stole it.

778
01:10:36,744 --> 01:10:37,985
He even told me

779
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:40,185
that he was the bear.

780
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:42,664
I was furious at him.

781
01:10:44,505 --> 01:10:45,345
So,

782
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:47,704
how did you get it back?

783
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:51,025
I found it at the temple.

784
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:53,664
It's funny.

785
01:10:54,345 --> 01:10:57,425
When he showed up,
the teddy bear disappeared.

786
01:10:58,145 --> 01:10:59,945
Then, when he left,

787
01:11:00,025 --> 01:11:01,385
the teddy bear came back.

788
01:11:07,225 --> 01:11:08,145
So,

789
01:11:08,624 --> 01:11:10,305
what are your plans for the future?

790
01:11:10,905 --> 01:11:13,145
I think I'll still be
an artist and an activist.

791
01:11:13,865 --> 01:11:15,744
I'm thinking of opening a new studio.

792
01:11:16,865 --> 01:11:17,945
In Chiang Mai?

793
01:11:20,465 --> 01:11:21,585
Somewhere around here.

794
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:26,025
I'll get going.

795
01:11:34,465 --> 01:11:37,105
I think I have an idea

796
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,105
where his studio will be.

797
01:12:04,025 --> 01:12:05,225
Hey, Nut.

798
01:12:12,985 --> 01:12:15,624
Congratulations on the studio.

799
01:12:24,265 --> 01:12:26,145
I once went to your house in Chiang Mai.

800
01:12:26,985 --> 01:12:28,345
I thought you might like it,

801
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:29,505
so I got it for you.

802
01:12:30,744 --> 01:12:32,225
You can have one here too.

803
01:12:38,744 --> 01:12:39,744
Did you ever think

804
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:43,585
that we would see each other again?

805
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,065
I didn't dare to.

806
01:12:52,545 --> 01:12:54,025
I'm sorry

807
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,545
for hurting you

808
01:12:59,905 --> 01:13:01,624
and letting go of your hand.

809
01:13:25,305 --> 01:13:26,664
I was never hurt.

810
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:30,585
You don't have to be sorry.

811
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:36,145
I know you chose the right path.

812
01:13:49,065 --> 01:13:50,065
Let's go.

813
01:13:50,145 --> 01:13:51,385
All right.

814
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:53,185
Come on, Song.

815
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:58,345
Everyone, give me a hand.

816
01:13:58,425 --> 01:14:00,025
-It's quite a lot.
-Take this.

817
01:14:02,185 --> 01:14:04,345
-It's heavy.
-Here.

818
01:14:06,065 --> 01:14:07,425
Take this.

819
01:14:10,105 --> 01:14:11,585
This one is quite heavy.

820
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:12,824
All right.

821
01:14:12,905 --> 01:14:14,145
-Are you okay?
-Kind of.

822
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:16,385
What does "kind of" mean?

823
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:18,704
-It means I'm fine
-It means he's fine.

824
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:21,985
Okay?

825
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:23,704
-Are you okay?
-It's a little heavy.

826
01:14:23,784 --> 01:14:25,945
-Hello.
-Hello.

827
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:27,345
Hello.

828
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:29,145
Put it here.

829
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:33,265
What did you guys bring?

830
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,624
I posted drawings of teddy bears
on my page.

831
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:39,425
They turned out to be really popular.

832
01:14:39,505 --> 01:14:40,905
People wanted them,

833
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:43,265
so I made some sample products.

834
01:14:45,784 --> 01:14:48,505
Prib. Why does it have to be a teddy bear?

835
01:14:50,305 --> 01:14:53,185
I once asked Tofu about teddy bears.

836
01:14:53,985 --> 01:14:55,664
He didn't say anything,

837
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:59,265
but when we went to retrieve Tofu's ashes,

838
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:02,305
Nut got his teddy bear back.

839
01:15:02,385 --> 01:15:03,945
Isn't that strange?

840
01:15:08,624 --> 01:15:10,305
When I think of Tofu,

841
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:12,545
I think of a teddy bear.

842
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:17,025
Right.

843
01:15:17,105 --> 01:15:18,905
What should I be

844
01:15:18,985 --> 01:15:20,865
when you think of me?

845
01:15:22,065 --> 01:15:23,824
A dog, since you're like a puppy.

846
01:15:24,905 --> 01:15:28,065
Then you have to be a tick
and stick with me forever.

847
01:15:29,545 --> 01:15:33,025
-You're a tick. A tick. My tick.
-A tick?

848
01:15:33,105 --> 01:15:35,545
Hey, stop it.

849
01:15:35,624 --> 01:15:37,185
I'm getting emotional.

850
01:15:39,385 --> 01:15:40,225
Prib.

851
01:15:43,225 --> 01:15:44,145
I guess

852
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:46,985
Tofu must have been a great guy.

853
01:15:48,185 --> 01:15:49,824
Everyone seems to love him so much.

854
01:15:54,225 --> 01:15:56,145
I love who Tofu was.

855
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:59,704
I believe that everyone
wants their own Tofu.

856
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:02,385
That's why I made these.

857
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:05,185
But actually,

858
01:16:05,744 --> 01:16:07,065
I think

859
01:16:07,624 --> 01:16:09,865
we should be our own Tofus,

860
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,865
and be a Tofu for other people.

861
01:17:00,225 --> 01:17:01,065
Here.

862
01:17:04,585 --> 01:17:05,824
Nut.

863
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:08,744
Here.

864
01:17:12,265 --> 01:17:16,025
Right. I don't have my own Tofu.

865
01:17:17,985 --> 01:17:19,865
Come on.

866
01:17:21,505 --> 01:17:23,145
Then I wish

867
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:25,345
that you find your own Tofu soon.

868
01:17:31,624 --> 01:17:32,465
Hello.

869
01:17:45,225 --> 01:17:46,425
Which one do you like?

870
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:06,305
Well,

871
01:18:07,025 --> 01:18:10,505
I saw on the Once Upon Our Time page

872
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:13,065
that you were selling stuff here.

873
01:18:19,145 --> 01:18:20,784
Right.

874
01:18:22,985 --> 01:18:25,305
I posted that just five minutes ago.

875
01:18:26,425 --> 01:18:27,945
Do you live around here?

876
01:18:28,025 --> 01:18:29,265
No.

877
01:18:29,744 --> 01:18:32,744
I just wanted to take a Tofu Bear home.

878
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:34,865
Your post caught my eye right away.

879
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:37,265
Just the way I like it.

880
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:42,305
"Just the way I like it."

881
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,824
That's right.

882
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,624
You're "Mittraphap Is A Road Name."

883
01:18:52,865 --> 01:18:55,105
Yes, that's me.

884
01:19:01,624 --> 01:19:06,185
Thank you for always engaging
with my posts.

885
01:19:07,465 --> 01:19:09,585
You've been doing it since I started.

886
01:19:12,545 --> 01:19:14,385
I like your artwork.

887
01:19:14,465 --> 01:19:17,105
I wanted to support you,
so you can continue drawing.

888
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:22,425
Thank you.

889
01:19:27,025 --> 01:19:28,185
Right.

890
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:32,185
Which one are you interested in?

891
01:19:33,905 --> 01:19:35,945
This one is really cute.

892
01:19:37,664 --> 01:19:41,585
Finally, Prib found her own Tofu.

893
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:47,185
You didn't have to walk me home.
We're neighbors.

894
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:48,784
I wanted to.

895
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:51,345
It's the first time
I came all the way to your house.

896
01:19:52,784 --> 01:19:53,704
Thank you.

897
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:09,905
Do you still miss Tofu?

898
01:20:14,985 --> 01:20:16,385
Would you be mad

899
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:18,824
if I missed him?

900
01:20:21,465 --> 01:20:22,465
No.

901
01:20:25,305 --> 01:20:26,905
I should thank him

902
01:20:28,025 --> 01:20:32,664
for getting your mother to open up
and to get over what other people think.

903
01:20:34,624 --> 01:20:36,505
It's not strange for men to fall in love.

904
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:39,905
If society says it is,

905
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:42,624
I think that's what's strange.

906
01:20:44,704 --> 01:20:46,345
I should thank you too.

907
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:49,465
You gave me strength

908
01:20:50,385 --> 01:20:52,305
and the courage to choose my happiness.

909
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:55,905
You helped make me who I am today.

910
01:20:58,225 --> 01:20:59,624
Didn't I tell you?

911
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:02,385
I'm happy

912
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:05,305
to see you happy.

913
01:21:08,305 --> 01:21:11,265
Whether you agree to marry--

914
01:21:11,345 --> 01:21:12,624
I do.

915
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:20,305
Even though we can't do it legally,

916
01:21:22,505 --> 01:21:23,824
my heart

917
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:26,585
married you a long time ago.

918
01:21:33,585 --> 01:21:35,624
Nut once told me,

919
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:40,065
a good screenplay should leave a trace
in the audience's hearts.

920
01:21:40,545 --> 01:21:42,704
They should never forget it.

921
01:21:43,225 --> 01:21:45,065
No matter how many years later,

922
01:21:45,545 --> 01:21:49,385
they will still think of those stories

923
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:54,225
and dig up that trace to remember.

924
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:00,704
I guess that's what Tatarn is to Nut.

925
01:22:01,704 --> 01:22:03,025
I also hope

926
01:22:03,784 --> 01:22:05,145
that I'm like that too.

927
01:22:15,145 --> 01:22:16,624
Are you done with the plot?

928
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:48,345
Tofu

929
01:22:48,945 --> 01:22:50,505
Are you jealous of Tarn again?

930
01:22:51,585 --> 01:22:54,105
Are you trying to make me think of you?

931
01:22:56,465 --> 01:22:58,025
Even if you're jealous,

932
01:22:58,784 --> 01:23:02,425
I know you won't get mad
if I get back together with him.

933
01:23:03,585 --> 01:23:05,145
No matter what,

934
01:23:05,664 --> 01:23:07,425
you'll always be in my heart.

935
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:14,945
I told you before,

936
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:18,585
miracle is just
another way of saying hard work.

937
01:23:19,425 --> 01:23:21,865
Maybe the miracle that occurred

938
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:26,385
was a result of someone's hard work,

939
01:23:26,945 --> 01:23:28,985
or even many.

940
01:23:46,824 --> 01:23:47,824
Nut.

941
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:54,025
Nut.

942
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:27,385
Tofu.

943
01:24:41,985 --> 01:24:43,945
Is it not enough to stay in my heart?

944
01:24:44,505 --> 01:24:45,784
Is that why you're here?

945
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:56,784
I told you to wait for me,

946
01:24:58,025 --> 01:24:59,585
but you didn't.

947
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:02,784
You shouldn't have gone to Jan's.

948
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,985
Everything was already decided.

949
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,545
I'm sorry

950
01:25:12,865 --> 01:25:14,945
that I couldn't wait to see you.

951
01:25:18,465 --> 01:25:20,465
That's why I came back today.

952
01:25:24,345 --> 01:25:26,664
You came on a rainy day, just like Mio.

953
01:25:30,465 --> 01:25:32,985
I'll disappear like Mio too.

954
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:37,985
Before I go,

955
01:25:39,865 --> 01:25:41,185
I want to tell you something.

956
01:25:44,945 --> 01:25:46,664
Don't worry.

957
01:25:47,585 --> 01:25:48,824
Don't feel bad.

958
01:25:51,305 --> 01:25:53,025
I'll be so happy

959
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:56,865
if Tatarn is the one by your side.

960
01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:03,905
I'm also glad

961
01:26:05,865 --> 01:26:08,425
that you're no longer stuck in the past.

962
01:26:13,505 --> 01:26:15,105
I am the way I am

963
01:26:15,624 --> 01:26:16,784
because of you.

964
01:26:18,945 --> 01:26:20,905
I'll continue living my life for you.

965
01:26:23,185 --> 01:26:25,624
I'll be happy in your stead.

966
01:26:29,425 --> 01:26:31,185
I love you, Tofu.

967
01:26:34,185 --> 01:26:35,865
I love you too.

968
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:40,824
I'm happy

969
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:43,265
to see you smile.

970
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,865
Please be very happy.

971
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:15,105
Yes, Juea.

972
01:29:15,905 --> 01:29:18,065
It has been approved, Nut!

973
01:29:19,465 --> 01:29:20,505
What?

974
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:23,784
The plot you submitted this morning
was approved.

975
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:25,025
Are you serious?

976
01:29:25,105 --> 01:29:27,945
Of course!
You can start writing the script now.

977
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:29,105
Sure thing.

978
01:29:30,545 --> 01:29:33,385
Tofu! It was approved!

979
01:29:40,545 --> 01:29:45,624
THE MIRACLE… THAT MORNING

980
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:01,025
I kept my promise.

981
01:30:02,425 --> 01:30:04,624
Your story is being made into a series.

982
01:30:05,585 --> 01:30:08,025
I'm going to celebrate with Tarn and Mom.

983
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:11,905
Don't be jealous, my boy.

984
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,145
I'll enjoy the food for you.

985
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:19,345
I know Nut will always think of me.

986
01:31:20,185 --> 01:31:22,465
Whatever he faces from now on,

987
01:31:22,945 --> 01:31:24,585
he'll be fine,

988
01:31:25,265 --> 01:31:27,385
because I'm cheering him on from here.

989
01:31:28,905 --> 01:31:31,505
I hope Nut is happy in the real world

990
01:31:32,305 --> 01:31:35,105
without the need for any more miracles.

991
01:32:37,185 --> 01:32:42,185
