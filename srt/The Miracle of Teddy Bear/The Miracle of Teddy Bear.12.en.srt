1
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:09,065
…The person I thought would take my side

2
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,585
and protect me

3
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:13,945
turn against me like that.

4
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,665
I'm so sorry.

5
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:20,745
Mutual understanding

6
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,305
requires an open mind.

7
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,184
When did you get so smart?

8
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,505
Do you like it?

9
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,585
I like it.

10
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:32,305
What happened to you in the past

11
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,545
made you lose faith in love,

12
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,145
but I'm going to show you
how serious I am about you.

13
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,665
-Mom!
-Mrs. Na.

14
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,945
-Dress up tomorrow.
-Yes?

15
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,585
We are going shopping tomorrow.

16
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,305
Nut.

17
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:56,425
This is Mr. Nobu.

18
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,184
He wants to buy your show
and broadcast it in Japan.

19
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:01,624
Hello.

20
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:02,665
Hello.

21
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,745
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

22
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,385
I am from Tokyo. My name is Nobu.

23
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:12,545
Please be kind to me.

24
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:15,425
This is Mr. Yoshi.

25
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:18,265
He is an entertainment reporter.
He's here to interview you.

26
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:20,585
Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,545
-Mr. Nobu.
-Yes?

28
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:27,105
We will go and sign
the contract in my office.

29
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:32,064
And leave Nut and Mr. Yoshi here
for the interview.

30
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,745
-Mr. Nobu.
-Yes?

31
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,504
Want some Japanese sake?

32
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:45,344
I love sake.

33
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,904
-Rice whiskey?
-Whiskey.

34
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:02,825
Mrs. Na,

35
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,425
Nut has not read it yet.

36
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:07,665
He is probably busy.

37
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:11,064
That’s all right.

38
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,825
We can go by ourselves.

39
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:29,264
How about these?

40
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,785
They're a bit bright.

41
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,745
People can see them from miles away.

42
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:39,785
How about some plain ones?

43
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:43,785
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

44
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,305
Do you have other colors?

45
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:47,545
We do. Please wait a moment.

46
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:58,024
Do they fit well?

47
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,745
They are a little tight.

48
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,625
-Miss.
-Yes?

49
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,024
Do you have a bigger size?

50
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,625
Of course. One moment please.

51
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,704
I will take a look over there.

52
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:16,345
Okay.

53
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,505
Are they comfy?

54
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,745
Try walking in them.

55
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,225
Anything you like?

56
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:20,225
They are all pretty. I can't pick one.

57
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,425
Why don't we let Nut pick one for you?

58
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,385
Shall we?

59
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:28,344
Nut.

60
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:30,625
Can you pick something for your mom?

61
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,865
I told him

62
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,464
that your phone is broken.

63
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,024
What about this one?

64
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,665
Would it suit Mom?

65
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:34,784
It looks good.

66
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,985
We should get the right color.

67
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,745
I think she would like a pink one.

68
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,304
Thank you, son.

69
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,465
Let's go.

70
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,705
What color would you like?

71
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,145
The one that best suits my mom.

72
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,985
Then I recommend this shade.

73
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,064
It should suit you.

74
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,825
Do you like it?

75
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,265
How much is it?

76
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:44,544
It is 599 baht.

77
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:51,424
I stay home most of the time,
so I don't wear much makeup.

78
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,745
You can look pretty at home too.

79
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,184
Are they both your sons?
They're so handsome.

80
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,184
Yes.

81
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,304
He is my son.

82
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,064
He is also my son.

83
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:20,225
The three of us are a family.

84
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,865
What about those two? Are they yours too?

85
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:31,465
They've been looking over here.

86
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,304
Song.

87
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,424
Why are you following me?

88
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:51,424
Who followed you?

89
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,785
I was passing by and got a little curious.

90
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:57,785
All this time, I have never seen you
go out with your mother.

91
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,505
So I was wondering

92
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,585
what has gotten into you today.

93
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:05,505
Nothing much.

94
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:08,064
I just brought my mom to the mall.

95
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:15,145
I am glad you are happy.

96
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,184
I've been waiting for this day.

97
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,145
What about you?

98
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,865
Why is he with you?

99
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:33,705
You and he…

100
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:36,944
Well, I…

101
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:42,465
What about us?

102
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,985
Well?

103
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,064
So?

104
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:50,585
This kid…

105
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,064
is not with me.

106
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,225
It's me…

107
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,424
who is here with him.

108
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,345
So, are you two together?

109
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,905
Yes, as you can see.

110
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:18,064
You said you didn't like younger guys.

111
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:20,905
Did I?

112
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,665
When was that? I can't recall.

113
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,025
Well done.

114
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:32,505
I will reward you with something later.

115
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:36,824
You are the sweetest.

116
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:41,465
Why aren’t we ordering something?
I'm hungry.

117
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,505
Go for it, Tofu. Tell me what you want.

118
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:50,064
Today, I am so happy
that I will treat you.

119
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,064
-You said it.
-Of course.

120
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,184
I'll order, then.

121
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:54,785
Alright. Go ahead.

122
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,824
-I want this one.
-This one?

123
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:58,985
-And this.
-And this?

124
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:00,785
-This one and this one.
-Those two?

125
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,985
This one and this one. I want all of them.

126
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:04,785
-Good job.
-All… all of them?

127
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,184
Yes.

128
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,505
You want all of them?

129
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:08,745
Are you sure?

130
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:10,385
-You said it was a treat.
-Really?

131
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,944
-You said you would pay.
-I will.

132
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,665
Eat what you like and I'll swipe my card.

133
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:37,905
Hurry up and grow.

134
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,665
There is a kid waiting to eat you.

135
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:44,345
You're in a good mood today.

136
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,625
You went on a date, right?
I saw Song earlier.

137
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,105
I'm in a good mood because of Nut.

138
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:56,304
I saw Nut. He took
his mom and Tofu shopping.

139
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,745
Nut made up with his mom.

140
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:00,544
Really?

141
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,625
A lot of time was wasted though.

142
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,985
What I mean is…

143
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:13,345
had they reconciled earlier,

144
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:16,665
they would have spent
much more time together, right?

145
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:21,265
You too, Gen.

146
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:24,064
Don’t make love difficult.

147
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,105
You never know what is going to happen.

148
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,944
Be good to each other,
so you don’t regret it later.

149
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:34,345
You know me.

150
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,785
You are my son after all.
Of course, I know you.

151
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,865
Thank you so much.

152
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,424
I had a great time today, son.

153
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:52,704
This has made becoming human worthwhile.

154
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,785
At the very least,

155
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,865
I get to help in healing the rift
between Nut and his mom.

156
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,785
It made me realize

157
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:27,905
that whether you are a mother or a child,

158
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,184
everyone makes mistakes.

159
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,264
I’m going, Mom.

160
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,385
What about…

161
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:17,305
my lunchbox?

162
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,785
I'm going.

163
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:30,385
All right.

164
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,905
By accepting each other’s flaws

165
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,865
with love and understanding,

166
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,905
only then can the void be filled.

167
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,705
Seeing this

168
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:51,225
has been worth it,

169
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,504
even if

170
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,504
I might be gone forever one day.

171
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,264
You're here early, Gen.

172
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,744
You are late.

173
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,024
Hey, Gen. Let go.

174
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,425
You're suddenly so possessive.

175
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:24,264
-Won't you share anymore?
-No.

176
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,024
It's a good thing Prib isn't here.

177
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,705
Or else she would ask you for some.

178
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,425
You are right.

179
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:32,625
Where is my niece?

180
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,625
Kuenchai.

181
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:42,225
Why are you barking?

182
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,625
Prib?

183
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:49,744
I need to talk to you.

184
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,865
Do you know Tatarn?

185
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,665
Do you know him too?

186
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,185
Did Nut tell you about him?

187
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:06,504
Nut told me about his ex.

188
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,625
He never told me the name.

189
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:12,065
I found out his name is Tatarn.

190
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:15,984
You are friends with him on Facebook.

191
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,865
Can you take me to see him?

192
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,345
I have to ask him something.

193
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,585
I would like to,

194
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:30,425
but Tarn is in a coma and has not been
responsive for months now.

195
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:35,105
I really shouldn’t tell you this

196
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,705
as it might be hard for you.

197
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:41,425
But this is a really important matter.

198
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,305
I want Nut to visit Tarn.

199
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,665
A miracle could happen.

200
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,024
Even if it doesn't,

201
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,744
at least,

202
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,984
Tarn gets to see Nut one last time.

203
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,784
Can you help me just this once?

204
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,744
I've heard people say

205
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,225
that happiness often doesn’t last.

206
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:20,425
It is actually my secret,

207
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,425
but I will tell you about it.

208
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:26,385
Before I was into Nut,

209
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,305
I used to like Tarn.

210
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:32,024
It's a small world sometimes, Tofu.

211
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,585
Two people I liked used to be in love.

212
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,545
And that’s also why I want to help Tarn.

213
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:49,345
That's why Tarn asked you
to draw him with Nut.

214
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:55,385
He never mentioned Nut
in that page or on Facebook,

215
00:20:58,225 --> 00:20:59,784
but I can tell

216
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,305
from all those photos and messages

217
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,024
that he wanted Nut to know.

218
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,225
Tarn still loves Nut, doesn't he?

219
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:18,264
I don’t know about that.

220
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,865
All I know is that

221
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,625
Tarn never wanted to trouble Nut.

222
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:27,504
Tarn told me
that he wanted Nut to be happy.

223
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,625
He wants him to do the job he loves

224
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,945
and be surrounded by good people.

225
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,625
And what happened between them

226
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:39,145
should just be left as a happy memory.

227
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,225
Isn’t that obvious?

228
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:49,504
If he is still in love with Nut,

229
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,905
why didn’t he come back for him?

230
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,984
I know why.

231
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:00,385
What did you just say?

232
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:01,905
Well,

233
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:04,425
you were wondering

234
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:06,264
why they didn’t get back together.

235
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,984
I think the guy is not sure
if the girl wants him back.

236
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,465
Though they used to love each other

237
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:17,585
and they broke up out of necessity,

238
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,504
no one stays the same forever.

239
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,784
Now that the girl has feelings
for that other guy,

240
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,905
the guy who has been waiting

241
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:28,105
is now afraid to act.

242
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:34,145
Well…

243
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,585
How do you think it will end?

244
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,264
Just wait and see.

245
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:56,625
TATARN KLAIANANT

246
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:58,465

TATARN KLAIANANT, AN ARTIST WHOSE ART

UNCOVER TATARN KLAIANANT,
A YOUNGBLOOD ARTIST AND ENVIRONMENTALIST

249
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,305
SPECIAL INTERVIEW WITH TATARN KLAIANANT

250
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:11,625

251

TATARN KLAIANANT AND HIS FAMOUS WORKS

252

TATARN KLAIANANT AND HIS FAMOUS WORKS

253
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:27,425
ENTHUSIASTIC ADVERTISER, TATARN KLAIANANT

254
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:33,305
ENTHUSIASTIC ADVERTISER, TATARN KLAIANANT

255
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,264
ENTHUSIASTIC ADVERTISER, TATARN KLAIANANT

256
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,425
The world is not fair.

257
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:08,784
Why is he so good at everything?

258
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:10,504
He is skillful,

259
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,185
cool,

260
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:14,024
and probably rich.

261
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:17,225
If only he were here

262
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:20,625
instead of a useless amnesiac like me…

263
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:25,744
What do you think?

264
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:28,105
Does it still smell good?

265
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,825
-It smells so good, Tarn.
-Of course.

266
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,665
Try some.

267
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:38,544
-How is it?
-Amazing.

268
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,385
How sweet. Now, get back to work.

269
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:47,105
If Nut had stayed with him,

270
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:51,264
he might have been happier
than he is with me.

271
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:54,945
Tofu.

272
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,665
Can you smell something burning?

273
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:03,825
Tofu!

274
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:05,825
You're miles away. It's burnt.

275
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,304
Oh, gosh.

276
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:20,345
Hey.

277
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:26,984
Jeez!

278
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,665
How am I supposed to eat that?

279
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,264
Don't eat it if you don’t want to.

280
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:37,105
I thought you wanted fried pork,
so I made some.

281
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:38,544
If it's that bad,

282
00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:40,744
then get someone else to cook for you.

283
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:44,065
I will give this to Kuenchai.

284
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:46,665
Kuenchai, come here.

285
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:49,744
Here.

286
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:57,465
Eat it.

287
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,744
What is it, boys?

288
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:14,225
It's nothing, Mrs. Na.

289
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:16,264
I burnt the fried pork.

290
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,905
I’m heading to the market.

291
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,585
I get Nut now, Kuenchai.

292
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:45,625
I didn’t mean to be unreasonable.

293
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,504
I couldn't help it.

294
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:57,625
I lost, Kuenchai.

295
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:00,145
I couldn't compete with him.

296
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,425
Maybe…

297
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,625
I should just tell him.

298
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:11,425
Tell me what?

299
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,264
I thought you went to the market.

300
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:33,385
I didn't make it that far.

301
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,385
What did you want to tell me?

302
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,145
I was going to say…

303
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:00,665
I’m sorry.

304
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:04,145
I don’t know what's up with me.

305
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,744
I know.

306
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:13,984
How did you know?

307
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:15,984
Because I’m the best.

308
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:19,504
I’m your boyfriend,

309
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:21,065
so I know what you are thinking.

310
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,544
Don’t make that face.

311
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,345
People will say I'm picking on a kid.

312
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,425
Stop overthinking.

313
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:43,264
I don’t know if I did something that made
you feel insecure.

314
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:46,225
I will tell you this one more time.

315
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,625
You are you,

316
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:51,544
and I love that about you.

317
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:04,905
I didn’t want to feel this way.

318
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,585
I just can’t help it.

319
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,705
Let me stay like this a bit longer.

320
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:16,744
What’s the matter with you, Tofu?

321
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:20,625
If I’m unreasonable like this again,

322
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,145
will you still love me?

323
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:27,145
I’m like that all the time,

324
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:29,304
and you still love me.

325
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:41,145
What if…

326
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:45,465
you meet someone better than me,

327
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:48,504
someone you are happier with,

328
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,425
and isn't a burden like me?

329
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,744
Will you leave me for him?

330
00:29:58,225 --> 00:29:59,345
All right.

331
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,744
Even if you always burn the pork,

332
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:03,585
I won’t leave you.

333
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:05,264
Are you satisfied?

334
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,585
I promise

335
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:15,544
that I won’t give you cancer.

336
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:20,185
I will fry the pork beautifully next time.

337
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:23,825
I'll make it like

338
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:26,984
how you used to have it.

339
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:34,105
When did I ever tell you
that the fried pork I used to eat

340
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,264
was so good?

341
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:40,625
Where did you get this from?

342
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,385
Why do you ask? Do you want some?

343
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:46,665
I only asked where you got it,

344
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,185
so that I won’t eat there.

345
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:50,425
I made it myself.

346
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:52,345
It might not look great,

347
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:54,544
but it tastes amazing.

348
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:56,504
Want to try it?

349
00:30:57,425 --> 00:30:58,784
Yuck.

350
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:01,024
Try it. I put a lot of effort into it.

351
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:02,504
Here.

352
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,264
How is it?

353
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,185
Delicious, right?

354
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,784
Hey,

355
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:11,425
it's great.

356
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:16,345
If you want more,
then eat with me every day.

357
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,185
I live alone.

358
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:21,064
How about I make you Thai barbecue

359
00:31:22,504 --> 00:31:23,744
over at my condo?

360
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:27,825
It looked…

361
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:31,585
It looked just like the stuff you made.

362
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:35,345
It was all in your head
and you blamed me for it.

363
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:40,024
Don’t get all upset
about me remembering it.

364
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:45,585
It was just one of the first times
we ate together. That's all.

365
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:51,264
Do you remember
the first time we ate together?

366
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:55,544
Are you looking for something
to argue about, Tofu?

367
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,304
Stop comparing yourself with someone else.

368
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:03,544
Be confident in yourself.

369
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:09,145
And trust me.

370
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:21,225
You said you wanted me
to be patient with you.

371
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:25,504
You should be patient with me too.

372
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:28,905
I promise

373
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,705
that I won’t be like this…

374
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:34,225
too often.

375
00:32:36,784 --> 00:32:38,064
Tofu.

376
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:08,544
THE LITTLE PRINCE

377
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:21,905
Where have you been?

378
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:24,064
Did you get the pork?

379
00:33:25,064 --> 00:33:26,865
I’m sorry I made you worry.

380
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,425
Also, I didn’t get any pork.

381
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:33,784
That’s fine.

382
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:37,304
Never mind. Nhong brought
some stir-fried rice noodles he made.

383
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:40,744
I'll set the table.

384
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:42,625
Let me help you.

385
00:34:06,225 --> 00:34:07,984
I'll pour the water.

386
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:15,344
THE LITTLE PRINCE

387
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,264
THE LITTLE PRINCE

388
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,864
Is your work done?
You're checking holiday spots.

389
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:32,025
Do you want me to only work
and ignore Mom and you?

390
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:33,665
Would you like that?

391
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:34,744
No.

392
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:38,225
Don’t tell me

393
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:40,065
that you're taking us on holiday.

394
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:42,304
Yes.

395
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:46,545
I saw Mom reading The Little Prince
over and over.

396
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,465
She might want to travel like he did.

397
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:52,744
You guys will go out of your minds
just staying at home.

398
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,304
Let's take a trip and relax.

399
00:34:58,065 --> 00:34:59,185
This time,

400
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,825
we'll go as a family.

401
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:04,505
We can go as a couple next time.

402
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:06,384
Deal.

403
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:11,305
Help me pick a place.
Where should I take Mom?

404
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:14,105
We haven't been anywhere together
for ages.

405
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:16,505
Well…

406
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:19,985
How about we ask your mom?

407
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:23,065
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

408
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:28,145
I don't mind. You decide.

409
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:30,345
See? I told you.

410
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,785
You are her son.
Of course, you know what she thinks.

411
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:38,145
If Mom won’t choose,

412
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:39,505
then I'll let you choose.

413
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:42,625
Where shall we go?

414
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:44,585
I can choose?

415
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:49,904
I want to go to Chiang Mai.

416
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,424
What is it, Kuenchai?

417
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,505
Don't give me that look.

418
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:03,025
You don’t get to go.

419
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,384
Stay home.

420
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:26,944
TOFU: NUT, MRS. NA AND I
ARE GOING TO CHIANG MAI.

421
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:35,424
PRIBPREE: SORRY I GAVE YOU A HARD TIME,
TOFU. I WAS BEING SELFISH, WASN'T I?

422
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:49,465
TOFU: EVERYONE CAN BE SELFISH,
ME INCLUDED.

423
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:09,345
I didn't promise Prib anything.

424
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:12,864
Maybe not,
but you're dragging Nut to Chiang Mai.

425
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,785
I want to see if you can stand
not telling Nut about it.

426
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:19,705
I know this is important.

427
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,785
It is a matter of life and death,

428
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:24,545
but I don’t want to tell him about it.

429
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:26,625
I’m afraid.

430
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:30,145
Humans need to be
a little selfish sometimes

431
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,585
in order to avoid getting hurt too badly.

432
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,985
I don’t want to be that kind of human.

433
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:40,825
They are so fearful, dishonest,

434
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:42,904
envious,

435
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:45,065
and even jealous.

436
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:49,105
That is because you are in love.

437
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,625
You'll learn more about life as you grow.

438
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:56,384
I know Nut
will always be there to help you.

439
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,185
Tofu.

440
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:07,145
Why aren't you packing?

441
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:09,825
We’re leaving tomorrow.

442
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:12,944
Here.

443
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:14,825
What’s wrong?

444
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:16,464
I'm tired.

445
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:30,985
Well…

446
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,585
This trip is kind of sudden.

447
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:34,705
Are you sure Juea won't mind?

448
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:37,025
Why would he mind?

449
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,424
I worked day and night
to finish the script.

450
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:40,825
He has a lot to work on.

451
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:43,305
What about Gen?

452
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:50,864
Can you go pack now?

453
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,785
I can’t. I’m exhausted.

454
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:03,944
Do you feel better now?

455
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:14,665
Nut is going to Chiang Mai.

456
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:16,864
Right.

457
00:39:16,944 --> 00:39:19,105
He said he is taking his family on a trip.

458
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:22,065
-I see.
-So what?

459
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:23,705
I’m envious.

460
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:25,665
I haven’t taken a vacation in ages.

461
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:28,185
Then take the vacation now.

462
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:30,745
And I'm going with you.

463
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:31,985
Hey.

464
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,505
Here to deliver food?

465
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:35,904
No.

466
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:37,864
I’m here to see my boyfriend.

467
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:42,424
I'm just kidding.

468
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,904
I’m here to pick up my check.

469
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:48,025
What are you talking about?

470
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:51,705
Well, Nut is going to Chiang Mai.

471
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:53,305
Gen wants to go too,

472
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,545
so I’m going to take him there.

473
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,305
We can go and see my dad too.

474
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,464
Who said I’m going?

475
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:03,225
I’m going.

476
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:26,424
Who's that?

477
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,065
Hello?

478
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:36,384
Tofu.

479
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:42,145
What's taking you so long?

480
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:45,625
You seem more excited than me.

481
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:48,265
You talk too much.

482
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,864
Go pack your suitcase.

483
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:51,745
Go.

484
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:06,904
Is anyone there?

485
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:24,505
Keep an eye on the house for us.

486
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:28,585
-Okay.
-Don't worry. We'll tend to your house.

487
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:32,065
If something happens, give me a call.

488
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:33,745
Thank you so much.

489
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,985
No problem. Have a good trip.

490
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:40,985
I hope you all have a great time.

491
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,065
Okay.

492
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:45,145
Where is Kuenchai?

493
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:47,464
Is he going too?

494
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:49,545
-Hey.
-Hey.

495
00:41:50,105 --> 00:41:51,825
He's in the car.

496
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:53,185
Kuenchai.

497
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:54,625
He probably wants to go.

498
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:57,265
-There he is.
-You can't go. Come here.

499
00:41:57,345 --> 00:41:58,625
There he is.

500
00:42:00,904 --> 00:42:02,185
-Kuenchai.
-Kuenchai.

501
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,464
Hey.

502
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:08,145
Kuenchai. Come here, boy.

503
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,745
Sit.

504
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,345
Be a good boy, all right?

505
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:14,025
I’ll be back soon. Okay?

506
00:42:14,105 --> 00:42:15,745
Be good.

507
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,384
Don't be a bad boy.

508
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:18,985
-Let's go.
-Kuenchai.

509
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:21,864
-Nhong.
-Sorry to bother you.

510
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:24,825
-Come here.
-Kuenchai, sit.

511
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:26,384
Here, turn that way.

512
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:28,585
I’m sorry we can’t take you with us.

513
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,105
I'll buy you some treats, okay?

514
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,345
Have fun.

515
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:36,185
Shall we go?

516
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,384
Let’s go.

517
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:39,785
Thanks for your help. Take care.

518
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:41,424
-Goodbye.
-Have a safe trip.

519
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:43,745
-Thank you.
-Bye, Kuenchai.

520
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:47,545
-Bye.
-Bye. Be good.

521
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,345
-Wave goodbye.
-Bye.

522
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:44,424
It’s beautiful.

523
00:44:05,665 --> 00:44:07,305
Oh, wow.

524
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:10,145
Nut.

525
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:12,785
What's up, bro?

526
00:44:12,864 --> 00:44:15,145
-Hello.
-Hello.

527
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:17,464
How was the drive? Are you tired?

528
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:19,145
Why are you so hyper?

529
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:21,984
Are you tired, Mrs. Na?

530
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:23,345
Just a little.

531
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:24,545
Well, well…

532
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,505
You don’t look like someone
who has just traveled for ten hours.

533
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,265
I’m envious.

534
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:30,904
I want to take a road trip too.

535
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,785
-I'm going to check in.
-All right.

536
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:38,265
Mom, Tofu, let’s go.

537
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,864
-Do you need me?
-Of course. We need your ID card.

538
00:44:42,904 --> 00:44:44,424
Coming by plane is better.

539
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:47,105
Your food delivery motorbike
is not a big bike.

540
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,225
Even if it were, I wouldn't ride with you.

541
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:51,825
You might get weird and take orders
along the way.

542
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:54,505
I could drive your car here.

543
00:44:54,585 --> 00:44:56,145
Why trouble yourself driving?

544
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:58,185
Just enjoy the trip, all right?

545
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:02,305
We get it. You care about Song.

546
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,065
Are we done?

547
00:45:04,145 --> 00:45:06,705
I’m sick of this lovey-dovey vibe.

548
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:07,825
That's harsh.

549
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:10,665
You could've told me so.

550
00:45:11,864 --> 00:45:14,225
-I'm so touched.
-What are you doing?

551
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:15,705
There are people here.

552
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,785
Will you spend the night
at my dad's place with me?

553
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:23,984
So Prib can relax by herself. All right?

554
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:26,825
Your dad might have a heart attack.
He doesn’t know about us.

555
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:28,305
All done.

556
00:45:29,984 --> 00:45:31,705
I’m too tired to go anywhere today.

557
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:33,424
Let’s split up.

558
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:34,785
See you tomorrow.

559
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,225
Let's go.

560
00:46:00,505 --> 00:46:02,305
Please let me be with Nut.

561
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:09,864
I wish that he will love me forever.

562
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,345
-I'll take a picture for you.
-Nut.

563
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:24,745
That's a great picture.

564
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:38,384
Can we go inside?

565
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:52,705
Song. Come here.

566
00:47:10,384 --> 00:47:12,464
Your mom looks so happy.

567
00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:17,464
She's a history teacher after all.

568
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,825
When I was little,
she used to read me stories.

569
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:23,545
When we had finished them all,

570
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:28,145
she then told me stories
about Thai history and foreign history.

571
00:47:29,785 --> 00:47:31,065
How nice.

572
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:33,505
I want to hear them too.

573
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:36,625
Can you tell me some stories at bedtime?

574
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:39,345
Go ask my mother.

575
00:47:39,864 --> 00:47:41,745
I don’t like history like she does.

576
00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:44,345
Why not?

577
00:47:45,984 --> 00:47:48,025
History depends on who's writing it.

578
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:51,145
It's what you choose to believe.

579
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:54,105
We like to believe in what we agree with.

580
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:57,505
A lot of people use belief as a weapon

581
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,185
to hurt those who think differently.

582
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:03,785
Some use it as a tool hiding the truth

583
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:06,464
to serve their purpose.

584
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:11,585
The same way my parents used to tell me

585
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:15,265
that being who I am is a sin.

586
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:21,145
When I grew up,

587
00:48:22,105 --> 00:48:23,305
I realized

588
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,025
that there are other beliefs

589
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:27,305
that no one else had told me…

590
00:48:29,464 --> 00:48:30,665
except…

591
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:36,424
Tatarn, right?

592
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:41,585
Yes.

593
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:46,424
He was the one who made me understand

594
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:48,065
that being gay isn't a disease.

595
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:50,065
It's not down to bad karma,

596
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:52,904
or an emotional disorder.

597
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,825
And it's not a joke.

598
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:58,585
Being gay

599
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:01,225
doesn't mean we love every one
of the same gender.

600
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:05,025
We can love someone
as sincerely as anyone else.

601
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:13,505
That’s why I became a writer.

602
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,585
I want to use my stories as a weapon

603
00:49:17,065 --> 00:49:19,025
and erase those wrong beliefs.

604
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:23,545
You really are your mother’s son.

605
00:49:24,265 --> 00:49:26,185
She likes to tell stories.

606
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:28,225
You also have something to tell.

607
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:30,665
Perhaps

608
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:33,145
her history lessons

609
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:36,665
motivated you to become a writer.

610
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,944
I’m sorry, Nut.
I got carried away walking around.

611
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:42,785
Where are we going next?

612
00:49:45,585 --> 00:49:46,944
Where do you want to go?

613
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,384
It's up to you.

614
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,105
You want me to decide?

615
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:57,065
Oh, wow.

616
00:49:57,665 --> 00:49:59,424
You wanted to come here?

617
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:04,105
I never thought I would get to come here.

618
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:11,185
I never knew you would like
something so extreme.

619
00:50:14,864 --> 00:50:17,145
I've always wanted to give it a try.

620
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:31,145
Smile!

621
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:33,025
Nut!

622
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:45,944
That was fun.

623
00:51:46,864 --> 00:51:48,705
Are you all right, Tofu?

624
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:51,625
Are you all right, Tofu?

625
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:54,265
I'm fine.

626
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,145
Can we go somewhere less exciting next?

627
00:51:58,185 --> 00:51:59,265
I knew it.

628
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:02,345
Nut has finally fulfilled his mom's dream.

629
00:52:05,384 --> 00:52:08,705
If you want to go somewhere, just tell me.

630
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:10,305
I will take you there.

631
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:14,785
I’m glad I got
to take a trip with you before…

632
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:17,625
while I still can.

633
00:52:20,864 --> 00:52:22,785
You are still healthy, Mrs. Na.

634
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:25,384
You still have enough time to travel
the world with Nut.

635
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,944
It’s just that he's probably too busy
to take you.

636
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:31,625
Wrong. I can't afford it.

637
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:34,185
Being a writer doesn't make you rich.

638
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,185
But actors like me are quite rich.

639
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:41,904
I can take you to travel the world
many times.

640
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,424
You are rich, are you? So rich?

641
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,984
I think,

642
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:48,345
for the next place,

643
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:50,665
let's go somewhere Tofu will like.

644
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:53,864
All right.

645
00:52:54,545 --> 00:52:56,065
I know the perfect place.

646
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:06,105
How is this a place for Tofu?

647
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:10,225
Why? You don't think it suits him?

648
00:53:11,384 --> 00:53:15,145
She probably wondered why it suits Tofu
better than her.

649
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:18,545
Gen, I was just curious.

650
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:22,225
Flowers don't have to be for girls only.

651
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:24,625
They can also go well with men.
Right, Mrs. Na?

652
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:26,944
That's right.

653
00:53:27,785 --> 00:53:29,745
I remember wondering

654
00:53:29,825 --> 00:53:33,345
why people associated flowers
with one gender.

655
00:53:33,904 --> 00:53:36,745
When we give someone flowers,

656
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:40,504
no one tells us the gender of each flower
or who are they suitable for.

657
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:43,145
We give someone flowers because we know

658
00:53:43,225 --> 00:53:45,585
their meaning
and the reason we give them to someone.

659
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:47,825
-Right?
-That's right.

660
00:53:48,384 --> 00:53:50,825
Let's go.
I'm sick of the people around here.

661
00:53:51,424 --> 00:53:52,904
Let's go over there.

662
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:54,464
-Did she mean me?
-Yes.

663
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:02,984
Nut.

664
00:54:05,464 --> 00:54:07,105
Did you bring me here

665
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:09,665
for a particular reason?

666
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,225
Look there.

667
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:20,665
They are the same kind of orchid,
and yet they are different.

668
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:23,464
Each flower is different.

669
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:29,904
So are we.

670
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:33,705
We all have value.

671
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:36,345
There's no need to compare.

672
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:41,745
Each of us is a unique flower.

673
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:49,065
You are a special flower

674
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:52,384
that belongs to me.

675
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:01,944
Let's take some photos.

676
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:03,384
I'll take lots of it.

677
00:55:03,464 --> 00:55:05,025
Okay.

678
00:55:13,225 --> 00:55:15,065
One, two, three.

679
00:55:24,025 --> 00:55:26,185
-Gen.
-What?

680
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:28,065
Do you want some flowers?

681
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:30,384
I will buy whatever you like.

682
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:32,225
Which one do you like?

683
00:55:32,984 --> 00:55:34,384
Black-eyed Susan?

684
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:37,065
Black-eyed Song sounds better.

685
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,785
Let's just take more photos.

686
00:56:01,864 --> 00:56:03,345
What are you doing, Tofu?

687
00:56:04,504 --> 00:56:05,984
I'm choosing a photo.

688
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:08,145
Which one do you like better?

689
00:56:09,305 --> 00:56:11,504
I'll post it on my Facebook.

690
00:56:11,984 --> 00:56:13,424
Save it as a good memory.

691
00:56:13,984 --> 00:56:15,025
Which ones?

692
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,464
This one and this one too.

693
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:20,025
I like this one.

694
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:21,345
This?

695
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:22,424
Yes.

696
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:26,225
I want to post it too.
Can you send me that photo?

697
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:28,424
Of course.

698
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:31,504
In that case,

699
00:56:31,585 --> 00:56:34,665
I'll create a family group chat
and post the photos in there.

700
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:36,585
So you can save photos from there.

701
00:56:53,984 --> 00:56:55,345
Yes, Juea.

702
00:56:55,424 --> 00:56:58,625
Nut, I'm sorry.
I need you to revise the script.

703
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:01,225
I sent my comments to your email.

704
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:03,625
I need it by tonight.

705
00:57:04,345 --> 00:57:05,785
Tonight?

706
00:57:05,864 --> 00:57:08,984
Yes. I was kind enough to let you go.

707
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:11,105
I want it by tonight.

708
00:57:11,785 --> 00:57:12,864
All right.

709
00:57:16,105 --> 00:57:19,225
Juea is probably upset
that he has to shoot alone.

710
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:20,785
Maybe.

711
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:27,305
Well then, that's it for today.

712
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:31,185
We should head back now.
Nut can also get some work done.

713
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:35,705
Gen and I have to excuse ourselves.

714
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,384
We are going to have dinner with my dad.

715
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:47,265
I'm going to visit some more places.

716
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,785
I want to find a good spot to sketch.

717
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:53,504
I'll go with Prib then.

718
00:58:00,464 --> 00:58:02,944
You have to work.

719
00:58:03,585 --> 00:58:05,545
I won't be much help here.

720
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:07,984
Hey.

721
00:58:08,065 --> 00:58:10,545
So you would rather go somewhere
than be with me?

722
00:58:12,065 --> 00:58:14,825
Nut, a little time alone won't kill you.

723
00:58:17,024 --> 00:58:18,145
All right, all right.

724
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:19,345
You can go.

725
00:58:19,944 --> 00:58:21,585
Take care of yourself, okay?

726
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:23,944
Look after Prib as well.

727
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:27,384
I'm sure she'll be okay, though.

728
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:42,105
You didn't just want
to hang out with me, did you?

729
00:59:42,904 --> 00:59:43,984
Tofu.

730
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:50,145
Are you okay?

731
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:54,504
I was a little overwhelmed.

732
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:56,745
I just feel a bit dizzy.

733
01:00:00,825 --> 01:00:02,464
What happened to him?

734
01:00:05,745 --> 01:00:06,944
He was attacked.

735
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:09,145
The police are investigating the case.

736
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:12,625
I think he was involved
in some conflict of interest.

737
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:17,024
He was a protest leader
in the Hollow Forest project.

738
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:28,904
Tofu.

739
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:32,145
I know you are confused right now.

740
01:00:32,225 --> 01:00:36,065
I didn't come here to pressure you
for an answer.

741
01:00:37,225 --> 01:00:38,944
I was just worried.

742
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:46,944
I turned your trip
that should be filled with joy into this.

743
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:52,345
It would be nice
if I could help you with something.

744
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:58,225
I understand.

745
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,305
I get it all,

746
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:07,145
but it still hurts.

747
01:01:24,585 --> 01:01:28,384
Before this,
I had always wanted to meet Tatarn.

748
01:01:29,665 --> 01:01:31,625
At the same time,
I didn't want to see him,

749
01:01:32,424 --> 01:01:35,864
for fear that he might separate
Nut and me.

750
01:01:37,504 --> 01:01:39,585
Now, I want him to wake up,

751
01:01:40,265 --> 01:01:42,825
as he might hold the answer to my miracle.

752
01:01:44,185 --> 01:01:46,145
But if he doesn't wake up,

753
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:49,424
I might be able to prolong my happiness.

754
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:53,225
I still don't know
what will happen to me though.

755
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,504
Tofu.

756
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:01,305
Do you still want to hang out?

757
01:02:14,384 --> 01:02:16,504
I used to come here with Tarn.

758
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:19,745
We both like art.

759
01:02:20,545 --> 01:02:24,345
It was around the time
he got back from Japan.

760
01:02:24,424 --> 01:02:26,864
He was getting involved
in political activities.

761
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:30,665
He joined a workshop here.

762
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:36,065
The way I saw it, Tarn was a warm person.

763
01:02:36,745 --> 01:02:38,904
But his paintings
were bursting with emotion.

764
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:41,785
His paintings showed two men

765
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:46,345
with satirical scenes about social
and political issues, the environment,

766
01:02:46,424 --> 01:02:49,785
religion, faith, and even love.

767
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:52,265
He just took it all.

768
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:58,984
I asked about the inspiration
behind these paintings.

769
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:01,585
When something can't be said,

770
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:04,145
then let art speak for you.

771
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:09,904
Art is the most peaceful form
of expression.

772
01:03:11,585 --> 01:03:15,384
Its voice is subtle
and you need to interpret it.

773
01:03:16,265 --> 01:03:18,545
Yet it is a powerful way of communication.

774
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:22,305
Too bad.

775
01:03:23,185 --> 01:03:25,424
Who would care about art

776
01:03:25,904 --> 01:03:27,745
when their stomachs are empty?

777
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:31,904
That sounds depressing.

778
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:34,225
Right?

779
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,345
That's why Tarn and I studied art abroad.

780
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:42,745
But you guys came back to do art here.

781
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:45,864
That's because we're hopeful.

782
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:47,944
Especially, Tarn.

783
01:03:48,665 --> 01:03:51,305
He wasn't just hopeful for art.

784
01:03:51,384 --> 01:03:53,024
He was hopeful for everything.

785
01:03:54,024 --> 01:03:58,065
He hoped for things
that are normal in other countries.

786
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:03,105
He didn't want to see our country
destroyed and held back anymore.

787
01:04:04,145 --> 01:04:06,785
So he started the Hollow Forest,
something personal.

788
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:11,185
I just want to live a normal life

789
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,384
in a society where everything is normal.

790
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,625
Everyone is equal.

791
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:19,944
No matter your sexuality,
no one is seen as different.

792
01:04:42,024 --> 01:04:43,825
I used to wonder

793
01:04:43,904 --> 01:04:48,225
why he was so bold and true to himself.

794
01:04:49,984 --> 01:04:51,185
Why was that?

795
01:04:51,944 --> 01:04:54,145
It's because of his family, Tofu.

796
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,904
He told me that before.

797
01:04:57,384 --> 01:04:59,944
He must have told Nut the same thing.

798
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,065
Can I ask you something?

799
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:22,464
How do you accept it so easily?

800
01:05:23,825 --> 01:05:25,504
That I like boys?

801
01:05:28,585 --> 01:05:30,944
Weren't you ever confused?

802
01:05:32,225 --> 01:05:33,585
Everyone is.

803
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:36,544
I just knew myself early.

804
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,225
When I told my parents about it,

805
01:05:41,544 --> 01:05:45,065
they even told me
that I didn't have to come out.

806
01:05:46,384 --> 01:05:48,345
Even though I'm their child,

807
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,825
we are all human.

808
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:53,585
My mother also said

809
01:05:54,265 --> 01:05:55,345
that gay

810
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:58,105
also means joyful.

811
01:05:59,745 --> 01:06:01,145
Being gay is not wrong.

812
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,105
We can have fun in our lives like others.

813
01:06:08,145 --> 01:06:10,864
Your parents are nice.

814
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:12,625
Yes.

815
01:06:13,585 --> 01:06:15,225
My mother grew up abroad.

816
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:19,544
My father, though he worked
for his Chinese family,

817
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,984
later decided to start his own company.

818
01:06:23,345 --> 01:06:25,065
So I had some freedom.

819
01:06:30,145 --> 01:06:31,185
Unlike me.

820
01:06:32,464 --> 01:06:33,665
In my household…

821
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:37,065
My parents would never understand.

822
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:44,145
You don't need people to understand you.

823
01:06:45,424 --> 01:06:46,544
If telling them

824
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:51,105
means being uncomfortable
or causing problems,

825
01:06:51,185 --> 01:06:52,305
then don't tell them.

826
01:06:53,145 --> 01:06:56,944
If telling them about it makes you happy,

827
01:06:57,745 --> 01:06:59,544
then tell them when you are ready.

828
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:03,625
If I can prove myself to them,

829
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:06,585
so that they accept me,

830
01:07:07,225 --> 01:07:08,745
-then--
-Why?

831
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:13,145
Why should you struggle to be accepted
just because you are gay?

832
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:16,265
Do gay men have to be good-looking,

833
01:07:16,345 --> 01:07:19,065
capable, and respectable

834
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:21,185
to be accepted?

835
01:07:22,984 --> 01:07:27,065
Why can't they just accept us
as human beings?

836
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,504
You have nothing to prove.

837
01:07:39,585 --> 01:07:42,384
You should just be yourself.

838
01:07:42,944 --> 01:07:44,944
Live the life you want to live.

839
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:48,625
Got it?

840
01:08:20,945 --> 01:08:22,825
You didn't say you would bring a friend.

841
01:08:26,504 --> 01:08:28,784
He is not my friend.

842
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:35,185
I see. You're one of the film crew, right?

843
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:37,225
He looks older.

844
01:08:38,025 --> 01:08:39,584
I guess he's not your age.

845
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:46,065
He is actually older than me.

846
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:47,985
But…

847
01:08:48,464 --> 01:08:51,025
-Gen and I--
-Excuse me.

848
01:08:51,105 --> 01:08:52,664
We're still waiting for our food.

849
01:09:01,185 --> 01:09:04,865
Actually, Gen and I…

850
01:09:05,504 --> 01:09:06,384
We are…

851
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:08,865
Oops!

852
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,624
How clumsy of me.

853
01:09:10,704 --> 01:09:13,065
Excuse me. I spilled some water.

854
01:09:25,664 --> 01:09:27,025
Dad.

855
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,985
So, Gen and I…

856
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:32,384
We…

857
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:33,464
are…

858
01:09:35,825 --> 01:09:38,584
How are you, Suwat? I'm good.

859
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:40,225
Long time no see.

860
01:09:40,704 --> 01:09:43,185
What? Your kid got married?

861
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:45,145
When?

862
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:49,825
I can't believe your daughter
is old enough to even get married.

863
01:09:52,305 --> 01:09:56,105
My son is in his freshman year.
There's no hurry.

864
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:59,305
Kids these days grow up fast.

865
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:03,065
They are one thing today,
but tomorrow, they may change.

866
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:08,585
I'm not that old. I can wait.

867
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:11,145
I'll get a grandchild one day.

868
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:21,865
You never gave him a hint?

869
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:26,265
I wanted to tell him in one go.

870
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:29,624
More like you plan to kill me
along with it.

871
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:34,985
This is not how I thought it would go.

872
01:10:35,624 --> 01:10:38,825
My dad seems quite open-minded.

873
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:46,345
Some parents are open-minded
about other people's kids.

874
01:10:47,145 --> 01:10:48,704
When it comes to their own child,

875
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,305
they may be disappointed.

876
01:10:53,345 --> 01:10:54,905
Don't give up just yet.

877
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:56,865
Let me talk to my dad first.

878
01:10:59,145 --> 01:11:00,945
Let's make him accept us.

879
01:11:01,025 --> 01:11:02,624
I won't give up.

880
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:04,505
You won't give up either, right?

881
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,425
How can I give up?

882
01:11:12,505 --> 01:11:14,225
You flirted with me first.

883
01:11:14,744 --> 01:11:16,585
And I'm confident

884
01:11:16,664 --> 01:11:18,425
that I'm good enough.

885
01:11:21,305 --> 01:11:24,065
What right does he have
to disapprove of me?

886
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:31,265
If you think he really is open-minded,

887
01:11:32,865 --> 01:11:34,505
then we might have

888
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:36,784
just caught him off guard.

889
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:39,704
So we should just take it

890
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:43,145
one step at a time

891
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:45,624
until he gets used to it.

892
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,065
Just like what you said to your fans.

893
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:58,265
I'm glad I get to love you.

894
01:12:02,105 --> 01:12:03,624
There, there.

895
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:06,065
You crybaby.

896
01:12:07,025 --> 01:12:08,265
Come here.

897
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:09,865
I will console you.

898
01:12:11,385 --> 01:12:12,585
You want to console me?

899
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:14,784
You got it.

900
01:12:15,385 --> 01:12:17,185
What are you doing?

901
01:12:17,265 --> 01:12:18,865
Song.

902
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:21,145
No. Don't!

903
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:22,225
No, Song!

904
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:35,865
Come here.

905
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:38,225
Here. Get this.

906
01:12:38,305 --> 01:12:41,265
-Here.
-Song, what's wrong with you?

907
01:12:41,985 --> 01:12:44,065
Stay in there.

908
01:12:50,185 --> 01:12:51,465
Hey.

909
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:54,265
I'll get a new room and send you the bill.

910
01:12:55,865 --> 01:12:56,865
Don't!

911
01:12:58,865 --> 01:12:59,865
Don't.

912
01:12:59,945 --> 01:13:01,465
I was just

913
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:02,945
fooling around with Song.

914
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:07,025
You can leave now.

915
01:13:07,105 --> 01:13:08,704
See you tomorrow.

916
01:13:12,025 --> 01:13:13,704
Don't worry about it.

917
01:13:14,465 --> 01:13:15,945
We will get through this.

918
01:13:19,105 --> 01:13:21,664
I'll call you when I get to my room.

919
01:13:22,225 --> 01:13:23,825
All right. Go carefully.

920
01:13:24,585 --> 01:13:26,545
Go.

921
01:13:26,624 --> 01:13:29,225
Leave already.

922
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,345
Do you want some too?

923
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:27,385
When did you get back?

924
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:31,145
You love your work more than me.

925
01:14:32,065 --> 01:14:33,585
I got back ages ago.

926
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:36,025
You didn't even notice me.

927
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:38,784
You chose going sightseeing over me.

928
01:14:39,425 --> 01:14:40,624
Now, we are even.

929
01:14:43,305 --> 01:14:44,624
Isn't it boring

930
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,305
having to work while on a vacation?

931
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:50,065
I'm used to it.

932
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,465
But I'm not.

933
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:57,265
You keep checking your phone.

934
01:14:57,345 --> 01:15:00,425
You don't have enough time
to eat or sleep.

935
01:15:00,505 --> 01:15:02,585
You don't get any exercise.

936
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,225
And not to mention the benefits,
there's none.

937
01:15:05,784 --> 01:15:08,624
When the show was on-air,
you still took all the criticism.

938
01:15:09,265 --> 01:15:11,784
I know how much you love your work.

939
01:15:13,905 --> 01:15:14,945
What's up with you?

940
01:15:15,505 --> 01:15:17,065
You're being weird lately.

941
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:22,744
I'm worried about you.

942
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:32,065
I know

943
01:15:32,784 --> 01:15:35,185
how much you love this job.

944
01:15:38,225 --> 01:15:39,985
Are you really okay with it?

945
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:43,305
Of course, I am.

946
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:48,624
I knew doing this job
in a country like this wouldn't be easy.

947
01:15:50,065 --> 01:15:51,065
At first,

948
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:53,265
I just liked writing

949
01:15:53,824 --> 01:15:55,425
as my dad didn't let me do much.

950
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:58,505
Once I got to do it as a job though,

951
01:15:59,784 --> 01:16:01,145
I found out

952
01:16:01,744 --> 01:16:05,065
that writing can heal me.

953
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:10,704
It enables me to express
what I can't say directly.

954
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:14,824
Whenever I'm exhausted

955
01:16:15,585 --> 01:16:16,865
or I feel like giving up,

956
01:16:19,065 --> 01:16:23,624
I look back to the day
that I chose this path.

957
01:17:30,624 --> 01:17:33,744
Can you guess
which scene I liked the most?

958
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,664
The CGI one?

959
01:17:38,185 --> 01:17:39,585
You know me well.

960
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:42,065
The CGI scene is so seamless
and beautiful. I love it.

961
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:45,425
Now, I will try to guess
which scene you like?

962
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:48,585
Which one do you think I liked?

963
01:17:51,145 --> 01:17:52,385
The ending.

964
01:17:54,225 --> 01:17:55,465
How did you know?

965
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:57,465
Because I know you.

966
01:17:57,545 --> 01:17:58,865
I wanted to know

967
01:17:58,945 --> 01:18:00,225
at the end,

968
01:18:00,824 --> 01:18:03,065
if the character has to choose one way,

969
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,425
what is it going to be like?

970
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,345
If you really want to know,

971
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:09,905
why don't you write your own ending?

972
01:18:12,784 --> 01:18:14,465
Do you really think I could do it?

973
01:18:18,624 --> 01:18:21,704
If you like it, then give it a try.

974
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:27,784
My parents wouldn't like it.

975
01:18:28,905 --> 01:18:30,624
If you're doing what you love,

976
01:18:31,185 --> 01:18:33,105
why wouldn't they like it?

977
01:18:34,945 --> 01:18:36,385
I believe in you.

978
01:18:38,865 --> 01:18:40,425
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

979
01:18:45,704 --> 01:18:47,624
I still remember that feeling.

980
01:18:48,385 --> 01:18:49,865
It's like falling in love.

981
01:18:50,505 --> 01:18:52,145
It's like you finally found someone.

982
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:55,545
I'm lucky to have found what I like early.

983
01:18:56,824 --> 01:18:58,664
Though along the way,

984
01:18:58,744 --> 01:19:00,265
it wasn't easy at all.

985
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:03,784
Nut.

986
01:19:07,985 --> 01:19:08,985
What's wrong?

987
01:19:11,865 --> 01:19:14,425
I didn't get in the short story contest.

988
01:19:16,145 --> 01:19:17,905
I didn't get a prize.

989
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:22,065
Were you confident that you would win?

990
01:19:24,065 --> 01:19:25,345
Of course, I was.

991
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:28,225
I put a lot of effort into it.

992
01:19:28,824 --> 01:19:31,345
I thought I might win something, at least.

993
01:19:33,744 --> 01:19:35,704
Writing is like art.

994
01:19:36,425 --> 01:19:37,905
There's no right and wrong.

995
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:39,585
When you turn it in,

996
01:19:40,145 --> 01:19:42,265
it's a matter of what the judges like.

997
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:44,585
Don't forget

998
01:19:45,345 --> 01:19:47,865
that art serves no one

999
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:50,545
and it is a slave to none.

1000
01:19:51,345 --> 01:19:52,465
Therefore,

1001
01:19:53,345 --> 01:19:55,784
I don't want you to pressure yourself
just to win.

1002
01:19:56,744 --> 01:19:58,145
It is okay to lose.

1003
01:19:58,624 --> 01:20:00,624
Whether you make it or not is fine.

1004
01:20:01,185 --> 01:20:02,905
Along the way,

1005
01:20:03,784 --> 01:20:05,545
I hope you are happy with it.

1006
01:20:08,545 --> 01:20:10,505
But happiness won't feed you.

1007
01:20:11,664 --> 01:20:14,065
I wanted the prize money
to pay for my tuition,

1008
01:20:14,985 --> 01:20:16,985
in case I have to support myself

1009
01:20:18,345 --> 01:20:20,145
when I go to college.

1010
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,704
You can try again.

1011
01:20:24,385 --> 01:20:27,265
Gain more experience by trial and error.

1012
01:20:30,145 --> 01:20:31,225
I believe that

1013
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:34,945
one day, someone will like your work.

1014
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:40,345
You've got this. I'm here for you.

1015
01:20:45,704 --> 01:20:49,865
Juea really likes your work.

1016
01:20:53,465 --> 01:20:54,505
So…

1017
01:20:55,905 --> 01:20:58,585
did you work with Juea from the beginning?

1018
01:21:01,225 --> 01:21:03,185
Juea and I get along.

1019
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:05,105
So working together is easy.

1020
01:21:06,065 --> 01:21:08,065
Still, I can't say that I'm successful.

1021
01:21:10,425 --> 01:21:11,865
But if I keep going,

1022
01:21:13,345 --> 01:21:15,664
I can still write what I want to say.

1023
01:21:19,704 --> 01:21:21,624
What do you want to tell people

1024
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,185
from the story you are working on?

1025
01:21:29,265 --> 01:21:30,704
I want to tell them

1026
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:33,744
that the country that exports shows
about boys' love,

1027
01:21:34,664 --> 01:21:36,624
has the prettiest transgender people,

1028
01:21:37,985 --> 01:21:39,784
and has gay couples as net idols,

1029
01:21:40,744 --> 01:21:42,824
doesn't support the rights
for those people,

1030
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,305
as they aren't truly accepted there.

1031
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:54,185
I also want to tell him

1032
01:21:57,265 --> 01:21:59,545
that even though it has been a decade,

1033
01:22:01,185 --> 01:22:02,905
I still want to apologize,

1034
01:22:05,265 --> 01:22:06,664
and express my gratitude.

1035
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:12,145
He is a good memory,

1036
01:22:14,545 --> 01:22:16,945
an inspiration that made me who I am,

1037
01:22:19,385 --> 01:22:21,105
and the one who made me love myself.

1038
01:22:26,865 --> 01:22:28,065
Then…

1039
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:31,945
your show should have
a happy ending, right?

1040
01:22:34,744 --> 01:22:37,905
Hey. Are you jealous of my work now?

1041
01:22:40,905 --> 01:22:42,505
I'm just curious.

1042
01:22:43,585 --> 01:22:46,585
Don't forget that I'm a fan of your work,

1043
01:22:47,425 --> 01:22:49,105
and a fan of yours.

1044
01:22:52,145 --> 01:22:54,145
It will have a bad ending like my life.

1045
01:22:55,985 --> 01:22:57,905
I don't want to turn back time.

1046
01:22:57,985 --> 01:22:59,145
I want to move forward.

1047
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:03,985
And don't make me tell you

1048
01:23:04,624 --> 01:23:06,545
who…

1049
01:23:08,265 --> 01:23:09,345
keeps me going.

1050
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:57,905
Nut and Tatarn

1051
01:23:58,505 --> 01:24:01,585
reminded me of a quote
from a book that I read.

1052
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:04,145
It said,

1053
01:24:04,784 --> 01:24:07,905
"Good love makes us want to grow
into a better person,

1054
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:11,865
and makes us love ourselves more
as we love that person."

1055
01:24:14,065 --> 01:24:16,425
Nut is who he is today

1056
01:24:16,505 --> 01:24:18,545
as a result of Tatarn's love.

1057
01:24:19,664 --> 01:24:20,784
Therefore,

1058
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,985
at such a critical time for Tatarn,

1059
01:24:24,985 --> 01:24:27,185
if Nut can help him,

1060
01:24:28,185 --> 01:24:29,744
then I should be glad.

1061
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:32,105
Right?

1062
01:24:51,664 --> 01:24:53,065
Didn't you get any sleep?

1063
01:24:54,704 --> 01:24:55,985
Are you all right?

1064
01:24:57,385 --> 01:24:59,824
A lot of strange things
have been happening lately.

1065
01:25:03,065 --> 01:25:04,945
I'm beginning to see some images.

1066
01:25:07,784 --> 01:25:09,265
There was a place.

1067
01:25:11,585 --> 01:25:12,664
There was a person.

1068
01:25:17,505 --> 01:25:19,065
Are you regaining your memory?

1069
01:25:21,545 --> 01:25:23,185
I'm not sure about it.

1070
01:25:28,784 --> 01:25:30,664
Let's go to the doctor.

1071
01:25:32,505 --> 01:25:34,265
I don't want to remember it.

1072
01:25:37,385 --> 01:25:38,585
I'm afraid,

1073
01:25:41,505 --> 01:25:43,185
but also curious.

1074
01:25:46,025 --> 01:25:47,185
Tofu.

1075
01:25:52,624 --> 01:25:53,784
It's okay.

1076
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:56,744
I will be here for you.

1077
01:26:03,145 --> 01:26:04,265
Nut.

1078
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,225
The real reason
I brought you to Chiang Mai

1079
01:26:11,744 --> 01:26:13,704
is that I saw an image of a man

1080
01:26:16,065 --> 01:26:17,065
here.

1081
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:22,585
So, did you used to live here?

1082
01:26:24,824 --> 01:26:26,305
I don't know.

1083
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:32,585
Can we go somewhere?

1084
01:26:35,225 --> 01:26:36,265
Being there,

1085
01:26:37,784 --> 01:26:40,065
I might find out the truth.

1086
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:58,345
Tofu.

1087
01:26:59,985 --> 01:27:01,145
Are you scared?

1088
01:27:04,545 --> 01:27:05,824
I don't know…

1089
01:27:07,065 --> 01:27:09,065
what will happen to me

1090
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:12,905
if I take you to see him.

1091
01:27:14,864 --> 01:27:17,744
We will finally get to know who you are.

1092
01:27:34,784 --> 01:27:36,985
You're afraid
that we can't be together, right?

1093
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:41,425
That's right.

1094
01:27:49,704 --> 01:27:51,824
If he's really someone in your family,

1095
01:27:52,864 --> 01:27:54,465
we can talk to him

1096
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,585
and ask if you can stay with us.

1097
01:27:57,145 --> 01:27:59,704
My mother and I don't look like
bad people, do we?

1098
01:28:02,505 --> 01:28:05,585
Why did you bring us to the hospital?

1099
01:28:07,025 --> 01:28:10,784
Tofu's cousin may be a doctor,
like your mom.

1100
01:28:11,345 --> 01:28:12,465
Am I right?

1101
01:28:14,744 --> 01:28:16,065
Is he sick?

1102
01:28:18,425 --> 01:28:20,704
Why is the person you saw in the hospital?

1103
01:28:20,784 --> 01:28:22,145
Who is he?

1104
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:26,465
Tarn.

1105
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,465
Is that Tarn, Neung's friend?

1106
01:29:57,465 --> 01:29:59,465
The person you remembered is Tarn?

1107
01:30:12,505 --> 01:30:14,905
I was scared that if I brought you to him,

1108
01:30:16,824 --> 01:30:18,664
I would lose you.

1109
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:25,025
Na must be really happy that her son…

1110
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:28,185
Everybody has a gender.

1111
01:30:28,265 --> 01:30:30,585
You can be any gender you wish to be.

1112
01:30:31,145 --> 01:30:33,624
And every gender is equal.

1113
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:36,185
I'm glad you can be yourself

1114
01:30:36,985 --> 01:30:39,145
whenever you are with me.

1115
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,025
If something is troubling you,

1116
01:30:43,585 --> 01:30:45,345
I'll be the one to ease your mind.

1117
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:57,425
