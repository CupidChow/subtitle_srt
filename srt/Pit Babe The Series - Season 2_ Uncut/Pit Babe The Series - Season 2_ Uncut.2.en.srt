1
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,000
Way!

2
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,360
It’s okay.

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,200
I’m here now.

4
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
My name’s Willy.

5
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,120
I’m the new king of the track now.
He’s too in love to notice the dust settling.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
– Kid.
– Yes, sir.

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,240
Alpha's not looking good.

8
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,120
Pete, what’s wrong with him?

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
Way?

10
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Shit...

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,960
The new researcher at Pete’s lab
looks just like Way. Look!

12
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
Damn, he really does!

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,800
He’s practically a clone.

14
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,160
Let me see that.

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
But Way doesn’t have any relatives, does he?

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,480
Is it even possible for people
to look that alike without being related?

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
Is this what you call a doppelgänger, Charlie?

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,120
In scientific terms...

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
We call people who look alike...

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
but share no DNA connection at all...

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
...as a doppelgänger.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,079
Even though it's unlikely,

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,520
it doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
I don’t think that’s it.

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Can we really explain it
with something so vague?

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
But this guy named Chris—

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
I think he might be involved
in Way’s death.

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
What do you think?

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,200
But Pete already ran the tests.
Chris wasn’t lying.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,960
I think you’re overthinking it.

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
Exactly, Babe.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,240
No matter how badly
I want Way to still be alive...

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,840
that day at Tony’s house—

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,160
everyone saw it. Way is gone.

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,760
And the guy behind it all Tony is dead too.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,600
But there’s still so much in this world.

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Sometimes it might just be nothing.

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,800
That’s true, seriously.
The world’s a huge place.

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,400
There’s still so much we don’t know.

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
– Mhm.
– Yeah.

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,600
You talk like you’ve ever left the garage.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,120
Come on, North...

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,160
You’re overthinking it.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
Fine, maybe I am.

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,000
If Babe’s worried, maybe we should
just keep an eye on Chris instead.

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,400
Better than guessing and arguing like this.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,200
Doppelgänger, right?

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
Doppelgänger...

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
Okay.

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Since the day I arrived...

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,560
I’ve been a bit busy lately.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,120
So I haven’t reached out.

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
Sorry about that.

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
I’ll go back soon anyway.
I still have school.

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Alright then, I’ll leave it here for now.

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,160
I’ll message you again later.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Hey, Sonic.

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,320
Who were you talking to?

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,600
Actually, I came to ask you—

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,480
wanna go get some food?

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
There’s a new grilled
pork place next to the garage.

62
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,880
I’ll invite the others too.

63
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,920
Didn’t you see how the guys were feeling?

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
They just saw someone who looks like Way.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
Who’d be in the mood to eat?

66
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,040
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

67
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,280
Not talking, not eating, not meeting up?

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,520
No. Why would I do that?

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
About eating together...

70
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Let’s wait until things settle down first.

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,600
Will that be before you leave for Paris though?

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
I don’t know.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,040
If not, I guess you’ll have to wait
until I come back next time.

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,240
So, what’s up?
What are you guys doing?

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,200
On the rocks, please.

76
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,400
Were you following me?

77
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,440
I just asked Touch where I might find you.

78
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,040
There’s something I wanted to talk about.

79
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,360
Let me be clear.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,680
I’m here to work in your lab as a researcher.

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,920
And I won’t leave until my work is done.

82
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Are you talking about the skill-nullifying drug?

83
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,560
Lately I’ve been hearing rumors...

84
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,240
that someone’s been spending big money
to recruit researchers.

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,760
But when I asked around,

86
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,120
no one would give me a straight answer.

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Doesn’t this all seem a bit shady to you?

88
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Like I said...

89
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,760
Right now, I’m the one
you can trust the most.

90
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,680
So, can I join your team now?

91
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,480
Babe, I’m coming with you.

92
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,600
Babe, maybe you should calm down.

93
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
I’m fine, okay?

94
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,440
I know you're under a lot of stress.

95
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have run off like that.

96
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,280
Good thing I caught you in time.

97
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,360
You really do know me inside out.

98
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,600
We’ve got training tomorrow morning.

99
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,080
Everyone says I’ve gotten rusty lately.

100
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
Time to step things up.

101
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,880
I can’t lose to that rookie in the next match.

102
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,040
You mean Willy?

103
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,880
It was just one time, wasn’t it?

104
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,240
Mama will bounce back and win again.

105
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
You better be careful even if you’ve got a gift,

106
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,320
if you don’t train,
he’ll eventually take your place.

107
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,320
You really think Willy’s that good?

108
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,200
He’s about as good as I am.

109
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,280
But one thing for sure—

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
he’s better than you.

111
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
What?

112
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
If Papa keeps slacking like this,

113
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,120
Mama might start paying
attention to the new guy.

114
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,360
He’s got the vibes, that’s for sure.

115
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,560
If that’s the case—

116
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,520
I’ll prove it to you in the next match.

117
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
How much I’ve improved.

118
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,080
So you won’t have to look at anyone else.

119
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,800
Aww... are you sulking or jealous?

120
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,760
You little mutt, Charlie.

121
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,640
Let’s go.

122
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
Hurry up.

123
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,880
Hurry up, go in!

124
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,840
Shit...

125
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,080
Surprised, aren’t you?

126
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
Wondering why I’m still here...

127
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,800
instead of lying in a coffin?

128
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,880
Every one of my kids...

129
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,600
needs to be taught a lesson
for what they did to Daddy.

130
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,880
Well, if there’s anything you want, Tony...

131
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,480
just let me know.

132
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,000
I’m always willing to serve those I owe.

133
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,320
You...

134
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
I’m willing to give you another chance.

135
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,200
Even though you once tried to kill me.

136
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,160
You’ve probably...

137
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,360
been cared for and served enough already.

138
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,680
You don’t need me.

139
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,720
From now on, do whatever you like.

140
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,040
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

141
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,120
Kenta.

142
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,280
If one day you decide to come back...

143
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Daddy will always welcome you home.

144
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,200
I don’t have a dad.

145
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Aren’t you gonna deal with Kenta, Tony?

146
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,280
Kenta?

147
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,520
He’s not the one I’m after right now.

148
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,480
You mean... X-Hunter’s the real target?

149
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,560
Just wait and see.

150
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,520
The game’s just getting good.

151
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,800
Because the person I planted...

152
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,160
is gonna tear X-Hunter apart.

153
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,600
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,240
(Chen Foundation's chairman dies during auction)

155
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,120
(Shock in the racing world
famous driver found dead)

156
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,760
Uncle, what are you doing?

157
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
What’s got you so lost in thought?

158
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,000
Get up.

159
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
Watch your step.

160
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,200
Stressing out and fixing stuff again?

161
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,880
How’d you know?

162
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,880
You reading my mind or something?

163
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,600
It’s Pete’s new researcher that’s bugging me.

164
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,600
Having someone who looks exactly like Way
suddenly show up so close...

165
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
It’s not easy to accept.

166
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,760
You think someone planned it?

167
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,040
Why’d you comfort Babe back at the garage,

168
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
telling him it was just a coincidence,

169
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,520
but now you’re overthinking it yourself?

170
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,960
What can I say?

171
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,640
I know how Babe is.

172
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,319
I just don’t want him to do anything reckless.

173
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,760
You rushed in without checking things first.

174
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,080
You miss Way too, don’t you, Uncle?

175
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,200
Missing him won’t change a thing.

176
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
I know that skill-nullifying drug...

177
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,800
means a lot to you, Charlie.

178
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,080
And to every gifted human out there.

179
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,600
We just need Chris to actually help make it real.

180
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,840
But hey, hear me out—

181
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,320
maybe you won’t need the drug after all.

182
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,480
That brilliant kid Alan has already
controlled his sense for over a year.

183
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,560
What’s wrong? Why that face?

184
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,800
Don’t tell me... you still
want your sense gone for good?

185
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,840
Or are you starting
to feel a bit attached to it?

186
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,480
Why would I feel attached?

187
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,400
Do you want me to keep it?

188
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,640
Nah, that’s totally up to you.

189
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,760
Quit fixing random stuff
when you're stressed.

190
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,960
Go! Find me something good to eat.

191
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,480
Hmm... but I’m not hungry for food anymore.

192
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,960
I’m hungry for boys.

193
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,960
Can I take a bite out of you?

194
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
– Uncle...
– Just a little taste?

195
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
Come on, bring it on!

196
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,880
Whoa, Babe!

197
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,560
Training already this early?

198
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,240
You’re way too pumped.

199
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
I train like this every single day.

200
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,240
And from now on,
I’m going even harder—just watch me.

201
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,680
But pushing yourself
too far’s not good either, bro.

202
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Take a break sometimes.

203
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,040
Don’t bother trying to stop Babe.

204
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,720
He won’t rest...

205
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,120
until he’s number one on the track again.

206
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,480
This because of that guy—Willy or whatever?

207
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,760
I’m stressing out too, y’know.

208
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,040
I gotta train harder as well.

209
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,000
Can’t let Willy sneak up
and ride side by side with Babe.

210
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,240
God, help us.

211
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,120
Both of you are so stressed.
Hey, chill out a little, will you?

212
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,680
Being a champ isn’t about one match.

213
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,240
It’s about total points in the end.

214
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,720
But Kim just left our team, remember?

215
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,320
So how are we supposed to turn this around?

216
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,360
You’re right. ETA’s got three racers.

217
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,800
But we’re down to just Babe and Charlie now.

218
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,160
Uncle, we’re totally outnumbered like this.

219
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,200
All we need is a new racer to replace Kim.

220
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,760
How hard can that be?

221
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,240
Easy for you to say.
The new season’s already started.

222
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,400
Who’d want to switch teams halfway through?

223
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,000
Alan.

224
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,760
I’ll help train Charlie myself.

225
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,120
You just focus on coming up
with a plan for just me and him.

226
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,080
Next race...

227
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,680
I’m taking that win for sure.

228
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Honestly, I don’t need some super skilled racer.

229
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,200
I need someone who gets how our team works.

230
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
Skills can be trained.

231
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,960
But attitude? That’s what really matters.

232
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,920
Yeah, I get that, bro.

233
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,720
Still, if we bring in someone new,

234
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,360
it’s gonna take time
for them to click with the team.

235
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,480
That’s true.

236
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,760
So it’s gotta be someone
who’s been with us a while.

237
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,000
North, this year you’re
moving up to the main league.

238
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
Wait—seriously, Uncle?

239
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,280
Dead serious, man.

240
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,960
North, that’s awesome!

241
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,280
Congrats, dude.

242
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,600
Dude, you're playing in the big league now!

243
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
So happy for you, man.

244
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,520
But don’t think going big
means you can chill, alright?

245
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,200
I’m gonna train you
and Charlie hard, so get ready.

246
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
Bring it on, Babe. I can take it!

247
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Oh yeah? “Take it,” huh?

248
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,160
This kind of training’s brutal, y’know?

249
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
Hey, Uncle.

250
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
When Kim quit...

251
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
he took his personal mechanic with him.

252
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
So what now? Who’s gonna help out?

253
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
I don’t think Jeff can handle all of it alone.

254
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,680
And who said I’d let my boyfriend
do everything by himself?

255
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,360
You can come in now.

256
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,040
Dean?!

257
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,920
– Babe.
– Babe!

258
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,040
Chill out, Babe!

259
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,600
Calm down, alright? Chill!

260
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
What the hell’s going on, Alan?

261
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,560
Well, last night...

262
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,760
Don’t, Alan. It’s me.

263
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,280
Dean…

264
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
Are you telling me...

265
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,040
someone just released you,
Winner, and Kenta?

266
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,480
Yeah, that’s right.

267
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
At first, they told me to go with them.

268
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,280
And who exactly are “they”?

269
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,560
I don’t know either.

270
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,160
But they seemed… powerful.

271
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,880
Powerful enough to break people out of prison.

272
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,880
Alan, please don’t worry about me.

273
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,360
I’m leaving first thing tomorrow.
Just needed a place to lay low tonight.

274
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,240
I’ve got nowhere else to go.

275
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,960
Where will you go after this?

276
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,720
I don’t really know.

277
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,360
Maybe somewhere upcountry.

278
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,560
Find something to do… start over again.

279
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Do you wanna come back and work at the garage?

280
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,720
Alan… I’ve wronged you so many times.

281
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,960
You've helped me so much already.

282
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I don’t want to be a burden on you again.

283
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,240
And even if I do come back…

284
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,000
Do you really think
the others will be okay with it?

285
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,160
You’re the one who broke their trust.

286
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,280
If you want it back,
you’ll have to earn it.

287
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,840
I believe everyone deserves a second chance.

288
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,640
Whatever happened—leave it in the past.

289
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,520
Because no matter what…

290
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,760
You’re still part of this family.

291
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,040
Thank you, Alan.

292
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,480
I’m sorry, Babe.

293
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,320
He just got out of prison.
He’s got nowhere else to go.

294
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,880
Dean made a lot of mistakes with you…

295
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,400
So whether he stays
or goes—it’s your call.

296
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
But you almost killed Babe, Dean.

297
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
I know.

298
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,760
That’s why I wanted to apologize in person.

299
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,760
I want you to know… I really do regret it.

300
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,520
I’m truly sorry, Babe.

301
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,000
But if you’re not okay with this…

302
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,560
I promise I’ll never come back here again.

303
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,000
Honestly, I get it. They used you.

304
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,280
They wanted you to move up to pro, right?

305
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
Yeah.

306
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,200
But from now on, I’m done racing.

307
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,920
That’s not my goal anymore.

308
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,680
All I want now… is to earn back your trust.

309
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,560
I’d like to work at
the garage again—as a mechanic.

310
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,760
You don’t have to worry.

311
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,760
I already run the pit crew myself.

312
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,720
Dean can work with me.

313
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,600
That way everyone knows
nothing shady’s going on.

314
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,720
You and Babe can stop stressing.

315
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,960
He works under me…

316
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,800
Trust me, he won’t have time to mess around.

317
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,520
But if Dean’s staying at the garage…

318
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,280
North, hide all the damn wrenches.

319
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,120
Just looking at them freaks me out.

320
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,280
So… does that mean
I’m officially back at the garage?

321
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Yeah.

322
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,360
But only because of Alan.

323
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,920
Thanks, Babe,
for giving me a second chance.

324
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,240
Thanks, man. Really, Babe.

325
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,960
And you too, Charlie.

326
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,080
For at least trying to understand.

327
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,160
It’s alright.

328
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,560
I trust you, Jeff, and Charlie.

329
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,600
Always have.

330
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,600
Now go collect the wrenches.

331
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,040
What are you waiting for?

332
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,440
– For real?
– Yeah. All of them.

333
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,160
Stop smiling, Dean. This is your fault.

334
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Go help North.

335
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Right now?

336
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,320
– Get moving.
– Got it!

337
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,080
Babe, seriously… whoa.

338
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,480
First day of training
and North's already puking.

339
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,640
Babe and Charlie totally ganged up on me.

340
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,800
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have messed up.

341
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,800
No kidding.

342
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,120
That’s how it works.
Better learn now than get wrecked later.

343
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,840
Still, North—gotta say, not bad this round.

344
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,280
Dean, help check North’s ride later, alright?

345
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,680
Got it, bro.

346
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,760
Did Jeff catch up yet?

347
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,960
– Let him in already.
– You serious?

348
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Jeff just wants to make sure you’re all okay.

349
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Say hi so he can stop worrying.

350
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,040
Use this chance to push yourself hard too.

351
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,880
Don’t mess up again.

352
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,880
Come on, chill. It was just one slip.

353
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
That’s all.

354
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,760
Sure thing.

355
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,920
Let’s go, Charlie.

356
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,520
Our little X-Hunter is back in action.

357
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,840
How’s the drive feel just now?

358
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,200
Too light, honestly.

359
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,840
Hey, come on—engine’s already solid!

360
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,600
Probably not the engine—just a weak driver.

361
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,560
– I tuned it perfectly, you know.
– Yeah, and Dean’s the one who worked on it.

362
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,720
Hey! Say that again
and I’ll stop tuning your car!

363
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,560
Oh hey, Babe! What’s up?

364
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,240
You and I aren’t that close, dude.

365
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,640
Oh, come on now.

366
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,080
We’re in the same scene.

367
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,760
No harm in knowing each other, right?

368
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,400
Wouldn’t you wanna get to know me too?

369
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,440
Why the hell would I care to
know someone from a rival team?

370
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
Well, I wanna know you.

371
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,760
You’re literally my idol.

372
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,400
I started racing...

373
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,840
...because I wanted to be like you.

374
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,960
I’ve watched every match you raced in.

375
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,120
I could quote your stats by heart.

376
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,400
And what?

377
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,880
You’re not the first fanboy
trying to get close to me.

378
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,640
And you won’t be the last either.

379
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,040
But the last guy who tried this approach...

380
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
...ended up being your boyfriend, right?

381
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,440
Don’t I get a shot too?

382
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,640
I mean, honestly,

383
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
I’ve got more charm than Charlie, don’t I?

384
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,880
I don’t care for crap
that comes out of a dog’s mouth like yours.

385
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,120
But let me say this once.

386
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,560
Don’t you dare mention my boyfriend.

387
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,480
Fine, I won’t.

388
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
So where is your boyfriend tonight?

389
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,480
Usually you two are glued together.

390
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,040
Would it kill you to mind
your own business for once?

391
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,320
Just saying—looks like you’re free tonight.

392
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,640
Let me buy you a drink.

393
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
Pretend you’re single for a night.
What’s the harm?

394
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,560
These chances don’t come by often.

395
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,400
You used to go out with
any Alpha who was hot enough.

396
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,480
As long as he was good-looking...

397
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,600
...and spicy.

398
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,120
A few moves in bed didn’t hurt either, right?

399
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
You seriously won’t quit, will you?

400
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,280
Come on, I’ve got premium quality.

401
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
You sure you’re not even a little tempted?

402
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
Sorry, dude.

403
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,679
The stench of an Alpha makes me sick.

404
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,320
If it stinks, then it stinks.

405
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,880
But you had to get that close

406
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,440
just to notice it?

407
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,360
Did you lose your senses completely?

408
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,080
I told you to back off, didn’t I?

409
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,320
Just guessing, that's all.

410
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,199
You were close enough for a sniff, after all.

411
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,960
No senses—so that's why you lost to me?

412
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,280
Let me get this straight—Pit Babe

413
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,240
can still crush a loser
like you without any senses.

414
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,600
Then how about we do something fun, Pit Babe?

415
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,520
You game or not, Pit Babe?

416
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,960
Actually, the latest
formula gave a result

417
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,600
similar to what Uncle
Rawin once injected into me.

418
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,680
Even the cells seem to be
changing for the better.

419
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,400
Honestly,

420
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,320
if we combine those two formulas together...

421
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,800
and refine the formula,
we might get something great.

422
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,560
Got it. I’ll prep everything for you, Chris.

423
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,280
-I'm counting on you.
-You got it.

424
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,360
Charlie.

425
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
Is that Babe over there?

426
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,640
Let’s race. Come on.

427
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,160
What should we bet on?

428
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,720
If you lose,

429
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
then stop sticking your nose in my business.

430
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,280
And if I win?

431
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,200
You go home with me tonight.

432
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,080
Two laps.

433
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Whoever finishes first, wins.

434
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,720
Willy! Willy! Willy!

435
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,040
Willy! Willy! Willy!

436
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,840
Willy! Willy! Willy!

437
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
You really are the forever number one.

438
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,680
You never disappoint.

439
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,040
Now that it’s done,
back off and leave me alone.

440
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,440
But I’m your biggest fan.

441
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,520
Can I get a selfie with you?

442
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,440
What the hell are you doing?

443
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,560
I told you to leave me the fuck alone.

444
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Good night, Babe.

445
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,440
Oh hey, Charlie.

446
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,680
Out having fun tonight?

447
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,920
Well, you got home late.
I didn’t wanna be alone.

448
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,320
Late? What do you mean?

449
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,880
I literally got home before you, Babe.

450
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,120
Did you go out drinking?

451
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,760
Just a little. Barely had anything.

452
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,640
What?

453
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,880
Fine, I’m sorry.

454
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,400
I only had a bit, seriously. I’m fine.

455
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,000
Was the bar super packed or what?

456
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,440
Why do I smell Alpha all over you?

457
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,560
Same as always. Nothing new.

458
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,880
So your skill-nullifying drug isn’t ready yet?

459
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,920
Your sense is still sharp as ever.

460
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
I’m still working on it.

461
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,160
Did you have fun today, Babe?

462
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,280
Going out all by yourself without me?

463
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
Not really.

464
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,440
But seriously, Charlie,
I only had one drink. Just one.

465
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,560
Charlie.

466
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,840
Don’t start, okay?

467
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,320
I’ve got a race coming up,
no more drinks, I promise.

468
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,480
If you weren’t having fun,
why didn’t you just come home?

469
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,920
There’s something real good
waiting for you here.

470
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,680
And that something good… is mine, right?

471
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,600
What are you even doing?

472
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
Charlie.

473
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
Don’t you want me, Babe?

474
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,240
Truth is, I wanted you the second I walked in

475
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,480
and saw my puppy waiting on the couch.

476
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,480
Ow, Charlie! Did you just bite me? That hurt.

477
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,360
Papa.

478
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,040
Why so rough tonight?

479
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,880
Naughty boys deserve punishment.

480
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,840
I trained you myself.

481
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,640
But you still lost to him, Charlie.

482
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,720
If Papa keeps this up,

483
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,160
Mama might just go fall for someone new.

484
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,880
You suddenly got up and made fried rice?

485
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,880
Is something going on?

486
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,960
Well, Papa went all out last night.

487
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,680
Woke up starving.

488
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,160
Come sit.

489
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,600
-Looks good?
-Mhm.

490
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,880
Charlie.

491
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,560
Notice anything?

492
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,120
Told you not to make it obvious here.

493
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,520
Alan and North are totally gonna tease me.

494
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,760
But I *want* people to see.

495
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,920
So they know you're already taken.

496
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,840
Wasn't it obvious enough last night?

497
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,840
You already own all of me, Charlie.

498
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,280
Still... gotta admit, it’s kinda sexy.

499
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,400
So you staying in today,
Babe? It’s your day off, right?

500
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
Or are you heading somewhere?

501
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Got a training session with Alan today.

502
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,240
But it’s your day off.

503
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,520
Which means no work allowed.

504
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,560
Which means more time to train, duh.

505
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,720
Wanna come with me then?

506
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,280
Can’t. I’ve got to go to the lab today.

507
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
The lab again? It’s always the lab.

508
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,880
Hurry up and finish that stuff
so we can go somewhere.

509
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,240
Go somewhere?

510
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah, of course.

511
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,240
It’s been ages since
we went anywhere together.

512
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,080
You’re always at the track,
I’m always in the lab.

513
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,040
That’s our whole life.

514
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,600
So where do you wanna go?
I’ll book it in advance.

515
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,800
Wherever you want.

516
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,440
Let me finish the skill-suppressant first.

517
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,720
Then we’ll go for real.

518
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,840
-That’s a promise.
-Mhm, promise.

519
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Come on, let’s eat.

520
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,880
Here you go.

521
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,680
I reviewed your bloodwork report.

522
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,840
You’ve used a skill-suppressant
before, haven’t you?

523
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Yeah. I was actually
the main test subject in the beginning.

524
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,920
But lately, a few other
special Alphas joined in too.

525
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,360
Peach got worried I couldn’t handle it.

526
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,320
So you’re saying that before this...

527
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,400
none of the drugs worked on you?

528
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,880
Not a single one.

529
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
From what I’ve seen...

530
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,400
your cells are way
more resilient than average.

531
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,320
If we can decode that...

532
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,640
we might be able to unlock
a new breakthrough in suppressants.

533
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,280
So what do I need to do?

534
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,440
You’re not in a rush today, are you?

535
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,560
Jeff, anyone else coming
to train at the garage today?

536
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,480
Alan said Babe might swing by to train.

537
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,280
Babe’s coming in?

538
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,880
What about the others?

539
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,720
North’s not coming today.

540
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,120
Dean, once you're done, you can head out.
I’ll handle the rest.

541
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,200
-Okay. I’ll head off then.
-See ya.

542
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,400
Uncle, call Babe now! It’s urgent!

543
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,200
You might not believe
what I’m about to tell you...

544
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,480
But the scariest one of all... is back.

545
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,680
Can I eat this?

546
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,520
If it doesn’t kill me,
I’ll eat it. No biggie.

547
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,640
You got this. Trust me.

548
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,520
Think hard about it—

549
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,200
what does the word
“boyfriend” even mean to you?

550
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,440
But your boyfriend’s not here right now...

551
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,920
So how about I take care
of you in the meantime?

552
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,160
What are you doing?

553
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,160
Charlie.

554
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,920
(Danger zone) Daddy...

555
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,320
(The shirt’s still intact)

556
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,440
Oww, that hurt
(Whiny baby mode activated)

557
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,480
The shot’s hard to get right, okay

558
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,440
(Babe going full savage)

559
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,440
Look at how he’s sitting

560
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,800
(Jealous teasing vibes)

561
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,440
Sneaking pics?
Are you snapping Charlie in secret?

562
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,520
Chris! Babe!

563
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,320
(Glued to each other)

564
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,320
(Uncle's acting like it's VR)

565
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,080
Watch your step

566
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,440
Hold up—cut for a sec

567
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
Let the crew sweep the floor first
