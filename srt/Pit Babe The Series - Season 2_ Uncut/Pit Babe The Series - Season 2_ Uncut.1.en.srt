1
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,320
All this time I’ve been right by your side.

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Do you really not see how I feel?

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,280
How could you do this, Way?

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,720
And if I didn’t, do you have a better plan?

5
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you know any way to make Tony back off?

6
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,759
Make him stop bothering me
or stop messing with the whole team?

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,120
I love you, Babe.

8
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,080
Way

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
Another nightmare, Babe?

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
Let it go.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Try to sleep, okay?

12
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,560
It’s all right.

13
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
I’m right here now.

14
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,360
I’ll protect you.

15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,440
You don’t have to be afraid of anything.

16
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,960
Someone like me’s got nothing to fear.

17
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,760
You’re being ridiculous.

18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,160
If that’s the case…

19
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,720
Should I help you dream sweet again?

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,560
Again, Papa? Really?

21
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
Go to sleep now.

23
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,040
You’re asking the wrong person, Mama.

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,160
Mama…

25
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
can go all night.

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
That’s the spirit, Mama.

27
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,040
Papa loves Mama.

28
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Mama loves Papa too.

29
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
Welcome to all racing teams…

30
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
to the new format of The Hallow.

31
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,760
Please bring your cars to the starting line.

32
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,680
This is the long-awaited season opener.

33
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
You'll be facing the
king of the track, No. 1 in stats.

34
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
The undefeated, reigning champion.

35
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,840
It’s Pitbabe.

36
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
And that’s not all…Team X-Hunter

37
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,600
secures their title shot
with a second pro racer.

38
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
One so iconic you won’t forget them.

39
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,320
The prince of The Hallows…Charlie!!

40
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
You’ve got a lot of fans these days.

41
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,720
But I’m still your only real fan.

42
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,640
Obviously, you’re hot.

43
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
But if we weren’t on the same team…

44
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,200
I might’ve been No. 1 by now.

45
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,280
You guys seriously
picking a fight from round one?

46
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,920
Save it for the next matches, will you?

47
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
There’s no stopping Kim.

48
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,440
He’s waited all year for this.

49
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,840
Jeff, can you check my car for me?

50
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,600
Hey, Kim!

51
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,320
Only “I” get to boss my boyfriend around.

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Jeff, check it for him.

53
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
Sure thing.

54
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

55
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,160
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

56
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
What’s wrong, Charlie?

57
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,280
I think I heard something weird.

58
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,960
A sound?

59
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,320
You okay?

60
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,040
-Yeah.
-I think it’s nothing.

61
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
Go get ready.

62
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,760
Hurry up.

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
-Okay.
-That’s good then.

64
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,360
-You good?
-I’m good.

65
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,240
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

66
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,440
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

67
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,800
This season, The Hallow is hotter than ever!

68
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,440
Because we’ve taken it
outdoors with a whole new format.

69
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,720
Introducing…
The Hallow Super GT Street Thunder!

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,960
Here’s the deal all racers
will start from this point…

71
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,360
and race through the track

72
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
and the streets we’ve laid out
specially for the event.

73
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Then return to finish
right back here at the start line.

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,159
There will be 5 laps total.

75
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Whoever clocks the fastest time…wins it all!

76
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,080
And today, we have 10 racers in the lineup.

77
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,440
The racing is about to start in a sec.

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,920
And they’re off!

79
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,960
The race is divided into two sections.

80
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Zone A is the open track.

81
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,159
And that fast pass is
from a member of Team ETA.

82
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,760
Oh! The car just spun out!

83
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,560
This is just a start!

84
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
One car has spun out!

85
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,600
Yep, one spin right there!

86
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Team X-Hunter is still holding it together.

87
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Ever heard of the king of The Hallow?
I mean, really?

88
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Drivers now head into Zone B…

89
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,480
a narrow, dangerous section lined with containers.

90
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,400
It takes both caution
and experience to navigate.

91
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Team X-Hunter is still in the lead,

92
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,120
with Pitbabe, Charlie, and Kim in front.

93
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,880
Who's gonna take the win in the first race?

94
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,159
But now Team ETA is
climbing up from the back!

95
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,280
We’re back to Zone A again.

96
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,039
Team X-Hunter is still showing great coordination.

97
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
The leader is still Pitbabe, with Charlie and Kim following close behind.

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,880
Kim is overtaking Chalee for second place—this race is getting intense!

99
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,640
Here comes ETA’s rising star, trying to make a move!

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,760
Whoa!

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,440
Turns out Team ETA
has some serious talent too.

102
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,920
Let's see if he can make the pass!

103
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,960
That kind of skill is no joke.

104
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,760
Team ETA is catching up fast!

105
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,880
What a smooth turn from Charlie

106
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,840
ETA is on the rise—up from sixth to fifth already!

107
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,240
ETA has moved up to 4th place.

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,120
Right behind Kim from X-Hunter.

109
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,400
It’s a rookie racing in the big league now!

110
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,600
The front runners are staying close, but ETA is determined to make their move!

111
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,760
But Kim doesn’t seem to realize yet—he’s pushing hard to get past Charlie!

112
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,120
Kim, block him…don’t let him pass!

113
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,880
Or our team’s going to lose our spot.

114
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,280
But I can overtake right now, bro.

115
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,240
Yeah, I know…but can you
think about the team first?

116
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,760
Hold on—what’s happening here? Kim’s slowing down!

117
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
It’s Charlie chance now!

118
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,280
ETA’s closing in on Kim.

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,040
But Kim’s still blocking the line well.

120
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,840
He’s not letting the title of South Korean champion slip away!

121
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,480
ETA’s not giving up! He’s fighting to climb into 3rd place!

122
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,320
Look at ETA go! This rookie is really proving himself!

123
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
And Kim finally loses his position!

124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,480
ETA moves into 3rd place.

125
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,400
But Charlie’s still holding his own.

126
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,920
This is intense!

127
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,200
Over in Zone B, ETA is still making a run for the leader!

128
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
ETA is right on Charlie’s tail.

129
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
But Charlie’s still holding him off.

130
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,040
ETA’s right on Charlie now—this is a neck-and-neck battle!

131
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,600
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

132
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,640
ETA pulls ahead of Charlie
from X-Hunter, claiming 2nd place!

133
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
We’ve now entered the final lap of the track.

134
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,640
Team ETA and Pitbabe are still neck and neck.

135
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,560
It’s the final straightaway!

136
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,720
-ETA’s pushing in…
-Don’t hold back!

137
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,880
Against the legendary
champ of The Hallow…Pitbabe!

138
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,320
Is this the moment the game turns?!

139
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,000
- It’s a tight race!
- Babe!

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,480
Pitbabe’s pushing ahead, but ETA is still right there!

141
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
Wait a minute—what a twist!

142
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
And the first race of the season…

143
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,640
is shockingly won by Team ETA!

144
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,120
Pitbabe from X-Hunter

145
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,240
takes 2nd place for the first time in years.

146
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,720
Followed by Charlie and Kim of Team X-Hunter.

147
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,400
Can we get a quick interview?

148
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,600
First race of the season
and you dethroned the reigning champ…

149
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
how do you feel?

150
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
How do you feel? Tell us!

151
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
How do I feel?

152
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,640
I feel nothing.

153
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
Because I already knew I’d win.

154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,240
Whoa, that’s a lot of confidence.

155
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,000
You beat *the* king of the track…Pitbabe.

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,960
So are you aiming to
take the whole championship?

157
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,560
Of course I am.

158
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,320
I’m probably the only one

159
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
who can take down Pitbabe.

160
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,360
How does it feel to lose
for the first time in years?

161
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
-How do you feel?
-Please give us an answer.

162
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,960
If it were me, I wouldn’t ask that question.

163
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,560
This is just the first race of the season.

164
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,360
One result doesn’t define the bigger picture.

165
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,480
Babe won’t be giving any interviews.

166
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,080
-Oh?
-Not even a short one?

167
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
-Just a little?
-Can we take a photo?

168
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
-Just a quick one?
-Can we get a picture?

169
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
-A photo, please?
-Just one photo?

170
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,920
I’m Willy.

171
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,840
Nice to meet you, Babe.

172
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,360
I never wanted to know you.

173
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,240
-Whoa, why though?
-Yeah, why?

174
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Let me make it clear…

175
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,880
this’ll be the last time
you ever get a photo with me.

176
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,560
You sure about that?

177
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,600
I’m the king of the track now.

178
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,640
You might wanna take racing seriously.

179
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,960
You’re so in love,
you’ve gone rusty and don’t even know it.

180
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,480
You’ve got a nasty mouth, you know that?

181
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,120
-Whoa, no fighting.
-Let’s not start anything, okay?

182
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,920
I said that because I care.

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
I’m actually a fan.

184
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,120
So what, you think being
younger lets you talk trash?

185
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,080
-North, come on.
-Please don’t fight.

186
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
-Let’s not cause a scene.
-Calm down.

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
-Can we take a picture?
-One photo, please.

188
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Thanks for the warm welcome.

189
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
But I don’t think Babe needs it.

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,080
Celebrate, but don’t overdo it.

191
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,000
If you lose next time,

192
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,880
it’ll be embarrassing.

193
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,760
-Savage!
-That’s kinda harsh.

194
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
-Hold up!
-Let’s get a photo first.

195
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,480
-Just one picture!
-Wait a second.

196
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,800
-Can we take one photo?
-Hey, he said no pictures.

197
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
-Just one photo, please!
-Just one shot!

198
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,040
-Look at this camera!
-Over here!

199
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,440
Babe.

200
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,240
Babe, hey.

201
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,840
Babe.

202
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,880
Go home for now, alright?

203
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,480
Where are you going?

204
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,360
I just wanna be alone, Charlie.

205
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,720
It’s okay, man.

206
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,080
It’s just the first race.

207
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,960
I think Babe just lost a bit of rhythm.

208
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
Babe’s trained a million times.

209
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
He didn’t just lose rhythm.

210
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,640
But that kid Willy…

211
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,440
his skills are scary.

212
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,640
Who knows, the title might
change hands this year.

213
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,240
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

214
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,480
You think it has anything
to do with Babe losing his senses?

215
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
Kid…

216
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,160
you’ve seen Babe
race against Charlie, haven’t you?

217
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,960
He blew past everyone on the team.

218
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,480
That’s called experience.

219
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,680
Not some lost “sense.”

220
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,960
Damn.

221
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,280
Then Willy must be seriously gifted, huh?

222
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,960
He’s still so young too.

223
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,120
Yeah… that’s true.

224
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,760
He kinda reminds me of Babe as a kid.

225
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,680
But that kid Willy’s
a real little shit though.

226
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,640
We’ll figure out how to
turn this around, Uncle.

227
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,160
This year’s title
still belongs to Team X-Hunter.

228
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,760
Yeah. Come on, let’s head home.

229
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
But hey…

230
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,440
Can I get a consolation prize?

231
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,160
Come on.

232
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,800
You're seriously too cute.

233
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,080
Hey, kid.

234
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,280
-Hey, kid.
-Yes, sir?

235
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,400
You okay?

236
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,280
I’m fine. Let’s head home.

237
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,840
Let’s go.

238
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,280
This is our new research specialist.

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,560
February 23rd, 2025.

240
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,880
Time: 16:34

241
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,360
Experiment log: Skill-dissolving drug.

242
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,960
Skill-dissolving compound No. 116.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,080
Volunteer No. 108.

244
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
Trial No. 1.

245
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,200
Initiating experiment.

246
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,960
Mr. Pete.

247
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,680
You should’ve let me join this round too.

248
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,920
You just took part in the last round.

249
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,520
And right now we’re in
the middle of a new season.

250
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,119
I don’t want it to affect your body.

251
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,680
The last dose of
skill-dissolving serum didn’t work.

252
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,560
Babe’s sense is still fully intact in me.

253
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,880
Guess my cells are just too tough.

254
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,400
I hope this time it actually works.

255
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,840
Alpha’s special sense is still present.

256
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,640
The serum isn’t reacting with the cells.

257
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,160
Alpha isn’t doing well.

258
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,560
Get the meds, quick!

259
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,160
What’s happening to Pete?

260
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
This is a reaction from
a body rejecting the skill-dissolving serum.

261
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,160
We need to give him the antidote.

262
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
Get the doctor, now!

263
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Looks like we’ll have to
redo the entire experiment.

264
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,920
I thought the experiment would go better…

265
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,520
if we had one more skilled researcher.

266
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,440
Especially someone familiar
with Alpha genetics.

267
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,560
Who could be better than you, Touch?

268
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,440
Pete hired you, Touch,

269
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
because you’re
the sharpest mind in the country.

270
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,880
Right now in our country,

271
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,240
no one’s allowed to
research openly like they do abroad.

272
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,240
So we’ve had to do everything ourselves.

273
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,080
Someone recommended
a researcher from the U.S.

274
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,680
Specialized in Alpha genetic traits.

275
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
If we can get him on board,

276
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,760
I think we’ll have a real shot.

277
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
If he can help us create
the skill-dissolving serum…

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,560
no matter the cost, I’ll pay it.

279
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,080
You’re up against
the king of the track…Pitbabe!

280
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,360
Are you actually aiming
for the championship?

281
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,640
I *am* taking the championship.

282
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,720
I’m probably the only one

283
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,760
who can take down Pitbabe.

284
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,640
What the hell, Charlie?

285
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,360
I came to pick you up, Master Babe.

286
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,160
Master Babe.

287
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,440
Okay.

288
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,640
You really went all out, huh?

289
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
Please, take a seat, Master.

290
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,320
Right here, please.

291
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,160
You set up these flowers?

292
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,320
Sure did.

293
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Specially prepared just to welcome you.

294
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,560
You like it?

295
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,440
They’re pretty nice.

296
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,200
Did you get into another fight again?

297
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,400
It’s nothing, really.

298
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
Does it hurt?

299
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,240
You’ll ruin that pretty face of yours.

300
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,040
Still better than some nerd who lives in a lab.

301
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,160
So when’s the skill-dissolving serum
gonna be done?

302
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,840
And did you go in for testing today?

303
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
No, I didn’t.

304
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,360
Pete won’t let me test anymore.

305
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,480
He said right now…

306
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,400
we’re getting close to race season.

307
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,960
He’s worried my body
won’t be able to handle it.

308
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
But the lab results…

309
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,960
I still don’t really understand them.

310
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,200
I lost the race, Charlie.

311
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,720
Guess it’s my turn to be sad today.

312
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,280
Well then…

313
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,440
should Papa help cheer Mama up?

314
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,560
Go ahead and try.

315
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,040
Feeling any better?

316
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,160
A little bit, yeah.

317
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,760
But seriously, don’t you know
any other tricks to cheer me up?

318
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,160
You always use the same one.

319
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,360
That’s 'cause I know…

320
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,200
you only ever like

321
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,120
this one thing.

322
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,640
(Jeff)

323
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,240
Kid, what are you doing out here so late?

324
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,800
Why aren’t you in bed?

325
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,360
I waited so long
I nearly fell asleep out here.

326
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,960
I just haven’t finished my work yet.

327
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
Well, if you’re sleepy,
go ahead and sleep first.

328
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
No way.

329
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,040
I can’t fall asleep without you.

330
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,880
Come on, let’s go to bed.

331
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,160
Wait a sec.

332
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,840
Why?

333
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,320
Nothing. It’s nothing.

334
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,880
Oh, come on.

335
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,560
You pulled your hand away from me just now.

336
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,840
You don’t want me to touch you or something?

337
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,760
Or is it…

338
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
Your ability to see the future…
has it come back?

339
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,920
I already told you.

340
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,600
I’ve been able to control
my powers for a while now.

341
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,480
Right…

342
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,840
-That makes sense.
-Otherwise how could I cuddle you every night?

343
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,760
-Go to bed.
-Mmhmm, I’ll be right there.

344
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,560
Why not now?

345
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,960
I still have to go over
some reports with the mechanics team.

346
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,720
You can just do it tomorrow.

347
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
You’re dating the owner of the garage.

348
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,240
No one’s gonna chase you.

349
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
Come on, let’s go.

350
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,760
But we work as a team.

351
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,520
I don’t want the others waiting on me.

352
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,360
Besides…

353
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,960
tomorrow’s Way’s death anniversary, isn’t it?

354
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,560
I should finish this tonight.

355
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,960
You go get some rest.

356
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,560
I’ll head up as soon as I’m done.

357
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,640
-Promise?
-Mhm.

358
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,080
Still as stubborn as ever, huh?

359
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,440
Hurry up and come.

360
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,760
Okay.

361
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,440
Don’t take too long.

362
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,040
I won’t.

363
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,960
Stop the car here.

364
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,600
You can take the hoods off now.

365
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,040
Who are you?

366
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,160
How did you get us out of there?

367
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,560
I’ve arranged for this place
to be under Mr. Pete’s control.

368
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,320
Everything has been
kept exactly as he requested.

369
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,280
Thank you.

370
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:52,360
(If you ever need a drinking buddy,
you can always come to me.)

371
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:04,080
(If you ever need a drinking buddy,
you can always come to me.)

372
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,440
Put some effort into it, North.

373
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,800
What? Seriously, Uncle?

374
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,760
Your boyfriend’s the one slacking here.

375
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,160
Wow, did you just diss my boyfriend?

376
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,560
Double standards, huh?

377
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
Just a little more.

378
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,480
Okay, got it.

379
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,960
-Alan!
-Hey hey!

380
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
I missed you.

381
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,120
How’ve you been? You doing okay?

382
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,440
I’m doing good.

383
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,840
This new garage…

384
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,360
it's actually pretty nice.

385
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,280
How’ve you been?

386
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,760
You’re totally giving off
“owner’s boyfriend” vibes.

387
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,520
It’s glowing off you.

388
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,800
And what about Sonic?

389
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,040
He went to France to study fashion design.

390
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,760
But now that he’s back…

391
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,640
he’s dressing way more low-key.

392
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,440
Didn’t know you could tease like that.

393
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,680
Hey, man.

394
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,880
Didn’t think you’d actually come back.

395
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,560
You’ve been off the radar a while.

396
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,080
Yeah, it was my first year…
I needed time to adjust.

397
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,440
But hey, I’m back now, aren’t I?

398
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,040
So…

399
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,160
How long are you staying?

400
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,880
North.

401
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,760
Go inside and get the stuff ready.

402
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,960
Sonic.

403
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,560
Go help him out in there, will you?

404
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,480
Once everyone arrives,
we can get started right away.

405
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,880
Got it, Uncle.

406
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,480
Let’s go.

407
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,760
Yeah, let’s.

408
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,040
You go first.

409
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,040
What are we prepping anyway?

410
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,960
You playing matchmaker now or what?

411
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,200
What needs to be set up?

412
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,280
They’ve been circling each other for years.

413
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,640
Figured I’d lend a hand.

414
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,040
But honestly…

415
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,320
I don’t think it’s gonna work.

416
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
Uncle, is it over here?

417
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,760
Bring it up a little more.

418
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,000
-Right here?
-Yeah yeah, that’s it.

419
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,840
Okay, now slide it a bit to the right.

420
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,280
-OK.
-This way now.

421
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,160
Alan.

422
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,120
-Alan.
-Oh, Kim.

423
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,080
I’ve got something
I need to talk to you about.

424
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,000
What’s up?

425
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,680
I want to resign from Team X-Hunter.

426
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,280
Wait, what? Why would you leave?

427
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,360
If there’s something bothering you,
just tell me.

428
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,440
You’ve already gotten close to everyone here.

429
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,120
If I stay with X-Hunter…

430
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,360
I’ll never be number one.

431
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,280
Don’t forget…

432
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,480
right now…

433
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
there’s a rookie who already beat Babe.

434
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
I have to follow my goal…

435
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,800
to become number one myself.

436
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,360
It’s not that I don’t believe in you, Kim.

437
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
But here, we work as a team.

438
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,040
Exactly, Alan.

439
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,240
And the number one in X-Hunter…

440
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,760
will always be Babe.

441
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,280
You don’t have to feel bad about it.

442
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,360
I understand everything, Alan.

443
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,040
We’re only rivals on the track.

444
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,560
Off the track, nothing’s changed between us.

445
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,880
I’m sorry, man.

446
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,200
Sorry I couldn’t support you more.

447
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,440
I’m not mad at you.

448
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,560
But if I beat Babe…

449
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,520
and that new kid, Willy…

450
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,600
if I can pull that off…

451
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,040
please don’t be mad at me either.

452
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,600
Yeah.

453
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,800
Good luck.

454
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,040
Thank you.

455
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,520
Uncle.

456
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,160
What’s wrong? You look stressed.

457
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,200
Yeah.

458
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,560
Kim just asked to leave the team.

459
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,240
I kinda figured he’d come talk
about this sooner or later.

460
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,680
You okay?

461
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,960
There can only be one

462
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,760
number one on the track.

463
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,880
A captain like me can’t really stop that.

464
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,560
Still hurts though.

465
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,040
Sooner or later,

466
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,480
everyone’s gonna grow and go their own way.

467
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,159
Come on now.

468
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,120
No matter where they go,

469
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,400
I’m still here with you, aren’t I, Uncle?

470
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,040
Yeah.

471
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,760
Jeez, Way.

472
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,120
You’ve been gone for a year now.

473
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,680
Couldn’t you visit me in a dream
with some lucky numbers or something?

474
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,440
North!

475
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,960
Is now really the time for jokes?

476
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,080
Of course it is.

477
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,160
Look at everyone standing around all gloomy.

478
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,360
Someone’s gotta break the silence, right?

479
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,560
Don’t be too hard on North, Sonic.

480
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,480
He’s actually right.

481
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,160
Even if we all stand here
being sad in front of Way…

482
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,000
it won’t change anything.

483
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,760
It really won’t help at all.

484
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,040
We have to learn to face the truth.

485
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
See?

486
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,760
Uncle Alan’s the only one who gets me.

487
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,600
You just won’t stop, huh?

488
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,760
Babe.

489
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,160
Don’t look like that, man.

490
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,200
Way won’t rest easy seeing you like this.

491
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,680
He’s the one who loved you the most.

492
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
He’d want you to be happy.

493
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,560
Not standing here like that.

494
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,200
You were the best friend I ever had, Way.

495
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,320
I loved you so much.

496
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,160
Don’t worry, bro.

497
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
I’ll take care of Babe for you, always.

498
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,080
I love you too.

499
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
What do you wanna eat?

500
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,760
I want…

501
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,960
Charlie.

502
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,600
There’s something I need to talk to you about.

503
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,840
Does it have to be now?

504
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,240
Can it wait until another day?

505
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,760
Today I just wanna spend time with Babe.

506
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,080
It’ll just be a moment.

507
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,160
Alright.

508
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,240
Could you wait for me at the car?

509
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,080
Don’t take too long.

510
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,400
Got it.

511
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,080
So what is it?

512
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,720
Just tell me what’s going on.

513
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,600
Right now…

514
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,040
my future-vision sense came back.

515
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,320
And I can’t control it anymore.

516
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,760
What do you mean “came back”?

517
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
Like before?

518
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,440
Or does it only happen sometimes?

519
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,160
No, it’s not like that.

520
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,760
It feels like my power’s evolved.

521
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,440
Now the visions I see…

522
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,240
they last longer than before.

523
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,720
Sometimes I get nosebleeds.

524
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
It’s starting to take a toll on my body.

525
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,360
Like my body’s warning me about something.

526
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,120
Mr. Pete’s already brought in
researchers from abroad.

527
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,360
The skill-dissolving serum
is getting closer to reality.

528
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
But it’s not just about the drug.

529
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,480
Because the visions I see…

530
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,560
I don’t even know

531
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,280
if they’re really the future.

532
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,240
Or what they really are.

533
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,160
What did you see?

534
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,520
I saw Way.

535
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,880
Then let me show you today…

536
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,840
what we’re actually doing in my lab.

537
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,160
I really don’t like this.

538
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,440
This place reminds me of my childhood…
back at the Chen estate.

539
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,040
Charlie, can you promise me something?

540
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,440
Promise you’re not experimenting on people
or doing anything weird to them.

541
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,760
Everyone here volunteered, I swear.

542
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,760
Because the goal of the
Skill-Dissolving Serum Project…

543
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
is to let every special Alpha…

544
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,160
choose their own path in life.

545
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
-Without having to be…
-Okay, stop.

546
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,160
No need to lecture me. I get it now.

547
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,280
But the fact that
you’ve built a lab this intense…

548
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,080
there won’t be any zombies breaking out, right?

549
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,760
Zombies? Seriously?

550
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,160
No zombies here.

551
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,240
Oh…

552
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,360
Mr. Pete.

553
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

554
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,840
I was just giving him a tour around the lab.

555
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,640
You’re okay with that, right?

556
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,760
Actually, I should be thanking you.

557
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,120
For letting Charlie join the experiment.

558
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,200
You don’t need to thank me.

559
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,960
It’s not like I agreed willingly.

560
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,560
I just couldn’t stop him.

561
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
Liu.

562
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,880
We’ve got a special Alpha scheduled
for today’s new trial, right?

563
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Yes, sir.

564
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,960
Are you here alone?

565
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Where’s Touch?

566
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,240
Uh, Touch went to pick up the new researcher.

567
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,760
He’s arriving today?

568
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,400
The researcher from
the U.S. already accepted?

569
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,480
That’s right.

570
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,360
He wants to get started
as soon as possible.

571
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Oh…there he is.

572
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,960
Way?!

573
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,760
That’s impossible…

574
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,920
Way…

575
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,520
Wait, hold on.

576
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,800
I mean…

577
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,960
I think you’ve got the wrong person.

578
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,040
What do you mean?

579
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,720
It’s just…

580
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,760
We’ve never met before.

581
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,560
Who… who are you?

582
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,200
Mr. Pete, this is Mr. Chris.

583
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,280
He’s our new researcher.

584
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,520
Researcher?

585
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,880
Yes, sir.

586
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,680
He specializes in cellular
development studies.

587
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,760
He’s from one of the top labs in the U.S.

588
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,080
But I knew Way very well.

589
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,160
He didn’t have any siblings, for sure.

590
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,400
I think you’re all just
wasting time analyzing this.

591
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Me and the person you’re talking about…

592
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,920
we’ve never met.

593
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,160
We have nothing to do with each other.

594
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,560
You’re serious, aren’t you?

595
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,480
You really don’t know Way?

596
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,320
Mr. Pete.

597
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,160
Why don’t you test him?

598
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,280
You’ve got thought-sensing powers, right?

599
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,520
Go on, prove it.

600
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,480
He’s telling the truth.

601
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,160
He only knows who Way is.

602
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,560
But they’ve never met.

603
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,760
He’s never known the real person.

604
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,680
So you believe me now, right?

605
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
I came here for work.

606
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,360
You’re the ones who invited me.

607
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,360
Didn’t you say you wanted to
develop the skill-dissolving serum?

608
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,560
Right now, I think I might be the only one…

609
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,600
who can actually help you with this.

610
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,120
You must be Mr. Pete,
the one who runs this lab?

611
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,960
It’s a pleasure to work with you.

612
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,960
I’m sorry…

613
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,760
but I don’t think we can work together.

614
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,560
Touch.

615
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,480
Please find someone else to replace him.

616
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,440
Mr. Pete…

617
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,880
Wait, Mr. Pete…

618
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,240
Mr. Pete, please…

619
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,040
Let’s go.

620
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,080
Shit.

621
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,720
Damn it.

622
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,040
That new researcher at Pete’s lab…
he looks just like Way.

623
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,160
Yeah, Uncle, but when Kim quit…

624
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,520
he took his personal mechanic with him.

625
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,720
So who are we gonna get to replace him?

626
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,040
Come on in already.

627
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,360
Let me explain myself.

628
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,520
I joined your lab as a researcher.

629
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,280
Just wait and see…
the person I planted in there

630
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,080
is going to bring X-Hunter to its knees.

631
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,800
You really think Willy is that good?

632
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,160
Well, he’s better than you.

633
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,760
I’m a big fan of yours.

634
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Why do I smell Alpha on you?

635
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,320
-You have to kiss before the magic works, right?
-Yep.

636
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,880
Once you kiss, it slowly flows down.

637
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,240
Wanna try?

638
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,880
(Babe’s totally mine.)

639
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,680
(I mean, I am kinda sexy.)

640
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,240
If I spank him…
(feels pretty good!)

641
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,640
-Everyone’s just…
-They were totally admiring me, right?

642
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,520
So, how was it? You good?

643
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,760
Okay, nope. I’m not.

644
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,600
(I give up everything.)

645
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,640
Let me return the favor.

646
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,920
-Where’s the umbrella?
-Here it is.

647
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,840
-Didn’t hit me.
-Nah, that hit.

648
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,880
-Yep, it hit.
-Totally hit.

649
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,800
-The umbrella hit you?
-No, the sun did.
