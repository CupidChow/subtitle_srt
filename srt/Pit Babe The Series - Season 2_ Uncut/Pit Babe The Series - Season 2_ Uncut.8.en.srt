1
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,840
I haven’t forgotten.
You’re the one who gave me a new life.

2
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,000
- What’s going on?
- I’d like to resign from the team.

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Charlie became Tony’s target.

4
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,560
And Tony’s going to kill
everyone around Charlie.

5
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Being apart is better
for both of us than forcing it.

6
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
That’s not gonna work, Babe.

7
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,759
- Thought it was a love problem or something
- I separate work and personal stuff.

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Uncle, I think I’m getting worse.

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,520
Where are you now, kid? Hey, kid.

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,800
Charlie.

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,479
Will we get the results today?

12
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
I know you’re all impatient.

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,480
But everything has its process.

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Chris, come take a look at this.

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
This isn’t good at all.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,640
What does “not good” mean?

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Yeah, so has the drug
responded to Charlie or not?

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,920
I can’t say much just yet.

19
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,920
But from what I see now,

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,320
Charlie’s special cells

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,200
have evolved to the next stage.

22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,720
Developed again?

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
Can you not be so technical?

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,240
I just want to know
if the drug you tested on Charlie

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
actually helped him.

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
If I have to put it simply,

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
it’s kind of like

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
we have to start the whole experiment over.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
And honestly, it’ll take time.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
Even if the success rate is still pretty low,

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,360
I still believe

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,760
we should have Charlie

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,920
start the experiment from scratch.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,120
If Charlie starts over, won’t his condition get worse?

35
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,079
Well, who told him to take in more powers?

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
He did this to himself, didn’t he?

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
I’m okay with it.

38
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
Charlie.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
I’ll restart the experiment from the beginning.

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,240
Even if I still haven’t
figured out how to save you

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,200
But I won’t let anything happen to you.

42
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
We’re all together now.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,240
Tony won’t find a way to get to us.

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,520
- What’s up
- I tracked someone from the project.

45
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,320
Found a suspicious place.
Might be Tony’s lab.

46
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
Then wait for me.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Don’t rush in and do anything stupid.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,800
If you want to join, stay low.
Don’t get spotted.

49
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
Okay.

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,360
I’m thinking of sneaking in tonight.

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,520
But you need to think this through.

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
You’re breaking into a building.

53
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,600
Trying to get yourself killed?

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Either way, there’s a chance we die anyway.

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Tony’s not just sitting around.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,200
You know what Tony’s capable of.

57
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,120
He’s probably already making moves by now.

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
I know, but if you’re risking it,
I won’t allow it.

59
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,600
Even if we’re back under the same roof,

60
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,400
doesn’t mean we have to make up.

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,120
I’m not forcing you.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,760
I’m so sick of you two, honestly.

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,640
One moment it’s love, next it’s war.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Bro.

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,040
I’m skipping practice today.

66
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,640
Gonna stay with Charlie.

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
I’ll make it up another day.

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
No way.

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,200
Babe, you can’t skip practice.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Charlie, look at yourself.
You’re pale as hell.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
How can I leave you alone like this?

72
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,800
Who said I’d be alone?

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
Jeff’s staying too.

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
You two seriously look just as bad.

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,080
I’m not fully recovered,
but I can look after Charlie.

76
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,360
No need to worry.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,320
I’m with Babe on this.

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,440
I don’t trust leaving you two alone.

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Uncle, it’s okay.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
This is a critical time in the competition.

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,320
We don’t want to hold the team back.

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,600
I’ll keep you updated on Charlie’s every move.

83
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,200
So you won’t have to worry.

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,040
But yeah, the competition really is important right now.

85
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,720
Alright, we’ll go with that then.

86
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,600
But if anything happens, call me right away.

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Okay then!

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey Sonic, didn’t expect you here.

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,400
Jeff’s sick, Uncle.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
So I thought
I’d help you out with the car instead.

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,000
And didn’t you promote
one of the tech guys to racer?

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,800
Pretty sure you did.

93
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,720
You should give him a shot.

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,080
If Dean screws up, there’s no third chance.

95
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,480
Is this really the real Babe?

96
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,640
Looking all mature now.

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,320
Been around old folks too much. It rubbed off.

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
I’m just giving a heads-up, with good intentions.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,200
You know how shady this scene can get.

100
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
Especially with people you know.

101
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,920
That’s the last kind you should trust.

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,680
Sonic, if you’re that worried about us,

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,160
maybe just stay in Paris.
Then just stay with X-Hunter.

104
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,320
- He’s got a point
- Don’t even try, Babe.

105
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
I’ve gotta go back to school.

106
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,320
I’m just here for the day.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
Mhm.

108
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,240
- Uh, Uncle
- Yeah?

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,360
- I’ll go check on the team’s car first
- Okay.

110
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,360
Hey, wait up.

111
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,400
You’re off to check the car?

112
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah. Good luck today.

113
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,840
- What’s up, Dean
- Uncle, Babe.

114
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,000
Since I became a racer,

115
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,400
it’s made a lot of people uncomfortable.

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Dean.

117
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,960
It’s on you to prove yourself.

118
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,880
I get it.

119
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,480
Right now all I can do

120
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,880
is wait for everyone to accept me.

121
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,120
- Just give it your all today. I’m counting on you.
- Got it.

122
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,040
Go get ready.

123
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,920
- I’ll go change. See you at the track.
- See you.

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,320
- Did you check the car yet?
- All set. You can double-check if you want.

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,280
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

126
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,960
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

127
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,760
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

128
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Tick tick tick tock.

129
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
Charlie?

130
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,840
What is it? Nightmare?

131
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
He...

132
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,920
He’s here, Jeff.

133
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,680
- Who?
- Willy.

134
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,680
Willy came in here.

135
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Tick tick tick tock.

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,880
Tick tick tick tock.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Charlie, wake up. Wake up, Charlie.

138
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,840
Dean, stay on North’s tail.

139
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
Keep it tight.

140
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,640
Dean’s actually doing well.

141
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,120
Mhm.

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,920
But Babe doesn’t look focused at all, Uncle.

143
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,280
I’m not focused. Let me go again.

144
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,880
Hey, Babe.

145
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,160
If you’re stressed about Charlie,
we can take a break.

146
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,640
It’s fine. I can separate things.

147
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,240
- North, Dean, one more round.
- Mhm.

148
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,880
- Got it.
- Let’s go.

149
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,480
What’s up, kid? What is it?

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,240
Hello, Uncle. Charlie passed out just now.

151
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,920
Looks like his power to see the future kicked in.
I’m heading to the lab.

152
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
Uncle, Babe, hurry and follow me.

153
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,440
- Okay, I’m on my way.
- Babe, I’m coming too.

154
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,760
You guys, stay here, alright?

155
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,120
- Uh, what?
- What?

156
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,440
Where’s Uncle going?

157
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,120
Why didn’t you take him to the hospital, Pete?

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
It’s an effect from
the special sense inside Charlie.

159
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,080
It’s just too much.

160
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
Keeping him in the lab is the right call.

161
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,120
He was fine this morning.
Why did he suddenly crash?

162
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,920
That’s how future-sight powers work.

163
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
You can’t control them.

164
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,680
The closer danger gets,

165
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,960
the worse the power affects him.

166
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,080
So... what did Charlie see this time?

167
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
Willy.

168
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,000
Charlie said he saw Willy entering the house.

169
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,600
How’s that even possible?

170
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,800
How could Willy get into Babe’s house?

171
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
I don’t know either.

172
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
But my power is seeing the future.

173
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,520
So yeah, it’s definitely possible.

174
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Willy might actually get close to Charlie in the future.

175
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,560
But right now, we need to stabilize Charlie first.

176
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,280
I think we’ll have to use
the prototype skill-nullifying drug.

177
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
Just to suppress Charlie’s condition for now.

178
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
Whatever it is,

179
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,520
as long as it helps Charlie.

180
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,040
Looking at Charlie’s physical state right now.

181
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,960
He probably won’t be able to
join the skill-nullifying drug trial.

182
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,120
All we can do is give him
something to stabilize him.

183
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,240
Then what are you waiting for, Chris?

184
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,200
Charlie matters just as much as your experiment.

185
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Alright then.

186
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,760
We’ll focus on helping Charlie first.

187
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
As for the skill-nullifying drug,

188
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,080
we’ll need someone else for the trial.

189
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
I’ll do it.

190
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,720
Wait, you have powers?

191
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,960
Didn’t you give all your powers to Charlie?

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
What if it’s someone like me—an Enigma?

193
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,760
Would I be a viable test subject?

194
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,840
Pete, I don’t think you should be the one testing it.

195
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,600
If Tony makes a move,

196
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
you’re one of the few who still has power

197
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,360
to protect the rest of us.

198
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,440
But right now, no one else has enough power to test it.

199
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
Not Babe. Not Jeff.

200
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,840
They’re both not ready right now.

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,200
Then what if I do it instead?

202
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
Uncle.

203
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,520
But Alan, you don’t have any special sense.

204
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,280
How could you do it?

205
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,960
An experiment without a subject

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,160
is like a race without a car.

207
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,640
Arguing like this gets us nowhere.

208
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,600
Time is seriously closing in on us.

209
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
If we want Charlie to survive,

210
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,920
Pete has to go through the trial.

211
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,880
The drug had no reaction with Pete’s cells at all.

212
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,520
Thanks for the ride.

213
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,200
You basically drove yourself.
I just came along.

214
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,400
That still counts as giving me a ride.

215
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,200
Admitting you’re soft sometimes

216
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,640
won’t kill you, you know.

217
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,280
I just didn’t want my test subject

218
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,640
getting into trouble driving home.

219
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,480
That’s what you call caring.

220
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
I may have grown up abroad,

221
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,720
but I understand Thai just fine.
No need to teach me.

222
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
- Can I use your bathroom real quick?
- Of course. Go ahead.

223
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,240
Okay, I’ll wait for you at home, Kenta.

224
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Did you go upstairs and snoop around my office?

225
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
I was just curious.

226
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,800
What does a CEO like you actually do all day

227
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,400
to have all this money for researchers like me?

228
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,080
Got an urgent matter today.
I have to go now.

229
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,600
Who told you to come here?

230
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Did you just use your power on me?

231
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
I just wanted to try.

232
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,920
See if the skill-nullifying drug really works.

233
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
And? Was I lying to you or not?

234
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
You weren’t lying.

235
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,600
Alright, I’ll be going then.

236
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,480
I don’t think we should wait.

237
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
I’m heading in to investigate tonight.

238
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,160
- The guy I talked to was part of Tony’s project.
- Mhm.

239
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,720
He mentioned a snake.

240
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,920
I think it’s where I once picked something up for Tony.

241
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,360
I know you’re anxious right now.

242
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
But I want you to wait for my intel first.

243
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,280
I want to know who’s running the place right now.

244
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,240
Then I’ll go in with you.

245
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,480
Then I want you to dig into this too.

246
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,880
Before the incident with the Chen family,

247
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,600
Way handed me this key.

248
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,800
He told me Tony’s got
a secret organization hidden away.

249
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,240
A man named Manit tried
to seize power from Tony.

250
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,520
He tried to reach out to Way.

251
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,720
But then something happened.

252
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,520
And I ended up in jail.

253
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,880
This time, I think it might be useful

254
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,880
if we can figure out what this key is for.

255
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,040
New training schedule?

256
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,800
Yeah.

257
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Gotta push Dean a bit harder.

258
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,920
He’s doing well, but it’s still his comeback.

259
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,800
We need to fine-tune his team strategy a lot.

260
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,680
Been testing different rotations in the schedule.

261
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,120
See what works best for him.

262
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Sorry, but if we want it perfect,
we’ve gotta train hard.

263
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,480
Seeing how exhausted you are...

264
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,680
I get heartaches too, you know.

265
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,600
Why not let me take on more work?

266
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,560
No, that’s not it.

267
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,080
But can I recharge for a bit?

268
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,680
Recharge?

269
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,280
Battery charged yet?

270
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,600
- About 70 percent
- Seventy?

271
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,480
I want to max it out to 100.

272
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
So? How’s it now?

273
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
- Almost there
- Almost

274
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,480
Fully charged.

275
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,760
Then maybe I should hang around
the garage and be your charger.

276
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,520
It’s nice we get to hug like this.

277
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
When I heard you got in a crash,

278
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,880
I felt so uneasy. Couldn’t breathe.

279
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,960
If I could choose,

280
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,400
I’d rather be the one who got hurt.

281
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,520
I feel the same way.

282
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,480
Glad I get to be here with you.

283
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,040
But now it feels like
everything’s falling on Charlie instead.

284
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,960
- I need to take this call
- Don’t go

285
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,080
What if it’s a customer?

286
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
- A customer?
- Mhm.

287
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,160
Okay, fine.

288
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,680
- Hurry back
- Mhm.

289
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Calling from the orthopedic department.

290
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,000
Alan, you have a pre-op checkup scheduled for tomorrow.

291
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
At 2:00 p.m.

292
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,880
Please fast for at least six hours before surgery.

293
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,160
Actually, I’m not ready for surgery yet.

294
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
Can I talk to the doctor again?

295
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,880
But, um, the attending doctor said

296
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,800
you should have surgery as soon as possible.

297
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,600
Before your condition gets worse.

298
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,880
Still, I’d rather postpone the surgery for now.

299
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,520
It’s not a good time for me.

300
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,600
I’ll come back and discuss with the doctor again later.

301
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,240
That’s all for now.

302
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,840
Why is it just you?

303
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
Where is everyone?

304
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,840
Well obviously, right?

305
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,320
Babe has to be with Charlie.

306
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,480
And Jeff wouldn’t let Uncle come.

307
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Said he needed rest.

308
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
As for Dean—

309
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,920
You probably don’t want to see him anyway, right?

310
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
Then how is this even a team meeting?

311
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
It’s just you and me.

312
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,960
Come on. I already ordered food.

313
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
Just stay and eat with me, okay?

314
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,560
Here.

315
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,040
The shrimp on this plate is really good.

316
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Here, take it.

317
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,520
Don’t.

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
Why not?

319
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,080
I’ve always done this.

320
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,320
You always eat it.

321
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
Never peeled it yourself before.

322
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,400
Hey wait—uh, how was that? Was it good?

323
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah, it was good.

324
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
I think it’s even better than the place in France.

325
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,280
Right?

326
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,680
I’ve still got a bunch of spots left on my bucket list.

327
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,600
Once you’ve tried every place I’ve got listed,

328
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,520
you’re gonna change your mind.

329
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,920
Trying to make me stay?

330
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,880
But seriously, I’m going there to study, not to eat.

331
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,720
So what’s today’s team meeting about?

332
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Oh, the meeting?

333
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
Yeah, today’s meeting—

334
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,200
It’s about you.

335
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,520
You.

336
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,920
Can you stop suspecting Dean?

337
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,440
Uncle’s already stressed enough.

338
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,560
The vibe in the team right now is so tense.

339
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,920
No.

340
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,320
That’s exactly why
I need to keep an eye on Dean.

341
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,200
So I can have Uncle’s back.

342
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,920
Hey, but Dean’s really putting in the work.

343
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
He trains hard and never complains.

344
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,800
I know he’s trying.

345
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,160
But how do you know
he’s not working for Tony?

346
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,680
He already messed up once.

347
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,800
It’s easier to slip up again.

348
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah, you’re right about that.

349
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,280
Guess I should start
being suspicious of Dean too.

350
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,320
Someone like Dean’s not exactly easy to trust.

351
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Right?

352
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
You’re not a kid anymore.

353
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
Stop being so indecisive.

354
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
What—

355
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,200
Why are you snapping at me?

356
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,480
Because your indecisiveness is the problem.

357
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,000
It’s frustrating.

358
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Can you just be clear for once?

359
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,280
So people know how they’re supposed to react.

360
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,960
Wait, are you—

361
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Are you talking about Dean?

362
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,400
About everything.

363
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
If that’s all, I’m out of here.

364
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,600
Hey, Sonic, don’t go yet.

365
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
Pete’s not answering?

366
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,640
Yeah. I’m thinking of going in now.

367
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,800
Hey, wait a second.

368
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,800
- You stopping me again?
- I thought you were the calm type.

369
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,120
You’re being reckless as hell.

370
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,520
Don’t get in my way.

371
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,840
We’ve wasted enough time.

372
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,960
Who knows what Tony’s done by now.

373
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,000
You stay here and wait for Pete.

374
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,640
- I’ll go in myself.
- Hey, you—

375
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
Kenta.

376
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,440
Why didn’t you talk to me first?

377
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,320
Why do you always act like
you’re alone in this world, huh?

378
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,240
We’re in this together.
What do you even see me as?

379
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
What am I to you?

380
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,440
- What am I?
- A bunch of things.

381
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,520
A friend, someone you know,

382
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,880
a close one, roommate, assistant.

383
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,840
Hey you, you you.

384
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
What are you even doing?

385
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
Where are you running off to?

386
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
Could you care about how I feel, too?

387
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,680
Not just Pete all the time.

388
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,120
Hmm.

389
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,240
Either way, I’m still going.

390
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,080
You coming with me or not?

391
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,600
One beer, please.

392
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,640
Thanks.

393
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,240
North.

394
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,600
Why’d you ask me to meet you here?

395
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Tell me this—

396
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,960
Does someone like me

397
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,040
come off as indecisive?

398
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,000
Vague?

399
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,680
Never clear about anything?

400
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,520
Sonic said that to you, didn’t he?

401
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
How’d you know?

402
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,680
You psychic or something?

403
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,320
Psychic my ass.

404
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,120
Only a few people

405
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,280
would say stuff like that to you.

406
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,080
To be honest,

407
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,960
even from Paris, I could tell.

408
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,200
You two clearly had something going on.

409
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,560
Had what?

410
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,640
I didn’t have anything.

411
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
I’m normal, alright?

412
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,160
- Normal?
- Yeah.

413
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
That “normal” is exactly the problem.

414
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,480
North, just be honest already.

415
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,880
So what’s it gonna be with you and Sonic?

416
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,720
If you’re crossing the line from friends,
just cross. What are you waiting for?

417
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,720
Saying it is easy.

418
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,600
But doing it’s hard, man.

419
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
I don’t even know how he feels about me.

420
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,400
I’m scared of losing him as a friend.

421
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,080
And also—

422
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,000
what if by saying it,

423
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,320
- I end up ruining his future?
- North.

424
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,080
You’re usually not the overthinking type.

425
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,680
How come this is
the one thing you’re overthinking?

426
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,480
If you want something,

427
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,120
go for it.

428
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,760
Follow your own feelings.

429
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,840
You still have a shot.

430
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,480
Sonic came all the way
back to Thailand this time.

431
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
You better give it everything you’ve got.

432
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,880
Just like how Alan gave me a chance.

433
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,800
I’m gonna give it my all too.

434
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,320
We don’t get second chances
often in life, you know?

435
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,160
Got it?

436
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
What do you want to know?

437
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,240
Why are you investigating Way?

438
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
I just...

439
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,800
want to know about someone
who looks exactly like me.

440
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,520
Didn’t you say you didn’t know Way?

441
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
You need to tell me right now.

442
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,280
Who sent you?

443
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,400
Charlie, why are you draining Jeff’s power?

444
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
Feeling any better?

445
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,280
Yeah, I’m feeling better.

446
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,760
Hey.

447
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
I’ll be back in shape in no time.

448
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,640
Is this really the right time?

449
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,200
I’m sorry.

450
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,200
I should’ve told you beforehand.

451
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,240
Charlie.

452
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,120
I know we’re not dating right now.

453
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,600
But if something actually happened to you,

454
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,880
I wouldn’t be okay with that.

455
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,920
You don’t have to worry.

456
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,200
I’ll get through this just fine.

457
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
You know how strong I am.

458
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,600
You’re not getting through this alone.

459
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,200
We’re getting through it together.

460
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,080
Got it?

461
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,040
Okay.

462
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,080
I’ll take care of you.

463
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,400
I will.

464
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,400
Just like how you always took care of me.

465
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,480
Everyone’s working on the treatment right now.

466
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,200
I believe it’ll succeed one day.

467
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,080
Just like you always believed it would.

468
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,640
You still have stuff to wrap up tomorrow?

469
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,440
Probably the usual stuff.

470
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,160
What should we eat?

471
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,040
- Mookata?
- Sure. Which place?

472
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,480
No idea.

473
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
- Where is it?
- Right on the corner.

474
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,240
- Let’s go.
- I’ll take you.

475
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Uh, okay.

476
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
Hurry, look fast before someone sees.

477
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,560
You.

478
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,880
What are they experimenting with?

479
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,560
It’s Tony.

480
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,200
He’s turning regular people
into special alphas.

481
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,240
Shit.

482
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
That’s terrifying.

483
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,320
- Hey.
- Willy.

484
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,600
Hey, you.

485
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,440
Where are you?

486
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,320
Are they building their own army?

487
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,480
Record it, quick.

488
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,480
Okay.

489
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
Look.

490
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,800
- Hey.
- Go, go now.

491
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,880
No, no.

492
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
Hey, you.

493
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,360
Don’t. Just go.

494
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,240
- Hurry, follow him.
- I’m a racer, not a detective.

495
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,720
I told you not to come.

496
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,080
- That’s not fair.
- Everyone else went.

497
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,440
This way.

498
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,560
This way.

499
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,160
Hurry up.

500
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,320
- Where is he?
- Check over there.

501
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,440
Stay here. I’ll lure him away.

502
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,160
- But—
- Trust me.

503
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,320
There he is! After him!

504
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,640
Hey!

505
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,880
Sit down. Drop your weapon.

506
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,280
Drop your weapon.

507
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,160
When I was in America,

508
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,560
I saw Way on the racing news.

509
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,280
I started looking into him,

510
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,640
because I was wondering why we look alike.

511
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,920
And then what?

512
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,600
I couldn’t find anything linking me to him.

513
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,240
But I did find out one truth.

514
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,720
I have Tony’s bloodline.

515
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,000
You?

516
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,080
Yes.

517
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,440
So I figured

518
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,560
maybe Way is involved too.

519
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,800
Or maybe he’s Tony’s son, like me.

520
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,040
If you don’t believe me,

521
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
you can try using your power on me.

522
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,400
Now do you believe me?

523
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,680
I wasn’t lying to you.

524
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,680
What is it, Kim?

525
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,880
Kenta’s been taken.

526
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,400
Willy’s using a power that Tony created.

527
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,120
He can stop time.

528
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,040
Hello?

529
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,640
Hey Babe, Kim just called me.

530
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,560
Turns out Willy has a special sense too.

531
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,200
I’ve known that for a while.

532
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,040
But what you need to know
is that he can stop time.

533
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,280
Hi, Babe.

534
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,200
Willy.

535
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,240
- Long time no see.
- Let go.

536
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,960
- Did you miss me, Babe?
- Grab him.

537
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,000
What the hell are you
grabbing me for? Let me go!

538
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,920
- Let me go.
- I think this pose suits us.

539
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,720
It’s kinda erotic.

540
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,040
You perv, let go of me.

541
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,600
A smart guy like you,
still ends up obeying Tony.

542
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,400
Tony’s way smarter than any of you.

543
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,600
The doctor’s rushing me in for surgery.

544
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,400
Chronic spinal compression.

545
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,680
Why didn’t you tell me?

546
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,200
Don’t be so damn stubborn.

547
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,720
Does my trust really mean that much to you?

548
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,720
I know you don’t trust me.

549
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,840
Someone who’s messed up before…
how can I be sure?

550
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,720
Everyone, start the plan.

551
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,160
Go for it, North.

552
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,960
Throw your first punch, punk.

553
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,600
(Surprisingly sweet moment)

554
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,160
(Timing’s perfect)

555
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,440
(Ready to race!)

556
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,200
(Racer’s blood)
Can you handle it?

557
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,200
I’ll just stick with my old Wave.

558
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,760
Catherine, shoot him!

559
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,360
Shoot him, not me!

560
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,600
As soon as the line’s done, Babe heads up.

561
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,960
(Mama will protect Papa)

562
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,400
Close enough.

563
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,800
(Box-bak cat punch!)
