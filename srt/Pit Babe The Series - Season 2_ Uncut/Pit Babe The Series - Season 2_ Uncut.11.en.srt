1
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,039
Tony implanted a chip in Willy.

2
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
He used it to control and track him.

3
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,200
The capsule had some
substance and a transmitter.

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,160
Our matching rings—
I said I'd wear it when I felt ready.

5
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,400
Honestly, I’ve been waiting
for the right time.

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Can you put this ring back on for me?

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,560
- I like you.
- Thought I’d never hear you say that.

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,920
They created people with powers.

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,120
No body means he’s still alive.

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,640
- One hundred percent.
- Don’t do anything stupid.

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
It’s time for you to hold up your end.

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
Bring me Charlie’s blood.

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
What the hell did they inject you with?

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,360
How would I know, bro?

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,440
You were in Tony’s lab all that time.

16
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,560
You must’ve seen something.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
Yeah, I was there.

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,560
But I didn’t see anything.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,480
Wait… or maybe I did?

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
My memory’s kinda shot.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,240
If I got a little something
from Babe in return…

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,600
I might start remembering.

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,880
Shut your damn mouth, will you?

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Willy.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
You know if you just told us,

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,760
you could actually help a lot of people.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,760
And why should I?

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,000
Look at what I’m stuck with now—

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,760
no one’s ever helped me out.

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
My life...

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Living or dying doesn’t make a difference.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,320
The drug we made
is a skill-dissolving serum.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,000
You already know that, don’t you?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,040
Tony’s banking everything
on his skill-enhancing drug.

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,600
You really gonna let him succeed?

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,880
You gonna let everyone

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
lose their freedom like you did?

38
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,400
I’m the one who brought
you back from the dead.

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,600
Turned a regular guy like you

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,840
into an alpha with a special sense.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,320
Let me go.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520
Let go.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
Just so you know, that chip inside you—

44
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
it can explode anytime.

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,960
As far as I remember,

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
the shot had something
to do with Tony’s blood.

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,680
They used it in the experiments.

48
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,120
Researchers kept collecting
his blood regularly.

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,360
It’s done, Mr. Tony.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
So you’re saying

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
the skill serum he injected into everyone—

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
it was extracted from Tony’s cells?

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,200
Sounds like that could be true.

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,520
I don’t really get science stuff,

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,560
but if you guys finish
making that dissolving serum—

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
I want in. Inject me too.

57
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Deal.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
If you agree to help us.

59
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,560
Then maybe this is all
linked to Tony’s special sense.

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
Tony’s special ability—

61
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,960
maybe his body
can regenerate cells on its own.

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,640
But we can’t jump to conclusions yet.

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,560
Not until we’re sure
what Tony’s real skill is.

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,400
Either way—

65
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
we need to find
a way to test his blood first.

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,680
And where do we get it from?

67
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
You wanna break in or something?

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,400
I don’t think we need to go that far yet.

69
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
At least now we know
what we’re supposed to do next.

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
Thanks a lot, man.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
You okay, Babe?

72
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Yeah, I’m good.

73
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,440
Why’re you asking?

74
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,000
Just… lately,

75
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,320
so much has been happening all at once.

76
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Thought you might be stressing out.

77
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,920
I’m fine.

78
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,040
This is nothing, Charlie.

79
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,880
As long as you,

80
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,840
Alan,

81
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,040
and everyone who
feels like family is still here—

82
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,240
then I’ve got nothing to worry about.

83
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
From now on,

84
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,280
I’m in on the dissolving serum project too.

85
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Got it, Babe.

86
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,960
I think...

87
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,840
getting Tony’s blood—

88
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,360
that might complicate things even more.

89
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,760
But at least—

90
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
at least we're getting closer to the answer.

91
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Thanks so much, Babe.

92
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
For always being by my side.

93
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,400
Damn, you're always this sentimental, huh?

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,480
If I keep being sappy like this,

95
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,800
just don’t get sick of me, okay?

96
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
Why would I get sick of you?

97
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
I never would.

98
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,120
And I’m staying with you for life.

99
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,200
Didn’t you say you didn’t want to tonight?

100
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,840
Couldn’t resist, huh?

101
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,520
Did I?

102
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
I don’t remember saying that.

103
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
What, you old or something?

104
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,600
Getting forgetful?

105
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
Old my ass.

106
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,840
I’m just a little fuzzy, that’s all.

107
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,240
Even if I do get old,

108
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,960
no matter how forgetful I become—

109
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
I’d never forget you, Babe.

110
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
But right now...

111
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,320
I can’t hold back anymore.

112
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,560
Hey uncle, you okay?

113
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,080
That was wild driving.

114
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,720
Hey, kid—

115
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
I used to be the king of the track.

116
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,880
Can’t you see I’m doing great?

117
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,760
I’m way stronger now.

118
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,280
I’ve never seen you smile like that before.

119
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,880
For real?

120
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,240
It’s been so long since I quit racing.

121
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,520
Never thought I’d be
behind the wheel again.

122
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,760
Damn, that was so cool, uncle.

123
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
You haven’t driven
in ages and still nailed it.

124
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,720
For real—didn’t lose any of that power.

125
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,120
If you raced again now,

126
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,720
you’d totally be king of the track.

127
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,440
No way.

128
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,080
Right, Charlie?

129
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,880
If it’s me versus Alan,

130
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
who wins? Who you cheering for?

131
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,520
I’m rooting for you, obviously.

132
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,200
Uncle Alan already has Jeff in his corner.

133
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,520
Come on, Babe—I’m not taking your spot.

134
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
My job—

135
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,760
is to back you and our team

136
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
all the way to the championship.

137
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,840
Now get your ass
out there and start practicing.

138
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,960
- Okay!
- Let’s go, Babe. Practice time!

139
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
- Ow!
- Uncle?

140
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Uncle?

141
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,920
Are you okay?

142
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,360
Uncle?

143
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,480
Uncle, what kind of stunt is that?

144
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Sorry—

145
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
but this isn’t just a matching ring.

146
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,680
It’s a wedding ring.

147
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Why?

148
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
You not okay with that?

149
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,800
I just don’t get why it had to be today.

150
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,600
I wasn’t even ready for this.

151
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,920
If I told you to get ready,
would it still be a surprise?

152
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,040
Besides, today had to be the day.

153
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,080
The day I finally got
to do what I love again.

154
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,200
And the day I’m strong
enough to take care of you.

155
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,160
Marry me.

156
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,560
Let’s get a shot of this historic moment!

157
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay—one, two...

158
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,440
Take a pic, take a pic!

159
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,640
Come on, come on!

160
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,640
Can I ask you something?

161
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
How did you know...

162
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,680
that you were connected to Tony?

163
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,520
I knew I’d been adopted in the US.

164
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,320
After that,

165
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,520
I met this Thai friend named Tim.

166
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,920
We were really close.

167
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,920
But after he returned to
Thailand and joined Tony’s group,

168
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,240
I never heard from him again.

169
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,360
So I started digging.

170
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
And that’s when I found out

171
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,920
I have a twin who looks just like me—Way.

172
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,720
We were both born from
one of Tony’s test tube experiments.

173
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,880
But I didn’t get any powers like Way did.

174
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,920
So yeah... that’s my story.

175
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,760
That’s why I wanna take Tony down.

176
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,040
Now it’s up to you.

177
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,680
Whether or not you wanna tell the others.

178
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
I trust you.

179
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,760
I know.

180
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,119
I know you hate having
Tony’s blood in your veins.

181
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,040
But maybe now,
we can use it for something good.

182
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,119
It’s true—

183
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,480
we can’t change the past.

184
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,080
But I’ll definitely be part of your future.

185
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
Pete.

186
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Kim.

187
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Uh...

188
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
I don’t know who else to talk to.

189
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,840
When Alan came home,

190
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,280
I saw a mark behind his ear.

191
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,360
It’s the same one I saw

192
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,240
in the test subject files from Tony’s lab.

193
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,520
What are you saying?

194
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,840
I think...

195
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Alan might have gone to see Tony.

196
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,440
No way.

197
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,880
Alan’s always been loyal to the team.

198
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,920
I don’t believe he’d betray X-Hunter.

199
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,240
But aren’t you even curious?

200
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
He was sick—

201
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
and then suddenly,

202
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,160
he’s totally fine again.

203
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,640
Then why would Alan go to Tony?

204
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,520
That part...

205
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,280
I still can’t figure out either.

206
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
And...

207
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,440
what about Kenta?

208
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,120
Has he reached out at all?

209
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,680
Ever since that day, he just disappeared.

210
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,200
But I think Kenta’s probably okay.

211
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,480
Maybe he’s just waiting
for the right moment to reach out.

212
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,440
Gotta say, I admire your patience, Pete.

213
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,560
Kenta gave up everything for all of us.

214
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
And I can honestly say—

215
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
Kenta really loves you.

216
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,920
I just don’t want you to see him

217
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,800
as just another pawn in your game, Pete.

218
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,640
After a long, intense battle—

219
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,520
we’ve finally reached the final race
of The Hallow Super GT Street Thunder.

220
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,800
And they’re off!

221
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
Kicking off in Zone A.

222
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,840
Right now, the race leaders
are Charlie and North from X-Hunter.

223
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
Looks like in this final round, every team’s

224
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,840
doing everything they can to block Pitbabe—

225
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,160
the reigning king—from overtaking.

226
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,000
Pitbabe’s speeding up,
trying to close the gap.

227
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,520
He’s pushing to break into the lead group.

228
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,680
But it’s no easy task, not this time.

229
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
North and Charlie up front—

230
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,360
still holding their positions strong.

231
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,600
And Pitbabe’s right behind,
keeping up the chase.

232
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,800
Fans are holding their breath.

233
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,480
We’re entering Zone B now.

234
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,400
Charlie and North
still nailing those turns beautifully.

235
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,400
Pitbabe’s looking for an opening—

236
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,680
trying to slip through and surge forward.

237
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,600
Up front, Charlie and North—

238
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,000
still locked in a tight head-to-head.

239
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,800
Pitbabe’s not backing down—
he’s pushing hard!

240
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Beautiful move right there.

241
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,680
He’s still every bit the king of the track.

242
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,320
Pitbabe’s surged into third place!

243
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,400
Now the top three spots are all held

244
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,520
by X-Hunter racers!

245
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,800
Bring it, Charlie.

246
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,240
Pitbabe overtakes North—
he’s now second!

247
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,280
What’s going on? X-Hunter
is racing against itself now!

248
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,720
Pitbabe, our reigning champ,

249
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,120
isn’t giving up that title so easily.

250
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Still taking those turns like a pro.

251
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,680
Babe and Charlie
are neck and neck for the lead.

252
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,680
As for ETA—without Willy today,

253
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,160
they just can’t get
past North’s solid defense.

254
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,280
North is now pulling ahead,
distancing from ETA.

255
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,400
Wow—first, second, and third place

256
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,680
all belong to the X-Hunter team!

257
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,440
We’re entering the final curve now.

258
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,320
The top three are still battling it out.

259
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,840
Who will take the win?

260
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,400
Will it be Babe, Charlie,
or North of X-Hunter?

261
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,600
Charlie pushes up on the right!

262
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,120
He's gunning it forward!

263
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
But Babe fires back—
charging up in the final second!

264
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080
It’s the final stretch!

265
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,320
And across the finish line!

266
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,280
Pitbabe remains the champion of this track!

267
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,680
And for the final round of the season—

268
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,800
The Hallow Super GT Street Thunder—

269
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,080
the crown goes once again
to X-Hunter’s reigning champ!

270
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
Hey, uncle!

271
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Wait, what?

272
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,520
Why are you in your race suit?

273
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,480
Come on, Babe—the race is about to start!

274
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,040
You better go get changed.

275
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,960
What are you on about, Charlie?

276
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,440
You just finished racing.

277
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
Oh—

278
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
right, I did.

279
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,320
Just messing with you.

280
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,280
Charlie...

281
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,040
What’s your deal?

282
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,360
Go get changed.

283
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,240
Yes, sir.

284
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,400
Bottoms up.

285
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
Drink it all, North.

286
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,080
I don’t mean to brag, but—

287
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,320
that final curve I pulled?

288
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Damn, that tail slide—so slick.

289
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,520
- So slick.
- But you still didn’t beat Babe.

290
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,600
Man...

291
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
- Let him take that one.
- You didn’t beat Charlie either.

292
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,720
But the way I stood on that podium—

293
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,160
One glass on the rocks, please.

294
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,600
Uncle, take it easy.

295
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
Aren’t you supposed to be on meds?

296
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
It’s fine.

297
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,720
Kid...

298
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
I love you so much.

299
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,360
Nothing’s gonna happen. I promise.

300
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,080
Everything’s gonna be okay.

301
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
Are you drunk?

302
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,200
Yeah, I’m drunk.

303
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,360
But it doesn’t even feel like a big deal.

304
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,960
It’s been ages since I drank like this.

305
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Hey, uncle...

306
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Babe.

307
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,280
You okay?

308
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,000
You look kind of stressed.

309
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
Charlie’s been acting weird lately.

310
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
What do you mean?

311
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,440
He keeps forgetting stuff.

312
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,320
Hmm...

313
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,520
I think...

314
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,520
maybe it’s because
Charlie has too much power now.

315
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,400
Powers sound great and all—

316
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,720
but if you weren’t born with them,

317
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
they’re like cancer in your body.

318
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,760
Because that power takes over

319
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,880
and changes your cells from the inside.

320
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Hmm...

321
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
So what do we do now?

322
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,320
We need to act fast.

323
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,320
And the best shot we’ve got—

324
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,080
is the skill-dissolving serum.

325
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
One more drink.

326
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,360
Hard to believe...

327
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,560
that you’d actually
agree to be my test subject.

328
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,960
After taking my drug,

329
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,400
just keep your end of the deal.

330
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,560
Bring me Charlie’s blood. No matter what.

331
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Dean.

332
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,640
Where’s Charlie’s blood?

333
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
Don’t stress about it.

334
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I said I’d do what you told me.

335
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,880
Save it for Tony.

336
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,640
You—come here.

337
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,840
So, how’s it feel?

338
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,960
Like you’ve got a brand-new body?

339
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,360
I doubt you actually care about my health.

340
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,760
No one in the team’s suspected anything yet.

341
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,040
And I’ve kept my side of the deal.

342
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
That part was never in question.

343
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
But I’m getting tired of waiting.

344
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,080
When are you gonna make your move?

345
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
When I get the chance.

346
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,280
Charlie’s always with Babe.

347
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,760
I don’t care about your excuses.

348
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,440
Every one of my guys
keeps giving me the same crap.

349
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,320
I’m sick of hearing it.

350
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
Here’s what we’ll do.

351
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,880
I’m setting a deadline.

352
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,080
Three days.

353
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,360
Get me Charlie’s blood within three days.

354
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,400
Three days?

355
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,360
Are you insane?

356
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,160
If I don’t get Charlie’s blood—

357
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,480
you’re dead.

358
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,840
And all your little teammates?

359
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,840
They’ll meet you in hell.

360
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,200
I’ll get it done.

361
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,440
But you have to release Dean and Kenta.

362
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,320
I always keep my promises.

363
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,520
I saw everything.

364
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,600
You’re working with them, aren’t you?

365
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,280
Kim, just listen to me first—

366
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,640
- I’ve been trying to help everyone—
- Don’t lie to me.

367
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,480
The mark behind your ear,

368
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,600
you driving into Tony’s lab—

369
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,520
and you’re still lying?

370
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,480
Dean and Kenta are still alive.
I’ve been trying to save them.

371
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Is that true?

372
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Then...

373
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,520
how are they doing?

374
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,680
Dean’s not doing so well.

375
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,440
Kenta’s holding on for now.

376
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,720
But I don’t know
how much longer they’ll last.

377
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Kim.

378
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,320
If you want to save them both—

379
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,200
you have to work with me.

380
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,680
There’s something important
everyone needs to know.

381
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,760
I need to apologize to you all.

382
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,680
For keeping this from everyone until now.

383
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,080
I didn’t think it really mattered before.

384
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,000
But today, I feel like—

385
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,200
it’s time I told you the truth.

386
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,560
Way is my twin.

387
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,560
And we were both born
from Tony’s test tube experiment.

388
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
See?

389
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,960
I told you this before, didn’t I?

390
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,920
Wait, hang on.

391
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
But I’ve never lied to any of you.

392
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,160
It’s true—I didn’t know Way,
and we’d never met before.

393
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,360
But now I think

394
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,280
I need to be honest with you all.

395
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,480
If Tony’s blood

396
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,000
can be used as a base to create the serum,

397
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,440
maybe they can also use my blood and cells

398
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,560
to run more research and experiments.

399
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
But still, I need everyone’s consent first—

400
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,800
especially yours,

401
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,920
since it would need to be
injected into Charlie’s body.

402
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,240
If that’s what you’re worried about,

403
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,840
you don’t have to be.

404
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,880
Because I’m not like Way.

405
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,840
I was born without any powers.

406
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,200
Tony left me—he didn’t keep me.

407
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,240
So don’t worry, there’s no bond
between me and Tony.

408
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
You can trust me.

409
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,120
I think it’s worth a try.

410
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,960
Okay.

411
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,160
If it’ll help Charlie,

412
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,840
I’m in.

413
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Babe.

414
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,280
Can I talk to you for a sec?

415
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,360
Be right back.

416
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,280
What the hell are you saying?

417
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,280
There’s no way Alan would work for Tony.

418
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,560
I was shocked too when I heard it.

419
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,920
It just doesn’t make sense.

420
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,040
But we shouldn’t let our guard down either.

421
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,760
Babe?

422
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,360
Where are you, Babe?

423
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,840
Where is everyone?

424
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,920
Alan?

425
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,920
You’ve already taken the compound.

426
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,520
Our deal still stands.

427
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,800
Stay with me.

428
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,240
Alan...

429
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,840
Charlie—Charlie!

430
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,200
I’m sorry, Charlie.

431
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Jeff.

432
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Uncle...

433
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,080
What happened to Charlie?

434
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,360
Charlie?

435
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,680
I don’t know.

436
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,640
Found him unconscious in the hallway.

437
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,360
- Charlie—Charlie!
- Charlie!

438
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,160
Alan, what happened?

439
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,160
Charlie! Charlie!

440
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Charlie?

441
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,080
Charlie...

442
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Alan!

443
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,560
Charlie.

444
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,800
Charlie.

445
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Charlie!

446
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,280
Charlie...

447
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Charlie...

448
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,160
Does it hurt?

449
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,360
Who are you?

450
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,080
It’s me, Babe. I’m Babe!

451
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,080
Jeff.

452
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,320
Hey—

453
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,720
We’re at the lab where you work.

454
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,720
Right now we’re working
on the dissolving serum.

455
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,360
Do you remember anything?

456
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,680
Anything at all?

457
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,320
No... I don’t remember.

458
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
You don’t remember anything before this?

459
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,560
Charlie.

460
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
That’s Mama, see?

461
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,640
Papa, do you remember Mama?

462
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
This is Babe—he’s your boyfriend.

463
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,040
And this is Alan.

464
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Mama and Papa were getting married.

465
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,440
But now... that doesn’t matter anymore.

466
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Charlie—Charlie!

467
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,360
You’ve got a headache?

468
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,240
Chris—

469
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,120
Maybe let’s not pressure Charlie right now.

470
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,440
He should get some rest first.

471
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,960
So what exactly is Charlie’s condition?

472
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,520
From what I can tell,

473
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,640
it’s likely sudden-onset memory loss
possibly acute dementia.

474
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,920
Looks like Charlie pushed
his powers past the limit.

475
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,200
That may have triggered this condition.

476
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,160
So what should we do now?

477
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,880
First step—

478
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,200
I’ll consult a neurologist to be sure.

479
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,360
Once we know more,
I’ll keep you all updated.

480
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Uncle.

481
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,640
Can I stay with Charlie tonight?

482
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,960
Maybe it’s better if Jeff stays instead.

483
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,120
Charlie doesn’t remember anything.

484
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,720
He might feel safer if it’s Jeff.

485
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,520
But I’m worried
his condition might get worse.

486
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Please?

487
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,600
Then we can both stay, okay?

488
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,040
With me there too, he’ll be fine.

489
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,600
You go home and rest, Uncle.

490
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,720
I don’t want anything
to happen to you too, Uncle.

491
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,600
Charlie.

492
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,680
How are you feeling?

493
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,440
Hey...

494
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,520
Are we...

495
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Are we really together?

496
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Yeah.

497
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,320
We’re boyfriends.

498
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Here, Charlie. Take a look.

499
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
This one—

500
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,320
This is Papa’s ring.

501
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,480
And this one—

502
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,520
It’s Mama’s ring.

503
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,880
We’ve even got matching rings.

504
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,600
I really don’t remember any of this.

505
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,000
It’s okay.

506
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,920
It’s okay if you can’t remember yet.

507
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,760
Mama remembers everything.

508
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,720
I’ll tell you the whole story, bit by bit.

509
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,040
Until Papa remembers again.

510
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,560
What if I never do?

511
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
I...

512
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,360
don’t really feel—

513
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,720
familiar with you.

514
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
What if I let you down?

515
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,920
You won’t.

516
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,040
Mama will do whatever it takes

517
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
to help Papa remember.

518
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
See?

519
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Take the blood to the researchers.

520
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,680
Make sure it really belongs to Charlie.

521
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,120
Yes, sir.

522
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,160
Check it thoroughly.

523
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,200
Because if it’s not—

524
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,360
you’re dead.

525
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,640
Once it’s confirmed,

526
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,160
it’s time for you to keep your promise.

527
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,200
Let Dean and Kenta go.

528
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,520
Relax.

529
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,120
I always keep my word.

530
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,600
If everything goes as agreed,

531
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,320
I’ll release them like I said.

532
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,960
I said I’d release them.

533
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,880
But I never said—

534
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,160
when I’d do it.

535
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,280
You think just
a little bit of Charlie’s blood

536
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,480
is worth trading for Kenta and Dean?

537
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,760
One more thing

538
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,800
you have to do for me.

539
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,240
What?

540
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,520
Do whatever it takes—

541
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,440
to make Babe crawl back to me.

542
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,400
Are all these trophies really yours?

543
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,160
Can I ask you something?

544
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,360
Don’t call me “you,” call me “P’Babe.”

545
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,400
Why?

546
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,960
You sound like we’re
not gonna be together anymore.

547
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,400
This is Tony’s research on special abilities.

548
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,440
I’ve got a test subject.

549
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,000
Looks like Tony’s already
started his next move.

550
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
Then we need to take Tony down now.

551
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,360
I’m not following your orders anymore.

552
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,080
I’m calling off the deal today.

553
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,600
P’Babe, your dad’s here.

554
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,120
Uncle.

555
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,840
(Take good care of him!!)

556
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
(Mama’s worried about Papa.)

557
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,280
Actually—

558
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,480
Can you? / Worse than a bus.
(This one’s got style for days.)

559
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,360
- More like a songthaew.
- Try again.

560
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,320
Nope, that’s not it.

561
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,120
Go kiss him already.

562
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,520
Let the queue move.
(This guy’s still waiting.)

563
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,440
This is the third round.
(Every round, man.)

564
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,840
You don’t just barge into someone’s house—

565
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,760
without knocking or giving a call first.

566
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,960
All three cars are lining up side by side.
