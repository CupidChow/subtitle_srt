1
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,120
I always believed in you.
But you're the one who destroyed that.

2
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,720
How many times do I have to tell you
to stop seeing me as the one who died?

3
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,080
Do you not trust me,
or are you just jealous?

4
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,759
I did what I love.

5
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,600
You too. We just found
what we love in different ways.

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,600
If I ever see your face off the track again,

7
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,039
I'm running you over.

8
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,759
Bring Charlie back.

9
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,200
And get rid of everyone around him.

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,840
I didn’t lose on purpose.
I just never managed to beat you.

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,840
To the victory of X-Hunter.

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,680
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,920
Hey North, you were killing it today.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,760
What was your nickname again?
North Hot Speed, right?

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,880
Man, Dean.
With that performance...

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,320
He’s now been promoted to
North the Next King.

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
If he didn’t spin out first.

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
No idea. Whoa.

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,520
If Willy didn’t block my rise...

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,400
I would've finished side by side with Babe.

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,480
So intense.
My heart was about to explode.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
Willy’s really leveling up.

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,760
Yeah, true.

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,120
Mhm.

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
Same here.
I thought we were done for.

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,880
Good thing Babe and Charlie made it back.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm telling you,
if we keep working as a team like this.

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,480
No one can beat X-Hunter.

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,960
But... are Babe and Charlie good now?

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,280
Aw, kid. Don’t worry.

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,600
If those two vanished from the after party.

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,360
Where else could they be?

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,840
Except...

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,360
It has to be for sure that...

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,600
That...

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,200
Drink.

37
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I think you're drunk. Are you?

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
Someone’s heartbroken, huh?

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,160
I really hate it when we fight.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,800
But I'm glad we could make up.

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,880
Babe.

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,160
I think we shouldn’t
get back together just yet.

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,920
Why?

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,280
I just need some time to think.

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,880
How much time do you need, Charlie?

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Until I’m sure.

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,360
That I’m good enough
to really be by your side.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
Please give me a bit more time.

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
What are you still unsure about?

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,680
You've stayed by my side
and looked after me.

51
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,800
You made me a better person.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,640
We work well together, Charlie.

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,000
You saw it today, didn’t you?
What more do you need?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,480
Or am I not good enough for you?

55
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,560
You are good enough, Babe.

56
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,320
But I just don’t want us to fight again.

57
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
About Willy, about the test laps...

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
Maybe it'd be better
if we had a bit of space.

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,680
It’s up to you then.

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,680
Why haven't you brought Charlie back yet?

61
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,520
And you even lost to him on the track.

62
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
Completely useless.

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,640
I just couldn’t find the right timing.

64
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,400
So I had to stay cautious.

65
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
Feels like he knows I have powers.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
So what? I have to waste my time
just because you’re too scared to act?

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,000
You're afraid of him.

68
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,240
But you're not afraid of me.

69
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,920
Let me remind you of something.

70
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Someone I raised with my own hands...

71
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
I still killed him.

72
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,800
So someone I brought back
from the dead like you...

73
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,360
Why would I keep you?

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
Don't bother trying.

75
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,720
Who the hell are you?

76
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
The one who brought you back from the dead.

77
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,000
And turned someone as ordinary as you...

78
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,360
into an alpha with special senses.

79
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
What the hell are you on about?

80
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,960
Let me go. Let go!

81
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,200
Fiery, huh?

82
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
You really do fight like a warrior.

83
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,160
But just so you know,
the chip in your body...

84
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,760
It could explode at any time.

85
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
If you work for me...

86
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll let you live.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
Yes.

88
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,760
I haven’t forgotten.

89
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,080
You’re the one who gave me a second life.

90
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,840
I’ll do whatever it takes to get Charlie back.

91
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Good.

92
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,680
Let’s hope next time I see you,
you’ll bring good news.

93
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,080
Weird vibe in here.

94
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
North?

95
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Sonic?

96
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,040
You guys fighting?

97
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,880
He’s fighting by himself.

98
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
He won’t talk to me.

99
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,880
He’s avoiding me too.

100
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
I’m not fighting anyone, uncle. I’m fine.

101
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,680
I’m just focused on training for the race.

102
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
You two, seriously...

103
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,240
If something’s wrong, just talk it out.

104
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,960
Don’t act like kids.

105
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,400
Jeff, is he helping Dean with the car?

106
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,880
Haven’t seen him, uncle.

107
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Huh?

108
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,160
He left home since morning though.

109
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
- Where’d he go?
- Alan.

110
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
I finished the car setup.

111
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,160
Babe isn’t showing up today, right?

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
What about Charlie?

113
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,080
If Babe isn’t coming,

114
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,560
I doubt Charlie will either.

115
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,280
Want me to try calling them?

116
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,200
Yeah, give it a shot.

117
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Okay.

118
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,920
No need to call, uncle.

119
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
Thought you weren’t coming.

120
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,920
Ever since you made up with Babe,
you’ve been totally gone.

121
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
Come on. Since you’re here, let’s train.

122
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
I’m not here to train today.

123
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,200
I came because there’s something
I want to tell you all.

124
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,280
What is it?

125
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,400
I want to resign from the team.

126
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,920
Charlie, you still haven’t made up with Babe?

127
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,560
I even gave you two alone
time in the locker room.

128
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,000
You didn’t show up to the party either.

129
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
This has nothing to do
with our relationship, uncle.

130
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Right now, I just want to
focus seriously on my lab work.

131
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,240
And you’re quitting in the middle like this?

132
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Can’t you wait until the season ends?

133
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,320
Racing is a team sport, you know?

134
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,800
I’m really sorry, bro.

135
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,400
I do love racing, I really do.

136
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,320
But the lab work just can’t wait.

137
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,800
I tried doing both,
and it just doesn’t work.

138
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,880
So I have to focus on the lab first.

139
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,080
Please try to understand me.

140
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
Alright, whatever.

141
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,960
You’ve already made up your mind anyway.

142
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,800
What’s your deal, seriously?
Just suddenly quitting the team?

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,640
Why are you mad? I quit uncle’s team...

144
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,920
Not the one you’re running, you know?

145
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,120
How can I not be mad?

146
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
I haven’t seen my boyfriend
this pissed in a while.

147
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,280
The garage vibes are already tense...

148
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
And you still had the guts to come find me?

149
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
Come on now.

150
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,080
This is more important
than your boyfriend’s mood.

151
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,360
The other day I raced with Willy.

152
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,320
I think he might be
an alpha with special senses.

153
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,800
But I don’t know what his power is.

154
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,400
So you’re not sure either?

155
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,720
Then that means everything
Babe suspected is true?

156
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,400
Then go apologize to him.

157
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,280
If I could tell him, I would’ve.
But I can’t say anything yet.

158
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Because the one who sent Willy... was Tony.

159
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,400
Tony? Tony again?

160
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,080
That day, I followed Willy.

161
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,920
To figure out what his power really was.

162
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Tony ordered Willy...

163
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,640
To take out everyone around me.

164
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,240
And he said...

165
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,320
He wanted me.

166
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,320
Probably to use me for something.

167
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,320
So it’s just like before all over again.

168
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,800
Only difference is...
it’s not Babe this time, it’s me.

169
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,600
By now, I’m sure he already knows
what my power can do.

170
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,600
Tony probably wants this power.

171
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,080
So that’s why you pretended to quit the team.

172
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
And won’t go back to Babe.

173
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,080
Even though...
you actually want to make up, right?

174
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,800
It’s better than putting
everyone else at risk.

175
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,360
You really think you’re a hero?

176
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Solving everything on your own?

177
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,680
I can’t drag anyone else into this.

178
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,520
If anything goes wrong...

179
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
It’ll be just me who doesn’t make it.

180
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,480
Think it through.

181
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,680
Even if you die... how can you be sure...

182
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
That Tony will stop hurting others?

183
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Is the path you’ve chosen
really the best one?

184
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Hey, kid.

185
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,360
Where’ve you been?

186
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,200
Had some stuff to take care of.
Sorry I didn’t tell you first, uncle.

187
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,520
It’s alright. I get it.

188
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Things at the garage have been messy lately.

189
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
If it’s too much, you have to let me know.

190
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,400
You too, uncle. If the pain's still there,
don’t forget to see a doctor.

191
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,400
- Gotta take care of your own body, you know.
- I know, I know.

192
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,080
- Babe.
- Babe.

193
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,640
What’s going on?
You’re here kinda late.

194
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,080
Sorry for dropping by so late.

195
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,200
Can I crash here tonight?

196
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
You good?

197
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,720
Charlie packed up and left.

198
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,000
I can’t sleep there alone.

199
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Everywhere I look, I think of him.

200
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,280
You okay?

201
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,400
At first I really thought
we were gonna make up.

202
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,840
Things were finally going well.

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,320
Then he told me...

204
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,200
We can’t go back to how we were.

205
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,600
Kid, have you talked to Charlie lately?

206
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,200
Even Babe… Charlie won’t talk to him either.

207
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,520
To me? He doesn’t say anything at all.

208
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,119
Jeff, can you check my future for me?

209
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,599
See if Charlie and I will ever be together again.

210
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
Babe...

211
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,680
Come on, just check for me.

212
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,599
Please don’t lie to me.
I’m begging you.

213
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,800
Babe, my powers aren’t stable right now.

214
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,120
I don’t think I can read your future.

215
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
I’m sorry.

216
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
I’ll head inside first.

217
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,000
You two can talk more privately that way.

218
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,040
Then stay here tonight.

219
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,920
Take your time
and go back when you're ready.

220
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,920
Make yourself at home.

221
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Thanks, uncle.

222
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,600
No worries. I’ve been the one
tying up every loose end anyway.

223
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,440
Come on, get some rest inside.

224
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,320
Don’t overthink. Just rest.

225
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,440
You woke me up early...

226
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,120
Just to watch you shadowbox in my room?

227
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,720
Kim, tell me honestly.

228
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,680
Can you not go back to Korea?

229
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,240
Can you come back and race for X-Hunter?

230
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,920
You already know why I left the team.

231
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Because I want to be number one.

232
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,680
I was born to be
the main character, not a sidekick.

233
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Sit down.

234
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,560
I think your back’s in trouble.

235
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,280
Take it easy or you’ll hurt it even more.

236
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,120
It’s fine. I’m okay.

237
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,000
If the team I built
half my life is falling apart...

238
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,000
A busted back isn’t that big a deal.

239
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,280
Alan, why are you getting all dramatic?

240
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,360
Now I feel bad, man.

241
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
What do you guys see my team as?

242
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Come and go whenever you feel like it?

243
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,920
You and Charlie—where did I go wrong?

244
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,600
Sorry for ranting.

245
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,480
I just really don’t know what else to do.

246
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,120
If it’ll make you feel better...

247
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,480
Go ahead and yell. I can take it.

248
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
But if running the team...

249
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,040
is stressing you out this much...

250
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,000
Maybe you should take a break.

251
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,040
You can take a break from life too, you know.

252
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,120
If I step back,
what will everyone else do?

253
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,320
Racers like you still have a way forward.

254
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,080
But what about the rest of the crew?

255
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,520
They’re like family to me.

256
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,920
I’ve got a responsibility
to make sure everyone’s okay.

257
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,600
Whoa whoa, hey—wait up!

258
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
You care about everyone so much,
you forgot your own happiness.

259
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,800
You’re bottling up too much.

260
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,480
Be careful or you’ll end up like Kenta.
That’s not good.

261
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,560
That’s why I came to unload in your room.

262
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
And you, man...

263
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,920
You were the first one to leave my team
and stress me out.

264
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,200
You owe me for that.

265
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,600
So what did you call me out here for?

266
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
Don’t tell me you’re having problems
with your researchers again.

267
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,680
Why don’t you trust Chris?

268
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,000
Because he’s shady.

269
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,240
Just one look at that face and
you know to stay away.

270
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,800
But you still wanna mess with fire.

271
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
It’s not like I want him to replace Way.

272
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
I’m just not sure about myself yet.

273
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,680
So that’s all you needed?
I’m heading back.

274
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,120
Wait a sec.

275
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,920
I recovered the data
from the hard drive you gave me.

276
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,240
There’s someone listed
in the Unlock the Power of Change project.

277
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
His name is Kawin.

278
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,280
He was a former athlete who got
injured and couldn’t compete anymore.

279
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Disappeared from home once.

280
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,560
The neighbors even called the police.

281
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,480
Then one day,
he just came back out of nowhere.

282
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,400
But what changed was…
Kawin started having mental issues.

283
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,680
You think it’s from the experiment?

284
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,480
I’m not sure yet.

285
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,200
Then just send me the rest of the info later.

286
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,040
I’ll take care of the rest.

287
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Okay.

288
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,600
That look on your face—
did you and Pete have a fight?

289
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
What look?

290
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
Never mind.

291
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,720
Thought it was some
love drama or something.

292
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,400
Quit racing, dragged
your suitcase out of the house...

293
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,120
All I asked for was time.
Did you have to go this far?

294
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,680
Charlie, at least give me
a reason that makes sense.

295
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,600
Do you really think what you’re doing...

296
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Is actually good for us?

297
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,000
I put all your meds in the pill box already.

298
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,680
Don’t forget to take them.

299
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,040
And your doctor’s appointments,
practice schedule, race schedule...

300
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,000
I added them all to your calendar.

301
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,120
That’s not what I want to hear.

302
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,400
I also cut up fruit and left it in the fridge.

303
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,400
While I’m gone,
please don’t drink too much.

304
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,920
If you really can’t sleep while I’m away...

305
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,320
You can always call me.

306
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,160
Charlie...

307
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,080
You love me that much?

308
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,480
Then why are you leaving me?

309
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
I still want to be your boyfriend.

310
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,880
Not your ex—someone you
just drop by to hook up with.

311
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,560
Please trust me.

312
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,320
Us living apart...

313
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,880
It’s better for both of us than forcing it.

314
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
Charlie...

315
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,480
I really do love you, Babe.

316
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,880
But I can’t be
the same person for you anymore.

317
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,320
Take care of yourself, okay?

318
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,360
Excuse me.

319
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Is Kawin, the former
national swimmer, around here?

320
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,480
Does he live nearby?

321
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,480
He lives right next door.

322
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
Thank you.

323
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,520
- I need to talk to you, Mr. Kawin.
- Sir—

324
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,840
Mr. Kawin.

325
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,080
Mr. Kawin.

326
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,040
Mr. Kawin.

327
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,480
Please calm down, Mr. Kawin.

328
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,280
They sent you here to take me, didn’t they?

329
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,120
You’re Kawin, right?

330
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,680
I need to talk to you.

331
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,920
I’m scared. Please let me go.

332
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,560
I’m scared. Please let me go.

333
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
Calm down, Mr. Kawin.

334
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
- Sir, Mr. Kawin.
- Mr. Kawin.

335
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,800
Mr. Kawin.

336
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,120
Just calm down.

337
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
Mr. Kawin.

338
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
Mr. Kawin.

339
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,480
Please calm down, Mr. Kawin.

340
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,040
What do you want?

341
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,920
Calm down.

342
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,280
You were part of the project—

343
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,960
What do you want? I’m scared!

344
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,240
They locked me up.
They stabbed me with a knife.

345
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,120
I’m not going back!

346
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,800
Please calm down. Can you remember
where they kept you?

347
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,280
They locked me in a building.

348
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,400
There were people in masks.

349
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm scared. Demon snake. I'm scared.

350
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
Mr. Kawin.

351
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,320
What? What is it?

352
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
I think I might know...

353
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,400
What that demon snake really is.

354
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,000
Kid, that’s enough for now.

355
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Everyone, gather up for a bit.

356
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,600
- North. Sonic.
- Yeah?

357
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,000
What’s going on, uncle?

358
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,480
Someone else quitting the team?

359
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,920
Nope. Just Charlie.

360
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,320
I’ve made up my mind.
I’m letting Dean race in Charlie’s place.

361
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,480
Me? Uncle?

362
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,840
Wait, are you being serious?

363
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,280
You sure about this?

364
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,040
Well, I agree.

365
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,160
Dean’s already got skills as a racer.

366
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,680
Honestly, he should’ve been
on the main lineup instead of me.

367
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,720
If he didn’t screw things up.

368
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,920
Hey, come on now.

369
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,600
I’m the captain, and I’ve decided.

370
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,520
Unless Dean doesn’t
want to race in the main league.

371
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,080
I’m in.

372
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,440
I’ll go with whatever you say, Alan.

373
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,800
If you believe in me...

374
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Then I’m ready to prove myself to you.

375
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,560
Good. Let’s go over the race strategy then.

376
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,320
Come on. You too, North.

377
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,000
Hey, congrats, man.

378
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,440
Why are you avoiding me?

379
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
Why would I avoid you?

380
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Exactly.

381
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,640
So what are you hiding from me?

382
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,800
Or is there something
you’re keeping from me?

383
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Jeff...

384
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,400
You and Charlie—
what are you two hiding from me?

385
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,960
I...

386
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,120
I didn’t want to do this either.

387
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Why?

388
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,840
What is it that I’m not allowed to know?

389
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,720
Actually, I was the one who told him.

390
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,520
Charlie became Tony’s target.

391
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,120
And Tony is planning
to kill everyone around Charlie.

392
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,920
Come in, Jeff. The door’s not locked.

393
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,440
Babe, how did you even get here?

394
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,000
So the reason you ran was because of Tony?

395
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,800
It’s like you let him come
 ruin everything we have, Charlie.

396
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,679
If you’re afraid being
with me will get me killed,

397
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,520
Then I’ll be the one who stays close to you.

398
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,120
We agreed we should
keep our distance, didn’t we?

399
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Charlie...

400
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,480
You made that decision all on your own.

401
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,120
I never wanted to be apart from you.

402
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,200
Here, I’ll add the noodles.

403
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,880
Just sit and wait, I’ll handle it.

404
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,880
But after you eat,
you really should go back home.

405
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,400
This isn’t going to work, Babe.

406
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,600
Please wait over there properly.

407
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,120
Mama just wants to know
how strong Papa’s will really is.

408
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,480
You really gonna stop here?

409
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Mama came all this way to make up with you.

410
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,680
Papa, you’re not going soft on me at all?

411
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,600
You’re seriously stone cold.

412
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,520
What’s wrong?

413
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,880
I just want all of us
to stop going through this.

414
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,520
If there were no special senses or anything...

415
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,920
That might be the best way out.

416
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Alright.

417
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,400
Let’s go with that then.

418
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,120
We don’t need to get back together just yet.

419
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,320
But Papa, please don’t push
Mama out of your life, okay?

420
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,880
Mama loves Papa so much.

421
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
You know that, right?

422
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
I should go finish cooking.

423
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
I’ll leave the ring here.

424
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,080
Wear it if you want.

425
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,880
If not, that’s okay too.

426
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
But I’m not going home just yet.

427
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,760
Why that face? Stressed?

428
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,640
Or… want me to go
with you to see the doctor?

429
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,320
It’s okay. I’ll just be out for a bit.

430
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,560
You sure?

431
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Yeah.

432
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,560
Drive safe, okay?

433
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Uncle.

434
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Uncle.

435
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,120
- Haven’t eaten anything.
- What do you feel like eating?

436
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,400
Hmm… maybe something noodle-based?

437
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,440
Alright, not sure if they’re open though.

438
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,680
Papa.

439
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,400
Blow my hair for Mama?

440
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
The hairdryer’s in the room, babe.

441
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,440
Go grab it and do it yourself.

442
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,800
Papa, pretty please?
Just blow it for me?

443
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,200
Please? Pleaseee?

444
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,800
Fine. Wait here, I’ll go get it for you.

445
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,360
Mr. Alan has a chronic neck
spinal compression issue.

446
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,800
It’s been there since his racing days.

447
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,600
The doctor thinks it may likely get worse.

448
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,640
Surgery is recommended.

449
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,360
Please excuse me for a moment.

450
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,600
Hey kid, what’s up?

451
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Hello? Hello, Uncle?

452
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,560
Uncle, I think my condition’s getting worse.

453
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,760
It’s… it’s more intense than before.

454
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,000
- Where are you right now?
- I don’t know.

455
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,920
It’s like I’m seeing double…
everything’s overlapping.

456
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,120
Kid…

457
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,760
Yes, Alan?

458
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,080
What did you say?

459
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,320
Okay, I’m on my way, Alan.

460
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,600
What happened?

461
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,080
Kid.

462
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,240
How are you feeling?

463
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,320
What happened to me?

464
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,080
You crashed the car.

465
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,120
Luckily, no brain damage.

466
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
No broken bones either.

467
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,200
Alan told me everything.

468
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,440
The side effects of
your power got worse, didn’t they?

469
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,400
You really can’t control it anymore?

470
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Jeff.

471
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,000
Did you hear what I said, Jeff?

472
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,680
Jeff, can you hear me?

473
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,760
Kid.

474
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Kid.

475
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Kid.

476
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
Kid.

477
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,880
Kid.

478
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,440
Are you okay?

479
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,200
I’m seeing everything double… all over.

480
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,880
It’s okay. You’re okay.

481
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,600
I’m right here. You’re going to be fine.

482
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,920
I’m here. Don’t be scared.

483
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,400
Alan, is Jeff’s condition really this serious?

484
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
That ability-reversing
drug you’re working on—

485
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,000
There’s still hope, right, Charlie?

486
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,640
You okay, Uncle?

487
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah, I’m fine.

488
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,280
Have you seen the doctor yet?

489
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Yeah, I already did.

490
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,360
- Chronic spinal compression in the neck.
- What?

491
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,920
They say I need surgery.

492
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,520
Is it that serious?

493
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,680
Yeah, but I’m not doing it yet.

494
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,080
Don’t worry about me.

495
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,600
But you should take care of yourself too.

496
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,040
I can’t.

497
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,200
I need to be here for Jeff.

498
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,960
Jeff’s in serious condition.

499
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
I can’t even help him right now.

500
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,120
If I go in for surgery…

501
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,800
I’d be leaving Jeff. Leaving you guys.

502
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,520
Leaving X-Hunter.

503
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,800
I’d hate myself even more.

504
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,000
It’s my fault.

505
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,680
I wasn’t strong enough to protect any of you.

506
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Hey.

507
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,600
If we didn’t have you—

508
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,200
things would’ve been even worse.

509
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,640
But you’re still here, and that means a lot.

510
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,400
So stop blaming yourself.

511
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,600
Yeah. Thanks, man.

512
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,760
Charlie, what are you doing?

513
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,720
So you won’t have to suffer anymore.

514
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,840
Not like this, Charlie.

515
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,920
Not like this. Let go.

516
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,680
Charlie!

517
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,360
Charlie!

518
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,480
If you start experimenting on Charlie again,
won’t it make him worse?

519
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,720
And who gave you
the power in the first place?

520
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,200
Who told you to come here?

521
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,920
It’s your indecisiveness
that’s the problem. So annoying.

522
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,200
Lucky us, huh?
Getting to hug like this.

523
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,800
Stay here. I’ll distract him
and draw him away.

524
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,680
- But…
- Trust me.

525
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,600
Did you miss me, Babe?

526
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,800
And now… we reach right in.

527
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,720
Don’t pull down my pants! Ow!

528
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,760
Just place it gently, that’s all.
(Take it easy, Pel Pel.)

529
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,360
It’s just pretend, right?
(Take it easy, Pel Pel.)

530
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,120
I’m heading in now.
(Your audience awaits.)

531
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,400
- Watch out for wind monkeys.
- Wind monkeys incoming!

532
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,240
Get up, get up, get up!

533
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,200
