1
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,440
Tick-tock.

2
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,480
- P'Charlie.
- Willy just came in here.

3
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,800
What are you trying to find out?
Why dig into Way?

4
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
Stop being so indecisive.

5
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,800
Why are you lashing out at me?

6
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Your indecisiveness is the problem.

7
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
Can I charge my battery?

8
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Aren’t you gonna get worse?

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,720
Who told you to go absorb more power?

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,479
I know we’re not dating anymore,

11
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,360
but if anything really happens to you,
I won’t be okay.

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
Willy.

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,040
Hello?

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,400
Hey Babe, Kim called to tell me—

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,560
Willy’s got a special sense too.

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,800
I’ve known that for ages.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,320
But what you need to know is—
Willy can stop time.

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,200
Hi, P'Babe.

19
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Willy...

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
- Long time no see.
- Let go.

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,880
- Missed me, P'Babe?
- Grab him!

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Grab what? Let me go.

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
- Let go of me.
- I think this pose is perfect.

24
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,720
It’s got an erotic vibe.

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
You perv. Let go!

26
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Charlie! Charlie!

27
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,920
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

28
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,040
Sit down.

29
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,400
I said sit.

30
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,560
Thought you could fly with your own wings?

31
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,400
And yet you crawled back here.

32
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,560
Like a stray dog with no master, Kenta.

33
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,560
No need to worry, Mr. Tony.

34
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,520
I’ve already checked.

35
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,320
Kim and Kenta snuck in.

36
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
They didn’t take anything out.

37
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,920
They didn’t steal anything.

38
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,320
They came in to snoop around.

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,720
You should try thinking deeper than that.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Well, Kenta?

41
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,720
What are you doing here?

42
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
You’ve got him, right?

43
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,320
Bring him back to me—now.

44
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
Don’t let him die first.

45
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,040
P'Babe.

46
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,960
Mmm, thanks.

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
So...

48
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,760
Is Willy really working for Tony?

49
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,440
No idea.

50
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,920
Is that why Charlie quit the team?

51
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
Yeah.

52
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
Tony said anyone in the way should be killed.

53
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,320
Jeff, have you tracked down Charlie?

54
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,480
Willy turned off Charlie’s phone.

55
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,560
Last location ping was near the lab.

56
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,200
I’ll try tracking it another way.

57
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,840
So no need to find Willy’s place.

58
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,920
Find Tony’s lab instead.

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
I’ll drag him out myself.

60
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,240
I can take you guys there.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,240
But can we get back out?

62
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,840
I’m not sure.

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,920
Kim and Kenta just raided Tony’s lab.

64
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,240
And Kenta got captured.

65
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
Tony’s lab?

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
Just the two of you?

67
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,159
I didn’t want to go.

68
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,760
But you know Kenta—he trusts no one.

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,120
And he didn’t want anyone else in danger.

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,159
What did you see in there?

71
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,760
Tony’s testing drugs like we are.

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,080
But his are skill boosters.

73
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,440
They’re for people who never had powers—

74
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,159
to give them powers.

75
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,120
So Tony’s planning to build
a special-powered army?

76
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah, pretty much.

77
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
But it’s not that easy.

78
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,320
From the files I saw—

79
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,720
There’s only been one success.

80
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,480
Willy.

81
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,960
So that means Willy—

82
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,640
The one who got time-stopping powers?

83
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,960
Yeah.

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,800
If that drug can really give powers—

85
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,760
why does it still need Charlie?

86
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,760
Maybe it’s because of Charlie’s cells.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,640
Tony’s drug isn’t stable yet, right?

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,640
And Charlie’s body has
special cells.

89
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,320
They can absorb superpowers.

90
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,200
So maybe—

91
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,000
Tony wants to use—

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,600
Charlie's cells to improve his drug.

93
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,200
Then we definitely can’t let Tony catch Charlie.

94
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,240
Hang in there, man.

95
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,240
You won’t be stuck with me for long.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,200
Why are you even keeping me here?

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,040
Why not just hand me to Tony?

98
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
Or are you hiding from Tony too?

99
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,799
Is that why you’re using that jammer?

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,240
Guess you’re not as dumb as you look.

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,520
I thought you’d be stupid.

102
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,040
Because of you guys—

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,760
I’ve had to carry this thing with me.

104
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,400
Tony lost to a bunch of orphans like you.

105
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,560
And now it’s all on me.

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,560
They tested drugs on me.

107
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
Implanted a chip in my head.

108
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,360
Used it to force me
to do whatever they wanted.

109
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,800
If you don’t want to do it, then don’t.

110
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
You and I share the same enemy.

111
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,760
Don’t waste time trying to convert me.

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Tony’s way smarter than you lot.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,240
The chip in my head—

114
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
is there to control me.

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
If I disobey him—

116
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,120
he hits one button and I explode.

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
How’s that?

118
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
Double the benefits, huh?

119
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Maybe...

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,560
Pete’s lab could remove the chip.

121
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,360
I take back what I said
about you being smart.

122
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,320
You think I haven’t tried?

123
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,760
It didn’t work.

124
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
So now I’m using you.

125
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Someone smart like you—

126
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,280
even you have to follow Tony’s orders.

127
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
No matter how messed up they are.

128
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,320
All for your so-called freedom, huh?

129
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
Yeah.

130
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,760
I’ll do anything to get my freedom back.

131
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
You get that?

132
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,120
Mr. Tony.

133
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,520
Willy’s GPS signal just vanished.

134
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,040
Not sure what’s happened to him.

135
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,920
Even if he’s a corpse—

136
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,120
I want him and Charlie back.

137
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Yes, sir.

138
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
You guys are—

139
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,920
so damn annoying.

140
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,560
You know that?

141
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,120
You Japanese brat.

142
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
Stubborn little punk.

143
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,360
Idiot.

144
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,080
If I don’t find Charlie and Willy—

145
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,480
you know how screwed I’ll be?

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,520
You stay and watch him.

147
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,040
The rest of you—come with me.

148
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,000
Still staring?

149
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,040
What the hell you looking at?

150
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,800
Tough guy.

151
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,360
Let me give you a beating, you little punk.

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
Move.

153
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,040
I say we raid Tony’s lab—right now.

154
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,200
Don’t bother helping me.

155
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,560
Willy and Charlie never came back to the lab.

156
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Kenta’s probably the one who sent him to me.

157
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,840
But if Willy didn’t take Charlie to Tony—

158
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,360
what’s he after?

159
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,360
I think Willy’s trying to negotiate
something with Tony.

160
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,080
If it really was Kenta—

161
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,640
would he want us to stay out of it?

162
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,560
He probably wants to keep investigating inside.

163
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Because if he could message me—

164
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
it means he’s still mostly okay.

165
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,640
Let’s hope you’re right about that.

166
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,720
Kenta being undercover in there—

167
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,840
that’s actually useful for us too.

168
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,720
In that case—

169
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,840
our only clue is Willy’s car.

170
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,200
So can we start from the traffic cams?

171
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,960
To be honest, Uncle—

172
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,760
I only got access to one camera.

173
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,640
It’s like ten kilometers away.

174
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,320
Just caught Willy driving past.

175
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,160
That barely tells us anything.

176
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,200
He could’ve gone anywhere.

177
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
Judging by the speed—

178
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,560
he’s probably out of the province by now.

179
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,640
It’ll be hard to track him.

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,720
So that means Willy—

181
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,040
He’s holding Charlie as a hostage.

182
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,120
The good thing about a hostage—

183
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,320
is Willy definitely won’t hurt Charlie now.

184
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
I think you should wait for my call first.

185
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,240
No.

186
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
I’m done waiting.

187
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,120
- Calm down, P'Babe.
- Hey.

188
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,360
Let him go.

189
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
Better than just sitting here.

190
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,360
His boyfriend’s risking his life.

191
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
Anyone would lose it too.

192
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,040
Getting anxious?

193
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,640
Where are you keeping Charlie?

194
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,760
Right now, both Charlie and I are safe.

195
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,440
Enough stalling.

196
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,560
Hurry up and return Charlie as we agreed.

197
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,400
Agreed—or forced?

198
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,720
I won’t hand Charlie over—

199
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
until you remove my chip.

200
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,720
You have no right to bargain with me.

201
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,920
Because if I press this button—

202
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
you’re dead on the spot.

203
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,760
Go ahead, then.

204
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,760
Charlie will die right along with me.

205
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,200
I’ll be waiting at the next race.

206
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,200
Right in front of the live stream.

207
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,600
As for how I’ll return Charlie—

208
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,040
I’ll let you know later.

209
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,440
You can send whoever you want—

210
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,760
but bring a chip remover with you.

211
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,360
A stray dog I gave new life to—

212
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
trying to betray me?

213
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Sounds like a fair trade to me.

214
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,720
You get Charlie—

215
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,440
I get my freedom.

216
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,720
Try playing fair for once.

217
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,960
Pete’s contacts still haven’t found anything?

218
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
But P'Babe still isn’t back.

219
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,400
I’m scared something happened to him.

220
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
He’ll be fine.

221
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,880
You guys go rest for now.

222
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,640
I’ll wait here for Babe.

223
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,840
Go on.

224
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,600
Go.

225
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,240
Go get some rest.

226
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
Why didn’t you tell them—

227
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,920
that I’m Tony’s real son?

228
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,280
I just think—

229
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
it’s not the right time yet.

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,280
Telling them would only cause more trouble.

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,840
And do you think they’ll be okay with it?

232
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,360
Probably not.

233
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,960
Because you hid it from the start.

234
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
But at least they’ll know—

235
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,200
you’re not on Tony’s side anymore.

236
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,480
And you?

237
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,440
You probably don’t trust me either.

238
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,560
You probably hate me for being Tony’s son.

239
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,840
Even I can’t answer that right now.

240
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,320
But if you want me to—

241
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
and earn everyone’s trust—

242
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,400
you need to finish that drug.

243
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
Well? Got any leads?

244
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,920
Nothing at all.

245
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
I’ve gone in circles like ten times.

246
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
Still found nothing.

247
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,600
I’m telling you—

248
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
he must’ve planned this for ages.

249
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,960
For now, we just have to wait
on Pete’s intel.

250
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,320
I freaking hate the word “wait,” man.

251
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,680
I know.

252
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
But what else can we do?

253
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
Babe.

254
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,360
You’ve done your best.

255
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay?

256
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,840
Right now, you should get some rest.

257
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Sleep and recharge a bit.

258
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,520
We’ll start again when you’re up.

259
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,520
Yeah?

260
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
Alright—everyone get to your posts.

261
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
Uncle—your phone.

262
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
Hello?

263
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Hi, I’m calling from
the Orthopedic Surgery Dept.

264
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,640
This is from TV Hospital.

265
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,480
Is this Mr. Khematat Tulphisaan?

266
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,200
We’d like to confirm an appointment
with your doctor this week—

267
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,760
at 2 PM.

268
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
Is that okay?

269
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,080
Yes. Thank you.

270
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,640
I’ll have Alan call back to confirm.

271
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
Hey kid, who was that?

272
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,960
The hospital. What’s wrong, Uncle?

273
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
If we’re dating,
we should trust each other, right?

274
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,200
Why didn’t you tell me anything?

275
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
It’s nothing. Just—

276
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,800
a regular yearly check-up.

277
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,720
That was the orthopedic department.

278
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,080
Do you see me as a stranger?

279
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,000
Or do you think I can’t take care of you?

280
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,840
It’s just—

281
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,400
The doctor keeps pushing for surgery.

282
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,440
It’s chronic spinal nerve compression.

283
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
It happened—

284
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,920
after that last race I was in.

285
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
That’s why I had to quit racing.

286
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,400
And if I get surgery, I’ll need months to recover.

287
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,160
So I wanted to delay it.

288
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,760
I’m sorry, kid.

289
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,680
For not telling you sooner.

290
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,400
Why wouldn’t you talk
to me about something this big?

291
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,240
It’s not like that.

292
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,760
We’re living together—

293
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,480
I just want to be someone you can talk to.

294
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,920
I’m sorry, kid.

295
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,320
Then let’s go see the doctor together.

296
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
Right now—

297
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,600
we all have to stick together.

298
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
I promise—

299
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
once we get through this—

300
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,600
I’ll let you take me to the doctor right away.

301
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,720
Okay?

302
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,160
You might be the big bro of the team—

303
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
but I don’t want you carrying this alone.

304
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,040
Even though I’m small—

305
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,480
I can be someone you can lean on too.

306
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,320
Thanks, kid.

307
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,720
What’s wrong? Tired? You were spacing out.

308
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,320
No, I’m good.

309
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,200
Here.

310
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
Worried about Charlie?

311
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,320
Well—

312
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,160
Something like that.

313
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,080
You can always talk to us, Chris.

314
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Yeah.

315
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,280
We really do care about our teammates.

316
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,960
It’s just—

317
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,560
someone who used to trust me—

318
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
doesn’t anymore.

319
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,280
Whatever, it’s not a big deal.

320
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,040
Come on. Trust really is a big deal.

321
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,920
Well, he doesn’t trust me now.
What else can I do?

322
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,800
Then prove it—until he does.

323
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,400
Watch him. Show it through your actions.

324
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,920
Through your eyes.

325
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,480
Your eyes are the hardest thing to fake.

326
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
The eyes of someone who trusts you—

327
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
and someone who doesn’t—

328
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,520
they look completely different.

329
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,120
Is it a relationship?

330
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,840
I don’t know, honestly.

331
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
We’ve never talked about it.

332
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,680
And me—

333
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,320
I wasn’t serious about it.

334
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,800
I’m rooting for you.

335
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,840
Or maybe... should Liu
pass the message for you?

336
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,760
Might help clear things up faster.

337
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,840
It’s alright.

338
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Tell every team to prep their gear.

339
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,440
We’re about to trade with Willy.

340
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,760
We can’t afford to mess this up.

341
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,160
Copy that.

342
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,760
Once your team is ready—

343
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,040
wait by the field.

344
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,880
Hello, darling.

345
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,760
How’s it going, Kenta baby?

346
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,040
Having fun doing absolutely nothing?

347
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,320
Just house-sitting for now, alright?

348
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
Ugh—what?

349
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,320
Ugh what? Spit it out, man.

350
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,520
I have no clue what you’re saying.

351
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
What the hell?

352
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,240
I don't get any of this.

353
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
This chick's nuts.

354
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,160
Just say something already!

355
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,920
Shit—that's one of my guys!

356
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,720
Take those masks off, all of you!

357
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,400
You—

358
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,280
You—

359
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,560
You—

360
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,040
What are you waiting for? Take it off!

361
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,920
Yeah, you.

362
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,120
I said take it off!

363
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
What’s so hard to understand?

364
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,120
I—said—take—your—damn—mask—off!

365
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,480
Oh hey, Kenta.

366
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,800
Playing hide and seek?

367
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,760
You’re kind of cute, you know.

368
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,760
But you can't run from me.

369
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,520
I’ve got new intel.

370
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,120
Tony’s meeting Willy to trade him for Charlie.

371
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,480
At the racetrack.

372
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,120
During the upcoming race.

373
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,840
Something about this feels off.

374
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,440
They’re setting up an exchange—

375
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,920
at a freaking racetrack?

376
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
It’s way too crowded.

377
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,880
Pete.

378
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,160
How reliable is your intel?

379
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,760
I got it from Kenta.

380
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,480
So I sent someone to check it out.

381
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Turns out the rescue team name
was changed for this race.

382
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,440
And it’s not in our system.

383
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,120
Even if he wants Charlie that badly—

384
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,400
Tony wouldn’t show his face to anyone.

385
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Everyone thinks he’s dead.

386
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,120
But if Willy’s really trading Charlie on that track,

387
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,880
then we’ve got a shot at getting him back.

388
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,000
Since I was born,
I’ve only ever known two people.

389
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,040
And both of them—

390
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,760
never gave a damn about me.

391
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,440
I made you some samgyeopsal.

392
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
Don’t know if you’ll like it.

393
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
I’m not picky.

394
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,880
Thanks.

395
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,400
What was that?

396
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,400
Thank you.

397
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
You stay here.

398
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,840
- I’ll lure them the other way.
- But—

399
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,360
Trust me.

400
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,440
Wherever you run, whatever you do—
just care how I feel, okay?

401
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
Where are you dragging me, Sonic?

402
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
Hey, man.

403
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,200
You sure about letting Dean race?

404
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,040
Why wouldn’t he be allowed?

405
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,480
We need two cars to corner Willy on both sides.

406
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,480
Look, I’m not saying anything bad, okay?

407
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,720
But Willy managed to track down Charlie.

408
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,920
We might have a mole in our team.

409
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,520
I get where you’re coming from, Sonic.

410
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,880
But have you learned
anything from what happened?

411
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,560
Or did you forget it all?

412
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,120
I haven’t forgotten.

413
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,480
But I believe people can change, man.

414
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,840
And everyone—

415
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,159
deserves a second chance.

416
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
Give him a shot, will you?

417
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,400
Sonic.

418
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,240
I know you don’t trust me.

419
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,320
Yeah…

420
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I really don’t, to be honest.

421
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,880
You messed up once already.

422
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,960
How do I know you won’t mess up again?

423
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,560
It’s fair if you think that.

424
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,480
But tomorrow, I’ll prove myself.

425
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,160
That I’m still one of X-Hunter,
through and through.

426
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,920
Is something urgent going on?

427
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,400
Not really, no.

428
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,160
I just wanted to talk to you
face-to-face and clear things up.

429
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,080
About your trust.

430
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,800
Is my trust really
that important to you?

431
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,640
Let me make it clear right now.

432
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,920
Someone like Tony
who uses science as a weapon—

433
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,080
I would never work with someone like him.

434
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,600
And even if you were just a hookup—

435
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,920
I’d still feel uneasy

436
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
knowing you saw me as the enemy.

437
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,400
I believe—

438
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,800
that if you really wanted to team up with Tony,

439
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,440
you wouldn’t have come to this lab in the first place.

440
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,240
Aren’t you gonna try using your powers on me? Tie me up or something?

441
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,720
No need for that.

442
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,720
I trust you.

443
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,960
Babe, you good?

444
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm good.

445
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,240
I'm Pitbabe, you know?

446
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Your insomnia’s back, isn’t it?

447
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,400
I saw your hands shaking just now.

448
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,600
It’s just physical stuff.

449
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,960
A sleeping pill and I’ll be fine.

450
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,520
Save your strength, okay?

451
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,040
Back when you still had powers—

452
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,040
you saw a vision of Charlie
getting captured, right?

453
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
But Alan told me something.

454
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,760
That you once saw the future—

455
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,560
where you and him wouldn’t end up together.

456
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,760
You wouldn’t be with him.

457
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,480
What about me and Charlie?

458
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,920
Did you ever see anything?

459
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,240
Never.

460
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,920
But Charlie once told me—

461
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,880
no matter how bad the future looks,

462
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,600
everything can change.

463
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,640
It depends on what we do now.

464
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,000
I believe in you and Charlie.

465
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,520
Both of you—

466
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
are willing to do whatever it takes

467
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,920
to get back to each other.

468
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,520
Welcome to The Hallow Super GT Street Thunder—

469
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,720
this is the fifth round.

470
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,400
All competitors are
now getting ready for the race.

471
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
Only three minutes left on the countdown.

472
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,800
But it seems that the competitor from team ETA—Willy—

473
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
still hasn’t shown up.

474
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,640
Still no sign of Willy.

475
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,080
You think he’s gonna show?

476
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
No idea.

477
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,760
Track officials are still finalizing preparations.

478
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,600
Including the live broadcast division—

479
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,000
all getting ready for the race to begin.

480
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,640
Alan.

481
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,680
What if Willy doesn’t show up?

482
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,800
Calm down, Babe.

483
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,160
We’ve still got one minute left.

484
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,480
Drivers, get ready to start your engines.

485
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,560
Shit.

486
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,640
- One minute left, let’s go.
- Go!

487
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,960
All drivers, please take your
positions by your cars.

488
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,320
Oh, here he comes!

489
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,640
And here’s Willy from
team ETA entering the track.

490
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,600
Now that’s the real deal.

491
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,360
ETA fans can breathe easy now.

492
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,040
All racers are now present on the track.

493
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,480
Get ready, everyone.
No matter what happens—stay focused.

494
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,360
Here are today’s starting positions:

495
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,360
First is Pitbabe from X-Hunter.

496
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,680
Second is Dean from X-Hunter.

497
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,680
And the one who just arrived—
Willy from team ETA.

498
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,680
Less than 30 seconds remaining now.

499
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,800
Drivers are ready.

500
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,320
Everyone else, clear the track.

501
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,800
And they’re off!

502
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,800
Willy from team ETA takes the early lead.

503
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,160
He’s ahead for now.

504
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
Followed by Pitbabe and Dean.

505
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,320
First turn now—no changes in position yet.

506
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,040
Willy pushes forward—really going for it.

507
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,960
Pitbabe still on his tail, then Dean and North.

508
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,200
There are lots of blind spots in this track,

509
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,440
- especially around the containers.
- Entering Zone B now.

510
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,440
That’s our meeting point.

511
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,800
Then what?

512
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
Rescue teams are stationed closest to the track.

513
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,040
Willy from ETA still holds the lead.

514
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,200
Just get the package and the guy on that car.

515
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,280
Shouldn’t be too hard for you.

516
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,840
And how will I know—

517
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,600
which spot is the meeting point?

518
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,120
The blind corner near the containers.

519
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,440
It’s a place you can duck into.

520
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,320
Just meet me there.

521
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,840
Watch out, folks—

522
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,480
it’s a tight and slippery section up ahead.

523
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,120
If you're not careful,
accidents can easily happen.

524
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
Everyone, get ready.

525
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,800
Tomorrow, we’re gonna have to cover the rear.

526
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,120
We’ll stay at the back to tail Willy.

527
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,760
And intercept his plan.

528
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,160
ETA’s taken the lead now.

529
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,720
Then I’ll disguise myself as a race official

530
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,680
to block the exit.

531
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,520
- Ready, Kim?
- Let’s see who wins this one.

532
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,520
It’s time to find out who’ll take the crown.

533
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,640
Willy must’ve planned the trade-off with Charlie in secret.

534
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,160
And the most likely location—

535
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,960
would be one of the container corners.

536
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,160
- So—
- Here we go.

537
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,840
- we’ll force Willy
- Someone just overtook!

538
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,200
off the route, somehow.

539
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,040
Good plan.

540
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,560
But what if someone sees us?

541
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,960
There are a lot of cameras there too.

542
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,560
- Kid, did you cut the signal yet?
- Close call—X-Hunter or ETA?

543
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,720
Let’s see who’s gonna come out on top.

544
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,920
- Nice timing.
- Uh-oh, what happened?

545
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
- Signal’s out—cut off completely.
- All right, we’re ready.

546
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,440
Everyone, start the plan.

547
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,160
Ready? North, you go ahead and pass him.

548
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,680
Dean, cover the right side.

549
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,560
I’ll bring up the rear.

550
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,280
Everyone, surround Willy.
Don’t let him escape.

551
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,080
Hold him steady for now.

552
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,440
Don’t let him veer off—
guide him to the rendezvous point.

553
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,280
Stay cool, just one more turn.

554
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,320
Now’s the moment. North, go for it.

555
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,240
On it, bro.

556
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,040
This side’s all sealed off.

557
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,920
Everything’s going to plan.
Willy’s fallen into our trap.

558
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,880
Missed me so bad you couldn’t wait, huh, Babe?

559
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,480
Coming at me like this... it’s kinda thrilling.

560
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,400
You might get more than a
thrill. You’re dead meat today.

561
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,000
Bet that sucks, huh?

562
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,760
Tell me where Charlie is.

563
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,160
Babe, Dean—hurry it up. Rescue’s on the way.

564
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,960
Babe, Alan here. The rescue crew’s closing in.

565
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,880
If you want Charlie back,

566
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,640
you’ll have to trade me something.

567
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Trade you my fist first, you jerk.

568
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,480
Talk! You wanna die? You wanna die?

569
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,000
I love it.

570
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,800
Rough stuff like this.

571
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,960
Babe, maybe stop—he could actually die.

572
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,400
Babe.

573
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,040
Here.

574
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,920
Hurry, Babe!

575
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,560
Damn, he’s heavy as hell.

576
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,640
Babe, get out first. I’ll handle things here.

577
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,960
Yeah.

578
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,400
Dean, can you help hold them off?

579
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,960
- Let Babe make his escape first.
- Got it, Alan. I’ll handle this.

580
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,440
This kid…

581
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,120
...sure has guts.

582
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,840
What, you going superhero mode again?

583
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,680
Dean! Dean!

584
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,240
Dean, answer me! You okay? Dean!

585
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,200
Where’s the key?

586
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,120
Dig for it.

587
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,080
Get it out.

588
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,200
I’m sorry, Babe. All of this
happened because of me.

589
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,240
I just... I don’t even know
what this thing between us is.

590
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,080
- Thanks for still being here.
- I’ll always be here.

591
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,040
I’ve come up with a new idea
to improve our skill nullifier.

592
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,880
Charlie. Charlie!

593
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,800
Whatever the reason may be,

594
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,120
since we’ve made a deal,

595
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,440
I need you to keep your word.

596
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,080
(Just a little cuddle, please.)

597
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,880
Shake that waist, pop it, pop it!

598
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,960
(This dancer’s on fire.)

599
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,640
Charlie.

600
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,240
Whoa, you scared, bro?

601
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,320
Seventh heaven, yeah yeah!

602
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,640
Seventh heaven, yeah!

603
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,640
(Tied tight!)
Cheer me on, okay?

604
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,000
- Okay.
- This is it.

605
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,320
Sorry.

606
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,920
(Pel Pel fainted!!)

607
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,720
Someone get a mini fan over here!

608
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,560
(Milk’s not doing so well either.)
