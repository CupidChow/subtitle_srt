1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,039
The new researcher at
Pete's lab looks exactly like Way.

2
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please, come on in.

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,880
Right now, I just want
to earn back all your trust.

4
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,600
Just wait and see the person I sent in...

5
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,320
They’re gonna totally wreck X-Hunter.

6
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,120
So, Pit Babe,
wanna do something fun with me?

7
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,520
I'm a huge fan! Can I take a photo with you?

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
What the hell are you doing?

9
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,039
Is the bar seriously that packed?

10
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,600
Why do I smell alpha on you?

11
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,800
Call Babe, quick!

12
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
What?

13
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,760
Babe? Are you serious?

14
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,160
Alright, I’ll tell Charlie.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Touch.

16
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,800
Can you switch off the stim device?

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,440
Nobody's allowed to turn it off.

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,960
But I’m the one
who gave the order to shut it down.

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,600
Babe just had an accident.

20
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,840
Charlie needs to get to the hospital right now.

21
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
But the brainwave scan isn’t finished yet.

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,240
No one’s allowed to shut down the stim device.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,800
Not even you.

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Mr. Chris.

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
The one in the accident...

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,800
He’s Charlie’s boyfriend.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,320
Even if the skill eraser is important,

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,640
it’s not more important than someone’s life.

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,320
Touch.

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,400
-Please shut down the stim device.
-Okay.

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Charlie.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
Charlie...

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
Charlie, wake up.

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,360
It’s a car accident case.

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,280
The guy who looked kinda cool.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,960
Which room?

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Let me check that for you.

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
How’s Babe doing, bro?

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
He's safe. Just a strained tendon.

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,280
The doctor’s gonna run a few more checks.

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
If all’s good, he’ll move to recovery soon.

42
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,960
So who hit Babe? Do we know yet?

43
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,680
The cops said it was a hit-and-run.

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
They haven’t caught the driver yet.

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,200
The crash was that bad...

46
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,120
How could the other guy still be okay?

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,040
Didn't they get hurt at all?

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,640
No idea, honestly.

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,360
Cops already checked the CCTV.

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,080
But they couldn’t tell where the car came from.

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,520
A witness said that...

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,160
It looked like the car ran
a red light and never even braked.

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,000
It was on purpose.

54
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
I saw this future coming.

55
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,400
What do you mean, kid?

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,760
Didn’t you say you had your
sense under control for a year?

57
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
I just started seeing again.

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,320
The first time I saw it...

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,840
I didn’t know what it was about.

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,920
Until today happened.

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,680
The car that hit us...

62
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,040
It looked like it hit on purpose and drove off.

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,360
So that’s when you called me?

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
To come see Babe?

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,200
Yeah.

66
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
When did your sense come back?

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,760
Just recently.

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,159
At first...

69
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,800
I thought I could still keep my power in check.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,280
Until suddenly...

71
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
I felt pain.

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
Pain?

73
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,160
Yeah.

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
I felt pain.

75
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,640
Like I got hit by something
when I saw the vision.

76
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
I only realized today...

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,920
It was the same pain.

78
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,880
The same pain Babe felt when he got hit.

79
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Jeff.

80
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,480
If seeing the future
physically hurts you like this...

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,040
That’s not exactly a good sign, man.

82
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,159
Exactly.

83
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,480
I think your special ability's
gotten stronger than before.

84
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Now you actually feel
what’s going to happen too.

85
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Something this serious...

86
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,800
You didn’t think to tell me?

87
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,640
Even if I did tell you,

88
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,400
you wouldn’t have been able to help me.

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,960
But I’m fine now, really.

90
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,880
I just felt it
it's not like I actually got hurt.

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
So what, you’d wait until

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,160
something actually happens
or you die—before telling me?

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Uncle.

94
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Uncle.

95
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Uncle.

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Uncle.

97
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Jeff.

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
Why are you just standing there?
Go after Alan!

99
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,200
Did I die or something?

100
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
Yup, you did.

101
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
And a handsome angel...

102
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,680
has come to escort Babe to heaven.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Ow...

104
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,560
Was that supposed to be funny?

105
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,200
Well, I thought you were making a joke.

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,880
Are you in a lot of pain?

107
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
It hurts, but I can handle it.

108
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,160
And I'm totally ready to leave the hospital
and punch whoever hit me.

109
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,760
So, did they find out
who the driver was yet?

110
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,960
You just woke up and already acting tough.

111
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,880
I think you should just rest for now.

112
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,400
What about the others?

113
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
They all came to see you already.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,400
But you weren’t awake yet.

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,840
So I told them to go home for now.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Can you tell Alan I’m sorry
I missed practice?

117
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
Alan wouldn’t blame you for that.

118
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,160
As for the CCTV footage...

119
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Alan already spoke to the police.

120
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
But they didn’t see anything.

121
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,160
So they still haven’t caught the culprit.

122
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,600
But don’t worry.

123
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,360
Whoever it is, I’ll take care of them myself.

124
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Oh wow.

125
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,000
Little puppy turned into
a full-on Rottweiler now, huh?

126
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,040
Ouch.

127
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
If it hurts, then rest, okay?

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,400
So you can heal faster, alright?

129
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
That’s not enough.

130
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
I want a magic kiss.

131
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Get some rest.

132
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,080
Oops—wrench dropped.

133
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Hey, kid.

134
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
You okay?

135
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,040
Hold on, Uncle.

136
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
Can’t we just talk first?

137
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,080
When we should’ve talked, we didn’t.

138
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,600
So what’s the point now?

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,840
Come on, Uncle… I know you overthink stuff.

140
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
That’s why I didn’t wanna be a burden to you.

141
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,520
The word “burden”...

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
Shouldn’t even exist in a relationship.

143
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,560
Love is about two people walking together.

144
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
But what you did...

145
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
It’s like you just pushed me out of your life.

146
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Uncle...

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Think it over properly.

148
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
What does being someone’s boyfriend...

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,640
really mean to you?

150
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,360
Something serious going on?

151
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Hey.

152
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,680
What do you do when Babe’s mad at you?

153
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Alan’s still not talking to you?

154
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,000
This time he’s not just ignoring me.

155
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
He won’t even look me in the face.

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,680
I’ve never seen him this mad before.

157
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,800
Can you blame him?

158
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,080
If Babe kept something that big from me...

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,640
I’d feel the same way.

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,200
Enough whining already.

161
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,080
Just tell me what you usually
do to make up with Babe.

162
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,040
Me and Babe aren’t
the type to hide how we feel.

163
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,560
When we make up...

164
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
We don’t really talk about it.

165
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,520
We just have sex.

166
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,200
But I’m not sure
that’ll work with you and Alan.

167
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,280
Right now, anything that works with him—

168
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
I’m willing to try it all.

169
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Before you go beg for forgiveness...

170
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
You better get that checkup done first.

171
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,160
Go on, then.

172
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
It’s an evolution of Jeff’s power.

173
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
But the scary part is...

174
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,600
We have no idea where it’ll end up.

175
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,280
Meaning, if the person Jeff
sees in his sense gets hurt...

176
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,080
Jeff would feel the pain too.

177
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,360
And what if that person dies?

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,680
Then Jeff might...

179
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,160
I don’t want to die.

180
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,600
We can’t ever let that happen.

181
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,440
From what I can see...

182
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,960
It’s still in the expansion phase.

183
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,800
And like I said—

184
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,440
What’s scary is we don’t know where it ends.

185
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,360
And we have no idea what it’ll do to his body.

186
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,800
So our only option is the skill eraser.

187
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,280
I think we need to speed things up.

188
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,960
For Jeff’s safety.

189
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Sir.

190
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,400
Babe is in the hospital right now.

191
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,560
If Mr. Manit’s men messed up the job...

192
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
Should I take care of it?

193
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,960
No, they did the job.

194
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,680
Mission accomplished, sir.

195
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
I just kinda missed him.

196
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,280
I didn’t plan to kill him.

197
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,760
If I wanted him dead...

198
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,680
One move... and he’s gone.

199
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,160
But the best kind of revenge...

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Is watching them suffer.

201
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,280
Not dead...

202
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,400
But might as well be.

203
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,800
I’ve ordered all the evidence to be cleared, sir.

204
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,200
They won’t be able to trace anything back to us.

205
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,960
What would you like me to do next, sir?

206
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,000
Nothing.

207
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,440
I’d rather see him squirm.

208
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,520
You’re not leaving yet.

209
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
I need a word with you.

210
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
You mean… me?

211
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
What did the boss talk to you about?

212
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
Mr. Tony told me to shadow you.

213
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,760
I’m gonna take Kenta’s place
as his right hand.

214
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,360
Working for Tony
isn’t exactly a walk in the park.

215
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,320
That’s true.

216
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,520
You might be an asshole...

217
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,120
But you’re not quite asshole enough.

218
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,320
Keep trying, alright?

219
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,880
Stick with me long enough...

220
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,880
You’ll get there.

221
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Got it.

222
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,000
You’re back, Papa?

223
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,079
Papa’s home.

224
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
What the hell?

225
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,280
Who told you to come in here?

226
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,760
Well, I’m already here.

227
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,240
No harm done, right?

228
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
Brought you flowers.

229
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,119
I’ll just leave them here.

230
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,920
Then get out.

231
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,400
Your boyfriend’s not around?

232
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,160
You’re this badly hurt and he’s not even here?

233
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,240
What a waste.

234
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,800
Will it kill you to mind
your own damn business for once?

235
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
With that attitude...

236
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,160
Did your boyfriend ban you
from being with others?

237
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,200
My boyfriend didn’t say anything.

238
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
I just don’t wanna be with you.

239
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,000
So that means...

240
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,200
Your boyfriend hasn’t seen our pic
at the bar that night, huh?

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,080
Came out great, by the way.

242
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,600
Looks like we were on a date.

243
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,800
What pic? I never took any with you.

244
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
This one.

245
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,760
Tons of likes on it too.

246
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
And I even tagged you.

247
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
You sure your boyfriend won’t see it?

248
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,200
Can you stop messing around?

249
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,960
If he saw it, he’d say I was already asleep.

250
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Now get out.

251
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,480
You’re annoying.

252
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,080
How can I leave...

253
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,280
When I’m trying to flirt with you?

254
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,680
Listen up.

255
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,480
-Me and Charlie are never breaking up.
-Never breaking up.

256
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,840
I know what you're gonna say.

257
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,520
But your boyfriend's not here right now, is he?

258
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,320
Let me take care of you for now,
just as a stand-in.

259
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
Get lost already.

260
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,600
Why are you in such
a rush to kick me out, Babe?

261
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,440
What are you doing?

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Charlie.

263
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,840
I’m here as a rep from ETA to visit Babe.

264
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,560
Same industry
we gotta support each other, right?

265
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,560
Hope you don’t mind.

266
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
Looks like you’ve got
someone to look after you now.

267
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
As promised.

268
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,560
I’ll head out now.

269
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
Yeah, just get lost already.
You’re annoying.

270
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Bye then.

271
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,520
I shouldn’t have left your side.

272
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,880
I could’ve helped you sooner.

273
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,560
It’s okay.

274
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,760
I know you had things to take care of.

275
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,360
But I’m not going anywhere.
I’m not leaving you.

276
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Charlie.

277
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,280
I know you’d never leave me.

278
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,920
I’m more afraid you’ll leave me.

279
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
What are you even saying?

280
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,440
Why would I ever leave you?

281
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
What if someone better comes along?
Smarter than me...

282
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,520
Has more time for you...

283
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,680
Like that Willy guy who’s been all over you.

284
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
That night you went to the bar...

285
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,640
You saw Willy, didn’t you?

286
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
Why didn’t you tell me...

287
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,920
That he’s still trying
to hit on you off the field?

288
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,120
So what if he is?

289
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,040
I didn’t flirt back or anything.

290
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Besides, I beat him that night.

291
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,480
Is there anything else I don’t know?

292
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
Am I being annoying?

293
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I’m really not feeling confident right now.

294
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,280
Charlie.

295
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Okay.

296
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I get annoyed by people easily.

297
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
But I mean it, alright?

298
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,680
You’re the only one I’ve ever had eyes for.

299
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Got it?

300
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,200
But...

301
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,040
But I just don’t care about him.

302
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,000
If I don’t care,
then there’s nothing he can do, right?

303
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,840
Charlie.

304
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
Willy...

305
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,640
He’s got nothing on you.

306
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
You know that?

307
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,600
Hey, come on.

308
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,920
What’s with you?

309
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,120
I love you, Papa.

310
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Come here.

311
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,280
Don’t overthink it.

312
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,040
Alright?

313
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Kenta.

314
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,960
You probably heard we’re outta prison, right?

315
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,560
So who are you working for now?

316
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,400
I’m not working for anyone.

317
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,720
That’s why I ran here.

318
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,720
You’re running away?

319
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,800
I don’t wanna be involved in this stuff anymore.

320
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,560
But the reason I’m here...

321
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,080
Is ‘cause I figured the ones in real danger...

322
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,320
Are you guys.

323
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,960
What’s that supposed to mean?

324
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,880
You might not believe what I’m about to say.

325
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,880
But the scariest one of them all...

326
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,080
He’s back.

327
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
No breathing.

328
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,040
What’s the pulse?

329
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,600
Did you check?

330
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,160
Go check now.

331
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,040
Sample c153 has failed.

332
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,600
Bring in c154.

333
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Yes, sir.

334
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,960
Have CEF put out an urgent recruitment call.

335
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Yes, sir.

336
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,920
Pete, is something wrong?
Why did you call us here?

337
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,680
It’s something really important.

338
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,160
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have asked Babe
to come here right after leaving the hospital.

339
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Kenta?

340
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,360
How did you get out?

341
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,000
What do you think you’re doing?

342
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,480
If it wasn’t serious,

343
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
I wouldn’t be getting
involved with you guys again.

344
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,960
But all of you need to know this.

345
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,400
Tony is back.

346
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,360
At first, I didn’t believe it either.

347
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,400
Because I was the one
who killed him with my own hands.

348
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,920
But after I got out of prison...

349
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,160
Someone took me to see Tony.

350
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,920
He looked like he was
recovering from serious injuries.

351
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,840
Are you sure...

352
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,640
That this whole thing isn’t some made-up story?

353
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,360
Kenta’s not lying.

354
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,200
Because right now,
he’s just as much at risk as the rest of us.

355
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,480
Or does Tony...

356
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,120
have some kind of power
that helped him survive?

357
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,800
I’ve never heard of any
special ability like that before.

358
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,440
But we all came from the Chen family.

359
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,520
None of us knew everything, right?

360
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,760
Did anyone know if Tony had powers?

361
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,560
Even if he comes back a hundred times...

362
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,600
I’m not afraid of him.

363
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,920
I just came to warn you all to be careful.

364
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,880
Because if I’m right...

365
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,960
The reason you’re like this now...

366
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,600
It’s probably because of Tony.

367
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,600
Are you worried about Tony coming back?

368
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Not really.

369
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,400
Are you scared of him?

370
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,120
I’m not scared of Tony.

371
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,720
I’m just scared we won’t get to stay together.

372
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,080
We don’t know what Tony’s planning next.

373
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,960
What if he comes back
and takes you away again?

374
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,840
But I don’t have sense anymore, Charlie.

375
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,880
Why would he want to take me?

376
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,280
And besides...

377
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,280
Someone like Tony...

378
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,640
All he wants is revenge.

379
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,040
And me?

380
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,160
I’m not letting him touch either of us.

381
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,520
We’re both gonna be safe, no matter what.

382
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,560
That line...

383
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,680
Shouldn’t Papa be the one saying it?

384
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,400
Well, Mama’s still injured, you know.

385
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,720
Oh please.

386
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,840
It’s just a scratch.

387
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Papa’s been taking care of you so well...

388
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,040
Doesn’t he deserve a reward?

389
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,920
What kind of reward, Mama?

390
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,280
I just got out of the hospital, you know.

391
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,480
You want it already?

392
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,800
What kind of reward are you thinking about?

393
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
Well...

394
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,120
Exactly the kind
you’re thinking about right now.

395
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Go ahead.

396
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Jeff.

397
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,840
You’re still not making up with Uncle?

398
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,720
I’m trying, I really am.

399
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Trying?

400
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,280
Trying what, exactly?

401
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,560
I haven’t seen you do anything.

402
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,120
I just don’t know how to start.

403
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,480
But I did ask Charlie for advice.

404
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,760
And what did Charlie say?

405
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,760
He said I should use—

406
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Use what?

407
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
Never mind.

408
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,880
Are we gonna have
an actual conversation today?

409
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,760
Alright, how about this?

410
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,560
If you’ve run out of excuses,
just use work as one.

411
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,440
Here—take the charger.

412
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,160
Trust me.

413
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,680
Take the water too—give it to Alan.

414
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,000
Trust me. Go, now.

415
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Uncle.

416
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
Are you still mad at me?

417
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Yeah.

418
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,160
But I can still separate work
from personal stuff.

419
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
Why?

420
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,920
You still hiding something from me?

421
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
I’m not hiding anything from you.

422
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,000
What about Tony being alive?

423
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,640
You didn’t know about that in advance?

424
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,080
I really didn’t know about that.

425
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,680
Come on, Uncle.
Don’t lump me in like that.

426
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,280
Can’t help it.

427
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,760
I just don’t know
what I can believe from you anymore.

428
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,320
Telling us this info...

429
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,960
You might be putting yourself in danger too.

430
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,520
Let’s just say...

431
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,400
I’m doing this to make up
for what I did to you guys.

432
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,680
So where are you gonna go now?

433
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
I don’t know.

434
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
But don’t worry about me.

435
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,880
I’m not going down that easy.

436
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,080
But I’m worried you’re the one who’s not safe.

437
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,800
Let me help you.

438
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
Help how?

439
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,800
If I stay here with you guys,

440
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,880
Tony’s just gonna target you too.

441
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
But I might have another way to help.

442
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,000
Hey, Alan.

443
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
Hey, Uncle.

444
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,560
How did it go with the police?

445
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,800
Any leads on who hit Babe?

446
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,400
Nothing yet.

447
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,000
All the CCTV footage got wiped clean.

448
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,920
The cops aren’t doing anything useful.

449
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,080
Tony, that bastard...

450
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,880
He just woke up and already—

451
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,920
He’s got connections with the police?

452
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,920
The fact he could hide
his “death” and all that for years...

453
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
Which means...

454
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,600
His connections are still just as strong.

455
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,520
And the fact he hasn’t shown his face...

456
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,600
Might just mean he’s waiting for the right time.

457
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
But I’ll tell you this—

458
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,920
Someone like Tony...

459
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,880
He wouldn’t run Babe over himself, right?

460
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Uncle.

461
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
I think we need to figure out...

462
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,200
Who he ordered to do it.

463
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,400
Exactly, Uncle.

464
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,160
Why don’t you ask Jeff?

465
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,960
He’s seeing the future again now, right?

466
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Tell him to focus, maybe he can—

467
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,080
Get a glimpse of the culprit’s face.

468
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,520
Even just a silhouette would help.

469
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,760
I couldn’t see the face.

470
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
But...

471
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,680
I remember seeing...

472
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,600
The driver was using only one hand.

473
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
What?

474
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,680
Damn, that’s bold.

475
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,840
He hit that hard—driving one-handed?

476
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,640
Are you okay?

477
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I’m fine.

478
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,560
Just a little drained.

479
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,360
Hey, Uncle.

480
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,200
What’s the plan for the next race?

481
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,360
It’s just me and Charlie.

482
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,560
I don’t think we can pull it off.

483
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
You’ll have to. No choice.

484
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Charlie.

485
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,760
You need to clock your best time in the next race.

486
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
We don’t know when Babe can come back.

487
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Got it.

488
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Actually...

489
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,920
I’ll race in the next one.

490
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,080
Babe, wait up!

491
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,040
Why would you race?

492
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,560
You just got out of the hospital.

493
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,480
There’s something I need to prove, Charlie.

494
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
Prove what, exactly?

495
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,120
I have a feeling Willy...

496
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,480
might be the one who hit me.

497
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,720
I’m not totally sure yet.

498
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,840
But from what Jeff told us...

499
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,320
Something about it reminded me of Willy.

500
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,440
So I wanna see for myself—on the track.

501
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,240
But that’s way too risky.

502
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,640
If you want something proven, just tell me.

503
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,080
I’ll do it for you.

504
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
No, I can’t let you.

505
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,840
Aren’t you supposed
to test the ability-nullifying drug?

506
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,520
That’s important too, isn’t it?

507
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Charlie.

508
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,480
I can’t just let you deal
with everything on your own.

509
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,600
Okay.

510
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,560
You sure you’re fit enough to race?

511
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,400
I don’t want you pushing yourself.

512
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,960
I can handle it.

513
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,280
I’m Pit Babe, remember?

514
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,120
Did you forget?

515
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,320
Then make sure you get plenty of rest, okay?

516
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,600
You treat me like I’m your kid or something.

517
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,400
No, I treat you like my boyfriend.

518
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,800
Boyfriend, huh?

519
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,680
Someone might see us.

520
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
No one’s around.

521
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
Why should I help you guys?

522
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,640
I’m in the middle
of transferring back to Korea.

523
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,600
That’s exactly why.

524
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,480
You’re no longer part of X-Hunter...

525
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,400
And you’re about to leave the country.

526
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,520
So you’re the least likely to be targeted.

527
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,560
Still, it’s risky for me too.

528
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,280
We’re not asking you to keep Kenta forever.

529
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,280
Just give him a place to hide...

530
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
Until the timing’s right.

531
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,400
Once I figure out a safe escape route...

532
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,280
I’ll come get him myself.

533
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,960
You’re the only one...

534
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,280
I trust to help Kenta right now.

535
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,880
How’s Charlie doing?

536
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,800
Nothing’s changed.

537
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,160
Everything still looks exactly the same.

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,400
You haven’t gone home yet?

539
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,720
What about you?

540
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,400
Don’t you have a home to go back to by now?

541
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,000
I figured someone like you, a total workaholic,

542
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,040
probably hasn’t eaten yet either.

543
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Here—sushi.

544
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,480
Can you eat this?

545
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,880
I’m not picky, you know.

546
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,200
If it doesn’t kill me, I’ll eat it.

547
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,880
So you’ve lived in the States your whole life?

548
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,760
Just like I told you—

549
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,320
I only came back here

550
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,560
because of the ability-nullifying drug.

551
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,360
Actually, I’ve had to...

552
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,400
run off to another country too, once.

553
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,160
In the end, I had to come back.

554
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,800
Because of Daddy.

555
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Daddy?

556
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,480
Yeah, Daddy Tony.

557
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,800
He’s like a godfather to all the Chen family kids.

558
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Honestly...

559
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,840
I think I’ve seen some news about him before.

560
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,160
But didn’t he already die?

561
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Most people probably think that, yeah.

562
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,120
By the way, you’ve worked with
a lot of people with special senses, right?

563
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,800
Have you ever met anyone...

564
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,000
with a sense that makes them immortal?

565
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,400
Pete, come on...

566
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,680
Even the most powerful Alpha...

567
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,600
can’t escape death.

568
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,040
Or wait—Pete,

569
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,360
have you actually met
an Alpha with a power like that?

570
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,000
No, not at all.

571
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,720
I just asked
because I was curious, that’s all.

572
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,600
What the hell are you doing, North?

573
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,400
I’m praying, obviously.

574
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,000
At this point, we need
some divine help, don’t you think?

575
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,360
Didn’t you say you were fully prepared?

576
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,920
Training is one thing...

577
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,400
but keeping your cool during
the actual race is another.

578
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,160
Sonic, this is my debut race
as a full team racer, you know?

579
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,880
Then take this with you.

580
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
What’s this?

581
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Some kind of charm?

582
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,280
If calling it that helps you
feel better, then sure.

583
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,880
You’ve got this.

584
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
I believe in you.

585
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,200
Alright then.

586
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
There you go.

587
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,400
Thanks, man.

588
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,840
How are you feeling, Babe?

589
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,680
I’m better now.

590
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,600
No need for anyone else to butt in.

591
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,760
I’m already taking care of Babe.

592
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,200
You just focus on your race prep.

593
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,080
My racer needs to focus.

594
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,040
Maybe you don’t realize it,
but what you’re doing...

595
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
feels like you’re playing dirty.

596
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,200
No need to be so negative.

597
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,640
I’m just concerned for him
as a fellow racer.

598
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
Charlie.

599
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,920
See you on the track.

600
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,720
Time to gear up.

601
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,840
We’re back with
The Hollow Super TG Speed Thunder!

602
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,080
This is Race 2, folks!

603
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
And now just 1 minute left...

604
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,840
It’s Willy from team ETA in the lead,

605
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,840
followed closely by Babe from X-Hunter,

606
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,080
as they approach zone A!

607
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,960
And they’re off!

608
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,960
Still neck and neck—Babe and Willy.

609
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,040
As expected, no changes in position just yet.

610
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,800
Looks like it’s going to be a long battle.

611
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,120
This is definitely not an easy one.

612
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,600
Willy’s in the lead!

613
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,760
It’s fine—it’s just the start.

614
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,280
Now we move into Zone B...

615
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,080
...the container zone!

616
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,080
Drivers need extra caution here...

617
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
and lots of experience.

618
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,640
Willy from ETA still leads the pack.

619
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,560
Babe and Charlie are right behind.

620
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,240
Willy’s holding strong—smooth cornering!

621
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,360
Babe’s closing in hard now!

622
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,560
But Willy’s still defending well.

623
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,920
Charlie keeps pressure from behind.

624
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,760
North, the new racer from X-Hunter...

625
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,040
...is doing great for his first race!

626
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,680
Go, North! You got this!

627
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,800
Willy’s still defending the lead well.

628
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,920
Babe’s looking for a way around...

629
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,680
But Willy’s still blocking tight.

630
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,600
Back to Zone A now!

631
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,920
Pit Babe’s speeding up again!

632
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,320
And it looks like North
is pushing into 4th place!

633
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,280
Yes! He made it—he’s in 2nd now!

634
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,400
Back in Zone B
Charlie’s accelerating hard!

635
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,200
He just passed Babe!

636
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
But Willy’s not letting anyone through just yet.

637
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,240
Babe pushes back and overtakes again!

638
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,160
Current standings
Willy, Babe, Charlie, then North.

639
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,280
Babe’s trying to find a way around Willy—

640
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,360
—but it’s not the right moment yet.

641
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,400
And now Charlie overtakes Pit Babe!

642
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,680
He cuts in front and is now tailing Willy!

643
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
Right on him! Right on his tail!

644
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,160
Willy from ETA is still defending like a pro.

645
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Charlie’s not backing down though!

646
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,600
He’s closing the gap!

647
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,720
Now it’s a straightaway!

648
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,000
Looks like Charlie’s about to overtake!

649
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,880
Come on, Charlie—keep pushing!

650
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
Closer! Closer!

651
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,360
Charlie’s right on Willy’s tail now!

652
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,360
But his car’s starting to wobble...

653
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,320
Hey, Charlie’s car spun out!

654
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,560
Charlie, man!

655
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,320
-Uncle!
-Whoa, hang on!

656
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,760
Babe, focus! Stay calm!

657
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,120
Charlie’s car should be okay.

658
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,560
North, it’s just you and Babe now.

659
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,000
-You gotta cover for Charlie.
-Alright, let’s go!

660
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,400
It’s up to North to catch up now.

661
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,080
Babe just overtook Willy!

662
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,400
They’re neck and neck now!

663
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,320
And now they’re on the final straight!

664
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,720
Babe’s picking up speed!

665
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,040
It’s super close right now!

666
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,160
And Babe crosses the finish line!

667
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,200
Babe’s first! Then Willy and North!

668
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,080
Dean, go get the rescue car for Charlie!

669
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,680
Got it! Sonic, stay here, okay?

670
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Charlie!

671
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,120
Come out first!

672
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,120
Charlie!

673
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,440
Charlie!

674
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
You okay?

675
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You alright?

676
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,440
Is Charlie okay?

677
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,000
Sense...

678
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,400
I think I lost my sense...

679
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,920
So when’s Charlie waking up?
He’s been out like 4–5 hours now.

680
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
To you guys, is he just some lab rat?

681
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,360
It’s the same compound
we used for the skill-nullifying drug.

682
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,120
Tony didn’t make a skill-nullifier.

683
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,800
He’s actually making something to boost skills.

684
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,440
You're sweating like crazy...

685
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,160
But you still smell nice, bro.

686
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,280
I’m starting to wonder...

687
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,440
What’s going on in your head

688
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,920
While having dinner with
someone who looks just like your ex.

689
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,640
Happy Birthday, Mama!

690
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,880
Make a wish, quick!

691
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,720
So smoky in here.

692
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,000
(Grilled fish 100 baht each)
Super grilled.

693
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,040
Maybe 199 baht for that tilapia or whatever?

694
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,080
Can I kiss your cheek?

695
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,760
How about a nose kiss? Super cute.

696
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,000
Once I get the kiss, I’ll ask for more!

697
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,440
(Sneaky moment)
Then I’m like—wait, who even is this?

698
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,920
It’s a big deal and you didn’t think to tell me?

699
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,280
Tell me for what? What could I even do?

700
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,240
(That hits deep...)
I’m fine now, okay?

701
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,640
You gonna wait till I’m actually
dying before saying something?

702
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,520
Whip that bob and walk away—yeah, just go.
