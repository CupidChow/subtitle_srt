1
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,960
Then why are you making spaghetti?

2
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,039
I vaguely remember I used to make it.

3
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,560
- Mama
- So you remember now?

4
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,920
You know someone
like Tony never helps for free.

5
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,600
I’m ending this myself.

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,280
The project I tested
successfully created a special Alpha 100%.

7
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,880
Today, I’m calling off the deal.

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
Tony has a special skill no one’s ever known.

9
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
He can bring himself back to life.

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,479
Just you and Charlie come with me—

11
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,000
everyone will survive.

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,479
Thanks, Babe.

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,200
Babe—let go.

14
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,840
This time I mixed in a new compound.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
I think it should work.

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
It’s not gonna have any side effects, right?

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,800
About that,
I think it depends on Charlie’s body.

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,880
Yeah.

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
- Hello
- Pete?

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Charlie’s been taken.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
What?

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
Charlie?

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,960
- Where?
- Right in front of the building.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Okay.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,160
Okay, Jeff.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,200
Tell everyone to meet us there.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,079
I’m coming too.

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,079
But it’s dangerous, you know.

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,840
Don’t forget why I came here.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Mm, okay.

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,400
Welcome home, son.

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,680
I’ve missed you—hm.

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
Let Alan, Dean, and Kenta go.

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,880
Then me and Charlie will stay here.

35
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,240
You don’t need to worry about that.

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,680
Daddy’s taken care of everything.

37
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,079
Bring me Alan and Kenta.

38
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,480
As for Dean—

39
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,640
Daddy will deliver him personally.

40
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,960
Babe.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Charlie.

42
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,640
What are you guys doing here?

43
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,320
We came to get everyone out of here.

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,040
Babe—don’t believe him.

45
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,320
He’s gonna kill all of us anyway.

46
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,640
Alan.

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,480
I’m talking to my son.

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Don’t be rude.

49
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
So, Babe—

50
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,040
you came all this way.

51
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,200
I hope your answer

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
won’t disappoint Daddy.

53
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,760
Fine.

54
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
I’ll stay here.

55
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,160
But Charlie’s deal—

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
you only get his blood.

57
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,840
Then you let him go.

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
Babe...

59
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Sure.
Daddy promises.

60
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Daddy’s gonna make
the best use of Charlie’s blood.

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,600
Can you just stay still?

62
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,560
TICK KA TICK KA TICK KA TOCK

63
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,440
Sorry, Babe.

64
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,560
Just seeing this piece of trash’s face—

65
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Let me skip a few steps.

66
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,480
Take him down.

67
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Hey—

68
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
Babe.

69
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,160
Alan, help Dean!

70
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
Charlie, go!

71
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,320
Tony, go right in.

72
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Charlie, wait here.

73
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey—do it!

74
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,880
Come on, go!

75
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Hey!

76
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
Hey!

77
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
We should still be on time.

78
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,160
Let’s split up and search.

79
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,080
- Sound good?
- Good.

80
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Sonic, go!

81
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,960
Then I’ll go look for Uncle first.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,640
I’ll go find Babe then.

83
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
Be careful, okay?

84
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
Let’s go.

85
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
Dean—Dean!

86
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
Dean! Dean!

87
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Dean!

88
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
Dean...

89
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
Charlie.

90
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
Uncle! Uncle!

91
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,000
Uncle—hey!

92
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
- Jeff?
- You...

93
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,480
- Hey!
- Uncle!

94
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,360
Uncle...

95
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,200
Uncle...

96
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,280
Are you okay, Uncle?

97
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Uncle...

98
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
Kid...

99
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
I’ve missed you so much.

100
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,000
I’ve missed you too.

101
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
Uncle...

102
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,080
I’m getting you out of here.

103
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
Hang in there for now.

104
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,640
Quick!

105
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,920
What just happened?

106
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,360
Kim.

107
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,280
Hey, are you okay?

108
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,520
You can’t pull that again, okay? It’s too risky.

109
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,920
Told you—I can handle it on my own.

110
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,480
No, you better not throw
yourself in danger again.

111
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,960
You hear me?

112
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
I told you already—

113
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,960
I’m not leaving you behind.

114
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
Charlie.

115
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,080
That’s enough.

116
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
You’re not getting out of this today.

117
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,960
Put the gun down.

118
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,440
If you don’t want me to kill Charlie—

119
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
If you and I teamed up,

120
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,280
imagine how powerful we could be.

121
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,840
Babe...

122
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,680
Did you forget already?

123
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
How much I used to love you?

124
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
That was before
I saw how evil you really are.

125
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,920
You saw it yourself—

126
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,000
my drugs helped so many people.

127
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,120
Look at Alan and Kenta.

128
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Would they have survived
this long without them?

129
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,440
Put the gun down.

130
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
Drop it.

131
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
That’s enough, Tony.

132
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,960
It all ends today—one way or another.

133
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,600
This plan’s too risky, Charlie.

134
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,680
Plus, we don’t even know if Willy’s on board.

135
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,560
We’ll have to find another way.

136
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
If you really want to stop Tony—

137
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,360
you have to let me
get as close to him as possible.

138
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,400
What are you doing, Charlie—let go!

139
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I said let go!

140
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
Let go!

141
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
Way.

142
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,640
I’m not Way.

143
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,920
Oh...

144
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,680
So you’re that useless son.

145
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,800
Then you should be sorry

146
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,880
you didn’t kill me when you had the chance.

147
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,240
Don’t.

148
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,680
Charlie.

149
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
Charlie...

150
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
Charlie...

151
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
Charlie—don’t go yet.

152
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,000
Charlie, stay with me.

153
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,240
Charlie...

154
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,560
Charlie...

155
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
Charlie...

156
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
Charlie...

157
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,880
Charlie...

158
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,960
No...

159
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,640
No...

160
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,240
Charlie...

161
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,480
Charlie...

162
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,480
Charlie...

163
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
Charlie...

164
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,080
Charlie...

165
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,840
Hey—Winner, right?

166
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,880
- Shit—
- Winner!

167
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,160
Do you know where Dean is?

168
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,480
Come on—spit it out!

169
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,680
If I tell you, will you let me go?

170
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
I say we just beat him up.

171
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,400
Hey, hey—there!

172
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,880
He’s under the engine room.

173
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,360
But he’s bedridden.

174
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,360
Just carry him back nicely, alright?

175
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,360
Can we really trust him?

176
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,160
So what now?

177
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,280
I...

178
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,880
I’ll be on my way then.

179
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,120
Hey—

180
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,640
Wait—

181
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
You’re really letting him go?

182
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,920
Just let it go—let’s hurry and help Dean.

183
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,040
Thanks, bro.

184
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,840
What’s up with him?
Looks pale like boiled chicken.

185
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,200
Let’s go.

186
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,200
Whoa—Uncle!

187
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Babe!

188
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,000
Hey, North.

189
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Charlie’s gonna wake up soon.

190
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
Take care of yourself too.

191
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
Got it, bro.

192
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,600
Yo—Dean!

193
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,120
You’re outta the hospital already?

194
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
- Whoa.
- Babe!

195
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,400
Charlie!

196
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,440
You remember me?

197
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,760
Who am I?

198
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
Huh?

199
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,040
North, what the hell kind of joke is that?

200
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,680
What kind of question is that?

201
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Dean’s not amnesiac like Charlie, you know.

202
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Whoa—

203
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,920
Well, he was out cold for so long.

204
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,440
I thought it might’ve
messed with his brain too.

205
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
Dean...

206
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,080
I’m sorry, man.

207
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,920
For not trusting you.

208
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,840
It’s all good.

209
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,840
And I really appreciate you, Dean.

210
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
Glad to help, Uncle.

211
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,240
As long as everyone’s safe,
that’s enough for me.

212
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,240
Once I’ve fully recovered,

213
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,640
I’m challenging you all to a rematch!

214
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,840
If it’s me you face, you’re already losing.

215
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
Dean, you might beat Babe—

216
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,520
but not me, man.

217
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,040
I’m flying back to Korea today.

218
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,480
What?

219
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,480
So I came to say goodbye to everyone.

220
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Thank you so much, all of you.

221
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,440
I had so much fun, seriously.

222
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
Good luck, bro.

223
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,000
Gonna miss you.

224
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,360
You better come back to us, alright?

225
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,840
- Of course, Uncle.
- I’ll visit you in Korea.

226
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,240
- With what money?
- Yours, duh.

227
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
You little—

228
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,120
Ha...

229
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,680
Where are you going?

230
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,640
The job’s done.

231
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,520
Once it’s done, I go back.

232
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
Back to where?

233
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,600
Aren’t we moving in together?

234
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,000
I already booked
an architect to plan the house.

235
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,720
I wanted you to help pick everything out.

236
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
Keep your house for yourself.

237
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,640
Wait, Chris—

238
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,600
If you didn’t wanna live with me,

239
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
why didn’t you just say so?

240
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,720
I like you.

241
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,240
And right now, I really like you too.

242
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,520
Even if I don’t have some special sense
or power to read minds—

243
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,120
I can still tell you
haven’t moved on from Way.

244
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,720
So, what do you think of this place?

245
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,400
It’s nice.

246
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,920
But it’s not really my style—I’m not into it.

247
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,040
Then I’ll have the architect
redesign the whole thing.

248
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,280
Just tell him what you like.

249
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,680
I don’t wanna be anyone’s replacement.

250
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,360
And I’ve thought this through.

251
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,480
The best thing for both of us—

252
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
is to go our separate ways.

253
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
I’ll admit it—

254
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
when I look at you...

255
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,880
I can’t help but think of Way.

256
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,040
But if you gave me time—a real chance—

257
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,000
maybe I could forget everything from the past.

258
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,760
But right now isn’t that time.

259
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,480
I don’t wanna hurt you by
making you choose the wrong person.

260
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
So when you’re sure someday—

261
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,480
that I’m the one you truly love—

262
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
we can talk again that day.

263
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,840
The wound’s healed now.

264
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,960
- Ow.
- Does it hurt?

265
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
10% pain—

266
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,360
90% just playing it cute.

267
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,640
Hurt, huh?

268
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,480
Don’t you have healing powers now?

269
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,560
A little wound like this’ll heal in no time.

270
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,800
Hold on.

271
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,280
Ever since it all happened—

272
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,560
we haven’t really talked it through properly.

273
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,440
I was really mad at you, Uncle.

274
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
You’re the one who told me—

275
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,600
that when two people love each other,
there’s no hiding things.

276
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,400
They have to trust each other completely.

277
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,600
But you broke every rule you made yourself.

278
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,320
I’m sorry.

279
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
I really went too far.

280
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,560
I just thought...

281
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,800
I thought having
powers would help everyone.

282
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,960
I just wanted to protect you.

283
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,040
To protect all of you.

284
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,480
But putting yourself
at risk like that isn’t right.

285
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,080
Didn’t you think about how I’d feel?

286
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
I understand.

287
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,800
That’s why I let you be mad at me.

288
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,280
But don’t be too mad, okay?

289
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,480
I’d be even madder if you hadn’t come back.

290
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,680
If you were gone, how would I go on?

291
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,480
You’re the one who dug me out
and gave me a place in this world.

292
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,960
Besides Charlie—

293
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,880
you’re my whole world.

294
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,000
I love you, kid.

295
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,400
Look at you—getting all emotional now.

296
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,200
So… are you really
going to get the skill-erasing shot?

297
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
Should I?

298
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,720
That shot might help other special Alphas.

299
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,080
But for you—

300
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,080
you should keep your powers.

301
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,560
I just don’t want your body to get worse.

302
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
But...

303
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Will Charlie think I’m selfish?

304
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,280
Will everyone think I only care about myself?

305
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,640
If anyone’s selfish—

306
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,480
it’s probably me.

307
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Because I just want you to be healthy

308
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,880
and stay with me forever.

309
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,320
Whether power is good or bad—

310
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,600
depends on how it’s used.

311
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,880
You didn’t use yours to hurt anyone.

312
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,880
You used it to keep yourself alive.

313
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,640
You have my permission.

314
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,280
Kim.

315
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,160
Thank you—

316
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,040
for always being there for me.

317
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,880
I was glad to.

318
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,520
So...

319
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,240
what about after this?

320
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,960
What are you gonna do next?

321
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,800
Honestly, I’m not sure myself.

322
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,960
Maybe I’ll finally
try living for me, for once.

323
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,720
Well then...

324
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,720
Hope you find something you love.

325
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,240
And...

326
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,880
if I want to reach out sometimes—

327
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
that’s okay, right?

328
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,400
You can always reach out to me.

329
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,920
Just...

330
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,400
have the guts to actually call.

331
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,040
See you, Babe.

332
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Yeah—take care, man.

333
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
Later, Jeff.

334
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,680
Good luck, bro.

335
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Whoa—look at that suitcase!

336
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,440
Let’s go.

337
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,160
I’ll finish school quick
and come right back, Uncle.

338
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,640
Yeah, take care of yourself, alright?

339
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,120
And graduate fast.

340
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,000
And don’t worry about anything over here.

341
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,720
I’ll handle things here.

342
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,760
Go all in on him, Uncle—

343
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
if he slacks off in training.

344
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,440
- Yeah.
- North, you punk.

345
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
- I’m off, Uncle.
- Alright.

346
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,560
Safe travels, man.

347
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,000
Sonic—

348
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,400
you trying to kill me or what?

349
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,520
You leaving—

350
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,280
it’s like I’m already dead, man.

351
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Next time I’m back—
drop the cringe lines, okay?

352
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,120
Take care of yourself, bro.

353
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,880
I’ll be back soon.

354
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,240
"Je suis fou amoureux de toi."

355
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,000
What was that, North?

356
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,160
You butchered the French!

357
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,800
What’s it mean?

358
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,360
It means “I’m crazy in love with you.”

359
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,840
Oh my god—so cheesy.

360
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,800
I meant every word.

361
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,760
Just marry him already.

362
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,960
Don’t go back, Sonic.

363
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,199
While Charlie’s asleep—

364
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,400
if you get lonely, Babe,

365
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,440
you can always come see me.

366
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,480
Kidding.

367
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,160
I just wanted to cheer you up—

368
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,520
and thank you for setting me free.

369
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,080
Thanks, man.

370
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,280
For saving me that day.

371
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,240
From now on—live your life well, okay?

372
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,800
You better get back on the track soon.

373
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,320
Your fans miss you like crazy.

374
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,200
Charlie’s been asleep a long time now.

375
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,080
Prepare yourself.

376
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,960
Racing’s my dream—

377
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,480
but Charlie is my life.

378
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,000
No matter how long it takes, I’ll wait.

379
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,480
Papa—wake up and see Mama soon.

380
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,000
(One year later)

381
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,280
Hey, do you guys take interns?

382
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
Babe?

383
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,200
What do you mean Babe? That’s my name.

384
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,080
Wow...

385
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,000
What, are you two
the only Babes in the world?

386
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,880
Come on, Babe—it’s not that deep.

387
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,160
Dean, you look way better now.

388
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
And stronger too.

389
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,160
Thanks, man.

390
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,040
Been training hard—new season’s coming up.

391
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,760
X-Hunter is definitely
taking the championship.

392
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,720
Is it just you guys here?

393
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,640
What about Uncle, Jeff—and Charlie?

394
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,960
No clue about Uncle.
Charlie’s over there.

395
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,720
Charlie...

396
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,800
Yeah, Babe?

397
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,920
You remember me now?

398
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,320
Of course I do.

399
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,240
You’re Sonic, Babe’s junior in X-Hunter.

400
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,200
Damn, why you sound so distant?

401
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,560
Don’t feel bad about it, man.

402
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,440
I lived with him for a whole year—
never shared a bed once.

403
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
He said we’re not that close.

404
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,240
Babe gets shy.

405
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,240
Well, it’s true!

406
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
If you want me to shut up—

407
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,600
then just let me sleep next to you.

408
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,600
You always twist things around, Babe.

409
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,240
Sleeping separately is better anyway.

410
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Hey, check this out.

411
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,400
Whose car is that?

412
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,400
Come on—it’s Uncle’s!

413
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
Uncle!

414
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,040
- Jeff!
- Sonic!

415
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,720
Where’ve you guys been?

416
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,880
Me and Uncle just gave
Charlie’s car a full makeover.

417
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,560
It’s been sitting dead
in the garage for a year.

418
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,200
A racer’s gotta race, right?

419
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Babe—

420
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,480
take Charlie for a few laps.
Shake the memories loose.

421
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,280
You sure about this?

422
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
I don’t even know if I can drive.

423
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,120
You can drive.

424
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,760
You’re Pitbabe’s one and only student, man.

425
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,000
You just don’t remember it yet, that’s all.

426
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,200
Hey, Uncle—

427
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,120
Babe really never gives up, huh?

428
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,000
Charlie still doesn’t remember anything.

429
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,640
Hey—

430
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,880
You gotta have hope, man.

431
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,400
Babe, maybe you should drive instead.

432
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,760
I’m scared I’ll wreck the car.

433
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,480
Charlie—

434
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,040
If I say you can do it, then you can.

435
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,800
Now drive.

436
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,680
Just believe in yourself.

437
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,520
Hit the apex, shift at the right time—
that’s all there is to it.

438
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,320
When you’re teaching me...

439
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,960
you look so cool.

440
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Charlie...

441
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,120
Coach.

442
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,040
You remember now?

443
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,480
Oh—

444
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Happy anniversary, Papa.

445
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,680
In your memory—

446
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,080
we might’ve only been together one year.

447
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,600
But for Mama...

448
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,800
it’s already been two years.

449
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,240
Like I once told you—

450
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,960
you don’t have to remember everything, Papa.

451
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,360
Just...

452
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,000
stay with Mama—

453
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,240
forever. That’s all I need.

454
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,320
You just have to believe in yourself.

455
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,040
Train until you know exactly
how much pressure is just right.

456
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,360
What are you staring at?

457
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,320
Just thinking you look so cool.

458
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,400
You’re the best coach ever.

459
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,760
Help!

460
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,560
Babe!

461
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,840
Welcome to X-Hunter, Charlie.

462
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Charlie.

463
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,240
All mellow and innocent.

464
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,200
When you pet him—

465
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,680
feels like stroking a golden retriever.

466
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Our little puppy Charlie.

467
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,880
Stalkers these days are kinda hot.

468
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,280
I don’t want you to be
just Babe’s boy, Charlie.

469
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,120
Be my boyfriend.

470
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,000
Didn’t you say we wouldn’t kiss?

471
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,600
Well, I changed my mind.

472
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,120
Or... you didn’t like it?

473
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,840
Mama, you wanna test Papa again?

474
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,200
If Babe wants to try—

475
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,200
then we’ll test it.

476
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,720
But I can’t see anything.

477
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,200
Do you need to see—

478
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,280
when you’re doing it?

479
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,600
Will you accept this couple ring?

480
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,640
Mama just wants Papa
to stay with her forever.

481
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,880
Why'd you stop, Charlie?

482
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,360
Actually, I said it wrong.

483
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,800
Wrong how?

484
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,240
The truth is—

485
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,240
if we count it right...

486
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,480
it’s almost three years now, Babe.

487
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,720
Did you seriously forget
the first year I chased you?

488
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,160
Charlie...

489
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,520
You remember?

490
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,440
Charlie.

491
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,360
You...

492
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,040
Charlie.

493
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,240
While I was driving—

494
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,640
the memories started trickling in.

495
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,640
I wasn’t sure if I remembered or not...

496
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,920
but I kept seeing Mama’s face everywhere.

497
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,480
Charlie, I missed you so much.

498
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
All this time...

499
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,240
I made things really hard for you, didn’t I?

500
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,920
Not at all.

501
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,240
No.

502
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,560
I'm sorry.

503
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,360
It’s okay, Charlie.

504
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,480
Charlie remembers now.

505
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Charlie... that mutt Charlie
remembers everything.

506
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,240
- For real?
- Charlie!

507
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,040
- Are you serious?
- Charlie!

508
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,840
- P’Charlie!
- For real?

509
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,000
He's back to normal now!

510
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,760
- P’Charlie!
- It worked!

511
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,000
Charlie’s really back.

512
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,080
You made me sleep alone for a whole year.

513
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,240
Let’s go.

514
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,560
(So deep in the feels)

515
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,080
Got any water?

516
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,480
- Want water?
- That was intense.

517
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,520
(Zombie Tony incoming)

518
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,800
No way!
(Messing with Mom is too fun)

519
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,840
(I’m outta here)

520
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,600
I’m gone!
(Gotta save myself first)

521
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,920
Cut.
(Did Uncle Sai crack his head?)

522
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,880
It’s nothing, just blood.
(Blood's spurting now)

523
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,080
Died peacefully.

524
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,240
- Production injury fee.
- Sheesh.

525
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
Still alive!
(This one never gives up)

526
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,840
I wasn’t tense, I swear.

527
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,720
Charlie needs to look good
while getting wiped down.

528
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,520
(Let me work out too)

529
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,280
(Get well soon, Papa)
