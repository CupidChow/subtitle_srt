1
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,840
No matter if we know or not,

2
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
what lies ahead in the future—

3
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,480
today, we'll still be together.

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm just wondering what you were thinking

5
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,480
when you had dinner with someone
who looked like your ex.

6
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,880
This compound is the same one
we used in the skill-erasing drug trials.

7
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,000
Tony wasn't making a skill-erasing drug.

8
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,960
He’s actually working
on a skill-enhancing formula.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,080
Happy birthday, Mama.

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,880
Get ready. The real thing’s about to begin.

11
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,960
Someone like Tony

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,120
wouldn’t create a booster for
people who already have special senses.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,120
He probably wants to transform
ordinary people

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,320
into ones with special abilities.

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
So what exactly is his goal?

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,000
To create an army
of enhanced Alphas?

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not so sure about that.

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,680
What Jeff saw
still isn’t enough.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
I think…

20
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,880
He probably wants to create
as many enhanced Alphas as possible.

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
This isn’t a joke anymore.

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,960
If he really manages to pull this off—

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
both creating and controlling them—

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
he’ll have all the power in his hands.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,800
Tony’s lab looks exactly like
what Jeff saw in the future.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,320
And no one’s found out yet?

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Pete.

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,560
Can you track him through
the chemicals he ordered for the lab?

29
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,280
It might be doable.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
But honestly,

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,000
I don’t think Tony would build
a normal lab where people can see it.

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,880
He probably hid it from Dad
in some random building.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,880
And Tony owns like a hundred buildings.

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,560
Who’s gonna find it?

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,800
I’ll look into that myself.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,760
You better keep your head down.

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,200
If Tony sees you again,

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,560
you won’t make it out.

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,560
No one knows Tony better than I do.

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
Tony’s got spies everywhere right now.

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,280
I think this time,

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
we have to move as quietly as possible.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,800
Uncle, North’s driving’s improved a lot.

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,200
He’s way more mature now
that he’s in the senior ranks.

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,640
But I still think the car’s a bit shaky.

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,000
Can you check it out later?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,520
Sure thing.

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
Hey North, how’s it going?

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,800
-Check the suspension too.
-Okay.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
What’s with you?

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,920
What about Sonic, Uncle?

52
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,200
Whether he shows or not,
you still have to train.

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
Why do you care?

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
I was just asking.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,640
Just curious, that’s all.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,920
Don’t worry, North.

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,160
Sonic’s probably on his way.

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,280
Oh, speak of the devil.

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,200
I thought you were out partying
and running late.

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,839
Didn’t celebrate anything.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,440
Charlie.

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,000
Congrats, Babe.
Wishing you a long, happy love.

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Thanks a lot.

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,560
Not bad, Charlie. Impressive.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,159
Uncle, maybe stop talking now.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
Wait a sec, Babe. Hang on.

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
-Let me see that.
-North.

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,400
Babe.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
You went all out with this.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,880
Why not just get married already?

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,560
Buy the wedding ring
at the same time and call it done.

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
Right? It’s already that serious.

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Might as well tie the knot.

74
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,200
Get married! Do it! Do it!

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,760
Get married! Get married!

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
-Do it!
-I’m not getting married, okay!

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,840
No party, and I still got slapped around.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
Seriously, North—

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
all you think about is partying.

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
You’re in the senior ranks now.

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,360
Take it more seriously.

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
Come on, Uncle.

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
Even if you don’t tell me off—

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,200
I’ve got no friends to party with anyway.

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah, yeah. Says the guy who has Jeff.

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
And Babe’s got Charlie too.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
Back then...

88
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
I still had Sonic.

89
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,480
Now that just sounds kinda sad.

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Well, look who’s here.

91
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
Oh hey, Sonic! Just in time.

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,880
North’s been asking about you non-stop.

93
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Come on, Uncle! Don’t say that!

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,440
Good to have everyone here.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
Makes it easier to say goodbye.

96
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,480
What?

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,600
I’ve gotta head back to Paris.

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
So soon?

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,960
You’re not staying to see North compete?

100
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
I wish I could, honestly.

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,120
You know what,

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm heading back to train, bro.

103
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm just being real with you.

104
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,760
Since you came back,
North's improved a ton.

105
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
He’s probably trying to prove himself to you.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
If you stayed a little longer,

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,400
I think it'd really help him.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
Whether I stay or not,

109
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,200
North still has to get through this
on his own anyway, Uncle.

110
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,159
And all those questions you kept asking
about North and me—

111
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,080
it’s ‘cause you care about him, right?

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,280
Why not just tell him straight up?

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,200
Tell him you’re rooting for him.

114
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,080
Because...

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
Look at me and him, Uncle.

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,920
It’s not like talking to him is easy.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,840
I didn’t want to butt in,

118
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,080
‘cause it’s between you two.

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,680
But come on, it’s been years already.

120
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Everyone can see you two like each other.

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,720
Why haven’t you gotten together yet?

122
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,200
You think I have the answer, Uncle?

123
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,560
North might be a bit clueless sometimes—

124
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,280
but if you’d just try to reach out to him...

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,320
Uncle.

126
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Look at you, acting like some love guru.

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,480
Back then you were
the one asking me for advice.

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,560
Remember that?

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
I used to be sure—

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,040
that me and him,
we could really make it work.

131
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
But now...

132
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,040
These days...

133
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,920
I’m not so sure anymore.

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
Me and North—

135
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,960
it’s like someone’s

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,680
but we’re always just a little too late.

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,880
But I’m done being stuck in the friend zone.

138
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,680
I’m moving on and finding something new.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
Why though?

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
Are you really giving up?

141
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,880
Yeah, Uncle.

142
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,240
I’ll think about it—

143
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,480
about staying in Thailand
till the end of the season.

144
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,480
It’s rare getting to see everyone like this.

145
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
Honestly, I don’t really want to leave yet.

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,560
Well, give it some thought, man.

147
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,799
Pete, is something wrong?

148
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
No, nothing’s wrong.

149
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,080
Just lost in thought.

150
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,360
Thinking about the time we hooked up?

151
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
Hey, come on.

152
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
What if someone hears you?

153
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
It could spread around. That’s not good.

154
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,520
I don’t want anyone to think badly of you.

155
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,200
I don’t really care about that stuff.

156
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,760
You should worry more about your own image.

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
So...

158
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,520
about that night—

159
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,880
-I...
-I didn’t think anything of it.

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,840
You can just pretend
like nothing ever happened.

161
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,080
Chris.

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Is it really that simple for you?

163
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,320
Why do you have to make it harder than it is?

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,520
It was just a physical thing.

165
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,600
If that’s really how you see it...

166
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
Then fine.

167
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,040
I want to consult you about something.

168
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
Consult me about what?

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,160
If you're gonna ask me something now,

170
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
please make it work-related only.

171
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,040
We’re still on the clock.

172
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,920
I want to talk to you about Tony’s lab.

173
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,520
I was thinking—

174
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
if we start by investigating the chemicals

175
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,760
or meds those labs have been ordering,

176
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
that could be a good starting point.

177
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Even if Tony’s kept the lab super secret,

178
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,360
there’s got to be some kind of paper trail.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
If it’s about that—

180
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,600
I think I can help you out.

181
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,320
But it might take a bit of time.

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
So let’s say...

183
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
after work hours, okay?

184
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,520
I’ll update you then.

185
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
Hey, Dean!

186
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,520
Looks like the oil pan’s leaking.

187
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
How do you even check that?

188
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,400
Go grab the tools.

189
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,120
Ever since Jeff stopped supervising me—

190
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,400
nothing I do seems good enough for you.

191
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,120
Don’t overthink it, man.

192
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,080
Maybe I’ve just gotten a bit spoiled.

193
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
My boyfriend’s just that good.

194
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,080
He gets me without me having to say a word.

195
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,720
What can I do, right?

196
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
Hand me the gloves.

197
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,600
Whatever you say, I’ll go with it.

198
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,480
Alan.

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,400
Are you okay?

200
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,160
Come sit down for a bit.

201
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,480
Careful.

202
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
I...

203
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,600
I just lost my footing a bit, that’s all.

204
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,240
Honestly,

205
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,600
you should take better care of your body.

206
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
Hey…

207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,680
How old are you now, anyway?

208
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
I haven’t been working out lately.

209
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,680
Been caught up with stuff at the garage.

210
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,720
I plan to get back in shape soon.

211
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Honestly,

212
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
I think Jeff’s gonna outlive you for sure.

213
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,120
Hey, Dean.

214
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,720
Are you cursing me or what?

215
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
I’m not cursing you.

216
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,520
I said it because I care about you.

217
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,760
You should go get some rest for now.

218
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,680
I’ll have the mechanics take care of the rest.

219
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
Fine, fine.

221
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,400
I’ll rest after tonight’s race, alright?

222
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
More power, Uncle!

223
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,840
Yeah! Combo attack!

224
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,000
Why are you lying down? Get up!

225
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
I’m done, Babe.

226
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,800
Let him drink some water.

227
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
He’s totally out of it.

228
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
You alright, man?

229
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,640
Come on—

230
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
Drink some water.

231
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,040
My body’s not what it used to be.

232
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,920
I really need to start
taking care of myself again.

233
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,280
No way I’m dying before Jeff.

234
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,760
Come on, Uncle.

235
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,760
People can die anytime
has nothing to do with age.

236
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Are you cursing me again?

237
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
Nope.

238
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,400
Dean’s another one like that.

239
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
Wow.

240
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,960
Jeff, stop eating already.

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,680
There won’t be anything left
for Babe and Alan.

242
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,480
But I’m hungry.

243
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,320
When are those two coming back?

244
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
What could they possibly
be talking about that long?

245
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,400
Are you happy yet?

246
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,600
You, Alan kid.

247
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,680
-Come help Uncle out. My back’s killing me.
-Oh wow, what happened?

248
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
Uncle.

249
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,840
I told you tonight
was supposed to be rest night.

250
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,600
You’ll overdo it at this rate.

251
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,080
Babe, seriously—

252
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
didn’t you say you wouldn’t tease me?

253
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
I’m not teasing. I mean it.

254
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,800
You won’t survive tonight’s round,
and tomorrow you’re training me.

255
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,080
Babe, you made
Uncle work out or something?

256
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
What’s up, Papa?

257
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes, sir!

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
Can you walk alright?

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Come on, want some? It's perfectly cooked.

260
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,480
It’s not as intense as Babe says.

261
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,080
I just want to work out regularly, that’s all.

262
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,040
Old folks feel like
their bodies are breaking down—

263
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
afraid they’ll die before
their younger partners.

264
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,240
So they start taking care
of their health, that’s it.

265
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,640
Babe.

266
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
If your body’s not ready—

267
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,960
working out will just make it worse.

268
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,760
See, Uncle?

269
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
I told you not to push yourself.

270
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,200
See? Your young boyfriend said it.

271
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,080
But honestly, doesn’t
P’ Alan work out often already?

272
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,760
I mean, sex counts as cardio too.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,920
I’m not saying that myself—Jeff told me!

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
Hey, kid.

275
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,200
What have you been telling him?

276
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,280
Charlie.

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,880
Oh wow.

278
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,080
Delicious.

279
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,600
Welcome to the
Super Hallow GT Speed Thunder race!

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,720
This time, we’re racing at night—

281
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,320
a full night race!

282
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
It's all happening in a heartbeat.

283
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,240
I told you to stop following me.

284
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
No, I wasn’t! I just came
to use the bathroom.

285
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
That ring—

286
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
Did Charlie buy it for you?

287
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,280
Just engaged, right?

288
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,680
Not married yet.

289
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,400
None of your business.

290
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,480
It has nothing to do with you.

291
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,560
Of course it does.

292
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,520
I told you I like you.

293
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,000
I can give you more than Charlie ever could.

294
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
Don’t be ridiculous.

295
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,800
Someone like you—

296
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
what could you possibly give me?

297
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,040
Just give it a try, Babe.

298
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
You might even like it.

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,480
Someone pathetic like you?

300
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,280
I wouldn’t even try if you begged me.

301
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,680
I can give you first place.

302
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
Give me first place?

303
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,839
I don’t need your first place.

304
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,400
I’m Pit Babe.

305
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,000
Someone like me wins on my own.

306
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
Sure.

307
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,720
You’re good, Babe.

308
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
But I think deep down you already know—

309
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,920
maybe you can beat Charlie...

310
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,079
but with me—

311
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,359
it won’t be that easy.

312
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,800
I mean it.

313
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
If you go out with me—

314
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
I’ll give you first place.

315
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,520
We’re back at the
Super Hallow Street GP Thunder race!

316
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,920
This is the third night race of the season.

317
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
Or Night Race.

318
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,080
And we’re off!

319
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,480
-Give it all you’ve got this round.
-Babe.

320
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,760
The lead is still with Team X-Hunter,
followed by—

321
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Willy from Team ETA!

322
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
They’re right on each other’s tails.

323
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
And now Willy is chasing Pit Babe hard!

324
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Willy’s gaining on him!

325
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,160
Pit Babe is still in the lead!

326
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,000
Charlie’s still coordinating
smoothly with North.

327
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
And North is doing a great job
blocking the line.

328
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,480
No way I’m letting you pass.

329
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,960
They’re both trying hard.

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Willy’s looking for a way through.

331
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,880
These guys are seriously on my tail!

332
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,160
Watch your rear, North!

333
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
Stay straight—go, go, go!

334
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Team ETA is trying to squeeze through.

335
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,240
If there’s a gap, take it.

336
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,160
North’s no pushover either!

337
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,240
That was a beautiful move.

338
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,480
Nice one!

339
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
And Willy picks up speed!

340
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,120
He’s successfully overtaken North!

341
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,760
Now he's closing in fast on Charlie and Babe.

342
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,160
Faster, come on!

343
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Willy overtakes!

344
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,920
There’s contact—an explosion on the track!

345
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,840
Hey, North! You okay?

346
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,120
We’re checking the situation on-site now.

347
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,920
That little punk played dirty.

348
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,280
We’re entering Zone B now.

349
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,720
Leading this zone are Babe and Charlie—

350
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,040
followed closely by Willy and North!

351
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Willy’s not letting go!

352
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,280
He’s pressing hard, trying to take the lead!

353
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
Charlie, help me out!

354
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,000
Charlie and Babe
are still blocking the line well.

355
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,600
Now Willy has made a pass!

356
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,200
He’s overtaken Charlie!

357
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,640
-He’s through!
-Babe, watch out!

358
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,640
But Pit Babe is still holding onto 1st place!

359
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,800
Followed by Willy and Charlie.

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,280
Willy is now right on Pit Babe’s tail!

361
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
And right at this moment—

362
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,840
Willy is pushing forward—pushing hard!

363
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,560
He’s finally overtaken Pit Babe!

364
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,920
Willy, who made a mistake in round 2—

365
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,400
is now back in the lead again.

366
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
And Willy, the winner of the first race—

367
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,600
let’s see

368
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,200
if he can pull it off again tonight.

369
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,400
Pit Babe and Charlie

370
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,840
-are trying to catch up with Willy!
-Come on, Babe, push harder!

371
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,320
Willy takes the corner beautifully!

372
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,680
And now we’ve reached the final lap!

373
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
Willy is still in the lead—

374
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
followed by Pit Babe
and Charlie from X-Hunter.

375
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,880
It’s the final turn, Babe!

376
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
Find an opening! Charlie, help him out!

377
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,680
And Babe is now accelerating hard!

378
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,360
He’s gaining on him!

379
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,320
He’s closing the gap now!

380
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,720
Babe is now side by side with Willy!

381
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,400
And here it is—the final straightaway!

382
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Neck and neck!

383
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,600
They’re bumping into each other now!

384
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,000
Wheel to wheel—neither one backing down!

385
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,840
It looks like Pit Babe
is speeding up—he’s gaining!

386
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,400
And he overtakes Willy in the end!

387
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,240
Pit Babe picks up speed on the final straight!

388
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,920
And Pit Babe crosses the finish line at last!

389
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,680
First place goes to
Pit Babe from Team X-Hunter!

390
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,200
And in this round’s race,
the king of the track—

391
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
is none other than Pit Babe from X-Hunter!

392
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,520
Followed by Willy from ETA.

393
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,360
Then Charlie and North from X-Hunter.

394
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,280
That was amazing, Babe!

395
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,520
That last-minute overtake was insane!

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,320
Willy wasn’t even that tough, bro.

397
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,680
You were way more hardcore.

398
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,680
You were awesome too, North.

399
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,040
Yeah.

400
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
Thanks, man.

401
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,440
Sonic—did you guys
have a fight or something?

402
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,680
No, we didn’t.

403
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,040
What’s up with him then?

404
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
Babe.

405
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,960
Are you okay?

406
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,080
Are you still in pain or something?

407
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,680
No, I’m fine.

408
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,000
It’s my turn now, Babe.

409
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,080
Why’d you throw the race?

410
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,280
I told you, didn’t I?

411
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,120
I can give you something no one else can.

412
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
I know you’ve got a special sense.

413
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,120
What makes you think that?

414
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,600
I don’t have anything special.

415
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,960
That final moment—

416
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,760
you did something on purpose.

417
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,920
You let me win.

418
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,520
Of course I knew.

419
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,000
What’s going on here?

420
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Didn’t even talk for long—

421
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,520
and your boyfriend’s already sniffed you out.

422
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,200
He was just talking to me
like a friend, that’s all.

423
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,360
Right, Babe?

424
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,880
Let’s go. Back to the pit.

425
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,520
Want me to give you a ride?

426
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,480
If you ever feel lonely—

427
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,000
drop by anytime.

428
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,000
-Willy.
-Charlie.

429
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,280
Don’t pay him any attention.

430
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,200
Come on.

431
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,480
Good night.

432
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
What the hell do you mean, good night?

433
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,120
So, how’s it going?

434
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,360
Did you find anything interesting?

435
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,560
Not yet.

436
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,280
But I’ve contacted a friend who works with—

437
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,520
chemical substances used in experiments.

438
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,920
We should find something soon.

439
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,080
And your friend—

440
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,840
Can we trust them?

441
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
Yes, no worries. He’s reliable.

442
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,520
If you say so, I’m good with it.

443
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,240
So now you trust me?

444
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,680
Well, we’re in the same boat now, aren’t we?

445
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,720
If you’re putting work first—

446
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,400
you’re not going to betray me, right?

447
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Instead of asking—

448
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,560
maybe you should try this instead.

449
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
Well?

450
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,480
Now do you know—

451
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,400
if I’d ever betray you or not?

452
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,080
Once is called a one-night stand.

453
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,840
But if there’s a second time...

454
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,240
what do you think that makes us?

455
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,440
During work hours—

456
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,400
I’m just your researcher.

457
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,600
But off the clock—

458
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,160
I’ll be your sex partner.

459
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
Or whatever you wanna call it.

460
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,400
I’ll do what makes me happy.

461
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,520
You just enjoy yourself, that’s all.

462
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,520
-I mean...
-Aren’t you enjoying it right now?

463
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,960
Some things don’t need to be all logic.

464
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,480
Sometimes, you should just
go with your feelings.

465
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,480
Way’s birthday, huh?

466
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,680
I found something interesting.

467
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
Over the past 3 months—

468
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,800
CS Company has imported
a large amount of this drug.

469
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480
But I think you’d better not act yet.

470
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,520
Wait until I’ve confirmed the info.

471
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,920
Charlie.

472
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,680
Heading to the lab?

473
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,800
I’ll go this evening.

474
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,320
Gonna train at the garage first.

475
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,880
You didn’t even wake me this morning.

476
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,640
No good morning kiss either.

477
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,000
No cuddling last night.

478
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,920
I figured you were tired.

479
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,080
I know you’re still mad about Willy.

480
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,680
Charlie.

481
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,160
Stop sulking already.

482
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,960
Yesterday I just wanted to know
if Willy went easy on me.

483
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,600
You know I hate it when people go easy.

484
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,360
If I’m gonna win—

485
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,520
I want to win with my own skill.

486
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
And so?

487
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,760
Nothing, really.

488
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,480
I just wanted to be sure
if he really let me win or not.

489
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,680
That’s all. Maybe I misunderstood.

490
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
Charlie.

491
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,720
Papa.

492
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,360
Mama’s trying so hard to make up with you.

493
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,640
Stop sulking already.

494
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,800
You don’t actually like Willy, right?

495
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
No, I don’t.

496
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,120
Papa’s way cuter anyway.

497
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,280
I don’t wanna be the jealous type.

498
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,800
If you don’t like it—

499
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,800
then I don’t like it either.

500
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
But why’d you take a photo with him?

501
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,520
I didn’t want to—he pulled me in.

502
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,760
It better be true.

503
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,520
Papa.

504
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,320
It is true.

505
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,920
Mama only has one Papa.

506
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,840
And Mama hasn’t misbehaved either.

507
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
So stop worrying, Papa.

508
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,880
Mama promises.

509
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,920
Ta-da!

510
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,800
Someone’s broken in—

511
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,200
He escaped out back!

512
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
-After him, now!
-Hey! Stop!

513
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,120
You bastard!

514
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,320
Freeze!

515
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,680
Stop!

516
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,200
Hey! Don’t run!

517
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,000
Where the hell do you think you’re running to?

518
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,640
Are you out of your mind?

519
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,520
You just ran off from the room like that!

520
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,280
If I hadn’t gotten there in time—

521
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
was it really worth the risk?

522
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,840
So—was it worth it?

523
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,880
Data on Tony’s human trials.

524
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,200
Even if you hadn’t helped me—

525
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,240
I could’ve gotten out on my own.

526
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,560
Hey, you—

527
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,080
Maybe try appreciating
when someone helps you.

528
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,920
Thanks.

529
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,360
What did you just say?

530
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,280
Thank you.

531
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,080
Can you take me somewhere?

532
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,280
Mr. Tony.

533
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Our men just reported—

534
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,480
someone broke into CS Company earlier.

535
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
Here.

536
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,320
That guy’s totally ungrateful, huh?

537
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,880
Even after you gave him a second chance.

538
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,600
I actually thought he’d be smarter.

539
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,600
Turns out he’s still a dumb mutt.

540
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,320
But having Kenta on that side—

541
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,160
might actually make things more fun.

542
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Because I know Kenta very well.

543
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,280
He won’t be able to run from me.

544
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,000
That’s true.

545
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
No one can escape you, Mr. Tony.

546
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,960
Even after you were declared dead—

547
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,160
you still came back.

548
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,800
Even Babe—

549
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,040
I don’t think he’ll get away either.

550
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,240
Do you want me to bring Babe back now, sir?

551
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,080
I don’t need Babe back just yet.

552
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,560
I just want to watch him suffer.

553
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,440
That’s the best revenge.

554
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
Kenta.

555
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,640
Kim.

556
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,920
You two go ahead and talk. Don’t mind me.

557
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,760
You can tell him.

558
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,000
Chris knows everything already.

559
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,280
He’s not an outsider.

560
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
I dug into CS Company’s records.

561
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,920
I remember back when I was with Tony—

562
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,560
there was another group
assigned to guard this place.

563
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,600
But I didn’t know
what exactly they were doing.

564
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,120
Everything was kept top secret.

565
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,760
So why’d you go in there alone?

566
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,840
Why didn’t you wait for me?

567
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,440
It was dangerous, you know.

568
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,640
What if I was late or something?

569
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,320
It would’ve been dangerous anyway.

570
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,320
Tony’s not gonna wait for you.

571
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,720
So what did you find?

572
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,840
Something feels off.

573
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,960
The company’s totally quiet.

574
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
But heavily guarded.

575
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
There might be something useful in here.

576
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,160
Judging by how hard they came after you—

577
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,000
there’s definitely something going on.

578
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,080
I’m guessing CS Company—

579
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,440
is probably just a nominee company for Tony.

580
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
Something he set up to look legit.

581
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,880
So we need to dig into their records.

582
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
Kim.

583
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,880
Thank you.

584
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,120
And you—if you ever pull a stunt
like that again, tell me first.

585
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,800
I don’t want you going in alone.

586
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,280
It’s too dangerous.

587
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,800
Do you like him?

588
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,320
Who?

589
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,680
Still heartbroken over Pete?

590
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,800
Or are you still secretly in love with him?

591
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
Did you ever tell him how you feel?

592
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
If you keep everything to yourself like this—

593
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,520
how will he ever know how you feel?

594
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,120
If he knew you liked him—

595
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,360
maybe you two could be together.

596
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,880
No way.

597
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,480
It’s not that he doesn’t know.

598
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,560
He just doesn’t feel the same.

599
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,320
Since I was born—

600
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,560
there’ve only been two people in my life.

601
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,480
Tony and Pete.

602
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,640
Wait, what?

603
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,240
And those two—

604
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,120
neither ever felt anything for me.

605
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,480
That’s okay, though.

606
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,200
There are plenty of people in the world.

607
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,320
Someday—

608
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,480
you’ll meet someone who truly loves you.

609
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,440
-What are you doing?
-Damn it, North!

610
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,080
You scared the hell out of me!

611
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,760
Why are you looking at Willy’s IG?

612
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,560
Don’t tell me you’re into him.

613
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,040
I’m not into him.

614
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,480
I’m just curious.

615
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,520
Curious?

616
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,920
Curious about what?

617
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,160
I’m suspicious he might have
some special ability.

618
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,000
But I wasn’t sure, so I checked his IG.

619
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,640
Didn’t find anything, though.

620
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Do you know anything about him?

621
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,760
Honestly, I’ve never hung out with him.

622
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,920
Every time I see his face, I get annoyed.

623
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,880
Makes me wanna kick him in the neck.

624
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,400
Seriously—

625
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,840
he’s got the kind of face that asks for it.

626
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,400
Maybe I should just hire
a private investigator.

627
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,040
Oh come on, Babe.

628
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,240
No need to go that far for this.

629
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,480
-Really?
-I have a friend who’s an influencer.

630
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,960
I think they’ve posted pics with him before.

631
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,280
I’ll ask them for you.

632
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,560
At the very least—

633
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,560
we’ll know what he likes
to do or where he hangs out.

634
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,200
Yeah.

635
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,880
That actually sounds good.

636
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,880
Then I’ll leave this to you.

637
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,160
You can count on me.

638
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Just don’t tell Charlie, okay?

639
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,400
I don’t want him to worry.

640
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,360
Once everything checks out,
I’ll tell him myself.

641
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,800
Whoa.

642
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,960
North, you’re here early today.

643
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,440
He’s our future champ, after all.

644
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,280
Gotta have discipline, right?
Isn’t that right, Babe?

645
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
What was that?

646
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,080
I said future champ.

647
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,680
If you wanna be champ,
you gotta get past me first.

648
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,120
Past you, huh?

649
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,840
-Look, I’m past you.
-Do it properly.

650
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,280
Nice move, though.

651
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,360
-So?
-How’d it go, man?

652
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,280
Hey, time’s better this round.

653
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Damn, you’re getting solid.

654
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,640
Why’s your time better?
You swerved in the turn just now.

655
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,560
Wait—you noticed that, Babe?

656
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,360
Cut him some slack.

657
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,280
It’s just a little slip, man.

658
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,240
It was more than one turn. I saw it.

659
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,200
Take a break. Try again after.

660
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,040
Hey, North.

661
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,520
Wanna go another round with me?

662
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,280
Look at him, all fired up.

663
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,600
Bring it on.

664
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Charlie, you in?

665
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,960
Let me grab a drink first.

666
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,800
-I’ll catch up.
-Okay.

667
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,160
You’re going down.

668
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,720
This round, I’m taking you down.

669
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,600
I just got here.

670
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,480
I’ll probably be back late tonight.

671
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,880
See you at home, okay?

672
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,240
Love you, Papa.

673
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,320
Wow.

674
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,480
Didn’t expect to see you
in a place like this, Babe.

675
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,600
What, can’t I come out and explore a little?

676
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,640
Your boy toy not exciting enough anymore?

677
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,760
You even took your ring off to come here.

678
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,680
My boyfriend’s exciting all the time.

679
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,960
Still—

680
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,040
it’s fun to find something new—

681
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,800
something a little more… interesting, right?

682
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,800
Don’t joke around like that.

683
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,920
I’m serious.

684
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,160
I know you’re dead serious.

685
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,400
But the question is—

686
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,480
are you even interesting enough for me?

687
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,880
You’ve been trying to flirt
with me for a while now.

688
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,600
But when it really comes down to it—

689
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,280
maybe you’re too scared.

690
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,600
I’ve had the guts
since the day I first met you.

691
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,680
But I know you’d never
want someone like me.

692
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,440
What is it you really want from me?

693
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,200
Just say it straight.

694
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,000
You’re an Alpha with
special abilities, aren’t you?

695
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,200
You really went through
all this just to find out?

696
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,320
I just want peace of mind.

697
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,520
And more than that—

698
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,040
I wanna know what someone like you—

699
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,640
really wants from me.

700
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,720
Let go.

701
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,320
What are you doing?

702
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,760
Hold still.

703
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,160
What the hell are you doing?

704
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,680
Babe.

705
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,240
Charlie.

706
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,920
I did what I wanted to do.

707
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,720
So did you. We’ve just found different paths.

708
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,240
I always believed in you.

709
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,040
And you’re the one who shattered that.

710
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,640
Now Chris is getting too close to Pete.

711
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,760
Is it trust you lack—or jealousy?

712
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,680
How many times do I have to tell you?

713
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,680
Stop treating me like someone
who's already dead.

714
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,920
If you win—

715
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,440
If I win, I’ll stay out of Babe’s life.

716
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,840
If you lose, you walk away
from Babe’s life too.

717
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,280
You up for that?

718
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,480
Whether it’s racing or Babe—

719
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,360
I’ll beat you in both.

720
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,560
(He’s feeding him!)

721
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,840
(Don’t give in!)

722
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,440
Mmm, yummy.

723
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,080
Stop teasing me already.

724
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,560
Cut!

725
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,240
I’m confused—is that Charlie or Pooh?

726
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,520
(He's playing himself.)

727
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,440
The vibe’s at -7 now.

728
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,800
(Nice weather, right?)
So fresh.

729
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,640
It’s hot.

730
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,480
Babe.

731
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,400
He’s going in for real.

732
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,160
You’re in a real hurry.

733
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,680
Just a sec, he’s really putting it on!

734
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,760
That was real just now.

735
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,480
(Yeah, that was pretty intense.)
