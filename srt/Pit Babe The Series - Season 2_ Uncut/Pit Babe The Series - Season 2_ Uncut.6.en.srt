1
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,760
Why did you throw the match?

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
I already told you what I can give you.

3
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Mama has only one Papa.

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
When we’re working,

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,160
I’m your research assistant.

6
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,280
Off the clock,

7
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,280
I’ll be your sex partner,
if that’s what you want.

8
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,000
Have you ever told him you love him?

9
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,479
It’s not like he doesn’t know.

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
He just doesn’t like me.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,200
But I know you’d never choose me anyway.

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,080
What is it that you really want from me?

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,840
You’re a special-skilled Alpha, aren’t you?

14
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,840
You really went this far just to find out?

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Let go.

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Let go!

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
Babe!

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
Charlie.

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Charlie…

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,960
Charlie, listen to me!

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,880
Charlie, Charlie, please listen!

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
Charlie! Charlie!

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,520
It’s not what you think, Charlie!

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
If you’re going to mess around,
why not tell your boyfriend first, Babe?

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,480
Can’t even make your boyfriend feel okay,

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,480
so you take it out on someone else?

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,880
How cute of you.

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,320
-Calm down, Charlie.
-You—

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,160
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
Charlie.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Charlie.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,079
-Charlie—
-Let go.

33
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,960
Babe came to me first, okay?

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,360
Now you act all innocent
in front of your boyfriend?

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,680
How is that right?

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Shut your mouth.

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
Charlie, calm down.

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,520
Calm down?

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Charlie.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
Charlie!

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,160
Charlie, listen to me!

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,480
Charlie—

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
Charlie…

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
Just hear me out.

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,960
What else are you going to lie about?

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,880
Just listen, I had a reason.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
What reason could justify all this?

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,760
And why did you take off your ring?

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,680
There’s no reason except your greed.

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,560
Okay, I’m sorry about the ring. But—

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,360
I was suspicious Willy
had a sixth sense, so I checked into it.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,320
And last race, he let me win so easily.

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,640
Just like that.

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Don’t you think that’s kind of weird?

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Charlie.

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,640
Charlie, please listen.

57
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah, it is weird.

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
But what’s even weirder is you.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,560
Weird that you let Willy get close to you.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,600
If it were the old you,

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
You’d curse at anyone
who even brushed past you.

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,440
How am I supposed to understand you now?

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
But I didn’t actually do anything with him.

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
OK.

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,720
I know you’re mad.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
But please listen to me. Be reasonable.

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
Reasonable?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
You're the one who’s being unreasonable.

69
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,000
You followed him on IG.

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,840
You replied to Willy's messages.

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
You think I didn’t notice?

72
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
I saw everything.

73
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
But I never took it further.

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
Charlie, I really had to do it.

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
Had to, huh?

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,680
I always believed in you.

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
But you’re the one who broke that trust.

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
-Charlie—
-Right now,

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
It doesn’t mean anything anymore.

80
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Charlie, don’t go!

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Charlie, talk to me!

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,720
Charlie! Charlie, open the door!

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,480
I said open the door!

84
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
Charlie!

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,880
You’ve reached
the voicemail box of the number…

86
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Charlie, where are you? Get home now.

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Mr. Chris.

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
Has Charlie come here?

89
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you see him here?

90
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,160
Can you not piss me off right now?

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,720
Charlie hasn’t been here.

92
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
Has he contacted you at all?

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Do I look like someone he’d be close to?

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,880
If someone hates your boyfriend,
and you don’t even know—

95
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
Then how do you expect me to know?

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,440
Or did you two already break up?

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
Uncle.

98
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,200
Uncle.

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
Oh?

100
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
Did Charlie come here?

101
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,000
Charlie? No.

102
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,480
What’s up?

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Jeff didn’t come too?

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,280
He said he went to pick
something up at the garage.

105
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Why? What happened?

106
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
You came here to look for Charlie?

107
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,800
Because Charlie saw me with Willy.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,040
Huh?

109
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Yeah.

110
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,600
You were with Willy?

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,560
What’s wrong with you?

112
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Sit down first.

113
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,440
Sit.

114
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Tell me.

115
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,680
It’s not what you think, Uncle.

116
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,440
I just wondered if Willy
had a special sense. So I checked.

117
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,400
You checked Willy?

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,600
-Yeah.
-What were you thinking?

119
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,560
I didn’t think, Uncle.

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
That’s why this happened.

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,560
I’m not surprised Charlie’s mad at you.

122
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
But I have my reason.

123
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,640
You know I’d never go for Willy.

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
About this—

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,320
Charlie didn’t do anything wrong.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,360
The one who messed up is you.

127
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,800
Totally your fault.

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,040
But he shouldn’t be angry to the point of…

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,040
Taking off the couple ring, right?

130
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,680
You know I’d never cheat on Charlie.

131
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,520
I’m just…

132
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
I really love him.

133
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
Does this mean
Charlie doesn’t trust me at all?

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,680
From what I see,

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,320
It’s not that Charlie

136
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,960
doesn’t trust you.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
He doesn’t trust Willy.

138
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
That kid went after you so openly.

139
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,280
He flirts with you nonstop.

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,280
Even if Charlie’s as calm as a monk,

141
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
anyone would get mad, Babe.

142
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
Charlie can be mad at me.

143
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
But I just don’t want him
to leave the house like that.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,880
And now I can’t even reach him.

145
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,520
I’m really worried about him, Uncle.

146
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,280
Come on.

147
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,000
He’s just mad right now.

148
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
Give him a little time.

149
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,800
Once he calms down, he’ll come back.

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,240
You’re not planning
to stay here forever, right?

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,240
I only packed a few outfits for you.

152
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
I don’t know yet.

153
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,560
I haven’t thought about it.

154
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,760
Charlie.

155
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,760
I think you should calm down.

156
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,720
Wouldn’t it be better to go back to Babe?

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,320
You didn’t go through what I did.
Easy for you to say.

158
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
Think about it.
What if Alan did that to someone else?

159
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
How would you feel?

160
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Didn’t Babe always act like this?

161
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
But back then,

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,160
I wasn’t even dating Babe.

163
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,680
But now we’re living together, Jeff.

164
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,200
Flirting and cheating are totally different.

165
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,920
Then how do you know for sure?

166
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,880
That Babe actually cheated on you?

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,080
Whose little brother are you again?

168
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,560
I’m saying this because I care.

169
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,440
From what you told me,

170
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,080
I think Babe had a reason for what he did.

171
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,680
He probably thought

172
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
Willy really was suspicious.

173
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,240
He wanted to know the truth so badly
he had to follow Willy like that?

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,080
Anyone can see

175
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
that Willy was only hitting on Babe

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,520
because he wanted him. That’s it.

177
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
But Babe…

178
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,560
He got obsessed.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Always looking to catch others doing wrong.

180
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,480
You’re obsessed with
your lab work too, aren’t you?

181
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,560
But he never complains about it.

182
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
That’s not the same at all.

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,360
You know I’m rushing the meds

184
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,560
because I want to help everyone.

185
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,640
And Babe followed Willy

186
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
because he wants to protect everyone too.

187
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
Don’t forget

188
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
what he’s been through.

189
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,880
With Tony—

190
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,400
and with Way.

191
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
You think Babe can trust anyone that easily?

192
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,120
I think,

193
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,920
until he’s sure

194
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,440
that Willy isn’t dangerous, he won’t stop.

195
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Anyway—

196
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,280
Just get some rest and cool down first.

197
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Mm.

198
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,720
I’ll get going then.

199
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
Two, please.

200
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,400
Why are you following me?

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,640
You left me in the middle
of the sauna like that.

202
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,400
I didn’t know where to go.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
So I had to follow you here.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,960
You’re seriously not
gonna stop messing with me?

205
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,440
Hey.

206
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,360
Don’t forget—

207
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,080
You’re the one who started it at the sauna.

208
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
Fine, I’m sorry then.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,120
From now on, I’m done dealing with you.

210
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
Go back the way you came.

211
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,160
Just seeing your face annoys me.

212
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,520
Is that really a good idea?

213
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,200
Don’t you want to know
about my special sense?

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,080
I said stay out of my life!

215
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,760
Looks like your fight
with Charlie was pretty serious.

216
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,120
Have you two made up yet?

217
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
Want me to help patch things up?

218
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
Can you not butt in?

219
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,840
You were with me just one day,

220
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,400
and you two already had a big fight?

221
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
Unless…

222
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,560
You two already had problems before that.

223
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
But having problems can be good.

224
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,760
Because that means…

225
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,880
I still have a chance.

226
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
Right?

227
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,280
What’s wrong with you?

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,280
He’s here.

229
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,360
Hey, Babe!

230
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,880
Did you sleep at all?
You look super worn out.

231
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,080
I slept.

232
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,600
Got 10 minutes this morning.

233
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
You better go back and sleep more.

234
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,440
If you train like this, you’ll collapse.

235
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
I’m fine.

236
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Jeff.

237
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,800
Did Charlie contact you last night?

238
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
I think now's not the time
for you two to talk.

239
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,280
You should both cool down first.

240
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Cool down?

241
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,440
He was gone all night
and I still don’t know where he stayed.

242
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,240
Trust me on this—

243
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,680
If you stay hot-headed,
things will only get worse.

244
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,880
If it reaches 24 hours,
I’m calling the police.

245
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
No need for that anymore.

246
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
Get the car ready.

247
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,040
-Charlie—
-I’ll wait at the practice track.

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Charlie!

249
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,160
Charlie! Charlie!

250
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,920
Babe, I think we should
stay away from each other.

251
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,160
Charlie, what do you mean
“stay away from each other”?

252
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,840
Charlie, when will we
ever talk things out properly?

253
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,960
If you keep talking with this kind of attitude,
I don’t want to talk.

254
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,280
Charlie, I already told you
all my reasons. I told you…

255
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
Charlie, just hear me out.

256
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
Charlie.

257
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,920
I know you had a reason.

258
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,040
But I have the right to be mad too.

259
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,240
I’m your boyfriend, you know?

260
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Or do I have to wait till you
actually sleep with Willy?

261
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,200
Then I’d be allowed to be mad?

262
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,880
Charlie, calm down.
It’s not what you think.

263
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,320
It’s not what you think.

264
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,080
-Babe, let go!
-Charlie!

265
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,680
-Babe, stop it!
-Let go!

266
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
That’s enough.

267
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,160
Let go.

268
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
Let go first, Babe. Let go.

269
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,400
Babe.

270
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,080
Charlie, calm down first.

271
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
Babe already feels guilty.

272
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,320
Say sorry to him.

273
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
I…

274
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,000
Alan, I swear
I didn’t mean to do any of that.

275
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,160
Charlie’s just overthinking it, bro.

276
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,680
I’m overthinking it?

277
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,680
Everything I do, I always think of you.

278
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,800
But why is it when you do something,
you never think about how I feel?

279
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
Are you really sure, Charlie?

280
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,600
Are you sure
I never think about how you feel?

281
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,760
If that’s what you think,
then why don’t you quit the lab too?

282
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,760
What does this have to do with the lab?

283
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,400
You’re mixing things up.

284
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,760
It’s all related, Charlie.

285
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,520
Because I want all
this crazy stuff to end, Charlie.

286
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,080
That’s why I went after Willy.
It’s all because of that.

287
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,960
But I know how to manage time.

288
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
I can still make time for you.
You don’t have to feel lonely.

289
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
I never buried myself in the lab,

290
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,360
leaving you all alone
like you’re doing to me now.

291
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,600
Babe.

292
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,600
Calm down.

293
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,440
Charlie, do you know
when you paid the most attention to me?

294
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,360
Back when we weren’t even dating.

295
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,480
Now you don’t care about me at all, Charlie.

296
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,120
Let me ask you something.

297
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,160
Why are we even together?

298
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,920
If I don’t matter to you at all?

299
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,800
It’s up to you now.

300
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,560
I came to practice racing today.

301
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,120
Not to fight with anyone.

302
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
I’ll be waiting at the track.

303
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,240
-Charlie! Charlie!
-Babe, hey!

304
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,200
Calm down. Let me talk to Charlie.

305
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,640
Babe, just take it easy for now.

306
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,360
Cool down, okay?

307
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,600
I thought you already left.

308
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,320
Not rushing back to the lab?

309
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,560
My shirt reeks of alcohol.

310
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,800
Hope you don’t mind me borrowing yours.

311
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
Didn’t you already put it on?

312
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,280
It actually suits you.

313
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,840
You can just keep it if you want.

314
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
Thanks.

315
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,600
But I’ll wash and return it later.

316
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,360
Let me have someone order breakfast for you.

317
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,600
If there’s something you want,

318
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
just order it yourself.

319
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
I don’t usually have
breakfast with a sex partner.

320
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,120
Have you talked to anyone in X-Hunter?

321
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,000
Normally, racing team matters

322
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,640
are Alan’s responsibility.

323
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,360
I don’t really get involved.

324
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,680
Why do you ask?

325
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,040
Yesterday, Babe came to
see Charlie at the lab.

326
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Looked like they had a huge fight.

327
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,080
Honestly, I don’t want to get involved.

328
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,560
I’m just worried about Charlie.

329
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
His mental and emotional state…

330
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
It directly affects his physical condition.

331
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,560
If Charlie’s emotions aren’t stable,

332
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,360
we may have to delay the experiment.

333
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,880
And if Charlie has to choose

334
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,640
between Babe

335
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,880
and the experiment,

336
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,400
I hope he chooses the experiment.

337
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
You understand, right?

338
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
I understand.

339
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,560
But I don’t think the way you do.

340
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,280
I just think…

341
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,360
Maybe people don’t have to go to
extremes with everything.

342
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
And I hope Charlie doesn’t have to choose.

343
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,880
Okay, let’s go.

344
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,080
-Just like that.
-Yeah.

345
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,520
That works.

346
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
-Whoa, what was that?
-Hey!

347
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,400
-Whoa, whoa!
-Hey!

348
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,760
Did the wheel slip?

349
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,680
That looked good though, really good.

350
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,600
-Don’t— Charlie!
-Hey!

351
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,240
-Hey!
-Don’t cut in like that! How’d you pass?

352
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,200
Hey, careful! Watch it!

353
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Charlie, can you please
separate work from personal stuff?

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,120
I’ve taught you how to
drive so many times already.

355
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,760
What you just did is dangerous.

356
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,600
Also, when you're driving,
don’t let your emotions take over.

357
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,920
I told you that before.

358
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,480
In racing, we go for first place.

359
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,160
I just wanted to see if I really go all in,

360
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,360
could I win like how
Willy won against you?

361
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,120
Is everything really just about Willy?

362
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,480
Besides, I’m trying to fix things between us.

363
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,200
I know.

364
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
But I just can’t separate it all.

365
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,720
Charlie.

366
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,840
If you’re gonna drive however
you want and ignore our strategy,

367
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,760
then maybe I don’t need to be team captain.

368
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,760
X-Hunter is about playing as a team.

369
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,080
If you can’t race as part of a team,

370
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
maybe you shouldn’t race next match.

371
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,160
Then I’ll cut today’s practice short.

372
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,920
Charlie, where are you going now?

373
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
I just want to be alone right now.

374
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,120
Charlie!

375
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,720
Your body is starting
to resist the medication.

376
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,960
Have you been taking care of yourself lately?

377
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,280
I haven’t really slept much.

378
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,480
Been a bit stressed, that’s all.

379
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,480
But it’s fine. I can handle it.

380
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
In this experiment,

381
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,320
it’s not about whether you can handle it or not.

382
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,440
It’s about whether your body can take it.

383
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,800
That’s what matters.

384
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,920
Then how about increasing my dose?

385
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,600
I don’t agree with that, Charlie.

386
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,280
Your current experiment
is already risky enough as it is.

387
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,240
You can’t just increase the dose randomly.

388
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,880
If your body becomes resistant to the drug,

389
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,680
it could ruin the entire experiment.

390
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,880
Then what should I do?

391
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,800
I think you should
take a break from racing for now.

392
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,360
I can’t do that.

393
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,400
If I stop racing,

394
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,720
what about Babe?

395
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,800
Your situation with Babe right now

396
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,360
is really affecting your health, Charlie.

397
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,800
I think…

398
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,680
Maybe now you need to choose.

399
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Whether you want to take a break from Babe

400
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,200
or take a break from the experiment.

401
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,280
Come eat with me.

402
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
I made samgyeopsal for you.

403
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,280
Not sure if you’ll like it.

404
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,680
I’m not picky.

405
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,120
Sit down.

406
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,640
Go ahead, eat.

407
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,480
Have this too.

408
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,960
So…

409
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,920
When are you going back to Korea?

410
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,240
Well…

411
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,120
Pretty soon, I guess.

412
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,760
Why do you ask?

413
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,520
I don’t trust Chris.

414
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,400
He’s getting way too close to Pete.

415
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,600
I think I better be careful.

416
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,800
You don’t trust him…

417
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,480
Or are you just jealous?

418
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,400
Aren’t you smoking too much?

419
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,280
It’s not good for your body.

420
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
What else can I do?

421
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,960
I’m stressed.

422
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,720
Then you should find another way to deal with it.

423
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
I’ve tried other ways.

424
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,080
But it doesn’t help.

425
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,920
Do you think…

426
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
Charlie will come back to the experiment?

427
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,160
He tried to create the skill-nullifying drug

428
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,240
just so he could be with Babe.

429
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,200
And now we’re asking him
to choose Babe or the lab.

430
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,080
So what you’re saying is,

431
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,360
everything we’ve been working for…

432
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,120
Means nothing?

433
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,840
But I believe Charlie
will choose the experiment.

434
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,400
Because Charlie loves Babe.

435
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,560
If the drug works,

436
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,160
he can be with Babe safely.

437
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don’t think he’ll give up that chance.

438
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,640
Because otherwise,

439
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,360
he’d have to live in fear
of people like Tony forever.

440
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,440
I hope you’re right.

441
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,880
You’re smoking, so why can’t I?

442
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
It just doesn’t suit a manager like you.

443
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,480
I just wanted to try.

444
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,840
I like the way it smells on you.

445
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
So I wanted to know—

446
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,280
If I smoked it, would I feel the same?

447
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,520
Way smokes too, doesn’t he?

448
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,680
How many times do I have to tell you…

449
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,560
Stop seeing me like
someone who's already dead.

450
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,240
I’m leaving.

451
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,000
See you at the lab.

452
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,680
Hello, uncle?

453
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,280
Babe?

454
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,800
Don’t worry, man.

455
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,560
Jeff told me where Charlie’s staying.

456
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
I secretly sent you the location already.

457
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,800
Just don’t tell Jeff about this, alright?

458
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,600
Send it to me now.

459
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,160
Charlie just needs some time
to get himself together.

460
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,160
You just need to stop pushing him
and give him space.

461
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,280
Just knowing he’s safe is enough.

462
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,360
Trust me, Babe.

463
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,680
This is just one more thing

464
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
you two have to get through.

465
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,360
Charlie really loves you, man.

466
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,480
He’s not going anywhere.

467
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,280
Babe.

468
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Charlie?

469
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,080
How did you get here?

470
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,240
Hey Charlie, come over here.

471
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,680
Grab a seat.

472
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,560
I saw you guys posting stories.

473
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,320
So I came to check it out.

474
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,199
Oh.

475
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,320
So you came all the way here for us?

476
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,639
The way you’re dressed
definitely here for Babe.

477
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,639
-Right?
-Definitely.

478
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,239
But I couldn’t reach Babe.

479
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,520
So I came, hoping I’d run into him.

480
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
Ugh.

481
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,679
Took you long enough to want to talk to him.

482
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,560
Hey, did you know—

483
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,199
Since he was born,

484
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,199
I’ve never seen Babe chase after anyone.

485
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,679
You’re the first.

486
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,679
So you better make up to Pit Babe properly.

487
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,920
Got it?

488
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,360
Why just me?

489
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,960
You and Sonic are still beefing too.

490
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,199
What?

491
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,719
I’m not the one beefing.

492
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,440
He’s doing that by himself.

493
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,480
I honestly don’t even get what his problem is.

494
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,680
I’m chill, really. No big deal.

495
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
So where’s Babe exactly?

496
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,320
No idea.

497
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,360
We invited him, but he didn’t want to come.

498
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,560
Well, if you guys manage to reach him,

499
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,320
just let me know, okay?

500
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,240
Mm-hmm.

501
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,080
-Sure.
-Wow.

502
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,320
Even the prince of
 the racetrack shows up here?

503
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,240
Hey, hey—

504
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,160
Who lit incense and summoned this guy?

505
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,160
Why didn’t Babe come with you?

506
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
Oh—

507
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
Did you guys break up?

508
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,640
What do you want?

509
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,480
Can’t you tell already?

510
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,080
I thought I made it pretty obvious—

511
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,040
I want Babe.

512
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,840
Hey—

513
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,640
How can you say something that messed up?

514
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
Huh?

515
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,760
Sometimes, dreams are all we’ve got.

516
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,160
Babe would never go for someone like you.

517
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
You never know.

518
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,920
I beat you on the track, didn’t I?

519
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,880
So why can’t I beat you
when it comes to Pit Babe?

520
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,360
Say whatever you want, man.

521
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
Just stay in your lane, alright?

522
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,800
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

523
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,160
Hold up.

524
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,880
What’s the rush, huh?

525
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
Wanna test our basics?

526
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
Bring it on.

527
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,760
Racing or Pit Babe—

528
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,240
I’ll beat you either way.

529
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,360
Good.

530
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,400
If you win—

531
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,040
I’ll stay out of Pit Babe’s life for good.

532
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,120
But if you lose,

533
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,640
you walk away from Pit Babe too.

534
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,280
You got the guts?

535
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,360
What the hell, North?

536
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
Call Pit Babe already.

537
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,360
One’s the ex, the other’s chasing him.

538
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,840
Throwing jabs like this—

539
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,520
We need a referee, man.

540
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,920
No need.

541
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,480
Let Charlie handle this on his own.

542
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,880
And you really think Charlie can win?

543
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
There he is, Charlie.

544
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,480
-Oh, sorry, excuse me.
-North!

545
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,320
-Sorry, sorry.
-Sonic, come here.

546
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,240
Hey, Charlie!

547
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,600
Listen up, man.

548
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,080
No matter what happens—

549
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,920
You better not lose to that punk Willy, got it?

550
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
I’m rooting for you all the way, Charlie.

551
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,760
The pride of X-Hunter
is on your shoulders now.

552
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,360
Yeah, it’s all on you now.

553
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,000
Don’t worry.

554
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,240
I’ll definitely beat him.

555
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
Let me cast a spell for you.

556
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,480
What the hell, North?

557
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,560
What are you doing?

558
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,800
Chanting the 100% win rate spell.

559
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,600
What 100% win rate?

560
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,760
Get ready.

561
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,400
Too bad—it’s a tie.

562
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,080
Guess we won’t know who won.

563
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
A tie means you didn’t win.

564
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
So now stay out of Pit Babe’s life.

565
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,600
If I see you outside the track again—

566
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,840
I’ll run you over, seriously.

567
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,080
That kind of anger is kinda thrilling though.

568
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,280
Good.

569
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,640
’Cause if you keep acting all boring—

570
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,480
Pit Babe might come to me real easy.

571
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,760
Next time, don’t hold back.

572
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,360
You’ll be okay, man.

573
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,120
Looks like Babe’s special sense
is all with Charlie now.

574
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,760
So that means Charlie
absorbed the power from him.

575
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,640
And it’s still inside him, right?

576
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,320
Do whatever it takes.

577
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,120
Bring Charlie back.

578
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,600
And get rid of everyone close to him.

579
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,440
Everyone, sir?

580
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,760
Yes.

581
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,240
But leave Babe to me.

582
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,520
Do whatever it takes.

583
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,320
Bring Charlie back.

584
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,640
And get rid of everyone close to him.

585
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,640
But leave Babe to me.

586
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,200
Charlie.

587
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,280
You two still haven’t made up?

588
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,040
It’s race day already.

589
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,760
I’m only focused on the race.

590
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,160
You don’t need to worry.

591
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,480
Don’t worry.

592
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,440
On the track, all I care about is winning.

593
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,760
Fine. Let’s hope that’s true.

594
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,560
But whatever issues you two have,
deal with them later.

595
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,280
I’m asking you, just for today.

596
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,720
Okay?

597
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,960
Get ready. Go.

598
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,760
Pit Babe, Pit Babe.

599
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,160
Pit Babe, better wait inside first.

600
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,880
I’ll come get you when we’re done.

601
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,880
Go ahead.

602
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
Please?

603
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,280
Hey.

604
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,960
Huh?

605
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,320
Where’s North?

606
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,680
He’s getting dressed.

607
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,920
Always slow, that guy.

608
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,440
Ouch.

609
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Uncle.

610
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,160
Does it hurt?

611
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,120
I told you to bend more carefully.

612
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,680
What’s with you, kid?

613
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,320
Why so jumpy?

614
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,080
I just lifted it the wrong way, that’s all.

615
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Look,

616
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,640
Believe it or not, I used to be a king.

617
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,160
This is nothing.

618
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,280
King or not, pain’s still pain.

619
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,960
Even kings get old.

620
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,400
Whoa, kid.

621
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,080
Listen.

622
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,320
Not only am I not old—

623
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,960
I’m immortal.

624
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,560
Because I feast on youth every day.

625
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,360
Excuse me, sir. Maybe you should rest.

626
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,360
Hey uncle, are you really hurt?

627
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,360
Of course I am.

628
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,720
You smacked me right on the sore spot.

629
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,440
Then maybe you should rest today.

630
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,080
No need to help out.

631
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,200
I said I’m fine.

632
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Nothing serious, just…

633
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,080
Faking pain so my girl gets worried. That’s all.

634
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,080
Then I’ll go get North ready.

635
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,400
You think our team feels kinda tense lately?

636
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,720
Kim just quit.

637
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,840
Pit Babe and Charlie aren’t even talking.

638
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,560
That’s normal.

639
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,360
Times change. People change.

640
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,040
What about you?

641
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,720
You ever think of racing again?

642
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,120
If you come back,

643
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,920
we could ride together like we used to.

644
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,960
I don’t want to race anymore.

645
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,960
What, Sonic?

646
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
But wasn’t your dream

647
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,080
to be the best-dressed racer?

648
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,360
Well, my dream’s changed now.

649
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,680
I’m doing what I love.

650
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,520
Same goes for you.

651
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,160
We’ve both found different paths we love.

652
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,280
Different paths, huh?

653
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,880
Hey.

654
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,080
Hurry up and get dressed.

655
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,760
You’re a veteran racer.

656
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,960
Veterans don’t show up late.

657
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
You ready, North? Time to gear up.

658
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
I’m ready, Jeff.

659
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,480
Today,

660
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,880
I hope you set a great record.

661
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,240
Okay.

662
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,880
Thanks.

663
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,720
Let’s go.

664
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,600
Welcome to the Haller GT Speed Thunder race!

665
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,240
We’re now at the race track.

666
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,320
The race has started, beginning with Zone A.

667
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,000
Pit Babe is still in the lead.

668
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,520
Followed by Charlie and Willy.

669
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,720
-Yeah!
-Pit Babe!

670
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,880
Now that’s what I’m talking about.

671
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,640
Willy is trying to find an opening.

672
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,320
Willy takes over and moves into 2nd place.

673
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,280
Meanwhile, North from X-Hunter

674
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,920
has overtaken from the back group.

675
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,000
North is accelerating—picking up speed!

676
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,600
-Impressive, North!
-He’s moved up!

677
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,720
-Go go!
-Now onto Zone B.

678
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,800
Willy and Charlie are still neck and neck.

679
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,920
Charlie has overtaken!

680
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,000
Charlie’s now in 2nd place.

681
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,080
North moves up from 7th to 6th place!

682
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,720
Still charging—he’s now 4th from 5th!

683
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,960
Not bad at all from X-Hunter’s racer.

684
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,160
Willy’s overtaken—he’s moving up now!

685
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,720
Willy’s successfully taken 2nd place!

686
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,960
Willy and Babe are neck and neck!

687
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,240
Charlie’s trying to pick up speed too.

688
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,400
He overtakes!

689
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,480
Charlie’s right beside Willy now.

690
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,760
They’re still pushing side by side.

691
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,600
And Charlie makes the pass!

692
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, that’s it!

693
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,120
The rankings just shifted again.

694
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,480
Charlie takes 2nd. Willy drops to 3rd.

695
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,760
Charlie’s blocking really well.

696
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,080
Willy tries to sneak through but—

697
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,160
Charlie’s still holding the line.

698
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,760
Willy steps on it and overtakes!

699
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,040
Willy’s gonna beat Pit Babe for sure, man!

700
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,360
What do we do?

701
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,160
Hey, the race isn’t over yet.
Why are you panicking?

702
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,120
Uncle, should we have North cover Willy?

703
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,120
We can’t rely on Charlie alone.

704
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah, North—

705
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,240
Once you hit that next corner, go full speed.

706
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,000
-Get up there and help Babe out.
-Got it, Uncle.

707
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,480
Smooth cornering just now!

708
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,000
North is still in 4th place.

709
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,160
Looks like North is picking up speed!

710
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,400
North has overtaken Charlie!

711
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,520
You know who I am? North, Top Speed.

712
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,800
Looks like Willy’s not giving in.

713
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,800
He’s closing in fast.

714
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,600
Oh no, North got hit and spun out!

715
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,520
Position shift! Willy is now in 3rd place.

716
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,640
-What the hell?
-How did that happen?

717
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,120
North’s car has stopped.
Looks like a technical issue.

718
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,360
That’s really unfortunate.

719
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,040
Looks like North is out of the race.

720
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,920
Charlie and Willy are still battling it out.

721
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,760
Willy just overtook Charlie.

722
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,800
But Charlie’s not giving up!

723
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,560
He’s chasing back up.

724
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,480
Still neck and neck.

725
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,440
Willy manages to edge ahead into 2nd place!

726
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,320
But Charlie still isn’t giving in!

727
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,080
He’s pushing back up the middle!

728
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,040
Now entering the final stretch.

729
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,560
Who’s it gonna be—Charlie, Babe, or Willy?

730
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,760
It’s neck and neck till the end!

731
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,920
And they’ve crossed the finish line!

732
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,720
First place: Babe. Followed by Charlie,

733
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,240
and Willy from Team ETA.

734
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,360
Damn…

735
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,720
What about North?

736
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,240
-How’s North doing?
-He’ll be fine.

737
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,840
Charlie—why did you do that?

738
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,600
I didn’t do anything.

739
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,640
Charlie—

740
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,120
Why did you throw the race?

741
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,720
I didn’t throw the race.

742
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,240
I was following the plan.

743
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,560
Why are you getting mad at me?

744
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,880
Charlie.

745
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,040
You cut Willy off like that—

746
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,760
That was really dangerous.

747
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,840
You don’t have to worry about me.

748
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,560
I know exactly what I’m doing.

749
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,680
Charlie.

750
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,720
You could’ve passed me back there.

751
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,800
Why did you let me win?

752
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,560
Aren’t you mad at me?

753
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,800
I don’t want to fight. I’m taking a shower.

754
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,480
Charlie, wait. Listen to me.

755
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,840
Don’t you love me anymore?

756
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,640
Don’t you want to be with me?

757
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,160
I…

758
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,600
I still love you.

759
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
But right now, I need time.

760
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,480
Time? Time for what?

761
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,280
Charlie.

762
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,640
If you need time…

763
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,440
I can’t give it to you.

764
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,840
Charlie.

765
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,720
Just don’t leave…

766
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,480
I’ll give you everything.

767
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,160
Babe.

768
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,480
I didn’t throw the race.

769
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,360
It’s just… I’ve never been able to beat you.

770
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,080
I came because there’s something
I want to tell everyone.

771
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,320
What is it?

772
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,440
I’d like to resign from the team.

773
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,120
Why are you avoiding me?

774
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Are you hiding something from me?

775
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,720
That won’t work, Pit Babe.

776
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,280
I thought it was a love issue.

777
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,120
I can separate work from personal stuff.

778
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,360
Uncle, I think my condition’s getting worse.

779
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,800
Where are you right now?

780
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,560
Kid! Hey, kid!

781
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,400
Tony’s planning to take down
everyone around Charlie.

782
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,240
He’ll do whatever it takes

783
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,600
just to get Charlie.

784
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,400
-Use the seizure spell!
-Both feet, up!

785
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,440
Ow!

786
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,040
(Fully maxed out)

787
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,440
-Charlie, listen to me!
-Let go!

788
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,960
Whoa, whoa, calm down—damn, man!

789
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,960
(So much emotion)
Damn, man!

790
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,360
(Chill a bit, okay?)

791
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,640
(Babe?)
Babe! Babe!

792
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,440
(Wrong person, Uncle)
No, not me!

793
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,280
-Babe! Babe, follow him!
-Charlie!

794
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,720
(Don’t do that to P’Pel)
I’m going full swing this time.

795
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,080
Mmm.

796
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,120
-Cut!
-Go, go, go!

797
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,840
Hair’s gone.

798
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,240
Must’ve puffed out.

799
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
(Top, you’ve got this!)

800
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,760
(Give it your all!)
One more time!

801
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,600
At first I thought it’d be hard,
but it’s actually chill.
