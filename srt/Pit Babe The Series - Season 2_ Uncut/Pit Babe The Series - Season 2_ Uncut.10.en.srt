1
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,760
What do you want to keep me for?

2
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,400
Why don’t you hand me to Tony?

3
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,880
- Where did you hide Charlie?
- Getting anxious, huh?

4
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,960
I’ll wait for the next race.

5
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,880
As for how to deliver Charlie,

6
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,160
I’ll let you know later.

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Hey, I told you to take it off.

8
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Kenta’s playing hide and seek.

9
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,360
If Willy plans to trade Charlie on track,

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,200
I think we still
have a chance to get him back.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,560
- Tell me where Charlie is.
- Bring me something to trade.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,360
Trade with my fist first, bastard.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Dean, can you help hold him?

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Babe’s double-crossed us.

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,080
I couldn’t keep up with him.

16
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,680
- Otherwise, I’d have caught him...
- When will you stop bragging

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,880
and actually get it done?

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
I’m sorry.

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,960
I won’t mess up next time.

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,200
I’m tired of your excuses.

21
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,240
You’ve proven enough already.

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,400
That you’re just useless.

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,960
Nothing but pathetic.

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,520
You never win a fight.

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,880
Mr. Tony… I’m sorry.

26
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,520
Please, give me another chance.

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,240
Mr. Tony, please don’t kill me.

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Give me a chance

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,200
to prove I’m still useful to you, Mr. Tony.

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,600
If… you kill me now,
it’d be pointless anyway.

31
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,960
You don’t have a new
right-hand man anyway, right?

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,400
Let me keep serving you, Mr. Tony.

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,520
I’ll give you one more chance.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,280
If you still can’t bring me Charlie and Willy,

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,120
you know

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
what will happen, right?

37
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
Yes.

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
Come out.

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,079
Babe.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
Charlie.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,360
Babe, hey.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Come out here.

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
What are you planning?

44
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
I asked what are you planning?

45
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,040
Charlie.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Where’s the key?

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,399
Where’s the key?

48
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
If you want it, dig it out.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,960
Sit.

50
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,159
Sit.

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,240
Willy wants to trade me for his freedom.

52
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
Tony planted a chip inside Willy.

53
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,280
He uses it to control and track him.

54
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,200
That means

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,280
Tony’s men are on their way here.

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Yeah.

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
I don’t care if I have to die.

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,400
As long as you die with me.

59
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,480
Living under Tony is
no different than being dead.

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
You should know that, right?

61
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,480
You’ve been through his hands before.

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,240
Who said I’d let you die so easily?

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
There’s some substance in the capsule.

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,000
And we found a transmitter too.

65
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
What do you mean you didn’t find the body?

66
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,520
The crash was that severe.

67
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,440
Police and rescuers checked the whole area.

68
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,360
But found no one—just a burned car.

69
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,800
That’s impossible.

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,760
We all saw the cars crash.

71
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,920
If there’s no body, shouldn’t
there be someone injured at least?

72
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,159
We’re working hard to find them now.

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,440
When then? He’s my little brother.

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
Hey, you need to calm down first.

75
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,880
Hurry it up, please.

76
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,640
It’s okay, uncle.

77
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
We’ll find him.

78
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Calm down first, uncle.

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,960
If there’s no body,

80
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,760
doesn’t that mean he’s still alive?

81
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,360
Accept it.

82
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,680
I think Tony’s men hid the body.

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
To cover up the case.

84
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,160
Impossible.

85
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,760
In the end, if we can’t find the body,

86
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,120
we can still hold a funeral for Dean.

87
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,800
I said no.

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,120
If there’s no body,

89
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
that means he’s still alive.

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
Got it?

91
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Kid.

92
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,720
I’m sorry.

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,720
Alan.

94
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,880
I’m sorry, bro.

95
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Everything happened because of me.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If I hadn’t been captured,

97
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,000
Dean wouldn’t have been hurt.

98
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,240
Jeff.

99
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
It’s okay, bro. It’s okay.

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
It’s okay.

101
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,800
It’s okay.

102
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,720
I can’t go back to Paris now.

103
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
Not until I find my friend.

104
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
I’m sorry.

105
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
I’ll call you back.

106
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,160
Did I

107
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,600
interrupt you?

108
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,720
No.

109
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,840
I just called my friends over there.

110
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,000
Told them I’d delay my return to Paris.

111
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,640
You’re staying

112
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,240
because of Dean, right?

113
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
Mm.

114
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
I feel like

115
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,480
I’m the reason Dean had to make that choice.

116
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,680
I’m the one

117
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,280
who caused his death.

118
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,840
No.

119
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
In that moment,

120
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,480
it was a split-second crisis.

121
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,520
What Dean did then—

122
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,160
it was probably

123
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
because he wanted us to survive.

124
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,080
But he didn’t have to risk his life like that.

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
If it wasn’t because

126
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,400
I wanted him to prove himself…

127
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,840
You—

128
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,800
wanted him to prove himself?

129
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,280
Mm.

130
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,960
Yeah.

131
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,200
If I hadn’t misunderstood him from the start,

132
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,680
thought he’d betray X-Hunter again…

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,000
If I hadn’t pressured him…

134
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,400
But Dean almost killed Babe, you know.

135
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,840
I was going to have
Dean race instead of Charlie.

136
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,120
Was that really a good idea?

137
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,600
In this business,
everyone plays dirty—we know that.

138
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Especially people you know well—
they’re the least trustworthy.

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,280
Someone who’s messed up before—

140
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,280
how could I know he wouldn’t mess up again?

141
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,320
But he—

142
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,080
he wouldn’t risk his life like this

143
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,120
just to make the team believe

144
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,800
he wouldn’t betray us again.

145
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,160
Hey, Sonic.

146
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,600
Don’t blame yourself.

147
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
No one wanted this to happen.

148
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,680
I understand you.

149
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,520
Dean’s out of critical condition now.

150
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,920
But he’s still in a coma.

151
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
He probably won’t wake up soon.

152
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
It’s okay.

153
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,320
I don’t really want him to wake up anyway.

154
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,320
As long as he’s still breathing, that’s enough.

155
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,680
This is a simple job.

156
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,000
Don’t mess it up again.

157
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,120
Yes.

158
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,040
Are you okay?

159
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,800
Our matching ring…

160
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
You said I could wear it back anytime.

161
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,440
I’ve been waiting so long for the chance.

162
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,320
I’m sorry, Babe.

163
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,280
For misunderstanding you.

164
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,400
If you still want me…

165
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Could you put this ring back on me?

166
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,800
Of course, Charlie.

167
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,320
Come here.

168
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,680
I swear,

169
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,359
I’ll never take this ring off again.

170
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,200
Thank you so much.

171
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Thanks for still being here.

172
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,280
I’ll always be right here.

173
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,160
Babe, you didn’t have to do this.

174
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,320
Someone like Pitbabe

175
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
shouldn’t be doing something like this.

176
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,320
Why?

177
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,760
You don’t like it?

178
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
I do.

179
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,040
But I can do it myself.

180
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,400
I’m not even hurt or anything.

181
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,840
No need.

182
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,200
Try it.

183
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,920
This one?

184
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,080
Rabbit.

185
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,840
Charlie.

186
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,480
Mm.

187
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,000
I want to do this for you
since I never had the chance.

188
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,280
You’ve always taken care of me.

189
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,720
But this time,

190
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
I’ll take care of you.

191
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,240
How about we think about our future?

192
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,640
After we finish the League race,

193
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,600
and end all the mess Tony caused.

194
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,280
Let’s sneak away on a trip.

195
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,480
Like a honeymoon?

196
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,200
Something like that, yeah.

197
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,880
Or is there somewhere you want to go?

198
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,440
Honestly,

199
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,680
I haven’t thought that far ahead.

200
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,920
Making the skill-nullifying drug is one thing.

201
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,480
Getting rid of Tony is another.

202
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,280
Right now, we need to find out

203
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
how Tony came back after dying.

204
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,520
We need a way to end him

205
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,200
so he can’t come back again.

206
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,000
I’m worried about that too.

207
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,520
We need to find the answer

208
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,280
about what power Tony
has that brought him back.

209
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Could Tony be immortal?

210
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,840
No way.

211
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,200
Special abilities enhance skills.

212
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,560
But no ability can make someone immortal.

213
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,960
Say what you want to say.

214
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
I just…

215
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,800
don’t know what this is

216
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,960
between us.

217
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,040
- After we…
- After we kissed, you mean?

218
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,240
Aren’t you embarrassed

219
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,160
saying it out loud like that?

220
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,880
No wonder you and I never

221
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,760
move forward.

222
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Hey.

223
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,040
You know,

224
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,280
I used to think

225
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,240
we’d never work out together.

226
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
So I left this place.

227
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,080
Went to study abroad.

228
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
Found new things to do.

229
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,320
I thought I’d started over.

230
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,280
But when I came back here,

231
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
I realized

232
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,760
I was wrong.

233
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,800
I like you.

234
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
What did you just say?

235
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,880
I like you.

236
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,040
I thought I’d never hear those words from you.

237
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,240
So what now?

238
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,800
Are you still going back to Paris?

239
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,720
Of course.

240
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,880
I paid all that tuition, didn’t I?

241
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,080
If I don’t finish my degree,

242
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
I’ll regret wasting all that money.

243
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,680
So that means…

244
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,680
once you graduate,

245
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,000
I’ll come back here.

246
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,880
While I’m over there,

247
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,480
let’s try long-distance for now.

248
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
Mm.

249
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,760
Sonic.

250
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Is this far enough?

251
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,880
Farther.

252
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,720
Farther?

253
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,880
What about here—is it far enough?

254
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,000
Not yet.

255
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,680
Not yet?

256
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,480
- Then I’m gonna jump.
- Hey!

257
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,480
That’s enough!

258
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,760
Babe, let me teach you something.

259
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,480
People need a goal in life.

260
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,120
Your goal should be big, too.

261
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Big enough for your skills.

262
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,880
I’ve never done anything
but train these skills.

263
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,880
I don’t know what I want.

264
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,920
How about this:

265
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,840
When the time comes,
I’ll have you intern as my assistant.

266
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,760
Handle things for me.

267
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,160
- How’s that?
- I’d love that, Daddy.

268
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,040
You really mean it?

269
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,160
That depends on whether you prove

270
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,600
you’re worthy of the position.

271
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,760
Babe, I’m the one who created you.

272
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,320
You’ll never really escape me.

273
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,880
Hot Americano.

274
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,920
Would you like two extra shots?

275
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,080
I never forget how you like it.

276
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,480
Mr. Chris.

277
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,400
I’ve got a new idea for
improving our nullifying drug.

278
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
What is it?

279
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,720
I think we can make use of Willy.

280
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,520
Willy’s the only one of Tony’s experiments

281
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,200
that actually succeeded.

282
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,480
If we analyze Willy’s cells,

283
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,640
and think backwards,

284
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
we might find the answer

285
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,920
to creating the nullifying drug.

286
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,600
Sounds like it could work.

287
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,600
Then let’s get started.

288
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
What are you doing?

289
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,920
Just borrowing some of your blood.

290
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,360
I’m not giving it to you.

291
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,240
Sorry, I wasn’t asking.
You have no choice.

292
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,160
Doing this makes you no different from Tony.

293
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,000
Seeing people as lab rats
for your crazy drugs.

294
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I know you hate Tony too.

295
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,880
So you should tell us how he came back.

296
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,120
Didn’t you say Charlie’s so smart?

297
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,400
If he’s so smart, let him figure it out.

298
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,720
What are you doing?

299
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,720
No—hey, ow!

300
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,280
I’m at the practice track.

301
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,720
Practice track.

302
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
What are you doing there now?

303
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,520
And why did you go alone without telling me?

304
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,680
I’m just checking on a few things.

305
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,120
I’ll head back soon.

306
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,760
I told you not to overdo it.

307
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,640
You need to take care of your health.

308
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,920
Come home soon. I’m waiting for you.

309
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,320
Okay.

310
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,880
I’ll head back right now.

311
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,920
Hey.

312
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,760
You’ve got guts coming here.

313
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,640
Calm down, old man.

314
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,440
At your age,

315
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,960
if you get too mad…

316
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,160
you might burst a blood vessel.

317
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
You…

318
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,880
See? I barely finished my sentence.

319
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,280
I came to you today

320
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,200
not to pick a fight—but to make you an offer.

321
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,200
Keep your offer.

322
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,560
I don’t want anything from you people.

323
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,080
Are you sure

324
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,800
you don’t want to hear
what I have to say first?

325
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,560
This offer

326
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,800
might just concern Dean’s life.

327
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,720
What does Dean

328
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,880
have to do with this?

329
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
Dean.

330
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,840
You should actually thank me, you know.

331
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,080
I’m the one who brought his body back.

332
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
That’s why he’s still breathing today.

333
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Bring Dean back right now.

334
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,240
I will.

335
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,400
If you do what I say.

336
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,760
What do you want?

337
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,440
Charlie’s blood.

338
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,280
No way.

339
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,280
Tony and I don’t want to kill him.

340
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,000
We just need his blood
for our drug experiments.

341
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,000
You people only want that?

342
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,000
I’ll never believe that.

343
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,040
Well… I get it,

344
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,880
why you wouldn’t trust me.

345
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,200
The bad blood from the past…

346
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,000
just let it go already.

347
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,440
Someone who’s cheated death like Tony—

348
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,600
he doesn’t care about those things anymore.

349
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Oh,

350
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,360
Tony also promised

351
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,200
that if his drug experiment succeeds,

352
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,080
he’ll leave X-Hunter alone.

353
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,080
Everyone goes their own way.

354
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,560
And

355
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,480
no one loses anything.

356
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,000
Think about it.

357
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,080
Spacing out? You’re up early today, old man.

358
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,480
No.

359
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,600
I’m just lost in thought.

360
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,240
So, you really don’t want me
to come with you to the hospital?

361
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,960
Wait a bit. I’ll finish showering soon.

362
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,200
It’s okay.

363
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,240
I want to handle this on my own.

364
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,920
How about this—

365
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,280
come cheer me up on the day
of my surgery instead.

366
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,720
Okay?

367
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Alright, that works.

368
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,480
When you get to the hospital,

369
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,120
don’t forget to text me.

370
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,880
Okay.

371
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,120
I’ll cooperate with you guys.

372
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,680
But I have a condition.

373
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,400
What is it?

374
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,000
You have to inject me
with the skill-enhancing drug.

375
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Unbelievable.

376
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,520
That you’d dare volunteer as my test subject.

377
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,240
Who said that?

378
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,800
I just want my body back

379
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,880
to full strength, that’s all.

380
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,480
Fine.

381
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,960
Whatever your reason is,

382
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,760
since we’ve made a deal,

383
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,600
once you get my drug,

384
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,000
make sure you keep your promise.

385
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,719
You’ve reached the voicemail system.

386
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,920
Don’t overthink it.

387
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,840
Are you ready?

388
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,120
Getting scared?

389
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,960
But it’s too late now.

390
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
Let’s begin.

391
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,239
Okay.

392
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,480
Increase the enhancer dosage.

393
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,640
Ready.

394
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,200
Ten percent.

395
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Thirty percent.

396
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,040
Forty percent.

397
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,680
Fifty percent.

398
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,480
Sixty percent.

399
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,480
Seventy percent.

400
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,360
Eighty percent.

401
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
Ninety percent.

402
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
One hundred percent.

403
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,360
Charlie.

404
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Charlie.

405
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,680
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

406
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,200
Charlie.

407
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,360
What’s wrong?

408
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,720
Babe.

409
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,280
I think Tony

410
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,280
has created another person

411
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
with special powers.

412
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
Hey.

413
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,360
Hey.

414
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
Are you still there?

415
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,480
Hey.

416
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,320
Hey.

417
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,280
Hey, grab him!

418
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,120
Alan’s experiment

419
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,360
responded very well to our drug.

420
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,960
Even though he was just an ordinary person.

421
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,200
But his potential

422
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,720
is on par with an Alpha like Willy.

423
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,360
So I think

424
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,800
if we unlock our full potential,

425
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,920
who knows—

426
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,760
we might surpass Willy.

427
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,400
- Let me go!
- Don’t pull!

428
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,560
Let me go!

429
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
Let go!

430
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,800
- Let me go!
- Don’t do anything stupid.

431
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,920
You should know there’s a chip inside you now.

432
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,680
Chip?

433
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,000
Did you really think I’d let you leave this lab

434
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,480
without something to keep you on a leash?

435
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,120
And don’t think you can remove it easily

436
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,280
like when you helped Willy.

437
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,560
Hello?

438
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,920
Hello, I’m a nurse from
the orthopedic surgery department

439
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,280
at TV Hospital.

440
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,640
Are you the relative of the patient named

441
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,120
Khematat Tulphisaan?

442
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,920
He’s my boyfriend. Is something wrong?

443
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,280
He missed today’s pre-surgery
consultation with the doctor.

444
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,560
We’d like to know when he wants to reschedule.

445
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Surgery?

446
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,400
I’ll have Alan call you back.

447
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,840
- Sorry.
- We checked the hospital.

448
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,800
There’s no sign of him there.

449
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,880
Even the CCTV didn’t catch him.

450
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,720
He definitely wasn’t there.

451
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,080
Did you reach him yet, Jeff?

452
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
No, nothing at all.

453
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,760
- Hey, uncle!
- Whoa!

454
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,360
- Uncle!
- What?

455
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,880
Uncle!

456
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
- Alan!
- Uncle!

457
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,520
Uncle!

458
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,840
Where did you go, uncle?

459
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,520
Why couldn’t we reach you?

460
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,680
I went to see a doctor.

461
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,560
See?

462
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
Doctor visit.

463
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,760
But the hospital called
saying you never showed up.

464
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,480
It was traditional Chinese medicine.

465
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,080
A friend recommended
a specialist from another hospital.

466
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,120
I got new meds now.

467
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,880
My condition will slowly improve.

468
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,080
And I don’t need surgery anymore.

469
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,120
Why didn’t you tell us, uncle?

470
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,200
You disappeared and everyone was worried.

471
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,160
Well, I wasn’t sure myself.

472
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,080
I just wanted to try it first.

473
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,680
Didn’t expect it to work this well.

474
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,880
Sorry, everyone.

475
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
For making you worry.

476
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,960
Especially you.

477
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,360
I’m sorry, kid.

478
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,000
But I really am feeling better now.

479
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,680
Please don’t do that again, okay?

480
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,080
Mm.

481
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,160
I had Chris run tests on Willy’s blood.

482
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,600
Turns out Willy’s cells really are abnormal.

483
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,800
But we still don’t know how it happened.

484
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,600
Was it because of the drug

485
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,400
they injected into him?

486
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,640
I think so.

487
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,040
If we had more data on the drug,

488
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,280
we might learn something more.

489
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Then we’ll have to ask someone
who was experimented on.

490
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,000
Fake medical records about your treatment.

491
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,600
You planned this well, didn’t you?

492
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,720
If you’re going to fool your own people,

493
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,160
you need believable evidence.

494
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,560
It’s time you kept your end of the deal.

495
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,000
Bring me Charlie’s blood.

496
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,920
You spent a long time in Tony’s lab.

497
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,080
You must’ve seen something.

498
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,320
Why should I help you?

499
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,480
I saw the mark behind your ear.

500
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,120
What do you mean by that?

501
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,760
I think Alan went to see Tony.

502
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,720
Within three days, bring me Charlie’s blood.

503
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,320
If Charlie’s blood doesn’t reach me,

504
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,760
all your little brothers die.

505
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,440
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

506
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,840
I think it’s time to tell everyone.

507
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,160
I’m Way’s twin brother.

508
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,760
Wait—

509
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,600
Who are you?

510
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,080
Just want to borrow some blood.

511
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,640
I won’t let you.

512
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Ow, it hurts!

513
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
Not so hard!
(I won’t resist anymore.)

514
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,920
- Last time.
- Ow!

515
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,960
Owwww, me—
(Is this private?)

516
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,520
(Reporting in.)

517
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,440
(Paying it back.)

518
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,680
- When you twisted it—
- Did it work?

519
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,800
- When you twisted it—
- Should we change the camera?

520
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,080
- Did it hurt?
- Yeah.

521
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,360
- You have to bear it.
- Ow!
