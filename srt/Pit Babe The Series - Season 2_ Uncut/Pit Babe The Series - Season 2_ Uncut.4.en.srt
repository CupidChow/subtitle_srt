1
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,680
Think about it properly, okay?

2
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,120
What does "boyfriend" even mean to you?

3
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,800
But right now your boyfriend isn’t here.

4
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,440
Want me to look after you for now?

5
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,240
Why didn’t you tell me
he's still flirting with you off the field?

6
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,320
-Is this edible?
-I’m not picky at all.

7
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,039
If it won’t kill me, I’ll eat it.

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
You’ve got this, trust me.

9
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,080
Tony’s back.

10
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,800
I couldn’t see his face,
just that he drove with one hand.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,680
I think it was Willy who ran into me.

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,800
I feel like I’ve lost my intuition.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,200
Charlie’s brainwaves while asleep

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,680
are now close to normal Data Wave levels.

15
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,640
It could mean
Charlie’s powers are really gone.

16
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,639
Maybe.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
So it's not 100% certain?

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Not yet.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,680
We’ll have to monitor him a bit longer.

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,520
We also need to wait for Charlie to wake up
so we can run the test again.

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Another test?

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
What are you testing now?

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,640
So when exactly is Charlie waking up?
He’s been out for like 4 or 5 hours.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,680
Don’t worry.
Charlie’s vitals are totally normal.

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
Normal? You call this normal?

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,640
Calm down, Babe.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,480
What if Charlie never wakes up?
Who's gonna take responsibility?

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,280
Is he just a lab rat to you guys?

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Babe.

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Charlie.

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,880
Charlie, are you okay?

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
You look shocked.

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,840
Of course I’m shocked.

34
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,600
You were out for so long.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
I was seriously worried about you.

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,880
So, are you guys done talking?

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,480
If you are, would you please leave?
I’ve got work to do.

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Stop.

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,440
I’m not letting Charlie be a lab rat anymore.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
Did you hear that, Pete?

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Babe.

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,400
Babe, please listen to me.

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,200
The experiment’s not that dangerous, okay?

44
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,680
You know how serious
I am about this project.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,160
I’m sure it’s going to work.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,840
What if you take the drug and never wake up?

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,520
That’s enough, Charlie.

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,680
You know Tony’s back now.

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,600
He’s not going to let us off the hook.

50
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,280
If we succeed with the skill-erasing drug…

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,360
No one can take advantage of us ever again.

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,800
Just give me a little more time.

53
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Alright then.

54
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
I don’t want you to do it,
but if you really want to…

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,320
Then do it right.

56
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Got it?

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,040
Mama’s the cutest ever.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,360
Don’t even start.

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,960
What?

60
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,000
Don’t give me that cute face.

61
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,159
Charlie.

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
If this happens again next time,

63
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,240
I won’t let you do it again, okay?

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,520
Yes. I promise.

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,120
Charlie’s awake now.

66
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,680
Yeah, he called and told me.

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,640
Should we go home?
Everyone else already left.

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,480
I’ll finish this paperwork first.

69
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,960
I can do it. You should use
your time for something else.

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
It’s alright.

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,520
I know you’re still mad at me.

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,080
What do I have to do for you to forgive me?

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
No need.

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,600
Just leave it. It’ll go away on its own.

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm trying to fix this, okay?

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,840
Please cooperate, Uncle.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Oh.

78
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,120
What happened?

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,560
(Let’s make up, Uncle.)

80
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,320
Hey, kid.

81
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,320
Did you hack my computer?

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,920
Well, you just kept
sulking and wouldn’t talk to me.

83
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,120
So, are you ready to stop being mad?

84
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,480
I’ve said sorry like a hundred times.

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,920
Still not good enough?

86
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,640
Let me ask you something.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
Do you even know what I’m mad at you about?

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,640
Uncle, wait— Uncle!

89
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,159
Uncle!

90
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,000
So what’s going on with you?

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,760
Is it about Alan again?

92
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Jeff.

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
If you still see Alan as your boyfriend,

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,080
then I think he deserves
to know everything about you.

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,640
I don’t want Alan to know about this.

96
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,960
What are you so afraid of?

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It’s just…

98
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,040
I…

99
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,360
I don’t think I’ll get to stay with Alan anymore.

100
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,920
But I really think Alan deserves to know.

101
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,000
He might get hurt.

102
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,160
Hurt by what you saw.

103
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,560
But at least you wouldn’t have to carry it alone.

104
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,600
And if it’s really going to happen…

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,200
I think Alan has the right to know.

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
Relationships are between two people.

107
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Whether good or…

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,679
It should be a decision you make together.

109
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
You get that, right, Jeff?

110
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Please don’t.

111
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
I don’t want to see your future.

112
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,560
I’m sorry.

113
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
I didn’t tell you…

114
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
that my future-sensing ability came back.

115
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
But I want you to know for sure…

116
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,680
that from now on,
I won’t keep anything from you.

117
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,840
Can you forgive me?

118
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,280
This isn’t something small, you know.

119
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,280
It’s about trust.

120
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
At first…

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,040
I thought I could live
with the power inside me.

122
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,720
Who would've thought

123
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
it was a ticking time bomb?

124
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,480
You know what, Uncle?

125
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,240
Do you know why I never told you…

126
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,520
what I saw in our future?

127
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,040
Because the vision I saw…

128
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
was that in the end…

129
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,200
we might not stay together.

130
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
That’s why…

131
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
I didn’t want to talk about it with you, Uncle.

132
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,680
But even knowing that…

133
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,480
you’re still gonna stay with me, right?

134
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Whether we know it or not…

135
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,920
whatever the future holds—

136
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,600
we’re still together today.

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
You’re not alone anymore, kid.

138
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,040
No matter what happens,

139
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
I’ll always be by your side.

140
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,200
Oh, hey Babe.

141
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
You work out at this gym too?

142
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
I could be your sparring partner.

143
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,800
What?

144
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
I could spar with you, if you want.

145
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
No need.

146
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,920
I haven’t even settled the score from last time.

147
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
What did I do to you?

148
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Oh, come on.

149
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,480
Weren’t you the one who ran me over?

150
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,880
Come on.

151
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,120
Sure, we’re rivals…

152
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,000
but only on the field.

153
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,440
Why would I do something like that to you?

154
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
The person who hit me…

155
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,200
was using their right hand.

156
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,160
And they drove one-handed.

157
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,840
Don’t you think that’s kind of weird?

158
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,920
That’s exactly how you drive.

159
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,960
It was just a coincidence, that’s all.

160
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,680
I was training
with the team the day you got hit.

161
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,680
If you don’t believe me, check my IG.

162
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,840
I already followed you too.

163
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
So, about sparring—what do you say?

164
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Sounds good.

165
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,440
I’ve been wanting to punch your face anyway.

166
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,120
Even with all that sweat, you still smell nice.

167
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
Hey, let go.

168
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,840
You win, Babe.

169
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
Did you just let me win?

170
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Let you? Who, me?

171
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,760
You’re totally imagining things again.

172
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
You held back just now, didn’t you?

173
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
Because you saw my arm was hurt.

174
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
Don’t you want to be number one?

175
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,640
If you wanna be a real racer,

176
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,280
you better take care of your body.

177
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,200
Wow, are you worried about me, Babe?

178
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
No.

179
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,120
Just think of it as advice from a senior.

180
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,080
And hey, I’m sorry for misjudging you.

181
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,440
I checked already.

182
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,680
I saw that you really were
with the team that day.

183
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,200
Thanks for trusting me.

184
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
Thank you, Babe.

185
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Jeff.

186
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,160
What do you think about this?

187
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
Are you proposing?

188
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,560
Why are you saying it so loud?

189
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
Are you serious about this?

190
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,040
Let me see.

191
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,200
Who’s trying to propose to my boyfriend?

192
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,560
What’s your deal, Charlie?

193
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,160
Are you proposing to Babe?

194
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,360
I just bought a matching ring for Babe.

195
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,600
If it’s a wedding ring for Babe,

196
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,800
it better be prettier.

197
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,280
And more expensive.

198
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
So it’ll be worthy of Babe.

199
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,640
You said all that just to brag
about your man, huh?

200
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
Honestly,

201
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,440
Babe doesn’t really care that much.

202
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,760
Whatever ring it is, he’d still marry you.

203
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,720
You two have been together
for a year already, right?

204
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
Getting married wouldn’t be a bad idea.

205
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,360
But isn’t one year a bit too soon?

206
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,880
Kid, this is Pit Babe we’re talking about.

207
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,040
If you’ve made it past a year,
that means you’ve got him under control.

208
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
Come on, Charlie. Be bold.

209
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
You don’t need to hype me up.

210
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,480
I’ve already planned everything
when to propose and all.

211
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,160
If I succeed with the skill-erasing drug,

212
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,480
and it helps those with powers—

213
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,800
I’m definitely asking him to marry me.

214
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,440
Don’t take too long
or someone else might snatch him.

215
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

216
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,600
Babe already has a guard dog like me.

217
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
No one’s getting near him.

218
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,800
It’s rare to see Charlie at a loss like this.
Kind of nice, actually.

219
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,240
It’s funny.

220
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Hey.

221
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Instead of minding their business…

222
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,720
They’re already
at the stage of buying rings, you know?

223
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,520
And us…

224
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,760
We’ve already talked about our future, right?

225
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,920
So now…

226
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,440
Should we take things to the next level?

227
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,440
Uncle, this is already the max.

228
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
What level are you trying to reach?

229
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Look—

230
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,160
Matching bracelets aren’t enough anymore.

231
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,480
They’ve got rings, so we should too.

232
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,200
Don’t you dare.

233
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,720
Don’t you dare propose to me here.

234
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,240
Not when I look this rough.

235
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,200
It’s not like I’d say no.

236
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,520
Then why?

237
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,360
I just want to wait
until the skill-erasing drug works.

238
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,760
I want to be close to you, Uncle.

239
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,680
To hold hands, touch, hug—

240
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,160
without being afraid of seeing anything again.

241
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,640
I really do want to marry you.

242
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,480
But… can you wait for me?

243
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,200
Then… I’ll take that as a promise.

244
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Once the drug is complete—

245
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,360
there’s no way I’m letting you say no.

246
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,440
You’re still here?

247
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,680
And you? You’re still here too?

248
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,240
Standing there watching me isn’t helping me
finish my work any faster.

249
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
Then… how about grabbing dinner with me?

250
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,560
No. You go ahead.

251
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,680
You know what?

252
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,240
You should eat something
nutritious once in a while.

253
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,280
Tell me what you want, I’ll order it for you.

254
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,360
In that case, I’ve changed my mind.

255
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,440
You’ve been working me this hard…

256
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,680
I deserve a decent meal.

257
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,160
I shouldn’t be eating boxed food
or bland leftovers.

258
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,760
I think…

259
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,840
if you really want to treat me to dinner,

260
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,520
you should put in a little more effort.

261
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
After you.

262
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
I’m really passionate about this sport.

263
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,320
It helps me focus.

264
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,880
That’s why I built this place.

265
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,600
Sometimes I use it for meetings.

266
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,280
But mostly, I come here alone.

267
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
You’re the first guest in years.

268
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,560
Have a seat.

269
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,240
Thank you.

270
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,240
I was wondering…

271
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,800
what’s going through your mind…

272
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,440
eating with someone
who looks just like your ex.

273
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Way’s not my ex.

274
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,600
He wasn’t my boyfriend.

275
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,000
Just someone I used to know.

276
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,800
So that means…

277
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,840
you and Way only knew each other?

278
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,560
Was it because you got
the sponsorship from X-Hunter?

279
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,760
I’ve known him since his days
with the Chen family.

280
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,200
But he never saw me before.

281
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,440
Because I ran away from that house first.

282
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,280
So Way ended up as the only Enigma—

283
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,600
the one Tony manipulated and used.

284
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,240
He carried the whole burden in my place.

285
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
Tony was really that scary to you?

286
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,720
That terrifying?

287
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,600
You probably can’t imagine it.

288
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,280
How cruel someone like Tony can actually be.

289
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,800
Even though he wanted
everyone to call him "Daddy"…

290
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,440
he never even treated
the kids in that house as people.

291
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,840
Then you were lucky to escape, weren’t you?

292
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Yeah.

293
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,560
Luckier than a lot of kids
who never got the chance.

294
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,080
That’s why I don’t want Tony
to hurt anyone ever again.

295
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,480
And I want you to help me finish
the skill-erasing drug.

296
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,800
Let’s eat.

297
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,480
Are you drunk, Pete?

298
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,280
Hey, hey, hey!

299
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Where are you going?

300
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,240
Don’t look at me like that.

301
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
I’m just doing my job too.

302
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,520
What if you run into Tony? Then what?

303
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,120
I’m going to see Pete.

304
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Move.

305
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,080
You’re going to see Pete?

306
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
What for?

307
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,520
It’s urgent, alright?

308
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,400
So don’t get in my way.

309
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,280
I don’t want to use force.

310
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,080
Why is force always your go-to?

311
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Is that all you know how to use?

312
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
Okay, okay, okay.

313
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,280
You’re really set on going?

314
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
Fine, I’ll take you myself.

315
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,840
No need, I can go alone.

316
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,360
I’m trying to help
and you still want to go alone?

317
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
Then how exactly are you planning to get there?

318
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,680
You gonna hail a taxi
and let Tony’s guys know where you are?

319
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,880
-Come on, let’s go.
-What are you doing?

320
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,120
What are you even doing?

321
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
Go.

322
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Thanks for the ride.

323
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,040
Have some hot tea.

324
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,400
It’ll help sober you up.

325
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,360
Earlier you…

326
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,640
used up quite a bit of energy.

327
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,280
Are you hungry?

328
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,240
If you’re trying to invite me for round two…

329
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Just say it straight up.

330
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,520
No need to be shy about it.

331
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,080
Go open the door first.

332
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,160
Way…

333
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
That’s not Way.

334
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,800
Just someone who looks like him.

335
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,160
He’s one of my lab researchers.

336
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

337
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,480
Does it have to be right now?

338
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
It’s about that person.

339
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,320
Sorry about this.

340
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,080
I’ll clear things up with you later.

341
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,920
It’s fine. You don’t owe me anything.

342
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,360
Just go handle your business.

343
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,960
I’ll be going now.

344
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So what’s this about, Kenta?

345
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,840
I wanted to take you
to look for clues on Tony.

346
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,600
Is this the area where you saw Tony?

347
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,960
This is where they dumped me.

348
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
But I remember some of it.

349
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,640
The entrance to
where Tony is should be nearby.

350
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,760
You think we’re gonna find
anything in a place like this?

351
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,280
We’ve come this far already.

352
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,160
I want to look around a bit.

353
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,080
You really want to go in without a plan?

354
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,720
We don’t know
where Tony might’ve set traps.

355
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
We’ve got no weapons. That’s suicide.

356
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,040
Is there something wrong?

357
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,840
Why are you parked here?

358
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
What are you waiting for?

359
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,840
What would I be waiting for?

360
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,800
And what’s it got to do with you?

361
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,080
You gonna answer properly?

362
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,760
Say it.

363
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,840
I’m just here to drop something off.

364
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,840
They told me to meet them here.
Should be here soon.

365
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,480
Kenta, come look at this.

366
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,880
Wait here.

367
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
What is it?

368
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,480
Hey!

369
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,239
Where are you going?

370
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,480
Hey!

371
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,520
This is the same compound
we used in the skill-erasing drug trials.

372
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Does that mean…

373
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,960
Tony is testing the same kind of drug?

374
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,560
That’s impossible.

375
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,360
Tony would do anything
to find Alpha kids with powers.

376
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,800
He’d never let their powers disappear—
not if he’s planning to sell them.

377
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Yeah.

378
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,160
But we shouldn’t underestimate
someone like Tony.

379
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,800
No one ever knows what he’ll do next.

380
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
Right now, we don’t even know where Tony is.

381
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,640
Still can’t pinpoint his location.

382
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,160
I had you track him,
but there was nothing.

383
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
But one thing’s certain—

384
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,640
they must have a lab running
the same experiments as us.

385
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,160
I’ll send someone to dig
around the researchers he hired.

386
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,640
But will that be fast enough?

387
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,000
We don’t even know
how far into the trials he is.

388
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,400
You don’t need to worry about that.

389
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,240
When it comes to experimentation—

390
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,640
I’m confident no cell researcher out there

391
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,160
is ahead of me.

392
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,280
You’re really that confident?

393
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,160
When it comes to research—yes.

394
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Hey—

395
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,640
Kid.

396
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,480
Tony’s not making a skill-erasing drug.

397
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,000
He’s making a drug to enhance skills.

398
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,720
The response is positive.

399
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,720
The skill levels keep rising.

400
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,360
-What’s going on?
-Hurry, just a bit more.

401
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,200
Watch your step, okay?

402
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,520
Right side, right side, right side!

403
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,760
This way?

404
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,320
Here—right here.

405
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Are you ready?

406
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Ready!

407
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,120
Three… two… one.

408
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,080
Charlie…

409
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,160
Happy Birthday, Mama.

410
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,720
Make a wish, quick!

411
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
Will you accept this matching ring?

412
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,080
Mama, marry Papa.

413
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Hold on a second.

414
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,120
It’s not a wedding ring.

415
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Wait, what?

416
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,720
As for marriage,
I’m still looking for the best for you.

417
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
But for now—

418
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,320
just take this matching ring.

419
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,120
No matter what you wished for this year—

420
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,880
I’ll stay by your side…

421
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,440
until your wish comes true.

422
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,480
You don’t have to do anything.

423
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,080
Because it’s definitely coming true.

424
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Mama wished Papa
would stay with her forever.

425
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,480
Thank you, Papa.

426
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,600
This birthday—

427
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,000
is the best one I’ve ever had.

428
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,440
Let’s stay together forever.

429
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,600
I will, Mama.

430
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,880
I’ve been handling most of the work.

431
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,160
I take care of things for Mr. Tony.

432
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,360
You can speak to me directly, Minister.

433
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Of course.

434
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,040
Good day, Minister.

435
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,600
Good day, Mr. Tony.

436
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,320
I honestly didn’t think
you’d make it out alive.

437
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,960
There are still plenty of miracles
in this world, Minister.

438
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,360
But right now—

439
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,680
there’s no more Chen Foundation.

440
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,560
You can still find Alpha kids
with powers for me, right?

441
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
I heard from Manit…

442
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,920
you’ve got a new project going on?

443
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,960
Is that true?

444
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,520
This time, I’ve got something
even more interesting than Alpha kids.

445
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,880
But I’ll need your cooperation, Minister.

446
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,680
We may need to continue
this conversation in private.

447
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,080
I trust you, you know?

448
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,200
But I’d like you to speed things up a bit—

449
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,080
I want to put your people to work.

450
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,320
Excuse me for a moment.

451
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,880
Of course.

452
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,280
Manit.

453
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Yes, Minister?

454
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,920
Get back and oversee CS.

455
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,400
Recruit as many people
into the project as you can.

456
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,520
Just have Winner stay here
and watch over me alone.

457
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,720
I’ve transferred the bitcoin to you.

458
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Ah.

459
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,160
Pardon me, Minister.

460
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,080
I think what I’ve done for you…

461
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,480
deserves more than that.

462
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,240
I just wanted to give you a little reminder.

463
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,960
Don’t forget—

464
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,080
I’m the one who saved you

465
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,720
when you were on the brink of death.

466
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,760
Brought you back to health.

467
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
So I think all that land in Phuket…

468
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,600
shouldn’t be too much to ask.

469
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,920
I don’t have a problem with that.

470
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,720
You’ve done quite a lot for me.

471
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,120
Thank you, Minister.

472
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,360
-Understood.
-And also…

473
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,440
If that’s the case…

474
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Yes.

475
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,560
Get ready.

476
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,680
The real game is about to begin.

477
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,400
But I’m done being
stuck in the friend zone.

478
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,480
I’m moving on—finding something new.

479
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,840
You’re not gonna betray me, right?

480
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,920
Heartbroken over Pete?

481
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,080
Or still secretly in love with him?

482
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,560
I can give you the number one spot.

483
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,840
You don’t actually like Willy, do you?

484
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,720
I didn’t want the photo—he pulled me in.

485
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,440
Don’t joke like that.

486
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,320
I’m being serious.

487
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
It’s like feeling guilty, but not really—

488
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,960
Not guilty at all. (Not feeling anything.)

489
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,640
(A ring for PelPel.)

490
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,440
(PelPel went all out.)

491
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,320
(A surprise gift!)

492
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,040
(Sweet to the max.)
