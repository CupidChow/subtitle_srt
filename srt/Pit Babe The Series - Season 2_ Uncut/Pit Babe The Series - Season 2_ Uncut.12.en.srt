1
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,760
Marry me.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
You’ve been at Tony’s lab long enough.
You must’ve seen something.

3
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,080
From what I remember,
the shot’s linked to Tony’s blood.

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,960
You’ve got three days
to bring me Charlie’s blood.

5
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,720
I’ll get it done.
But you’ve gotta let Dean and Kenta go.

6
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,400
Alan

7
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,039
Charlie

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,759
Who are you?

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,400
Get the blood to the researchers.

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Once they verify it,
you’d better stick to your word.

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,400
Release Dean and Kenta.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,160
Get the blood to the researchers.

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,440
Make sure it’s really Charlie’s.

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,920
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
Check it thoroughly.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,040
Because if it’s not—

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,919
You’re dead.

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
Once they verify it—

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,960
It’s your turn to keep your word.

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Let Dean and Kenta go.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
Easy now.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,120
I always mean what I say.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,560
If things go as planned,

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,280
when I say I’ll release them, I will.

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,480
You think Charlie’s blood

26
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,800
is worth trading for Dean and Kenta?

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,480
There’s one more thing

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,680
you’ve gotta do for me.

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
What?

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,640
Do whatever it takes

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,680
to make Babe crawl back to me.

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,520
No way.

33
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,200
I won’t let Babe get dragged
into your dirty game.

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,800
You might as well just kill me.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,040
You think you can say no to me?

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,320
You’ve got no choice, man.

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,360
You’ll never escape my control.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,960
Or are you gonna tell the boys

39
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,079
you betrayed them all?

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
Tony, sir.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,920
This blood sample is 100% Charlie’s.

42
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
Good.

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,440
Then...

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me give you a little reward.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,200
How about I take you
to see that kid in a coma?

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,079
Sound good?

47
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,240
Uncle?

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,280
Uncle?

49
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Are you in the bathroom?

50
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
Where’ve you been?

51
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,640
You didn’t come home last night?

52
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh, no.

53
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,840
I woke up early and went out for a run.

54
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,520
A run?

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,159
In that outfit?

56
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
You can run in anything, right?

57
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,159
Didn’t feel like changing again.

58
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
You’re just in time.

59
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,120
Have you eaten yet?

60
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,760
I haven’t prepped anything yet.

61
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
You hungry?

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,280
Then let’s eat out today.

64
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
Sure. I’ll hop in the shower first.

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,080
I’ll wait downstairs.

66
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,400
Mm.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,960
Don’t worry, Charlie.

68
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,560
I’m giving you the full tour today.

69
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,920
I moved in here without Jeff?

70
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
Sure did.

71
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
You made that choice yourself, man.

72
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,320
No one forced you.

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
And there was a time

74
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,080
I had to come get you back too.

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,280
Charlie.

76
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Come on.

77
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
This is your work corner.

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
You liked sitting here—
and that’s your laptop.

79
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,720
This one’s the chill zone.

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,760
When you were swamped,

81
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,760
you’d eat right here while working.

82
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,280
And when we first met—

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
you were working as an editor.

84
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,280
This is the kitchen area.

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
You used to love cooking, Charlie.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,600
Plates go right here.

87
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,560
Bowls and all that—right here.

88
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Spices go here.

89
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,400
And all the kitchen tools go here.

90
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh.

91
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,760
Uh…

92
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,480
I don’t usually do this stuff.

93
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,480
It’s more your thing.

94
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,000
But yeah, around here.

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
Oh—

96
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,280
Come here.

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,600
Whoa.

98
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,400
All these trophies— they’re all yours?

99
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
Yeah.

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,880
To be honest—

101
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,360
they’re both ours.

102
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
Charlie,

103
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,800
I know you don’t remember,

104
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
but can I ask for one thing?

105
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,440
Don’t call me “Khun.”

106
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,800
Call me “P’Babe.”

107
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,360
I just didn’t expect—

108
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,160
you—wait...

109
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,480
P’Babe.

110
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,600
—such a badass racer.

111
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,320
Honestly, I kinda wanna try racing too.

112
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Seems pretty exciting.

113
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,480
Charlie—

114
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,760
You actually are a racer.

115
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
And not just any racer—an elite one.

116
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,120
You just don’t remember.

117
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
Wait—

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
You’re not joking, right, P’Babe?

119
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,280
I’m not joking.

120
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
We met at the racetrack.

121
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,720
Back then, I even taught you how to drive.

122
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
And how was I... back then?

123
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,120
Well, back then—

124
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,440
this little puppy Charlie

125
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,920
came running to P’Babe

126
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,840
bugging me every single day.

127
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,520
If I try this—

128
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,480
maybe it’ll jog your memory.

129
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,920
Remember this?

130
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Wanna try it on?

131
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Can I really wear it?

132
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,760
Of course.

133
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,360
This one’s yours, man.

134
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,920
See, Charlie?

135
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
How’s it feel?

136
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Did it come back to you?

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,560
It’s okay.

138
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,680
Wanna go check out something cooler?

139
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,600
Yeah, let’s go.

140
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,200
Whoa.

141
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
Oh—this is P’Alan, owner of the garage.

142
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,960
Hi there.

143
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360
He’s also the team leader.

144
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
And Jeff’s boyfriend.

145
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,760
Jeff’s boyfriend.

146
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,680
Hey, Charlie!

147
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,160
You’re better now?
Didn’t think you’d show up here.

148
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,400
Who’s that, bro?

149
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,480
That’s North.

150
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
And Sonic.

151
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
These two right here—

152
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,080
they’re a couple.

153
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,440
Right? Or not yet?

154
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,760
Not yet, bro.

155
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
P’Babe—

156
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
you’re actually right.

157
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Sonic and I are officially a thing.

158
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
Charlie, meet Sonic—my boyfriend.

159
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,760
Oh, don’t listen to him too much.

160
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,000
- Such a show-off.
- Hey, P’Babe!

161
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
And this here—

162
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,600
the car you always used for training.

163
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
Wanna take it for a spin?

164
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,800
Can I really drive it?

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,280
Of course.

166
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,720
You’re not just messing with me,
about me being a racer?

167
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,120
Wanna try it?

168
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,080
Hop in and see.

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
Mama...

170
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
What did you just say, Charlie?

171
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,440
Mama?

172
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
You remembered something?

173
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,880
Remembered what?

174
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,680
Mama.

175
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
It just popped into my head.

176
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,760
That’s a good sign, bro.

177
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,640
Charlie’s starting to recall things.

178
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
Even if his mind forgets,

179
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,960
the body still remembers what feels familiar.

180
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,800
I just wish he’d remember more.

181
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,440
Hey, Jeff.

182
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,680
Can I sleep over with you tonight?

183
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,400
Oh—sorry, bro.

184
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,160
I’m not really comfy
sleeping with someone I barely know.

185
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I’d rather sleep with Jeff.

186
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Okay.

187
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,200
Hey, Babe—

188
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
You all right, man?

189
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,160
After what Charlie just said?

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
I’m good, bro.

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,160
He remembered the car he trained in.

192
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,160
I was his boyfriend, man.

193
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,720
Someday, he’ll remember me too.

194
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,120
I’m not giving up.

195
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,360
—Babe.
—Hmm?

196
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,680
Can I ask you something?

197
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,080
If there was a way
to make Charlie remember everything—

198
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,520
would you do it?

199
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,080
Of course I would.

200
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I’d do whatever it takes right now.

201
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,200
Even if it costs my life, I’d do it.

202
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,480
Why? Do you know how to help Charlie?

203
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,480
Nah.

204
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,040
Just wanted to see what you’d say.

205
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
You gotta have hope, man.

206
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,480
Charlie.

207
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,120
You can trust P’Babe.

208
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,680
He really was your boyfriend. I’m not lying.

209
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,680
But the way you talked to him,
like he’s some stranger—

210
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,200
I think you kinda hurt him.

211
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,880
What do you want me to do?

212
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
I seriously can’t do it.

213
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,520
But you feel it, right?

214
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,800
Feel what?

215
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,599
Safe.

216
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,280
When you’re with him—

217
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,200
do you feel safe?

218
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,200
I know he’d never hurt me.

219
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,000
He’s been nothing but kind.

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,080
I get that this is hard for you—

221
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,680
but it’s hard for P’Babe too, you know?

222
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,960
You get what I mean, right?

223
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
Not really.

224
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,920
But I’ll try.

225
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,760
Hey—

226
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,680
you’ve gotta get your memory back.

227
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,560
Mm.

228
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,240
Hey, P’Babe—are you hungry yet?

229
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,640
Charlie...

230
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
You don’t have to do that, okay?

231
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,160
This house belongs to both of us.

232
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,160
You can just order food.
I don’t want you overworking yourself.

233
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,240
I feel like...

234
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,080
I wanna do it for you.

235
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Maybe it’s just an old habit, right?

236
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,880
Yeah.

237
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
You used to cook for me all the time.

238
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So... why spaghetti?

239
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,840
No idea.

240
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Maybe 'cause you like it, P’Babe.

241
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
How is it?

242
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,480
Taste the same?

243
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,680
Just as good.

244
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,080
Well...

245
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,880
I vaguely remember making it before.

246
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
It’s like a picture flashed in my head.

247
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,800
And then...

248
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,000
Any other images pop up?

249
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,760
Not yet, I guess.

250
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,280
But I really want to remember more.

251
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,760
You’ll help me, right, P’Babe?

252
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
Of course.

253
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
I’ll help you with everything, Charlie.

254
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,960
Charlie’s blood is reacting very well.

255
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,320
It could help fix the problems
with the current formula.

256
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,600
Good.

257
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
But with the tiny amount of blood we have—

258
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,440
If we could get Charlie himself,

259
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,240
that would be way better.

260
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,880
Then go get him—ASAP.

261
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
But...

262
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,520
if we use too much of Charlie’s blood,

263
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,720
will he even survive, Tony?

264
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,720
Just drain it slowly.

265
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,440
Keep him alive.

266
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,400
Don’t let him die.

267
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,280
A money-making machine like that?
No way I’m letting it die.

268
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,360
Oh, and—

269
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,480
the new formula you just finished—

270
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,880
who are you gonna test it on?

271
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,480
I’ve got a test subject perfect for the job.

272
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,120
Still looking pretty relaxed.

273
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,760
You getting used to this place?

274
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,280
You’re really gonna kill me
with your own hands, huh?

275
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,040
I’m not here to kill you.

276
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,280
I’m here to give you one last chance.

277
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,160
Using your formula?

278
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,080
Don’t waste your time.

279
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,320
You already know I can’t
be your special alpha.

280
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
You never know till you try.

281
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,040
That’s why it’s called an experiment.

282
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,000
Worst case if it fails—

283
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,920
what do I lose, really?

284
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,680
It’s not like I expect you
to grow a conscience or anything.

285
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
You get worse every day.

286
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Enough talking.

287
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
What are you doing?

288
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
The injection’s in.

289
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,760
Ten percent.

290
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,760
Twenty percent.

291
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,560
Eighty percent.

292
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,640
Ninety percent.

293
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,920
What do you mean—

294
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,400
you still can’t help Kenta and Dean?

295
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,920
Right now, I still can’t get them out.

296
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,680
But don’t worry, okay?

297
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,480
Dean and Kenta are safe.

298
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,080
I saw them with my own eyes.

299
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
What did you see?

300
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Babe—

301
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,360
I saw Dean and Kenta get captured.

302
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,920
P’Alan...

303
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
Where are they?

304
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
I went to see Tony.

305
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,520
But I’m not working with him, okay?

306
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
Babe—

307
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,840
Just hear me out.

308
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,720
I just wanted to get Dean and Kenta out.

309
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,080
You know what kind of guy Tony is.

310
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,880
He doesn’t help people for free.

311
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,520
So what did you trade him?

312
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,840
Charlie’s blood.

313
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,800
Are you insane?

314
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,960
He only wanted one vial.

315
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,120
To exchange for Dean and Kenta’s release.

316
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
I saw the mark behind your ear.

317
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,120
You let them test on you, didn’t you?

318
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,840
What were you thinking?

319
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,400
Th—That’s because...

320
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,800
I didn’t want to go through surgery.

321
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,120
And I believed Tony’s drug

322
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,320
could make my body better.

323
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,520
I never wanted to exploit Charlie’s blood.

324
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,480
I just wanted to get Dean and Kenta out.

325
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,080
Don’t worry, Babe.

326
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,440
I started this mess—

327
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,160
I’ll be the one to end it.

328
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,720
P’Alan—P’Alan!

329
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,720
Uncle!

330
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
Uncle, where are you going?

331
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,560
Smells good.

332
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,760
—Pretty heavy.
—Here it is.

333
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,960
I’m back, everyone.

334
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,600
And I need your full support—

335
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,960
in exchange for a deal you’ll never regret.

336
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,280
What the—

337
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,560
How’s this even possible?

338
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,160
How the hell is this possible?

339
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,480
Think about it—

340
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,920
if we could give these powers to the military—

341
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,800
what would happen?

342
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
Other abilities—

343
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,840
like hypnosis,

344
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,920
mind reading—

345
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,360
would completely transform our world.

346
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,240
This is what’ll give us the world in our hands.

347
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,480
All I ask is for your authority—

348
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,120
to make it happen.

349
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,000
And how do we control these people?

350
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,520
Here’s your proof.

351
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,920
The project to create special alphas—

352
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,240
has succeeded 100%.

353
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,600
Alpha?

354
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,480
Mm-hmm.

355
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,320
If anyone still doubts it—

356
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,600
you’re welcome to come test it out yourself.

357
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
And—

358
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,040
what’s your next plan?

359
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,720
I want to launch a free flu vaccine program
for the underprivileged.

360
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,640
A vaccine program?

361
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,480
Anyone here interested in co-sponsoring it?

362
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,880
Of course.

363
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,400
You drink, P’Babe?

364
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,960
Someone used to stop me.

365
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,240
That someone’s gone now.

366
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,240
Guess I’ll have a sip.

367
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,920
Can I be the one to stop you instead?

368
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,160
You know—

369
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,160
we used to have so many plans together.

370
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,960
Now I don’t even know
if those chances still exist.

371
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,240
Why are you—

372
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,680
talking like we’ll never be together again?

373
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,440
We will be.

374
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,320
It’s just time to make a choice.

375
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,080
Hey. Your name’s Charlie.

376
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,880
You’re an alpha with special abilities.

377
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,880
If you’re watching this clip,

378
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,880
it means you’ve already lost your memory.

379
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,880
Because your body had too many powers at once.

380
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,280
But no matter what—

381
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,840
you must never forget your mission.

382
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,920
The mission to complete the skill-erasing serum.

383
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,320
This serum will be the answer
for all special alphas—

384
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,000
so they can return to normal lives.

385
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,320
So they have a choice in life again.

386
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
And one more thing—

387
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,480
don’t ever forget the X-Hunter team.

388
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
P’Alan,

389
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Jeff,

390
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,680
North, Sonic, Dean, Kim—

391
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
and most importantly—

392
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,240
P’Babe.

393
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,680
No matter what—

394
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,920
you have to protect P’Babe.

395
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,560
This is the key Way left with Kenta.

396
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,480
Before Kenta got captured, he passed it to me.

397
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,000
If we can figure out what it unlocks—

398
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,440
we might find an important clue.

399
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,199
This has to be connected to Tony.

400
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,760
Ugh—

401
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Damn, this is complicated—like a movie.

402
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,440
Honestly,

403
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,159
I think the power Jeff left inside Charlie—

404
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,840
could actually help us.

405
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,560
You mean—

406
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,760
you want Charlie to use his vision power

407
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,280
on this key?

408
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,520
Exactly.

409
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
I think it’s our only shot.

410
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,480
But I don’t know if the ability he got—

411
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,400
can even work on objects.

412
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,040
I think the only way to know
is to try.

413
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,679
If I ask you to do something—

414
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,480
will you do it for me?

415
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,760
I just have to hold the key, right?

416
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,760
But you might see things—

417
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,680
get a headache,

418
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
or feel pain.

419
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,240
Charlie—

420
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,160
I don’t want you using your powers.

421
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,000
You might relapse again.

422
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,600
I think Babe’s right.

423
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,960
We don’t know how much worse
his condition could get.

424
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,400
I don’t want Charlie to take that risk.

425
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,800
But if it’s the only way—

426
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,880
I wanna give it a try.

427
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,960
Charlie—

428
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,480
It’s okay, bro.

429
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,520
Just close your eyes—

430
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,640
and focus on it.

431
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,640
Let all your senses kick in.

432
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,120
Where is what I asked for?

433
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,480
I’m not doing what you want.

434
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,400
I’m here today to cancel our deal.

435
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,800
Alan.

436
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,920
You already took the substance.

437
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,680
That means our agreement still stands.

438
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,280
And it can’t be undone.

439
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,480
Even a fool would understand that.

440
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
You really brought this on yourself, huh?

441
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
What’s this document?

442
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
Let me see it.

443
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,600
This is Tony’s special ability research file.

444
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,960
Wait, so Tony tested it on himself?

445
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,400
No.

446
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,880
Tony was born with this power.

447
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,880
He’s got a special ability no one knew about.

448
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,160
He can resurrect himself.

449
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,600
What?!

450
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,240
You think someone ordinary like you—

451
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,800
You think you can actually kill me?

452
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,400
But his resurrection—

453
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,360
it has limits.

454
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,880
Tony has to swallow his own blood before his pulse stops.

455
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,280
Only then he can come back to life.

456
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,840
But dying still takes a toll.

457
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,920
His body can't fully recover to 100 percent.

458
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,200
He needs close monitoring.

459
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,120
You came to see Babe?

460
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,200
Charlie, who is it?

461
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,080
Babe’s dad came.

462
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,160
How are you, son?

463
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,560
What do you want?

464
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
What’s wrong with Charlie?

465
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,280
None of your business.

466
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,360
If I really wanted to take you guys—

467
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,920
it wouldn’t be that hard.

468
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,200
But I’d rather you come back willingly,
out of gratitude for your dad.

469
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,840
Return to me on your own.

470
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,880
The only way I’m going back is in a body bag.

471
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
I thought you might’ve matured a little.

472
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Think it over.

473
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,040
If you come back to me—

474
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,200
whatever’s wrong with Charlie,

475
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,280
my meds can cure him.

476
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,080
- Alan.
- Take Alan, for example.

477
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,640
His body’s way stronger now.

478
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,360
Stop.

479
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,120
You get it, son? Daddy’s favorite boy—

480
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,120
you’re the only one who can save the people you love.

481
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Only Daddy can save them now.

482
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,320
All you and Charlie have to do is come with me.

483
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,920
Then everyone will be safe.

484
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,040
There’s no better deal than this.

485
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,960
I know you’re smart, Babe.

486
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,040
You’ll come back to Daddy in the end.

487
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,040
Think it over.

488
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,120
Once you're ready,

489
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,760
Daddy will send someone for you.

490
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,360
Alan.

491
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,080
- Alan.
- Hey.

492
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,760
That’s Tony, right? The guy you talked about?

493
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,080
Yeah.

494
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,920
But don’t bother with him.

495
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,160
It’ll all be over soon.

496
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,040
What do you mean, Babe?

497
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,400
Tony’s guys took your uncle?

498
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Did they grab him when he went home to get his meds?

499
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,800
He wasn’t captured.

500
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,600
Alan walked into Tony’s lab himself.

501
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,920
Uncle went to Tony’s lab?

502
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,200
Alan made a deal with Tony.

503
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,280
To free Kenta and Dean.

504
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,120
In exchange for…

505
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,760
Charlie’s blood.

506
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,040
Wait—

507
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,360
So Dean’s still alive?

508
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,520
But Tony has him locked up?

509
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Yeah.

510
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,360
Tony’s keeping Dean hostage.

511
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,000
Dean’s in a coma right now.

512
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
Hanging by a thread.

513
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,960
Tony’s using that chance

514
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,440
to corner Alan into giving in.

515
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,880
He knows Uncle loves his boys.

516
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,200
Of course he’d risk it to save Dean.

517
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,280
So the time Uncle disappeared—

518
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,760
he wasn’t off getting treated at some hospital.

519
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,000
He went to see Tony, right?

520
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,520
Yeah.

521
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,360
He didn’t get treated or anything.

522
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,080
He got injected with Tony’s enhancement drug.

523
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
And now—

524
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,440
he’s stronger than any normal guy.

525
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,120
I’m sorry, man, for not telling you.

526
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,440
I’m not mad at you, bro.

527
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,520
I’m just upset.

528
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,880
That something this huge—

529
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,520
you couldn’t tell me about it.

530
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,760
If I had to guess,

531
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,960
I’d say Alan did it

532
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,280
to keep you safe, Jeff.

533
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,640
He wanted to handle it all himself,

534
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,760
so no one else would get hurt.

535
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,600
Jeff—

536
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,440
you know

537
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,160
how much Uncle loves us.

538
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,320
He loves everyone in X-Hunter.

539
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,960
Don’t be mad at him, okay?

540
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,480
So...

541
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,600
What do we do now?

542
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,240
Looks like Tony’s already moving on to his next plan.

543
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,160
Free flu vaccine campaign?

544
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,680
Yeah.

545
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,400
It’s a rushed project that just popped up out of nowhere.

546
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,040
So I looked into it.

547
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,280
Turns out a bunch of Tony’s politician allies are behind it.

548
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,320
They’re the ones running the whole thing.

549
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,800
That’s Lab D-One’s logo.

550
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,600
I saw it in Tony’s lab files before.

551
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,400
So Tony’s plan—

552
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,720
he’s gonna use skill-enhancing drugs

553
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,160
instead of vaccines?

554
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Exactly.

555
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,080
He might even use it to chip and control people on a massive scale.

556
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,440
Just like he did with Alan and Willy.

557
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,760
Then we’ve gotta take Tony down—

558
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,200
before the vaccination event happens.

559
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,880
But how are we gonna stop him?

560
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,480
He’s got the upper hand in everything.

561
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,280
We can do it.

562
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,480
We just need backup.

563
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,000
You missed me that much you made up a reason to see me?

564
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,920
Does your boyfriend know?

565
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,600
Mind your business. Charlie’s got nothing to do with this.

566
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,080
You’ve known about Tony’s vaccine project all along, haven’t you?

567
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,080
So what if I have?

568
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,760
What’s it got to do with me?

569
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,200
Everything.

570
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,880
I want to help you stop him.

571
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,360
You gonna let him do to others what he did to you?

572
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You can stop him, Willy.

573
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,600
Thanks, Babe.

574
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,800
(Charlie and I will work for Dad again,
but he has to let the others go.)

575
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,040
Winner.

576
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,280
I’ve got a job for you.

577
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,240
What’s up, my G?

578
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,640
Tie him up.

579
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,040
- Babe.
- Charlie.

580
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,160
- Stay still.
- Babe.

581
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,800
I said stay still.

582
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,240
Let me go, Babe.

583
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,320
Go.

584
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,480
Get in.

585
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,320
Get in.

586
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,600
What’s your answer, Babe?

587
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Hope it won’t disappoint Daddy.

588
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,680
That’s enough, Tony.

589
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,080
This ends today.

590
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,840
I told you before—

591
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,520
I’d never leave you.

592
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,640
Charlie.

593
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,720
Hey.

594
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,240
Other than Charlie,

595
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,960
you’re my whole world, Uncle.

596
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,920
I’m the garage owner.

597
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,360
’Cause every last baht and coin—

598
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,680
It’s all mine.
(Call me Boss Jeff.)

599
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,320
We’re not the owners anymore.
(Now we’re just workers.)

600
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,000
We work hard.

601
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,520
Counting money’s exhausting.

602
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,160
So exhausting.
(Too much cash, that’s why.)

603
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,160
(Things are heating up.)

604
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
Cool stance. Knife in hand.

605
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,040
Always gets shocked.

606
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,680
Always gets shocked.
(Save Uncle Saai, too.)

607
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,680
That kiss—so soft and tender.

608
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,320
Oh wow, wow.

609
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,960
Too far. Way too far.
