=Episode 13=

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,660
(Distance in the Wardrobe)

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,870
If Concubine Zhang opens the door,

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,230
you will be doomed.

14
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,950
If Concubine Zhang opens the door,

15
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,350
you will be doomed.

16
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,080
Could it be in the wardrobe?

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,360
Concubine Zhang, we received
some new clothes.

18
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,400
Hurry to try them on.

19
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,840
OK.

20
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,310
I found the drug
she put in the soup last time.

21
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,190
What's the use of it?

22
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,080
If I hand it to Lu Ding,

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,710
I'll be able to drive
Concubine Zhang out.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,560
I can get the jade token
to enter the attic.

25
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,430
Then I can find
my elder sister's murderer.

26
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,710
Lu Ding only cares about
the Chamber of Commerce.

27
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,470
He won't drive away Concubine Zhang

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,710
because she used the poison.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,190
Then tell me what I should do.

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,860
Dad.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,190
Darling.

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,280
Why are you here?

33
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,310
Shouldn't you be
in the Chamber of Commerce now?

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
Yichuan came

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,120
to discuss the wedding
of him and Xiaoqian.

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,430
It is a very busy time
for the Chamber of Commerce. What?

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Are you worried that Kenian may not

38
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,590
prepare your wedding well?

39
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,190
I have always trusted her.

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,080
I have things to do in the  of Commerce.
Now if you'll excuse me.

41
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,360
You are very concerned about Yichuan.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
We are all family.

43
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,910
Of course, I care about him.

44
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,070
You know what kind of concern I mean.

45
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,870
Are you suspecting

46
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,390
I am unfaithful to you?

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,630
You are thinking too much.

48
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,240
You matter the most in my heart.

49
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,720
So you mustn't let me down.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
I promise I won't fail you.

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
This is infuriating.

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,430
All the clothes are for that floozy.

53
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,630
Su Kenian is nothing.

54
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,430
Master bought so many clothes for you

55
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,560
that your room couldn't hold them all.

56
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,720
Su Kenian must leave Lu's mansion.

57
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,190
Otherwise, I will

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,720
lose my position.

59
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,750
Master Lu dotes on Su Kenian

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,430
and she can speak a foreign language.

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,480
May she be allowed to manage
the Chamber of Commerce later?

62
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,950
I won't let that happen no matter what.

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
I have to figure out a way

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,070
to get her kicked out.

65
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,600
The cleaner, Mrs. Hui,

66
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,040
found the book of
the Chamber of Commerce.

67
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
As a result, I've never seen her again.

68
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Book?

69
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,240
You mean the account book?

70
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,000
I didn't expect

71
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,870
being allowed to stay alive,

72
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,510
you will be helpful to me sometime.

73
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,120
Put it in Su Kenian's room.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,680
Concubine Zhang.

75
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,870
I am only an ordinary servant.

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
I beg you to spare me.

77
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,950
Chun, rise to your feet.

78
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,750
Why are you kneeling?

79
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,480
Don't you remember

80
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,040
your brothers

81
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
and sisters at home?

82
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,270
I can spare you.

83
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,830
But I won't spare them.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
You dirty dog! Get on your knees!

85
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,480
What did I do wrong

86
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,190
to make you so angry?

87
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,920
You stole the account book.
Why are you denying it?

88
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,950
I know nothing about it.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,190
Nian,

90
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,360
did you get into the attic today?

91
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,750
I didn't do that.

92
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
You are lying.

93
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,040
At the engagement party,

94
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,240
you acted furtively.

95
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,360
Everyone saw it.

96
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,160
Only you know whether you

97
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,240
entered the attic secretly.

98
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,870
I need the jade token
to enter the attic.

99
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,040
You said this yourself.

100
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,840
How could I do that
without the jade token?

101
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,120
Who knows? You might resort to

102
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,320
filthy means

103
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,870
to trick past the guards

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
and go up.

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,080
Zhang Rong,

106
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,910
without evidence,

107
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,870
how can you vilify me like this?

108
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,630
You are doomed.
Why are you still denying it?

109
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,320
Yichuan,

110
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,670
what do you think?

111
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,080
If Concubine Su stole the account book,

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,150
it should still be in her room.

113
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,960
