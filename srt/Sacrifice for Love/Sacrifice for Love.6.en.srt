12

Yichuan.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,280
Yichuan.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,870
Yichuan!

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,640
Yichuan, wake up!

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,840
Lu Yichuan, stay with me!

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't scare me.

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,150
I...

19
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,590
This, this is
my elder sister's pocket watch.

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,790
(The pocket watch blocked the knife.)

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,430
(Could there be something
behind my sister's death?)

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,120
(Lu Yichuan might not be the murderer.)

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,000
Go investigate

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,400
and find out who did it.

25
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,350
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,510
Yichuan acted impulsively.

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,640
But today thanks to him,

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,310
you were not hurt seriously.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,310
However, his merits
can't cancel out his demerits.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,680
The wrong thing he did can't be undone.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,240
Between my beloved

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,590
and my son,

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
only one can live.

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,150
It's up to you.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
I let you make the choice

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,080
because

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,560
I hope you will be the one
who can stay alive.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,800
Why?

39
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,560
You might not know.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,470
Because if a person

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,120
betrays you once,
he will betray you again.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,080
When he got off the ship,

43
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,840
he should expect

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,710
this would be the consequence.

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't worry.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
After he drinks the potion,

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,120
his appearance
will become unrecognizable gradually.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,750
Nobody will know Lu Yichuan is dead.

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,800
(Back then, my sister died)

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,030
(as Lu Ding described.)

51
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,430
(Could Lu Ding have killed my sister?)

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,080
(No.)

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,910
(Lu Yichuan can't die now.)

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
I got it.

55
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,510
Lu Yichuan saved my life today.

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
It is fair and sensible

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,040
that I should drink the poison for him.

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,950
You must think it through.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,920
You made great efforts
to join the Lu family.

60
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,600
Lu Yichuan saved my life.

61
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,720
If I return evil for good,

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,070
I am sure I'll be perturbed
from now on.

63
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,480
I don't want you to drink it.

64
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,120
Will you

65
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,830
disobey me as well?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,680
If you think I am wrong,

67
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,920
you can do whatever you want to me.

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,190
Darling,

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I have learned a new dance lately.

70
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,630
I will teach it to you.

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,390
OK.

72
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,510
(God has taken Gu Manxi away.)

73
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,510
(Luckily, I met Su Kenian.)

74
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,800
(I can't lose her.)

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,630
Master.

76
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,660
(Mr. Zhou, butler of the Lu family)

77
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Master.

78
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,040
How is the kidnap investigation going?

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,920
The investigation is thorough.
It's not an outsider's job.

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,070
Has Zhang Rong come back?

81
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,510
Stop beating me!

82
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,240
Darling, I beg you to stop it!

83
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,240
Stop beating me, darling!

84
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,160
I beg you to stop it!

85
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,430
Keep beating her if she doesn't confess.

86
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,680
Darling,

87
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,160
I do hate Su Kenian.

88
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,870
But I only dare to attack her orally.

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,950
How dare I pay someone to kidnap her?

90
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,270
How dare I have her killed?

91
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,240
Darling,

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,000
I beg you to stop beating me!

93
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,000
I am not the culprit.

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Darling!

95
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,800
Darling!

96
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,600
Darling, stop beating me!

97
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,870
Darling!

98
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,190
Darling!

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
I know

100
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,870
after all these years,

101
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn't bear you

102
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,630
any, any children.

103
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,720
However, I have been your wife
for many years,

104
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
I should be given credit

105
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,830
for hard work, if not for merit, right?

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,720
I tended the attic for you

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,750
and did my part
for the Chamber of Commerce.

108
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Why do I deserve

109
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,870
such, such treatment?

110
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,560
Master, I beg you to stop!

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,430
If,

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,920
if you continue,
my mistress will die.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,480
Master!

114
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,160
Brother,

115
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,680
she doesn't seem to be
the culprit.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
Why do you have the cheek to say that?

117
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,160
I asked you to watch Lu Yichuan
go aboard the ship.

118
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,950
However, you failed.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
If I had stopped Yichuan,

120
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,190
Su Kenian would have died.
