Zhang Kai,

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,280
go check Fu out.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,070
Yes, young master.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,150
I didn't lie!

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,590
I was set up!

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,640
It wasn't me!

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
It doesn't matter

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,560
whether you lied or not.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,070
I-I lied.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I'll tell you everything.

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,200
Please don't kill me!

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,680
Please!

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,790
You are lucky today.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,150
The bullet was stuck in the barrel.

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,950
You know what to do tomorrow.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,480
Move!

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,540
Quick!

29
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,120
Young master,

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,310
bind me looser next time.

31
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,360
Zhang Kai,

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,100
I want to join the organization.

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,960
Welcome!

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,560
Comrade Lu Yichuan.

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,400
I've been wondering

37
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,710
why we don't kill them all.

38
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,400
We have weapons, and we have people.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,910
Yichuan,

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
our members are not like them.

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,150
We rely on evidence

42
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,870
to make decisions.

43
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,750
This is our ethic

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,190
in this dark age.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
As long as you die,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Yichuan will love me.

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,150
Bury her.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,870
Stop!

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,320
(In Memory of Our Father Lu Ding)

51
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,000
Fu has something to tell you.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,120
Fu, what are you doing here?

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,960
I-I-I was

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,710
bribed to say

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,520
what I said yesterday.

56
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,750
Tell everyone

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,590
whether you see clearly

58
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,280
Concubine Su poisoning.

59
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,310
It is...

60
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,680
It is...

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,630
Fu,

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,590
think twice before you say something.

63
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Did anyone bribe you?

64
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,280
Bribe?

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,400
Lu Xiaoqian, what did you do?

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,310
Now he's a dead man.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,840
Su Kenian is the murderer.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Bury her now!

69
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Stop!

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,030
You can't bury her.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,280
Grandma, why are you here?

72
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,080
She's pregnant with Lu Ding's baby.
You can't bury her.

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,590
The baby will inherit

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,840
the Lu family's property.

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
She's pregnant?

76
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,710
Get her out of the pit.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,720
Now I can

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
legitimately inherit
the Chamber of Commerce.

79
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,830
Then we can

80
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,040
restart the business at the dock.

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,100
Yes.

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,240
Why are you

83
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,120
so calm today?

84
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,480
Aren't you happy that
I'll inherit the Chamber of Commerce?

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,680
Yes.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
Why are you like this?

87
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm worried about you.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,390
Why didn't you tell me you're pregnant?

89
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,190
Why did you confront Lu Xiaoqian alone?

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,950
If Grandma hadn't shown up in time,

91
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,270
you'd be dead.

92
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,240
You care about me,

93
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,190
but you pull a long face,

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,190
acting like you're teaching me a lesson.

95
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,430
So scary.

96
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,950
It will be a big deal

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
if I don't pull a long face.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,430
I didn't want you to worry about me.

99
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,630
All the uncles were present.

100
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,600
If there was solid evidence,

101
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,000
they could have saved me

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,920
with good reason.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,270
I didn't expect Lu Xiaoqian
to be so crazy

104
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,360
to kill the witness.

105
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,270
Fortunately,

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
I asked Chun to invite Grandma over

107
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,310
in advance.

108
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,390
Besides,

109
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,720
I just found out about it.

110
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,750
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

111
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Fine.

112
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,830
You always have your reasons.

113
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,390
Come on. Don't be angry anymore.

114
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,600
I won't do it again.

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,680
Smile.

116
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,800
Promise me,

117
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,800
it will never happen again.

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

119
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,920
Let's go on a date.

120
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,920
