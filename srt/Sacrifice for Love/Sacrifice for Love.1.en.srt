Stop doing this.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,870
Your father will come upstairs
at any moment.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,430
I am your father's concubine.

You need not do it by yourself.

53
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,710
Too tight-lipped.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,310

I have been looking for you for long.

72

Over the years,

73
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,750
where have you been?

74
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,310
Mr. Lu,

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,000
you mistook me for someone else.

76
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,800
Why are you here?

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,630
Let go of me.

78
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,360
No way.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,120
You hate me

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
and want to take revenge.

81
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
You can come at me directly

82
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,310
instead of sacrificing yourself.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,430
Mr. Lu, I will clarify it again.

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,950
You mistook me for someone else.

85
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
I have no clue what you are saying.

86
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,800
I will make arrangements
to let you leave.

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,950
Just do what I say.

88
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,270
Let go of me!

89
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,040
Mr. Lu,

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,830
I am the third concubine of your father.

91
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Please behave yourself!

92
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,480
How come you become
my father's concubine?

93
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,360
Nian.

94
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,360

Darling.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,950
You must be tired from the trip.

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,000
Sorry you had to go through that.

98
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,000
What is wrong?

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,720
Nothing.

100
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,310
Are this new dress for me?

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,120
Try it on.

102
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
Darling.

103
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,120
What do you think of it?
Does it look good on me?

104
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,270
You look just as pretty as her.

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800

You must be tired after your travel.

108
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,560
Let me massage your shoulders.

109
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,480
This time,

110
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,750
I won't let you leave.

111
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,390
When did I say I would leave?

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,200
Honey, do you feel comfortable?

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,840
Who is it?

114
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,240
Dad.

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,510
What is the matter, Yichuan?

116
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,670
The Chamber of Commerce...

117
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,750
Hello, Miss Su.

118
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,030
Nian, take a seat.

119
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,270
She is my third concubine.

120
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,000
From now on,
she will be a family member.

121
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,960
You can talk about anything
in front of her.

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,790
He is my son, Yichuan.

123
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,960
Yichuan, you are very handsome.

124
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,750
Thank you for your nice words, madam.

125
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,030
Our Chamber of Commerce
has been doing well over the years.

126
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,150
I have seen you

127
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
make all efforts.

128
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,200
I know you want to
take over the Chamber.

129
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,600
I promise

130
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,510
after you marry Xiaoqian,

131
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,200
you can take charge of
the core business of the Chamber.

132
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
Then I can retire

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,270
and enjoy my remaining years.

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,320
Yichuan, Yichuan.

135
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,000
I know you always see Xiaoqian as a sister.

136
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,000
However,

137
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,320
you can't neglect her feelings.

138
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,360
Dad, I got it.

139
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,790
You must be tired from the journey.

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,510
Have a cup of tea first.

141
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,270
Pour a cup for Kenian, too.

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
We will be a family from now on.

143
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,670
Madam,

144
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,270
have a cup of tea, please.
