on the Marriage)

Nian.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
You are alive.

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,230
Are you surprised?

15
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,950
Smith has been trying to find someone

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
to take over our business at the dock.

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,000
Someone

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,920
wanted to ruin our livelihood.

19
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,760
It was the only way

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I could make the enemy
relax their guard down.

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,640
I know

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,870
a lot has happened
in the Lu family recently.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,590
As long as you can come back to me,

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,870
and become my lawful wife,

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,150
I can forget it all.

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,520
- Congratulations!
- Please step inside.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,910
Welcome, Mr. Liu. Mrs. Liu.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,310
Please come in. Welcome.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,710
Congratulations.

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,630
Thank you for coming, Mr. Zhang. Please.

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,710
Mr. Lu is here.

32
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,190
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

33
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,030
Thank you.

34
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,310
Thank you for attending my wedding.

35
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,240
Congratulations!

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,310
Thank you.

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,190
Congratulations!

38
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,080
Thanks.

39
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,150
Cheers.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,910
Congratulations!

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,750
Thank you.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,870
Mr. Lu.

43
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,800
Congratulations to Mr. Lu!

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,430
Mr. Lu, I wish you and Miss Su
a long and happy marriage!

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,400
Congratulations!

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,910
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,520
Thank you all for taking the time

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,030
to attend my wedding.

49
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,800
Why are you here?

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,120
I can't leave you alone.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
I want to take you away.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,590
It's too late.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,680
I can't leave now.

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,030
I wish you all

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,680
a bright future.

56
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,080
Enjoy yourself. Cheers.

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,710
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,560
Miss Lu is in the hospital.

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
The troublemakers at the dock

60
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,840
have been caught.

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
But they were too tough

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
to tell us anything
after being tortured.

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,710
None of this matters.

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,310
How is the ambush?

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,240
Everything is ready.

66
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm sure Lu Yichuan won't escape

67
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,870
even with wings.

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,520
All right.

69
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,280
Congratulations!

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,520
Congratulations to Mr. Lu!

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,740
Take this.

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,360
Everyone.

73
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,630
- Cheers.
- Congratulations!

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,590
Cheers.

75
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,360
Congratulations.

76
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,280
Yichuan,

77
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,160
this is a trap.

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,630
Take this and leave.

79
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,160
Manqing.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,630
If Lu Ding finds out,

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,630
he'll kill you.

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,430
- What happened?
- Run! Run!

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,390
What's going on?

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,430
This way!

85
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,000
Run! Quick!

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,750
Run!

87
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,270
The gunshots

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
have burned your bridge.

89
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,070
I've never had any bridge.

90
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,240
Leave!

91
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,120
Aren't you planning to leave?

92
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Guess if you can walk out of the gate.

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,830
You arranged for an ambush
at home long ago.

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,560
I was sure

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,390
that you would care about Gu Manqing.

96
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,040
The trap was set for you.

97
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,310
You actually took advantage of her.

98
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,360
Why not?

99
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,040
Everyone can be used.

100
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,360
Why not she?

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
You didn't think

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,750
I liked her so much

103
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,510
or cared about her, did you?

104
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,360
She is just

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,070
a substitute for me.

106
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,720
If so,

107
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,120
why didn't you let her go?

108
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,800
Even if she's just a substitute,

109
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,430
she is mine,

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,750
and mine alone.

111
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,430
Whoever takes her way from me will die!

112
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,920
Lu Ding, you're crazy!

113
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,240
You killed so many people!

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,870
Look who else is around you.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,360
Have you ever regretted it?

116
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,040
Did you kill Gu Manxi

117
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,480
back then?

118
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

119
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,120
Lu Ding conspired with foreigners

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
to traffic the Chinese people.

121
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,040
He wanted to kill me.

122
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,830
I wrote this as evidence.

123
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,680
Don't you love my sister?

124
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,390
Why did you kill her?

125
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,750
You had no idea!

126
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,750
I didn't want to kill her.

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,560
It's not my fault.

128
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,630
It's your sister's.

129
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,670
She stole the contract

130
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
and tried to blow the whistle.

131
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
She was to blame

132
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,440
for everything!
