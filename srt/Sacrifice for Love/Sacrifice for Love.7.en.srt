(Don't Touch Her/Him)

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,150
Darling.

13
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,200
Order the servant to apply the medicine.

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,300
Any information about the kidnappers?

15
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,640
Why were you not on the ship?

16
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,280
Is this what you promised
to protect the Lu family?

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,760
Then you should
take good care of yourself.

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,510
I won't force you to kill him,

19
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,790
but he will be sent abroad
when he recovers.

20
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,520
Don't ever think about him again.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Understood.

22
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,400
Find a few people you can trust
and kill Lu Yichuan.

23
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,840
But you said you would spare him.

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,910
He's slavering over my woman!

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,430
Young master,
it's just as you suspected.

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,150
Lu Ding?

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Yes.

28
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,200
They are trafficking people.

29
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,150
So they are selling men overseas
to be coolies.

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,630
Manqing's sister
must have got some evidence

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,590
before she was killed by Lu Ding.

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,360
Then Manqing is more in danger.

33
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,470
What should we do next?

34
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,310
Report the news to your organization.

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,630
I will try to get to the attic.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Yes.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
(Things can't go on like this.)

38
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,000
(I have to find a way
to get Manqing out of here.)

39
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,710
What are you doing?

40
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,520
I need to go out.
Get out of my way!

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,960
Young master, you'd better stay inside

42
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,710
and take care of yourself.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,710
(If Lu Yichuan is not the real killer,)

44
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,120
(Lu Ding is the most suspicious person.)

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,150
(But I saw with my eyes
that Lu Yichuan fired the gun.)

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,680
(What happened back then?)

47
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,190
(I have to confront him.)

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,420
Concubine Su,

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,390
Master is waiting
for you in the ballroom.

50
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,720
He hopes you can wear
the cheongsam he gave you last time.

51
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,270
Please.

52
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,190
Who is it?

53
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,060
Dad forbids anyone to see you,

54
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,430
so I came here secretly.

55
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,680
These are the medicines I got for you.

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,500
I didn't know which ones would work,

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,630
so I took them all.

58
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,800
Let me see your injuries.

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,240
Why do you treat me like that?

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,950
I'm here to care about you.

61
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,380
Lu Xiaoqian,

62
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,190
didn't you hired the kidnappers?

63
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,510
It's too hypocritical
to care about me now.

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,360
Come here.

65
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,270
You look so like her.

66
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
What do you want from me, darling?

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
I want you to dance with me.

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,980
If you hadn't saved her,

69
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,310
you wouldn't have been hurt.

70
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,390
It's all her fault!

71
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,860
I'm warning you,

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
don't touch her.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,190
You want to kill me because of her?

74
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,070
Do you have no feelings for me?

75
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,750
I've been waiting for this dance
for a long time.

76
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,830
Only you can make me feel the same

77
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,830
as I danced with her back then.

78
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,560
Who is the lucky girl you danced with?

79
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Someone I wasn't blessed to have.

80
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
I've lost her once,

81
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,040
and I won't lose you again.

82
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,800
Anyone who stands in my way must die.

83
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,100
Oh, no.

84
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,630
Lu Ding is stalling.

85
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Lu Yichuan is in danger.

86
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,300
If I can't be with the one I love,

87
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,870
neither can you.

88
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,390
If something happens once,
it will happen a second time.

89
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,360
Do you think she can survive today?

90
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,320
Yichuan.

91
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,550
