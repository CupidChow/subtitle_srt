12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,520
Who called the police?

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,390
I did.

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,880
My maid found some unknown medicine

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,390
in Miss Lu's room.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,400
I hope you can check it, officer.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,120
So you knew about my plan.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,790
But it doesn't matter
even if you expose it.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,640
You can't do anything to me.

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,450
This is

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,140
the poison in
the Chamber of Commerce murder case.

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,790
What?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,950
What I bought was abortion medicine.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,480
How could it be poison?

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,430
Su Kenian!

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,120
Are you taking revenge on me?

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,230
How dare you change the medicine
and frame me?

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,950
You!

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,150
Lu Xiaoqian, don't be stubborn

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,430
and make mistakes repeatedly!

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,640
Yichuan.

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,040
I didn't do it!

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,150
Please trust me!

34
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,070
Say that

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,760
in the police station.

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,680
Lu Yichuan!

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,840
Why did you do this to me?

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,280
I've loved you

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,760
for so many years.

40
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,950
Don't you know that?

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,760
Miss Lu,

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,590
please go to the police station with us.

43
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,790
I can walk.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,870
Miss Lu, what else do you need?

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,840
I can get them for you.

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,470
That woman thought

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,910
she could control the Lu family.

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,360
In her wildest dream.

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
Please give your orders.

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,190
Closer.

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,750
I want to report
the Chamber of Commerce's business.

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,150
I wonder if she can
still be the chairwoman

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,590
when the Chamber is in trouble.

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,190
Miss Lu, please think twice.

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,120
Uh...

56
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,080
Although the police station never asked
about Mr. Lu's business,

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,080
it is connected

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,750
with the interests of half of Nancheng.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,240
If there's something that I can't get,

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
I'd rather destroy it

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,470
than watch her get it.

62
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,840
What's more,

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,310
Su Kenian

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,710
is the perfect scapegoat for this.

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,560
By the way,

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,750
tell Lu Yichuan to bail me out.

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,520
I can't stay

68
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,080
in this nasty place any longer.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,430
Yes.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Yichuan!

71
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,280
Why did you bring her here?

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,960
Want to meet Lu Yichuan?

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,310
He won't come to see you
after you caused him

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
so much trouble.

75
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,470
Nonsense!

76
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,800
Yichuan wouldn't be so heartless to me!

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
Why not?

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,430
Lu Xiaoqian,

79
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,630
have you forgotten what you've done?

80
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,710
You! It was you!

81
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,280
You ruined my family!

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,190
You made Yichuan hate me!

83
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,400
It's all your fault!

84
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,280
Lu Xiaoqian,

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,470
you are so hypocritical.

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,870
I never hurt you.

87
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,000
You kidnapped me.

88
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,600
You wanted to kill me.

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,800
You threatened Lu Yichuan
with my life

90
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,720
to marry you.

91
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,630
I want to make a deal with you,

92
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,240
using her life.

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,190
What is it?

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
I want you to marry me.

95
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,000
Otherwise,

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,630
you know what will happen.

97
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,240
Lu Xiaoqian,

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,630
you are cruel and selfish.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,070
You disregard human life
and confuse right and wrong.

100
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,120
You and Lu Yichuan are destined
to be on different paths.

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Don't you understand?

102
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,120
You pushed him
further and further away.

103
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,950
Even without me,

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,390
Lu Yichuan wouldn't be with you.

105
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,680
It wasn't me.

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,190
I didn't do it!

107
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,240
I didn't!

108
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,040
It wasn't me!

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,630

Now, I think

116
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,040
I should be qualified
to cooperate with Mr. Smith.

117
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,270
Mrs. Lu, you are such a speed demon.

118
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,480
The Lu family never

119
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,360
neglects Mr. Smith's business.

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,390
Mrs. Lu is more capable than I thought.

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,190
When will the goods be available?

122
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,600
Anytime.

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,870
In fact, I invited you over today

124
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,920
because I want

125
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,190
to talk about a bigger deal.

be it opium or arms.

130

You don't have to worry about any risk,

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,720
because we will deliver the goods first

132
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,660
and you pay the bill later.

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,680
You will definitely be successful.

the list of your accomplices,

142
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,950

I'll go get it now.

is still going on.

155
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,510

Do you know

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
who else in the Lu family smokes?

160
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,600
I think no one smokes

except Lu Ding.

162
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,840
Why do you ask?

163
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,000
In my memory,

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
my father didn't smoke either.

165
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,200
He didn't smoke.

166
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,630
So what?

167
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,600
That means

168
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
no lighter should have been found
on my father's body.

But Lu Ding said

170
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,790
it was my father's.

171
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,840
Wasn't it found on your father's body?

172
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,790
The things found on my father's body

173

may not belong to my father.
