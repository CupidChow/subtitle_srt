(Old residence of the Chen family
Two years ago)

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,590
I finally saw the arrival of this day.

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,230
I have also waited for
this day for long.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
Lu Yichuan, I will kill you!

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,870
Manqing!

17
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,040
Why?

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,710
Get off me!

19
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,480
Manqing.

20
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120
Could there be some kind of
misunderstanding between us?

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,760
Let's calm down and talk about it.

22
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,000
Misunderstanding?

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,310
I saw you kill my elder sister
with my own eyes.

24
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,070
Now you are telling me
that's just misunderstanding!

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,070
That's not true.

26
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,510
Lu Yichuan, I hate you.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
I will never forgive you
as long as I live.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,910
It's not what you think, Manqing.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,430
Get out!

30
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,240
Young master.

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,680
Put down your gun.

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,520
Manqing!

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,520
(Lu Yichuan,)

34
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,590
(I assure you
I will seek revenge against you.)

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,910
(Zhang Rong, Lu Ding's second concubine)
As a newcomer, you didn't offer me tea,

36
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
but got yourself a cup, instead.

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:37,870
Brother.

38
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,280
I am afraid this is not proper.

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,750
(Lu Guangzhu, Lu Ding's younger brother)

40
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,750
This sister-in-law is

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,710
both young and elegant.

42
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,430
I guess you are
my husband's second concubine.

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,520
Madam,

44
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,280
have some tea, please.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,310
The tea is so hot.

46
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,360
How could you offer it to me?

47
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,430
What?

48
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,910
As a newcomer, you want to humiliate me?

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
You got me wrong, madam.

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,840
Madam,

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,030
what do you mean by that?

52
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,360
Yichuan,

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
our Lu family is

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,630
a prestigious and influential family.

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,870
This new bride didn't offer me tea
to show respect

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,400
and broke the family rules.

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,430
People will laugh at us
if they come to know this.

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,470
Since when did you have the right

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,280
to set rules in this house?

60
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,750
Or are you trying to say

61
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,870
my marriage needs your permission?

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,710
Darling, I didn't mean that.

63
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,960
Brother, I will escort you back
to get some rest.

64
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,190
Don't you think you can be unruly

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,000
with our husband backing you up.

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,360
I will see how long you can stay.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,750
these quality cigarettes just came in.
Buy a pack, please.

73

Hello, sir.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,430
These quality cigarettes just came in.
Buy a pack, please.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Life is hard for them.
Buy all his goods.

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,950
Thank you, sir!

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,240
Thank you, sir!

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,480
I will deliver them to you in a while.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,270
Mr. Lu,

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,040
the clothes of Mrs. Lu and you
are ready.

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,360
Mrs. Lu, get in, please.

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,920
Mr. Lu.

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,830
What?

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,870
What is wrong?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,950
There is an insect.

86
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,480
What insect? Where?

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,800
It's behind the door.

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Look carefully.

89
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,270
Nothing.

90
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,680
Then it might have flown away.

91
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,720
If there is nothing else,
I'll go outside.

92
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,630
I can't zip my dress.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Could you help zip me up?

94
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,270
You want to shout
and say I got fresh with you,

95
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,680
but I suggest you give up the evil plan.

96
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,160
Dar...

97
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,680
Miss Su Kenian,

98
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
if you want to stay in this family,

99
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,750
you should behave yourself.

100
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,600
Your cover

101
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,870
will be blown easily.

102
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,160
Go to hell!

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,870
Dad, be careful.

104
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,830
You go in first.

105
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,390
Nian, you leave now and stay safe.

106
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
I will help Yichuan. Hurry up!

107
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,750
Young master, are you all right?

108
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,480
Go investigate and
find out who did this.

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,240
You acted like that today.

111
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,390
Did you think I dared not kill you?

112
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
You should hold a gun in this way.

113
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,720
Your hands shouldn't shake.

114
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,120
Align the diopter and
front sight with the target.

115
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,720
Like this?

116
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,790
Yes.

117
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,320
Aim at the chest

118
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,550
and you can kill your target
with the first shot

119
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,750
and protect yourself.

120
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,360
Pull the trigger.

121
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
Yichuan?

122
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,030
Why are you here?

123
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,120
Darling,

124
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,270
what happened today scared me to death,

125
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,240
so I came to see Yichuan
to borrow a gun.

126
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,240
As per the rules of our Lu family,

127
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,910
women mustn't touch guns.

128
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,510
I got it, darling.

129
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,150
(If I must sleep with him tonight,)

130
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,000

this bottle of anaesthetic.)

131
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,320
Darling.

132
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,600
I won't drink because
it will spoil the pleasure.

133
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,440
Darling,

134
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,000
