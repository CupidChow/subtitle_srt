What is the matter?

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
Did you see your uncle?

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,960
Uncle?

45
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,800
No, I didn't.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
If I see him,
I'll ask him to see you.

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
You didn't see him?

48
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,470
All right.

49
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,240
Go do your thing.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,910
OK.

51
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,040
We've collected Second Master's body.

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
OK.

53
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,070
What should we do
to the hired foreign killer?

54
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,680
Make him pay with his life.

00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,060
Dad.

56
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,240
What happened?

57
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,720
Your uncle is dead.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
The foreigner killed him.

59
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,560
He has walked over us many times.

60
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,480
From now on,

61
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,070
we can no longer let him grind us down.

62
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,120

One month later,

66
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,870
the foreigner will come
to sign the contract with us.

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,510
You shall stall him.

68
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,800
I will make a plan

69
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,310
to avenge your uncle's death.

70
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,920
Mr. Smith,

71
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,120
my father will be right here.

72
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,040
I've invited some dancers
to entertain you.

73
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,430
If you insist.

74
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,070
This way, please.

75
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,870
Let's go inside.

76
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,270
What are you waiting for?

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
Hurry to go serve the guest.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,220
I...

79
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,480
It's your honor to serve a socialite.

80
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,830
Why don't you value the chance?

81
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,920
I was told to do odds and ends

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,000
instead of doing this.

83
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Don't forget

84
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,160
you sold yourself to our family.

85
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,070
You must obey me.

86
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,830
Got it?

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
Miss Lu, I beg you.

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't make me go there.

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,630
Go in quickly!

90
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,830
Is it your socialites' hobby

91
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,120
to force a girl to prostitute herself?

92
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,510
I am not forcing her.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,160
She was born humble.

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,190
Replace her with an obedient dancer.

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,510
Mr. Smith is a big client, after all.

96
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,510
Don't disgrace our Lu family.

97
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,830
Yichuan, why are you here?

98
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,480
Dad sent me here on an errand.

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,190
I'll go entertain the guests

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
and come to join you later.

101
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,160
Chun,

102
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,950
be my maid from now on.

103
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,950
Yes, madam.

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,270
Leave now.

105
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,870
Let's act separately later.

106
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,310
You watch Smith's underlings here.

107
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,120
I'll watch their signature
and transaction.

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,870
Lu Ding will watch the goods at the dock.

109
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,430
Remember,

110
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,870
this is the only chance.

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
If we fail this time,

112
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,950
we won't have another chance.

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,360
All right.

114
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,240
Manqing.

115
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,360
What is it?

116
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,560
Let me hug you.

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,630
You must be careful

118
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,240
and keep yourself safe.

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,000
Stop. Lu Ding will arrive any minute.

120
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,240
Another hug.

121
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,600
Enough. Go quickly.

122
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,870
OK.

123
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,750
Nian.

124
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,200
Darling.

125
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,390
What's in your hands?

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
I picked a stickpin for you.

127
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,630
Luckily, you didn't leave.

128
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,360
