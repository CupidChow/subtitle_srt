(I'm Getting Engaged to Her)

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,790
You are here.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,430
It's windy tonight.

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,590
Put this on.

15
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,120
Lu Ding was stalling for time yesterday.

16
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,340
I had no chance to warn you.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,150
Thank God you are okay.

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,640
The killers Lu Ding has trained
over the years

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,040
were quite capable.

20
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,580
But you roughed them up all by yourself.

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,840
You are really good.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,020
You know what?

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,280
I was scared

24
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,200
when I was alone yesterday.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,070
But when I thought of meeting you,

26
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,430
I wasn't scared at all.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,780
And the gun.

28
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,760
When I picked up the gun,

29
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,840
all I could think about
was what you told me.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,120
Then I shot the killer
in one fell swoop.

31
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,150
When you were standing at the door,

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,150
I felt like all the crises were averted,

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,360
and you were the only one in my world.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
Lu Xiaoqian and I will…

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,360
You and Lu Xiaoqian will do what?

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Go ahead.

37
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,120
Lu Xiaoqian and I will get engaged.

38
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,840
Why do you want to get engaged to her?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,940
Do you like her?

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,360
Do you love her?

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,870
What are you doing, Lu Yichuan?

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,710
Lu Yichuan! What are you doing?
Put me down!

43
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,080
Put me down!

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,430
Lu Yichuan!

45
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,710
Lu Yichuan!

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,630
Lu Yichuan, why did you tie me up?

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Send her away.

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,560
Yes.

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,120
Lu Yichuan!

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Lu Yichuan!

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,430
Lu Yichuan!

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,120
Do you have to do this, Mr. Lu?
Miss Gu will hate you.

53
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,960
Instead of watching her die here
because she loves me,

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,030
I hope she can leave here safely
though she hates me.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Lu Yichuan!

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Stop!

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
They make a perfect couple.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,750
Yes.

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,750
Where is Kenian?

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm here.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,400
Stop the car!

62
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,150
If you don't stop now,
I will die in your car.

63
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,560
All right. Look at me.

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,070
Dad, I want to take a photo
with Yichuan.

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,100
Let's make room for them.

66
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,360
What a couple!
Don't you think so, Kenian?

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,680
Yes, a perfect match.

68
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,390
Three, two, one.

69
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,780
Nian,

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,120
you'll handle Xiaoqian and Yichuan's
betrothal party next week.

71
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,360
Darling, I used to
take care of such things.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,120
You were tired from the photo shoot.

73
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,430
Take a good rest.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,830
Come on.
Let's take one together.

75
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,310
Okay.

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,240
- Chun.
- Closer.

77
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,160
Okay. Look at me.

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,680
Concubine Su is so young and beautiful.

79
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't you think so, Yichuan?

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,040
She is pretty.

81
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,560
Brother, I've got news.

82
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,240
It's about the dock.

83
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,950
Yichuan, let's take one more.

84
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm tired.

85
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,390
Brother, someone has been investigating

86
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,920
the case from two years ago.

87
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,830
Have all the contracts been destroyed?

88
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
I think I should have destroyed them.

89
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,360
You think?

90
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,180
There was an emergency at the time.

91
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,430
But don't worry.

92
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,160
Everyone who knew about it is dead now.

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,560
You!

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,750
Suspend the business at the dock.
The situation is tense now.

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,240
Brother, I'm afraid
we can't suspend the business.

96
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,750
The foreigners have been pressing us,

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,510
saying that if we don't
deliver the goods, they will…

98
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,040
Asshole.

99
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,360
They are not qualified
to teach me lessons.

100
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,600
If they dare to come again,

101
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,120
I will settle the accounts with them
for the assassination of me.

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Why are you still here?

103
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,270
What do you mean?

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,160
What on earth do you want?

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,600
I've told you
that I'm getting engaged to Xiaoqian.

106
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,310
Why?

107
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,270
I can tell you still care about me.

108
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,830
Or you wouldn't have saved me.

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,420
Is it because Lu Xiaoqian
is rich, young and beautiful,

110
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,310
and she loves you

111
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,070
so you can inherit
the Chamber of Commerce?

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,600
You are right. So what?

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Aren't you worried that you'll hurt me?

114
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,000
Lu Yichuan,
do you really not love me anymore?

115
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,120
Yichuan, what are you doing here?

116
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,600
I need to discuss something
with Concubine Su.

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,270
I also need to discuss something
with her.

118
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,720
Concubine Su agreed to help me
prepare for the betrothal party.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,870
I wonder if it's a good time to talk.

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,720
