Zhang Kai.

Miss Gu.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,950
Does Lu Yichuan

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,710
really want to marry Lu Xiaoqian?

16
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,950
Does he like Lu Xiaoqian?

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,120
Then what does he mean?

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,480
He's getting married to Lu Xiaoqian,

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,640
but he's still so nice to me,

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,680
making me misunderstand.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,640
He is a half-hearted, disloyal man.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,400
He is so indecisive in love.

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,790
He is not a good man after all.

Forget it. You may leave.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,430
Lu Yichuan is a heartless man.

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,430
Young master has done so much

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,560
for you.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,950
Don't you feel it at all?

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,350
For me?

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
No way.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,840
He did it all to marry Lu Xiaoqian

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
and to obtain the Lu family's property.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,910
Miss Gu,

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,310
you are so ungrateful.

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,840
When you passed out,

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,120
Lu Xiaoqian pointed two guns
at your head.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,280

but to agree to the engagement.

Yichuan,

59
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,080
you can't hide everything from me.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080

than put you in danger.

65
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,430
But have you ever thought about me?

66
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,910
Do you know how much I worry about you?

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,430
You don't want to put me in danger,

68
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,470
and I don't want you to get hurt.
Do you understand me?

69
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,160
Did I just hallucinate?

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
I can't stay up anymore. Time to sleep.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,870
Lu Ding is a dangerous man.

72
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,870
So…

73
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,070
So he has something to do
with my sister's death.

74
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,870
Did Lu Ding kill my sister?

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
You would die.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,190
I don't want you to end up
like your sister.

77
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,510
But, but I need to find out

78
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,070
what happened to my sister.

79
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,870
I will investigate

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,950
what you want to know.

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,070
And I will let you know

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,750
after I've got the results.

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,270
But before that,

84
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,800
please help me protect yourself.

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,600
Don't make me worry about you.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,600
I suspect

87
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,480
that your sister was killed

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,680
because she knew Lu Ding's secret.

89
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
But it's just my speculation

90
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,120
and I don't have any proof.

91
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,310
The clue may be hidden in the attic.

92
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,270
I will try to get in

93
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,480
during the betrothal party tomorrow.

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,510
Don't worry.

95
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,870
Okay.

96
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,390
What is in the attic?

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,270
What are you doing?

98
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,750
Didn't we agree to take our time
and wait for me to find out the truth?

99
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,390
I don't want you to do this alone.

100
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,920
I can help you, too.

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,390
Is Xiaoqian inside?

102
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,430
She seems to be changing clothes now.

103
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,160
Then don't disturb her.

104
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,950
We'll need the jade pendant
to get in the attic.

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
Only Zhang Rong can go up there.

106
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Only when you are safe,

107
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,390
can I investigate it without worry.

108
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
She wanted to kill me,

109
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,630
and I don't think
we can get the jade pendant easily.

110
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,920
Next time.

111
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,310
(If Xiaoqian is here,)

112
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,750
(then who is in the dressing room?)

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
We can't stay here for too long.

114
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,720
They'll get suspicious.

115
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,310
I'll go first.

116
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,830
Okay.

117
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,920
Sir.

118
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,870
Dad.

119
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,870
Get the meds!

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,750
Dad, are you okay?

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,390
We'll need the jade pendant
to get in the attic.

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Only Zhang Rong can go up there.

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,480
Only when you are safe,

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,830
can I investigate it without worry.

125
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,360
Why,

126
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,720
you want to go to the attic too?

127
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,600
It's not a place where anyone

128
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,150
can get in.

129
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,030
