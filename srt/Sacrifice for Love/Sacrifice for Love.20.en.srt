00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,750
I've never seen
people make a wish on a bonfire.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,960
It doesn't matter what I wish upon.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,960
What matters is my sincerity.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,790
As long as I am sincere enough,

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,030
the wish I make on the bonfire
will come true as well.

what wish did you make?

Stop. Don't ask me anymore.

A wish won't come true
if you say it out loud.

I'm happy when you're happy.

(Yongchuan Hospital

66
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,920
That woman is actually pregnant!

67
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,510
I didn't expect her to be so smart.

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,600
Given this situation,

69
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,510
Su Kenian will probably
inherit the Chamber of Commerce.

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
The Lu family can only be mine.

71
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,980
No one can take it from me.

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,480
She wants to control the Lu family
with her child.

73
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,270
If the baby is gone,

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,070
the problem will be solved.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,630
I've made some bird's nest soup for you.

76
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,070
It's hot.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,800
It's not.

78
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,040
It is.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,510
Here.

80
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,480
Did you put the medicine in?

81
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,160
Yes.

82
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,000
I saw Young Master
take the soup away.

83
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,830
Great.

84
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,920

Concubine Su.

90
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,950
Are you OK, Concubine Su?

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,240
Help me out of bed.

92
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
You are bleeding, Concubine Su.

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
I'll call the doctor.

94
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,950
Don't.

95
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,190
Miss Lu.

96
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,190
I am the lawyer of
the Chamber of Commerce.

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm here to help Mrs. Lu
sign the inheritance contract.

98
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,830
I advise you not to wait any longer

99
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,160
and to go back now.

100
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,160
Why?

101
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,600
She isn't feeling well.

102
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,120
I bet she won't show up today.

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
Then, please excuse me.

104
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,360
Wait.

105
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,270
Su Kenian.

106
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,070
Why are you downstairs?

107
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,750
Let's sign the contract.

108
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,390
Yes.

109
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,430
Wait.

110
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,800
I don't believe

111
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,560
you are really pregnant.

112
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,430
Miss Lu.

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,750
You said you're pregnant.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
So, do you dare to let the doctor

115
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,510
take your pulse in front of everyone

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,040
to see if you are really pregnant?

117
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Why do you force Concubine Su to do it?

118
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
You are not allowed to speak!

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,360
OK.

120
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,680
I'll do it.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,560
Please.

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,920
Concubine Su.

123
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Miss Lu, Concubine Su is indeed pregnant.

124
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,000
What? Are you sure?

125
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
How come she's pregnant?

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
But she is.

127
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,390
Do you know how to take a pulse?

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,480
Get lost!

129
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,070
And you!

130
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,240
Who called the police?

131
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
I did.

132
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,550
My maid found some unknown medicine

133
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,030
in Miss Lu's room.

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
I hope you can check it, officer.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,670
So you knew about my plan.

136
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,480
But it doesn't matter
even if you expose it.

137
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
You can't do anything to me.

138
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,980
