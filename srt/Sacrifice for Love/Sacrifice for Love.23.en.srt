(An Either-Or Situation)

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,030
Let me go!

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,000
Lu Ding,

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,670
what do you want to do?

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,310
It's my fault

17
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,150
that you found the contract.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
Don't blame me.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
What is that?

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,920
Lu Ding,

22
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,760
why are you doing this to me?

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,150
Manxi.

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,950
Do you have any idea

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,360
how painful and sad I was

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,560
back then?

27
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,590
And you.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,750
You are the murderer, too.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,150
You fired the gun!

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,310
Gu Manxi fired the gun herself.

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,630
Please help me. Please!

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,030
Help me!

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
For so many years,

34
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,840
I couldn't get her out of my mind.

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,240
When I met you,

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,590
I decided

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,870
that no one could ever
take you away from me,

38
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,470
even though

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,000
I knew you were Gu Manqing
from the beginning.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,870
I've been so nice to you,

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,910
but what about you?

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,870
You chose Lu Yichuan!

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,310
So what?

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,470
You want to kill me, too, right?

45
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,680
As long as he surrenders,

46
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,280
I can let you go.

47
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,870
OK.

48
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,520
I'll surrender.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,910
You let go of Manqing.

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,470
Yichuan, what are you talking about?

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
He won't let you off easily!

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,710
To surrender is to die.

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,480
It doesn't matter.

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I want you to be safe.

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,430
Leave now.

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,680
No. We leave together.

57
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,720
Yichuan!

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,310
Don't, Yichuan!

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,270
Yichuan!

60
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,000
Go get them.

61
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,070
Yichuan!

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,310
Yichuan!

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,750
I am your dad,

64
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,680
and she is my concubine.

65
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,750
In the past,

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
you two would have been drowned.

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
Gu Manqing is not your concubine!

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,190
She is my fiancee!

69
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,560
She has always been my woman.

70
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,360
I'll ask again.

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,160
Whose woman is she?

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
She's mine.

73
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,510
No! No!

74
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,120
Please don't beat him!

75
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,600
Please let him go!

76
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,070
I can do anything you want!

77
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,120
No, Manqing!

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,630
No!

79
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,830
I thought about handing over

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,310
the Chamber of Commerce to you.

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,920
I could give you whatever you wanted.

82
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,950
But what did you do?

83
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,560
You wanted to steal her from me!

84
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,070
You are such an ungrateful person!

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
Just like your dead father.

86
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,160
You are not allowed
to mention my father!

87
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,430
He treated you like a brother

88
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,950
but you killed him!

89
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,950
The lighter is yours!

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
That's because you didn't know

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
your father almost ruined
the whole Chamber!

92
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,040
I disagree with the business
of human trafficking.

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,420
(Fifteen years ago)

94
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,680
But if we don't do this,

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,360
others will do it.

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,510
The result is the same.

97
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,190
Have you ever thought about it?

98
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,720
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
I won't agree to it anyway.

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,600
Human trafficking

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,510
is quite common in Nancheng.

102
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,720
How should I put it?

103
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,920
It's like normal sales of goods.

104
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Someone wants it, so we sell it.

105
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,390
If we need to grease the wheels,
we can pay the money.

106
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,600
This is all dirty money.

107
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
The Chamber of Commerce
is under our control,

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
and you are the vice-chairman now.

109
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,040
Isn't that enough?

110
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,630
Why do you want the dirty money?

111
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,270
I was wrong.

112
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,560
I lost my mind.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Have a cup of water.

115
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't take it that way.

116
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,870
We are brothers.
You don't need to be like this.

117
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,600
I'll report all the human traffickers
in Nancheng,

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,160
and I'll need the help of
the Chamber of Commerce.

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,620
OK.

120
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,270
You...

121
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm sorry, buddy.

122
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,270
I hid something from you.

123
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,000
The reason why we were able
to control the Chamber of Commerce

124
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,680
was that we agreed to help foreigners
with the business of human trafficking.

125
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,390
If we screw up their business,

126
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,160
the Chamber of Commerce will be others'.

127
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,070
Do you know that?

128
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,190
I didn't want to kill your dad.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,750
He could stay out of this,

130
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,390
but he shouldn't have
thought about reporting it.

131
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
He wanted to be a good person himself,

132
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,510
but he never considered the people

133
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,120
working in the Chamber of Commerce.

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
They have families.

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,550
They have to make a living.

136
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,030
There were hundreds of them,

137
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,840
and your dad never cared about them.

138
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,600
You are such a disgusting

139
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,080
and hypocritical monster!

140
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,750
You've done so many evil deeds,

141
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,480
and I believe you will die like a dog!

142
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,870
I've raised you for over ten years,

143
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
and now I am

144
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,790
a disgusting monster.

145
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,030
I'm so disappointed.

146
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,080
Lu Ding, I know you want revenge.

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,030
Let him go,
and I'll trade my life for his.

148
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,320
What a loving couple.

149
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm so touched.

150
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,320
That being the case,

151
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
I will do as you wish.

152
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,600
No.

153
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,600
No!

154
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,360
Manqing!

155
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,200
No!

156
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,720
This is poison.

157
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,630
Only one of you two can live.

158
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,270
Will you take it yourself,

159
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,670
or will you make Lu Yichuan take it?

160
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,750
I'll give you another chance.

161
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,910
Yichuan!

162
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,960
Yichuan!

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,840
Yichuan!

164
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,910
