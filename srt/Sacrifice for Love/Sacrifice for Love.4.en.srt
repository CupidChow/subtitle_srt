Yinchuan, are you in there?

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,350
How could you come in?

14
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,280
I called you from outside,
but you didn't respond,

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,430
so I came in.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,120
Don't come over. I am naked.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,760
I want to borrow some money from you.

I don't want to talk to my father.

No problem.

20
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,200
I will send the servant
to take it to you later.

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,430
You are really nice to me, Yichuan.

I also want...

you gave me two years ago.

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
I have kept it,

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,480
something urgent happened
in the Chamber of Commerce.

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
You need to handle it.

69
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,430

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
What should I do?

74
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,240
What should I do?

75
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,190
Don't leave me alone!

Sister!

77
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,630
Miss Lu, may I ask

78
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
why you are in my room?

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
What do you mean, Miss Lu?

80
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,070
This sum of money is enough for you
to spend for two lifetimes.

81
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,630
Take the money

82
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,120
and get out of our house!

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,390
It is a large sum of money.

84
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,560
I have never seen so much money.

85
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,430
If I had owned so much money,

86
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,040
that matter wouldn't have happened.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,040
Get out of here with the money.

88
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,070
I don't want to see you again
in Nancheng.

89
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,630
You...

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,240
Why are you laughing?

91
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,870
Do you really think

92
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,240
I came to your house
for such a small sum of money?

93
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,750
You...

94
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,480
How dare you give me a slap!

95
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,630
Su Kenian, let's wait and see.

96
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,190
Darling, shall I give you a massage?

97
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,560
I have neglected you for the past while.

98
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,840
It is unfair to you.

99
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,150
It is nothing.

100
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,910
I am happy as long as I am around you.

101
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,550
After you get well,

102
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,480
I will go wait upon you.

103
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,670
Darling, when did you

104
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,120
begin to have the headache?

105
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,670
About two years ago.

106
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,670
It was an unforgettable event.

107
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,240
All right.

108
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,840
I'd rather not bring it up.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,270
Anyway, the illness
has stayed with me since then.

110
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,790
Let me.

111
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,240
Your lighter?

112
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
A friend gave it to me.

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,080
What's wrong?

114
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,390
Nothing.

115
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,080
Dad.

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,600
What brought you here?

117
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,120
Come on, Yichuan.

118
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,510
Come here and sit down.

119
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,120
How long has it been

120
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,720
since we sat together and chatted

121
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,910
last time?

122
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,320
After I proposed
the transformation

123
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
of the Chamber of Commerce,
you seldom came here.

124
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,360
I thought about it.

125
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,630
I came to realize that

126
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,030
you were right.

127
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,510
It is true
that our Chamber of Commerce

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,440
should turn to safer business.

129
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,790
Therefore,

130
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,510
I want you to go abroad

131
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,200
to explore the overseas market
for our family.

132
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,840
What?

133
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,870
Isn't this what you have long wanted?

134
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,120
It is only that I think

135
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
if I leave just after your return,

136
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,870
others will reckon
we are not on good terms.

137
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,200
To do great things,

138
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,150
you can't afford to mind these things.

139
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,440
As for our relationship,

140
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,440
it's our own affair.

141
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,120
Is there anything at home

142
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,200
that is holding you back?

143
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,120
Our Chamber of Commerce
is an easy target because of its power.

144
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,910
Some people have already
taken action against you.

145
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,960
I am afraid after I leave,

146
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,960
you won't be safe left alone.

147
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,000
After you leave,

148
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,960
Kenian and all of us

149
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
will be safe.

150
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,870
This lighter

151
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,720
is the only thing
left behind by your father.

152
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,670
Luckily, Kenian found it.

153
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,150
If you lose it,

154
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,200
you will be at a loss.
