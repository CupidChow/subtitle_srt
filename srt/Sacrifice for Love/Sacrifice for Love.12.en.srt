00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,660
(The More Children, the More Happiness)

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,960
It's not a place where anyone

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
can get in.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,470
Then why can you get in,
Concubine Zhang?

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,840
You are no match for me.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
I've been with Master
for so many years.

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,120
He values me and trusts me.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,150
How long have you been with him?

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,070
You don't have strong feelings at all.

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,680
He made me host the party today,

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,510
and he will allow me
to enter the attic another day.

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,920
Only people with the jade pendant

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,680
can enter the attic.

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,870
And this jade pendant

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,230
can only be held

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,590
by the hostess of the Lu family.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Don't think you can be a member
of the Lu family

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,280
because you married him

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,510
with your pretty face.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,040
An outsider is an outsider after all.

32
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,840
We wish you a happy marriage…

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,560
- And a son soon.
- Congratulations!

34
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,190
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,710
Please take your seats, everyone.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,190
Wish you a happy marriage.

37
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,280
Thank you, Grandma.

38
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,710
Wish you a happy marriage.

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,120
Thank you, Grandma.

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,910
Xiaoqian.

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,360
(Yang Wen, Old Madam of Lu Family)
You are getting married soon.

42
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,910
Come stay with me

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
for a few days before the wedding.

44
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,800
I'd love to.

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,400
Anyway, Concubine Su

46
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,310
will take care of my wedding.

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,960
Right, Concubine Su?

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,520
Yes.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,430
I'm sure Yichuan will be happy about it.

50
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,840
Kenian,

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,470
come over here.

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,400
This is a fertility talisman
I got from a temple.

53
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,310
Don't be like Zhang Rong.

54
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,520
She's been married to Lu Ding
for more than ten years,

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,190
but hasn't had any child yet.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,430
You are young.

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,190
I hope you can give birth
to one or two children soon,

58
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,310
so I won't let Lu Ding's father down.

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,960
Great. I want a younger brother, too.

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,470
Kenian is still young,

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,000
so I don't think she wants children now.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,590
Mom, don't put too much pressure on her.

63
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,520
Are you tired now?

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,840
Let me help you get some rest.

65
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,750
I don't need your help.

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,520
Grandma, let me help you.

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,150
Take care, Mom.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,680
- Mom, take care.
- Okay.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,780
Make sure they are in place.

70
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,000
(Smith, Foreign Merchant)
Don't make any mistakes.

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,030
Yes.

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,520
Smith? Why is he here?

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,400
This is a big day for the Lu family.

74
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,750
I'm here to send my blessings
and a kind reminder to Mr. Lu.

75
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,750
Don't forget our business.

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
If my memory serves right,

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
I sent someone

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,120
to tell Mr. Smith
about the delayed delivery

79
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,560
a few days ago.

80
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,270
I thought the most important thing
for a businessman is credit.

81
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,510
Are you going to

82
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,120
break your word?

83
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,510
Today's a big day for the Lu family.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,830
So no business today.

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
All right?

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,800
I don't care what day it is today.

87
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,950
I just want to ask one question.

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,800
This business is done or not done?

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,040
- It's a clock.
- Someone!

90
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
How ominous!

91
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,680
Good morning, Mr. Smith.

92
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,040
May I introduce myself?

93
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,160
My name is Su Kenian.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,950
I've heard a lot about you.

95
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,800
You're good at English.

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,430
You're good at Chinese.

97
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,160
Mr. Smith,

98
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,510
would you like to chat over a drink?

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
No wonder Mr. Lu
is not interested in business.

100
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,240
Turns out there's a beauty at home.

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,430
What are you doing?

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
Do you want to start a fight?

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Boss, the smuggled wine was detained.

104
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,070
In Nancheng, we and only we

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,870
can do all the business.

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,120
Don't expect anyone to replace us.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,310
If you dare to be rude to Miss Su again,

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,680
I promise you won't be able to
return home.

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,800
We are on the same side.

110
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,920
Put away the weapons.

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,390
Harmony brings wealth.

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Put away your guns.

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,720
If Mr. Lu had delivered the goods
on time,

114
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,190
there wouldn't have been
such a misunderstanding today.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,310
Mr. Smith,

116
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,310
you may not know,

117
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,720
but when we do business here,

118
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,870
the more we value it,

119
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,000
the more we value auspicious dates,

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
because that will help
our business go smoothly.

121
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,430
Mr. Lu found a Fengshui master

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,160
to choose an auspicious day

123
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,830
to deliver the goods.

124
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,830
Really?

125
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,480
Concubine Su has bought

126
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,750
a talisman for Mr. Smith.

127
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,920
It can be used as a lucky charm

128
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,680
to ensure smooth business

129
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,680
at the dock in the future.

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
That accounts for it.

131
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,310
Mr. Lu, you are not enough of a friend!

132
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,120
Concubine Su is such a nice woman.

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,920
You should introduce her to me earlier.

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,600
That's because Mr. Smith
didn't give me the chance before.

135
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,190
Since you are here today,

136
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,160
let's have a few drinks.

137
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,390
This way, please.

138
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,390
Great.

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,510
Dad, Dad!

140
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,000
Let me go!

141
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,720
Don't look at this.

142
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,040
Young master,

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
more and more people are dying recently.

144
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,680
Time is running out.

145
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,040
We can't wait anymore.

146
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,070
We've tried so many times before,

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,950
but we never managed to enter the attic.

148
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,270
As long as Miss Gu
can get the jade pendant,

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
we'll be able to approach it.

150
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,800
No one can put her in danger!

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,920
I'll do it myself.

152
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,360
