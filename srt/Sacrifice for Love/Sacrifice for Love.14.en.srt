(Getting the Jade Token,
Aren't You Happy?)

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,520
Yichuan is right.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,790
Search her room and we'll know.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,470
If it is found,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
this woman must be driven away.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,710
Our Lu family doesn't need
such a person.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,000
Now I want to find the account book

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,310
and don't want to discuss

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,590
whether to drive Su Kenian away or not.

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,710
Master, the account book was found.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,710
It was in Concubine Su's room.

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,920
Darling,

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
I was framed by someone.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,200
Someone must have put it

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,510
in my room.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,710
What are your grounds
for saying that?

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,760
Now we have the witness
and physical evidence.

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,430
- I...
- Concubine Su,

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,710
if you admit your mistake honestly,

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,510
Dad will let you off.

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,920
Nian, I will ask you for the last time.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
Why on earth did you enter the attic?

33
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,230
I thought it was unfair.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,840
I am also your concubine.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
Why could Zhang Rong enter the attic

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,310
while I couldn't?

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
She told me

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,590
it was because you treat me
as an outsider

39
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,960
and I am unworthy of it.

40
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,030
I didn't believe it at first.

41
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,680
But now,

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,000
I have to believe it.

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,870
Darling,

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,750
the attic was guarded.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
You should know clearly
I couldn't get in.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,430
However, now you

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,400
are really suspecting me.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,750
Fine.

49
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,520
I guess I've loved you unilaterally.

50
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,870
You can say I entered the attic

51
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,360
and took the account book as you like.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,840
You can do whatever you want to me.

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,560
Darling,

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,910
she is playing the victim.

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,470
Don't fall for her trick.

56
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,120
The account book is blank.

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Look carefully.

58
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,030
Master.

59
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Concubine Zhang

60
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,000
asked me to put it
in Concubine Su's room.

61
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,470
There is also a letter

62
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,190
used to snitch
on the Chamber of Commerce.

63
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,470
Chun.

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,470
- How dare you betray me!
- Concubine Zhang.

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,800
I am in Lu family's debt,

66
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,840
so I can't let you ruin it.

67
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,870
Explain this.

68
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,470
Darling,

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,750
I admit I took the account book,

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,560
but I didn't write
the whistle-blowing letter.

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,030
I didn't write it.

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,120
Servant!

73
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,560
Throw all her things out of my house!

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,400
- Darling!
- Yes.

75
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,910
I will divorce her today.

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,120
Darling,

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,590
I beg you to consider

78
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,870
our conjugal affection over the years.

79
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,510
I beg you to spare me!

80
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,950
If it were not for our conjugal love,

81
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,600
I would kill you.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
Give me the jade token.

83
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't make me wait.

84
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,160
Hurry!

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Darling, I beg you.

86
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,430
I, I beg you.

87
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,680
I beg you to let me off

88
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,480
considering I've tended
the Chamber of Commerce

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
and the dock for so many years.

90
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,920
You abandoned me.

91
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,040
You caused all this.

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,190
I will kill you!

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,720
Wipe the floor clean.

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,870
By then, you should induce
Concubine Zhang

95
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,830
to frame Concubine Su
using the account book.

96
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,950
I will take care of the rest.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
Rest assured, young master.

98
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,830
If you and Concubine Su
had said nothing,

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,480
I would have died that day.

100
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,870
What's wrong? Are you still angry?

101
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,040
Sorry.

102
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,510
I did it wrong today.

103
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,070
I shouldn't have suspected you.

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,120
You have been lying to me.

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,390
Despite your usual sweet talk,

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,830
you treat me as an outsider.

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,800
You just don't believe me.

108
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,560
I have never doubted you.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,600
I just didn't want to tire you.

110
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,070
Look!

111
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,600
This is the jade token
of the Chamber of Commerce.

112
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,950
I'll give it to you now.

113
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,800
You really won't doubt me again?

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,950
Of course.

115
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
All right.
I'll believe you once more.

116
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,950
OK. Go get some rest.

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
I have something to do.

118
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,120
Let me help you.

119
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,630
Luckily, the wound is not deep.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,360
Bear with it.

121
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,920
Does it hurt?

122
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,360
What's it?

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
You can enter the attic
with the jade token now.

124
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,480
You should be happy.

125
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
I am happy.

126
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,480
You are lying.

127
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,510
I am not.

128
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,150
Are you afraid?

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,510
Though we had anticipated

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,870
all the reactions of Lu Ding,

131
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,240
we didn't expect that he would

132
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,080
gun down Concubine Zhang.

133
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,320
He did that to Concubine Zhang today.

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,270
He won't go easy on you.

135
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,270
I have no way to ensure

136
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,960
I can keep you safe every time.

137
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,750
You want me to give up?

138
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,270
I have made it so far.

139
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,000
Even if the road ahead is dangerous,

140
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,550
I can't turn back.

141
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
I am afraid you'll regret it.

142
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
I won't.

143
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,550
Stop pushing me away, all right?

144
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,120
OK.

145
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,270
