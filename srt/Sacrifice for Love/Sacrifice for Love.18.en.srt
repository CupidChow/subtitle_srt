(Who Killed Master Lu?)

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,840
Does it look good on me?

13
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,090
Move.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Shake a leg.

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,480
Move!

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,310
Hurry! Hurry up.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,430
Go in! Keep up!

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Hurry. Stop dawdling.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,480
Hurry up.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,230
Go in.

(Bill of Lading)

23
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,870
Stop the deal.

24
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,510
Bad news about Master Lu.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,200
What?

26
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,590
Master Lu passed away.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,960
Is this my father?

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,030
What happened to him?

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Someone found him by the river.

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
How come this happened?

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,190
Mr. Smith.

32
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,310
Dad!

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,910
Where are you going?

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,470
Since Lu Ding died,

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
the deal ended naturally.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
You killed my uncle.

37
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,000
And now you killed Lu Ding.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,630
I don't know what you are saying.

39
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,080
If I kill Lu Ding,
the deal will fall through.

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,360
Why should I kill him?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,750
Su Kenian,

42
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,590
aren't you keeping the jade token?

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,280
Why is it in my dad's hand?

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,470
It has long gone.

45
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,630
I have told your dad the matter.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,190
Why is it here?

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,150
Since it is a family affair,

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,630
my presence is not proper.

49
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,680
I'll be off.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,910
Su Kenian, it must be you.

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,870
You must be the murderer of my dad!

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,870
- I must, I must bury you with my dad!
- Lu Xiaoqian! Calm down!

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,750
- I'll make you...
- Take her away and let her rest.

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,870
Let go of me! Let go of me!

55
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,960
Get off me!

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,150
Lu Ding died in the same way as my dad

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
and your elder sister.

58
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,360
This suggests

59
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,240
the real murderer should be Smith.

60
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,630
If so,

61
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,400
my uncle's death

62
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,360
can be explained.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,030
Let's go stop him quickly!

64
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,710
Manqing!

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
What are we waiting for?

66
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,360
If we miss this window,

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,280
we won't have a better chance
to catch him.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,500
It's all right.

69
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,870
We can resume the transaction
with Smith.

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,000
Miss Lu has come to see me.

71
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,430
Who exactly is the boss
in your Lu family?

72
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,470
Concubine Su has been helping my dad

73
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,590
with the attic's business.

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,190
It's reasonable
to make her the chairwoman.

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,430
I have to ask Miss Lu about this.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,800
How about Yichuan?

77
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,750
He is the young master of the Lu family.

78
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,360
As far as I know,

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,750
Mr. Lu was adopted.

80
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,480
Legally,

81
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
he can't be Lu Ding's successor.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,870
He hasn't married Miss Lu.

83
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,510
Well,

84
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,240
I have things to do later.

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,950

(Xue Fuming's Law Firm)

87
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,630
You've been here since you came back.

88
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,870
You haven't had a meal.

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,310
What's on your mind?

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,510
You can have some meal.

91
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,830
I really have no appetite.

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,270
I made the noodles myself.

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Have a taste.

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,430
What's wrong?

95
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,360
My lips are numb.

96
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,680
Well,

97
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,270
are they so spicy?

98
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,560
Let me have a look.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Do you feel better now?

100
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,560
Have a taste, here.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,310
Soggy noodles won't be tasty.

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,980
Come on.

103
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,870
Don't mind the Chamber of Commerce.

104
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,040
Leave it to me.

105
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,830
Have a good rest.

106
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,190
You should also be careful.

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,630
Thank you for coming, uncles.

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,240
From now on, the Chamber of Commerce

111
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,950
will need your support.

112
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,270
We are here
for Mr. Lu Ding's funeral today

113
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,510
and are not in the mood
to discuss these with you.

114
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,680
Su Kenian, you jinx!

115
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,240
You don't deserve to stand here.

116
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,750
Are you out of your mind?

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Xiaoqian,

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
how can you speak
to your stepmother this way

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,430
in front of your late father?

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,920
She killed my father.

121
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,800
What?

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,920
You got it wrong. She didn't do it.

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,270
Yichuan! Yichuan!

124
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Yichuan is tired.

125
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,480
Take him away and let him rest.

126
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,830
Lu Xiaoqian, what are you doing?

127
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Bring in the witness.

128
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,480
Ah Fu,

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,360
tell us all you saw

130
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,830
on that day.

131
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,040
On that day,

132
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
I was working in the kitchen.

133
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,040
Then I saw Concubine Su

134
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,070
put poison into Master Lu's cup.

135
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,600
My dad's face is swollen after death.

136
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,270
It was proved that the cause of death

137
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
is not drowning but poison.

138
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,320
Therefore,

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,480
you are the real murderer!

140
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,080
I didn't go to the kitchen that day

141
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,080
and I didn't kill your dad.

142
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,510
Where is the evidence?

143
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,200
How can you prove

144
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,270
you didn't go to the kitchen that day?

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,120
Lock this woman up!

146
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll bury her with my father tomorrow!

147
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,390
