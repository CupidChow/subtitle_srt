(This box belongs to my elder sister.)

14
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,310
(Lu Ding's affection
for my sister is real.)

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,560
(Then why did he kill her?)

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,960
(Could Lu Yichuan lie to me?)

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Brother,

18
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,080
why are you here?

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
How did it go?

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,430
None of Concubine Zhang's people

21
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,190
is in the Chamber of Commerce now.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Got it.

23
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,120
But I have to tell you one thing.

24
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,630
After Gu Manxi died,

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,470
someone withdrew all her money
from the bank.

26
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,960
I, I just found it out.

28
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,960
This means that Gu Manxi

29
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,520
may have other kin.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,750
It doesn't matter anyway.

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,030
After all, back then,

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,870
we left nothing behind.

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,240
Whether this person knows
what happened or not,

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,120
he must be found and killed.

35
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,400
But brother,

36
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,590
how do we find this person?

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
Let's put on a show
to lure the person out.

38
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,750
Only a dead person
can keep a secret forever.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,310
What do you want?

40
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,190
Mrs. Lu,

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,840
someone reported a case
from two years ago.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,900
As per the rules,

43
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,360
we have to take away
relevant physical evidence.

44
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,470
We won't trouble Mr. Lu.

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,710
Please cooperate with us.

46
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,630
Take the stuff.

47
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,590
You...

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,710
Listen up, everybody!

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,150
You shall all go to the police station
to keep watch.

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,240
If anyone goes to claim the stuff,

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,680
as my elder brother said,

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,390
you shall kill the person
without hesitation.

53
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,920
Got it?

54
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,040
Yes, sir!

55
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,380
(Nancheng Police Station)

56
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Lu Yichuan, what are you doing?

57
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,000
I wanted to ask you the same.

58
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm going to find the police

59
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,000
to get my sister's stuff back.

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
Didn't you find this is a trap?

61
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,800
You are lying to me again.

62
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,600
Lu Ding loved my sister.

63
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,190
He couldn't have killed my sister.

64
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,120
It's you.

65
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,560
It's you who never wanted me
to find out

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
the truth about the past.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
You don't believe me?

68
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,920
Why should I believe you?

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,310
You said you didn't kill my sister,

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,830
but I saw with my own eyes

71
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,070
you fire at her.

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,680
Then tell me

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,190
how my sister died.

74
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,950
I didn't shoot.

75
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,480
I know

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
no matter how I explain it now,

77
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,720
you won't believe me.

78
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,310
How can I believe you?

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,510
You have been lying to me.

80
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,560
Lu Yichuan, let go of me.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
I can't let you go to your death.

82
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:37,920
You are useless!

83
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,750
Uncle, allow me to explain.

84
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,600
She is not...

85
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,480
Not what?

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
What is there to explain?

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,070
What should I say about you?

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,430
Why are you still seeing each other?

89
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,360
Between my elder brother

90
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
and my nephew,

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,560
who should I help?

92
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,870
We just came across each other.

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,720
OK.

94
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,190
You met by chance.

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
You never saw me.

96
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,430
You know your father.

97
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,800
If he finds this out,

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,630
either she

99
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
or you will die.

100
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,040
What's more important than life?

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,830
Leave quickly.

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,830
I never saw you.

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,430
If I see you do this again,

104
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,600
don't blame me for not helping you.

105
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,240
Got it, Uncle.

106
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,190
Wait. Leave separately.

107
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,560
How come nobody showed up?

108
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,510
You are good for nothing!

109
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,950
I can see you want to be fired.

110
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Mr. Lu,

111
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,480
though we didn't catch the person today,

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,480
I found out another thing.

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,260
(Household Registration Survey Form)

114
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,870
Su Kenian's identity is fake?

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,480
Brother.

116
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,240
How did it go?

117
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,830
Is it done?

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,630
I led our men and waited all day,

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,600
but we saw nobody.

120
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,310
But I...

121
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,630
So,

122
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,830
you failed.

123
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,310
All right. Go back to get some rest.

124
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,240
I never

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,070
count on you to succeed.

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
Brother, though I didn't catch
the person,

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,630
I found one thing.

128
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,040
What thing?

129
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,390
It's about Su Ke...

130
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,750
Have some tea.

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,190
No, thanks.

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,070
I can't drink it.

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,310
Brother, our Chamber of Commerce
is not in peace these days.

134
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,510
This home

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,310
is not safe, either.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Take care. I'll be off.

137
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,390
OK. Stay safe.

138
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,270
Nian,

139
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,830
something has happened
to the dock recently.

140
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,160
At such a time,

141
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,160
you'd better not come here.

142
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,080
Got it.

143
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,750
I will do what you say.

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,720
Who on earth is Su Kenian?

145
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,150
What exactly is her purpose
for joining the Lu family?

146
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,440
Mr. Lu.

147
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,150

148

who always shout into my ear,

149
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't do my work well.

150
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,750
Here's the thing.

151
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,390
- Go look into Su Kenian's background.
- Yes, sir!

152
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,480
Wait.

153
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,150
Remember

154
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,670
my brother mustn't know

155
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,440
- you are investigating Su Kenian.
- Yes, sir!

156
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,320
Wait!

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,750
One more thing.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Don't let the others know

159
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,200
I asked you to investigate her.

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,910
Got it.

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,080
Wait.

162
