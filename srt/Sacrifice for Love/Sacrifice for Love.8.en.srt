I was so desperate

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,160
when I thought I would lose you.

41
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,720
I was thinking about it on my way here.

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,630
I thought you were really…

43
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,480
What should I do?

44
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,200
I couldn't think of anything.

45
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,560

46
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,190
Thank God you are alive.

47
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,510
You've always wanted to kill me.

as long as you can wake up,

50
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,120
you can kill me anytime you like,

51
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,870
because I love you.

52
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,190
Yichuan!

Manqing.

54
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,480
It's okay, it's okay.

55
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,600
Yichuan, please don't leave!

56
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,430
I'm here!

57
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,360
It's okay, Manqing. It's okay.

58
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,120
I'm going to prepare some medicine.
I'll be right back.

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,560
Useless!

60
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,800
Now I have to do it myself.

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,310
Yichuan, you are finally back.

62
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,510
Lu Xiaoqian, I've warned you
not to hurt her.

63
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,310
This is the first time
you pointed a gun at me.

64
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,600
Are you going to kill me?

65
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,040
I will.

66
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,720
Then she dies, too.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,040
You can't kill two people
with one shot after all.

68
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,800
Put the gun down and let's talk.

69
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,830
I won't.

70
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,560
You won't listen to me if I put it down.

71
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,560
What do you want?

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
You know clearly what I want.

73
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,900
I love you.

74
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,310
I give all my love to you.

75
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,800
I treat you so well.

76
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,980
But you still don't want to marry me.

77
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,000
Why?

78
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,750
You can hate me.

79
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,340
I don't hate you.

80
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,310
I can't hate you.

81
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,680
So I hate her.

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,270
She is the reason for everything.

83
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,630
Lu Yichuan,
I finally found your weakness.

84
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,380
So don't worry.

85
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,360
I won't kill her now.

86
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,020
I want to make a deal with you,

87
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,720
using her life.

88
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,750
What is it?

89
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,620
Even if I can't win your heart,

90
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,120
I want you.

91
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,950
I want you to marry me.

92
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,480
Otherwise, you know what will happen.

93
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,630
Xiaoqian! Stop!
Put the gun down!

94
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,680
I won't!

95
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,310
You…

96
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,480
Dad, you hired a killer to kill Yichuan.

97
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,070
Why must I go soft on Su Kenian?

98
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,140
Don't move.

99
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,510
You both think she's precious,

100
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
but she's nothing in my eyes.

101
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,270
Lu Yichuan, I am not a patient person
and you know it.

102
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,540
I'll count down to three.

103
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,950
If you don't agree,

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,120
I'll kill her.

105
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Three.

106
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,630
Two.

107
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,670
Yichuan!

108
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,790
I agree!

109
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,840
Really?

110
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,150

111
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,270

112
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,440
