(Lu Yichuan, Don't Die)

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,920
Let go of me.

13
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,150
What do you want?

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,400
There is no time.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,680
Hurry to leave.

16
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,560
You are anxious to send me away.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,150
Lu Yichuan,

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,350
are you worried that if I stay,

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,840
I may find out the truth
about the past?

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,870
My uncle is investigating you.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,350
You can't use
Su Kenian's identity for long.

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,870
After your cover is blown,

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,510
you won't have any chance to leave.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,430
I have made arrangements.

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,950
Lu Ding's men won't find you.

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,150
No, I can't leave.

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,230
If I leave,

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
all my efforts will go to waste.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,510
- Manqing.
- Manqing?

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
- Are you all right?
- Gu Manqing.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,580
- Let me take a look.
- Gu Manxi's younger sister.

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,920
Are you all right?

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,150
Why is your hand injured?

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
I am fine. You leave quickly.

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,710
You are not fine.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
Lu Yichuan,
don't you know you are injured?

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,630
(Yichuan can't get entangled
with her anymore.)

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,150
(It is too dangerous.)

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,470
Let's go back to apply medicine.

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,870
Let's go.

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,080
Move.

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,520
Move.

43
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,310
Hurry up.

44
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,680
This is odd.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,430
Why need I hide?

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,750
Shouldn't they hide?

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Yichuan, I am back.

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,710
Did you miss me?

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,120
His hand is injured.
Don't touch him.

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,590
Why are you injured again?

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,710
Did you bring Yichuan bad luck?

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,750
Bad things happen to him
whenever he is with you.

53
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,190
I got myself injured.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,430
It has nothing to do with her.

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,190
You're a jinx.

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,150
What did you say?

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,910
You were also frightened today.

58
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't wander off.

59
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,630
Go back early for a rest.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,400
But your wound...

61
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,400
Concubine Su, don't worry.

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,030
I'll apply medicine
to Yichuan's wound.

63
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,430
No need.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,750
Stay away from Lu Yichuan!

65
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,840
Yichuan!

66
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,030
Uncle.

67
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,840
Hurry to break off with Su Kenian.

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,310
Don't get too close to her.

69
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,190
What's wrong?

70
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,870
Did you find anything?

71
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,280
The dancer who died here back then
was Gu Manxi.

72
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,430
Is Su Kenian's real name

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
Gu Manqing?

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
She's Gu Manxi's younger sister.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,910
She definitely thinks

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,590
you killed her sister.

77
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,430
Therefore, she approached you

78
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,470
to seek revenge on you.

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,470
I watched you grow up.

80
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,360
You've been unsophisticated.

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,430
It's normal for you
to fall for her trick.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,390
You mustn't go see her today.

83
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,950
I will handle this matter.

84
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,360
Yichuan,

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,310
you are the successor
of our Lu family.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,160
Don't do stupid things for a woman.

87
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,680
Got it?

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Mr. Lu,

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,510
why are you here?

90
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,430
You are not Su Kenian,

91
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,120
but the sister of the dead Gu Manxi.

92
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,310
Your name is Gu Manqing.

93
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,750
You used every ploy to come here

94
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,360
to avenge your sister's death, right?

95
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,630
I don't know what you are saying.

96
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,560
Stop playacting!

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,920
I don't know

98
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,040
whether you'll stop acting

99
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,240
when the bullet of my gun

100
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,040
goes through your head.

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,430
Yichuan,

102
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,800
how could you shoot me?

103
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,800
I can't let you hurt her.

104
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,720
I am your uncle.

105
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,680
You shouldn't shoot me in any case!

106
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
I must kill her today!

107
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,870
Uncle,

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,390
let her go.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,360
Snap out of it, Yichuan!

110
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,950
She came to kill you!

111
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,160
Kill them! Kill them all!

112
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,430
The foreigner's killer is here.

113
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,680
Leave quickly. I'll cover you.

114
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,120
- Uncle, be careful.
- Hurry to leave.

115
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,070
You get off the ship first.
I'll go help my uncle.

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,190
Go.

117
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,160
Go quickly.

118
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,870
Uncle.

119
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Uncle!

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,310
Yichuan.

121
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,190
Kid,

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
don't look at such a scene.

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,190
Dad!

124
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,870
Dad!

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
Don't look at such a scene, kid.

126
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,680
Manqing,

127
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Yichuan didn't kill your sister.

128
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,560
Don't misunderstand him.

129
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,600
Uncle!

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,360
Uncle!

131
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,630
Lu Yichuan, you got shot.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
Let's leave.

Yichuan, are you all right?

Yichuan,

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,390
I know you are sad.
