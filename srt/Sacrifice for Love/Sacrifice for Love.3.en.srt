(I Am Using Your Bathroom)

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,110
Darling,

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,470
I will do it myself.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,430
(If he really wants to shag me,)

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,710
(I will have to take action first.)

(Lu Xiaoqian, Lu Ding's daughter)

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,870
I object to the marriage.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,280
Xiaoqian!

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,430
Why are you back?

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,350
If someone hadn't tipped me off

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,950
I'd still be in the dark.

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,680
You temptress,

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,870
how dare you seduce my father!

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,590
Darling, who is she?

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,070
She is my only daughter.

26
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,230
Her name is Lu Xiaoqian.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Dad, you ever said

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,590
you wouldn't remarry after mum died.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,070
But now,

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,070
you are not satisfied with one concubine

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,590
and want to get a second one.

32
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,230
You...

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Look at her!

34
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,350
She and I are the same age.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,870
Why don't you think about

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,870
her purpose of marrying into
our Lu family?

37
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,480
Xiaoqian,

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,040
I usually pamper you too much.

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,400
If you continue with your mischief,

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,870
I will have to teach you a lesson.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
Fine, come on!

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,230
You...

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,430
Mum,

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
I ask your soul in heaven to look.

45
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,840
Dad is going to beat me
for another woman's sake.

46
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,070
It's all your fault!

47
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,590
You are also defending her.

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,280
If I am not welcome in the Lu family,

49
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,680
I can leave.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,960
I don't want to see the Lu family
use guns because of me.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
You can't touch this.

52
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,240
Outrageous!

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,470
It's outrageous!

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,400
You, you all bully me!

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,470
I will kill myself!

56
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,800
Xiaoqian!

57
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,190
Xiaoqian!

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,910
From now on, you mustn't
carry a gun in this house.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,560
Dad,

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
you'd better go check upon her.

61
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,870
Xiaoqian!

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
Chun has asked around.

63
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,150
Miss Lu went back hurriedly last night.

64
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,710
Then she dashed into
Miss Su and Master's room.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,000
Thus, Miss Su and Master

66
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,630
didn't have time to sleep together.

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,520
They didn't sleep together?

68
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,560
Nice to know that.

69
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,030
I will help them with a second try.

70
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,840
Young master,

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,630
what you want has been prepared.

72
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,910
Is the dosage in the safe range?

73
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,400
Will it cause humans any harm?

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,240
Rest assured.
It has been tested several times.

75
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,960
Young master, it is obvious

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
that you didn't kill
Miss Gu's elder sister.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,190
Why didn't you explain it to her?

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,520
If I tell her,

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,310
she will surely choose to dig deeper.

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
She is in the open
while the murderer is in hiding.

81
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,710
If people find out

82
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,630
the dancer who died back then
is her elder sister,

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,910
she will be killed, too.

84
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,030
However, if you leave things like this,

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,750
Miss Gu will wrong you and hate you.

86
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,070
I'd rather let her hate me

87
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,390
than let her fall into danger.

88
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,750
Because I won't hurt her.

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Has the car been prepared?

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,680
I will send her away today.

91
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,560
Yes, it is ready.

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Excuse me, young master.

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
Our master wants to see you
about something.

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
He wants you to wait for him here.

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,950
What is this?

96
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,560
Our master usually relieves his headache
with sandalwood incense,

97
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,480
so it has to be lighted in advance.

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,870
Make it last longer.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
I want my husband to see it.

100
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,310
Rest assured. I know what to do.

101
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,430
It seems that the drug began to work.

102
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,800
I didn't expect
the third concubine is so beautiful.

103
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,720
It seems that I got lucky.

104
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Who are you? Don't come close.

105
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,830
- If you come close, I'll kill you.
- If I don't go close,

106
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,190
how can I serve you?

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,070
(No.)

108
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,510
(I can't show myself.)

109
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,950
- Don't come close!
- Let me make you happy.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,630
Who, who are you?

111
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,870
How dare you touch her!

112
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,950
Concubine Zhang asked me to do this.

113
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,310
Please let me off.

114
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,390
Are you all right?

115
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,270
I feel very hot.

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,070
(It is the aphrodisiac incense.)

117
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,830

Mistress.

154

Yichuan,

155
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,360
why is your hair wet?

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
What do you want to see me about?

157
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,150
Yichuan,

158
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,240
can you ask my father to drive out
Su Kenian?

159
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,670
It's up to Dad.
I have no right to interfere.

160
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,840
I have things to attend to
in the Chamber of Commerce.

161
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,030
Excuse me.

162
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,790
In fact,

163
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,510
I want her to leave not for my own sake,

164
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,600
but for your sake.

165
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,840
For my sake?

166
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,360
When you marry me,

167
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,080
you will own the Chamber of Commerce.

168
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,080
But now the woman came from nowhere
and got in the way.

169
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
How can she be allowed to?

170
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,360
I have always seen you
as a younger sister.

171
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,390
I have a crush on someone else.

172
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
(The situation is explosive.
Take over the Chamber of Commerce asap.)

173
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,340
(All parties are eager for action.
Implement the plan earlier any minute.)

174
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,150
Have you got the information?

175
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,870
Well,

176
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,000
near the wharf,

177
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
another corpse packed in a sack
was found

178
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,390
Did it die in the same way
as Manqing's sister Manxi?

179
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,120
Yes. How come you know?

180
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,790
My father died in the same way.

181
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,030
Dad!

182
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,200
Dad!

183
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,790
Therefore, two years ago,

184
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,150
I opened the sack

185
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,080
with Manxi's corpse in it.

186
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
Now the evidence has been destroyed.

187
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,480
The murderer of Manxi and my father

188
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,320
is still at large.

189
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,840
Our men has been looking into it.

190
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,670
However, we were never able to

191
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
get near to the Lu family's attic.

192
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,870
Over the years,

193
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,030
I have never gone up there.

194
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,790
There should be clues in the attic.

195
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,840
I will handle this matter.

196
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,840
You continue to keep an eye on the dock.

197
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,270
Yes, sir.

198
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,510
Why are you still here?

199
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,080
I am using your bathroom.

200
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,120
On the first day
when I entered this house,

201
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,960
you informed Lu Xiaoqian.

202
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,840
Today you beat the man
who assaulted me.

203
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,080
You tried to save me and drive me out.

204
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,320
What on earth do you want?

205
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,630
I want to protect you.

206
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,960
Gu Manqing,

207
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,910
you are playing with fire.

208
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,510
