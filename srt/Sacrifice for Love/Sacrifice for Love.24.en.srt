Yichuan!

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
You don't have much time left.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Say anything if you want.

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,070
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,510
I should've given the ring to you
two years ago.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,070
Now,

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
you are finally my wife.

19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,000
Promise me

20
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,400
to live your life well.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,590
Don't do anything stupid.

22
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,430
Yichuan.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,430
Lu Ding,

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,230
I hope you can keep your word.

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,350
Of course, I will.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,710
Did I promise you

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,400
not to kill her?

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,520
How could I possibly spare you?

29
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,560
I want to watch you suffer

30
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,120

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,840

Don't worry.

33
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,840
Gu Manqing will reunite with you later

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,310

36
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,680

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Master!

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,280
A lot of people are coming!

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,470
What?

40
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,400
- Stop them!
- Yes!

41
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,030
So you've been stalling all this time!

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Kill them, now!

43
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,360
Freeze!

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,520
Master!

45
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,930
Move.

46
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,810
Move.

47
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,150
Hurry!

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,560
Yichuan,

49
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
what is going on?

50
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,630
We decided

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
to arrest Lu Ding
after we get evidence

52
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,470
of his crime.

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,800
This is hard evidence

54
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,150
that Lu Ding trafficked our compatriots

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,560
and killed Gu Manxi.

56
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,870
Lu Yichuan!

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Do you know what you are doing?

58
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,470
You...

59
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,560
I know clearly.

60
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm avenging

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
the death of Gu Manqing's sister,

62
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,710
exposing the murderer of my father,

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,750
consoling my uncle in heaven,

64
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,150

for the compatriots

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,240
you've harmed!

66
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,150
What about you?

67
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,710
Are you aware

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,830
of the consequences you have to bear?

69
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Yichuan!

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,620
Yichuan!

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Lu Ding, I'm killing you!

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,630
Manqing, don't kill me!

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Manqing!

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,950
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have killed your sister.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,920
It was my fault!

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Please forgive me!

77
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,430
Don't kill me!

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,630
Don't kill me!

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,190
Don't get your hands dirty.

80
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,160
Hand him over to the organization.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,740
Yes.

82
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,190
Go to hell!

83
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,600
I'll get the doctor!

84
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,040
Yichuan,

85
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,240
are you all right?

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,750
Yichuan!

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,830
Yichuan!

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,360
Yichuan, let's go to the hospital.

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm OK. Talk to me for a while.

90

OK.
