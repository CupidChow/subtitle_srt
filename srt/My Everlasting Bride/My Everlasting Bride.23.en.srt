Ms. Yan Bingbing,

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,420
I would stay very still

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,630
if I were you.

Are you here to kill me?

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,870
Oh, I'm not.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,230
I treat people with kindness.

10

But then again,

Nie Zhen has ways of keeping you safe.

about Zhao Ying

while working undercover for three months.

45

Why are you giving it to me?

46

between Yuzhou and Hongzhou.

53

The latter won.

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,030
In a countermove, Yuzhou devised a plan
to divide the people of Hongzhou.

55
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,430
The person in charge of this operation

56
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,220

to become my old self again?
