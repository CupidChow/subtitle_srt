Mr. Shen,

you're Xiaodie's adoptive father.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,110
From what she told me,

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,640
you've been exceptionally kind to her.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,240
Thank you

13

for all you've done for her.

00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,470
Mr. Hu,

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,000
in a turbulent situation many years ago,

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,670
you made a desperate but right decision

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,030
that kept Xiaodie alive.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,430
And for 20 years, you've been
dealing with missing her alone.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,430
I am serving tea to you today

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,470
to put your mind at ease.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,640
Xiaodie is my wife.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,680
I promise I will do right by her.
