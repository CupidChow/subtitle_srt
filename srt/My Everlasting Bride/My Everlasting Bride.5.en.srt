Grand Marshal Nie.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,440
Good.

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,390
We're a family.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,030
Spare the formalities.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,000
Qingxia,

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,280
it's time for you
to address me differently.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,710
Alright, Father.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,030
Hahaha.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,110
Have a seat.

Housekeeper.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Our guests have sent you two many gifts

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,110
for your wedding.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,560
I picked

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,670
two of the more unique gifts.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm going to show them to you guys.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,640
This pair of earrings
has a history behind them.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,280
The person who gifted the earrings

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,710
said they were designed
by a famous western designer.

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,350
Hahaha.

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,640
Once Nie Zhen takes over my position
as the Grand Marshal,

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,430
this pair of earrings

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,310
will fit you well.

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,870
This is

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,560
for you.

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't like it.

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,150
Listen up.

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,640
You're going to be
a grand marshal eventually.

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,120
You have to like firearms
regardless of what you think.

32
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,950
Father,

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,480
it's mealtime.

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,280
There's no need for you
to show us this gift

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
just to remind me and Qingxia.

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,710
Hmph.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,710
What do you mean by that?

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,590
Thank you, Father.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,040
I love the gift.

40
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,590
Ah.

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
What about this?

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
I'll keep this gun

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
in my room.

44
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,590
I'll give it to the brat

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
during next year's
inauguration ceremony.

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,350
Alright.

47
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,920
What's wrong?

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
You were afraid of me before this.

49
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,590
I should be the one
asking you that question.

50
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,120
I was afraid that I might give myself
away in front of Grand Marshal Nie.

51
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,910
I was just nervous.

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,630
I don't believe
that you'll get nervous that easily.

53
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,840
It's my first time
being the wife of a young marshal.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,190
You have to pardon me.

55
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,680
By the way,

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,750
we already signed the contract.

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,430
Who do you want me to help you locate?

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm an orphan.

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,150
I was abandoned since I was young.

60
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,590
I want you to help locate
my biological parents.

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,430
That's simple.

62
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,680
But it takes time.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,120
I've been waiting for 20 years.

64
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,430
Waiting a little longer doesn't matter.

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,280
Didn't you say you have
official matters to handle today?

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,430
You should go.

67
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,030
This is my room.

68
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,560
How dare you chase me away?

69
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,310
That's right.

70
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,870
I'm chasing you away.

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,630
Bang.

72
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,800
This is a warning.

73
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,520
You'll be punished

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,240
if you dare to shoot me again.

75
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,710
Finish the task as soon as possible.

76
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,190
Young Marshal,
are you in a hurry to return home?

77
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,560
That's right.

78
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,800
Did something happen?

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,400
It's nothing.

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,840
I'm just homesick.

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,800
You're homesick?

82
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,360
But we just left your house.

83
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,030

Do you need anything?

88
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,480
Is Father around?

89
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,480
Oh, unfortunately,

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,800
the Grand Marshal went to the
division headquarters right after lunch.

91
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800
He'll only return home
tomorrow night at the earliest.

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,360
Young Madam, you can tell me
if you need anything.

93
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,920
Tomorrow night?

94
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,630
I hired someone to fetch me
a prescription for Chinese medicine.

95
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
I thought it would be beneficial
to Father's health.

96
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
That's fine.

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,800
I'll place the prescription in his room.

Mistress Nie, you're here.

102
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,560
What are you doing here?

103
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,750
I'm here to deliver a Chinese medicine
prescription to the Grand Marshal.

104
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,560
This is the Grand Marshal's room.

105
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,600
There are many
confidential documents here.

106
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,750
Didn't the young marshal

107
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,600
teach you the rules around here?

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,750
Mistress Nie, pardon me for my rudeness.

109
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,600
Judging from your tone,

110
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
it seems like you don't like Nie Zhen.

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,160
Hmph.

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
He's just a boy
who's wet behind the ears.

113
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,800
As for you, Miss Shen Qingxia,

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,360
I do know some of your secrets.

115
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,920
You better pay me
some respect around here

in the future.

117
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,870
Mistress Nie,

118
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,160
your words are quite intriguing.

119
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,870
It seems like you and
your younger brother, Shen Duoran,

120
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,390
have an immoral relationship.

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
What do you mean by this?

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,360
Are you threatening me?

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,920
Mistress Nie, you misunderstood
the relationship between me and Duoran.

124
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,190
However, you and I

125
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,070
could work together

126
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,630
on certain matters.

127
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,680
Mistress Nie, have you
lost your mind again?

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
How dare you speak
to your elder in that tone?

129
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,950
What's going on?

130
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,310
Mistress Nie

131
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,600
misunderstood me
for stealing Grand Marshal's documents.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
Young Marshal, I assume you have no idea

133
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,430
that you married a spy.

134
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,800
Did you hit her?

135
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,600
I know you don't respect me
as your stepmother.

136
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
However, if you cannot distinguish
between right and wrong,

137
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
I will ask the Grand Marshal
to be our judge.

138
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't make yourself
sound so high-sounding.

139
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
You just love to compete with people.

140
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,750
You're targeting her
because you can't win against me,

141
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,950
am I right?

142
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,720
Why don't you explain
the situation to me then?

143
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Why was she sneaking around

144
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,070
Grand Marshal's room then?

145
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,510
Young Madam was just trying to...

146
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,070
You have no right to speak here.

147
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,510
Stop bullying him.

148
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,720
Mistress Nie,
I already explained myself to you.

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,920
I was delivering a Chinese medicine
prescription to the Grand Marshal's room.

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,070
Nonsense!

151
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,920
Do you think Qingxia
needs your permission

152
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,070
to enter my father's room?

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,430
That's not what I mean.

154
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,600
But I knew that she was
definitely up to no good,

155
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,480
judging from the way she acted.

156
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,190
Nie Zhen,

157
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
this happened

158
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,360
because I wasn't considerate enough.

159
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,480
That's right.

160
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,000
Nie Ping should be

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,310
the judge here.

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,510

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,390
Of course not.

187
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,360
There are only three division commanders
under Nie Ping in all of Hongzhou.

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,630
You're the most influential of them all.

189
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,240
I have no idea
why you're being so timid.

190
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,790
Back then, Nie Ping became
the grand marshal instead of you.

191
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,030
And now,
his son is being mean to me, too.

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,000
What happened?

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,240
Did he bully you?

194
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,390
Enough. Forget about it.

195
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,750
Let's get rid of Nie Zhen
when we have the chance.

196
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,550
I suggest you keep yourself in check.

197
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
Although he's a scoundrel,

198
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,390
he's quite meticulous.

199
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,510
You shouldn't attempt anything
if you don't have...

200
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,390
Don't worry.

201
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,030
(I have)

202
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,550
(an excellent helper)

203
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,670
(with me.)

204
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,670
I wish to see
Second Young Master Shen Duoran.

205
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
I am.

206
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,790
What's wrong?

207
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,870
Are you here to arrest me already?

208
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,750
Here.

209
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,960
Second Young Master,
what are you saying?

210
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,270
I'm here to deliver a letter to you
on Young Madam's behalf.

211
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
(Second Young Master,)

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,910
(you must send everyone
in the residence away tomorrow,)

213
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
(including Mr. Shen.)

214
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
(Wait for me.)

215
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,720
(I will tell you the details
related to Young Miss)

216
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,440
(and some of Nie Zhen's arrangements.)

217
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,630
(Nie Zhen,)

218
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,960
(sometimes,)

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,390
(I do wish)

220
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,390
(that you didn't see
the medal in the drawer.)

221
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,480
(If so, things might be)

222
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
(different for us now.)

223
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
(But unfortunately,)

224
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,390
(the more perfect you try to be,)

225
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,030
(the worse the humiliation
Miss Shen will receive,)

226
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,360
(and the more painful it is for me.)

227
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,750
(And, the worse your image will be)

228
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,870
(in my heart.)

229
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,320
(Next time,)

230
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
(I will be using a real bullet.)

231
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,200
(Everything will end soon.)
