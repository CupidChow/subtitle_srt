00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:15,980
[My Everlasting Bride]

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,020
[You're just my victim.]

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,940
[Episode 3]

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,320
How does it feel

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,200
to sleep in a bathtub?

6
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,640
Young Marshal, here's your ginger tea.

7
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,790
It seems like you've forgotten
everything from yesterday.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,640
You're not afraid of me anymore?

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,840
I know you need me.

10
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,590
I just realized this.

11
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,870
So I don't have to be afraid anymore.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,350
On the contrary,

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,200
shouldn't you be afraid of me?

14
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm afraid of you?

15
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,710
Why should I be afraid of you?

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,680
My dear maid!

17
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,680
Aren't you afraid
I'll kill myself to vent my anger

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,710
and ruin your plan?

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,430
Plan?

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,430
What plan?

21
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,870
Tell me about it.

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,590
I will figure out your plan

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
and why you need me.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,710
Alright.

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,870
I'll give you 12 hours.

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,870
There's a prize for finding out.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,630
You'll probably
have a boring military meeting

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
at headquarters this morning.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
What's wrong?

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,470
Didn't you sleep last night?

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Impressive!

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Cut the crap.

33
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,150
Focus on driving.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,310
(Nie Zhen's plan seems
to be completed after tomorrow.)

35
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,710
(The urgent matter is)

36
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,120
(to figure out why he keeps me around.)

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,590
May 6th.

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,240
Feng Street Tailor Shop.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
May 7th.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,630
Centenary Wedding Dresses.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,360
(This ledger)

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,430
(seems to record all the evil deeds
done by Nie Zhen.)

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,750
(But what about the compensation?)

44
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,240
Xiaodie.

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,630
Second Young Master.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
Why are you here?

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
Nie Zhen is too dangerous.

48
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,470
Come with me.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,870
I won't leave

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
until I find the truth.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,750
I've loved you for so many years.

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,590
Why don't you trust me?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,870
Second Young Master,

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,870
I don't understand
what you're talking about,

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
nor do I want to understand.

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,360
Xiaodie.

57
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,430
You have to trust me.

58
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
What kind of agreements
did the Shen family make

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,680
with the firms in Hongzhou?

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,560
And what are the terms of default?

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
Second Young Master,

62
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm just an outsider, after all.

63
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,470
Outsider?

64
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,910
Why are you saying this?

65
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,150
Because of Nie Zhen?

66
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,190
Have you fallen in love with him?

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,720
The downfall of the Shen family
has nothing to do with me

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
but because of you.

69
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,800
Don't waste your thoughts on me anymore.

70
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,000
You're still alive.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Stop right there.

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,680
I have a few questions for you.

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Madam.

74
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,950
Please spare me.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,480
Yesterday,

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
I was just following
the Young Marshal's orders.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
If you don't cooperate now,

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,430
I'll make him come back here again.

79
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,430
(I'll cooperate.)

80
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,460
[Xiaodie's profile]

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,270
[Xiaodie's profile]
(A little maid who's smart as a whip)

82
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,270
(secretly became the backbone
of the entire Shen family.)

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,830
(Interesting.)

84
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,680
(The Young Marshal,
who appears arrogant,)

85
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,390
(actually has exceptional knowledge)

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,800
(and is kind-hearted.)

87
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,360
(So,)

88
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,750
(there is only one)

89
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,750
(possible purpose for you.)

90
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,830
This tastes the best today.

91
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,510
Stop pretending.

92
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,390
You're the Young Marshal.

93
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,270
You can't pretend
to be anything you're not.

94
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,510
Fine. Go on.

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,510
You never intended to leave
any way out for the Shen family.

96
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,480
Inside it

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,680
are records of your actions
since you returned home.

98
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,160
Today, I questioned the shops
you've bullied recently.

99
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,950
and reached a conclusion.

100
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,950
You're a good man.

101
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,630
The playboy image of yours
that circulates in the street

102
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,390
is intentionally created.

103
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,190
You've compensated

104
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,160
every shop you've bullied.

105
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,310
The owner
of the bridal shop is not dead.

106
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,600
The tailor shop is also being renovated.

107
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,600
After your return, the Grand Marshal

108
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,600
started spreading the word
among the people

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
that you'll be the next Grand Marshal.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,270
But that's not what you want.

111
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,240
(So you went to extreme lengths)

112
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,320
(to make the public)

113
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,120
(despise your character)

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,510
(to discourage)

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,950
the Grand Marshal from this idea.

116
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,360
It doesn't make much sense.

117
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,750
I'm only a Young Marshal now.

118
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,480
I'll be even more powerful
when I'm the Grand Marshal.

119
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,950
Why would I refuse?

120
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,070
The pen in your hand

121
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,270
was left to you by your mother, right?

122
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,920
She loved you the most,

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,390
and you loved her the same,

124
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,160
but she died on the battlefield.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,040
So deep down, you're a war-weary man.

126
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,270
I'm sorry

127
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
for mentioning your deceased mother.

128
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,310
You've turned my room upside down

129
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,630
in such a short time.

130
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,390
But...

131
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,870
All these are your speculations

132
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,830
and have nothing to do
with you or the Shen family.

133
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,000
So why do I need you?

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,310
You know exactly who I am.

135
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,630
Yet you staged a marriage proposal

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,680
in order to reveal my identity as a maid

137
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,160
in front of the esteemed guests
at the wedding.

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,510
And you pretended to be innocent,

139
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,360
causing a farce
that shocked the entire Hongzhou.

140
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,240
The farce you've made

141
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,190
is even more magnificent

142
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,680
and embarrassing to the Grand Marshal

143
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
than smashing 100 shops.

144
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,190
Of course,

145
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,310
the price for this

146
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,120
is the destruction of the Shen family.

147
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
But you don't care.

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,750
That's why I say

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,310
you never intended to spare
the Shen family from the beginning.

150
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,680
Put the gun away.

151
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,510
Don't break my rules.

152
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,800
But she's a danger to you now.

153
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,920
Liu Xiu.

154
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm warning you for the last time.

155
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Put the gun away

156
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
and then leave!

157
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,000
So, are you going to finish me off

158
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,070
or fulfill your reward?

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,240
What reward do you want?

160
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,120
Provide sufficient compensation

161
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,320
after you destroy the Shen family.

162
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,360
That doesn't count.

163
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,550
I would have done it anyway.

164
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,320
Fine.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
After settling the Shen family,

166
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,510
help me look into someone.

167
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,120
Of course, no problem.

168
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,030
But are you really ready
to be my victim?

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,150
I have no choice.

170
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,670
Right, Young Marshal?

171
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,180
Mr. Nie.

172
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,470
Please answer me, Mr. Nie.

173
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,050
Mr. Nie!

174
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,270
- Look. It's Mr. Nie!
- Come on.

175
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,320
Come on!

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,530
Take more pictures.

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,860
Take more pictures.

178
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,270
Tomorrow,

179
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,960
Mr. Nie and Ms Shen
will officially tie the knot.
