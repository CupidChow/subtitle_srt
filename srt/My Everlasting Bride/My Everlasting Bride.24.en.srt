00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,860
[My Everlasting Bride]

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,620
[You and I are meant to be.]

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,540
[Episode 24]

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,190
There's been
a breach of classified material

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,640
and collateral
warlord's infiltration in Hongzhou.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,000
The name of this person is Zhao Ying.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,240
A man with multiple identities.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,240
A doctor,

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,350
a teacher,

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,070
the head of an organization
that never existed,

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,350
a justice seeker.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,670
Those are the fake personas he's created.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,670
He's willing to hoodwink the public

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,880
and drag innocent people into the mess

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,920
to achieve his aim.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,150
His ultimate goal

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,470
is to bring chaos to Hongzhou.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Are you saying
Hongzhou has been infiltrated?

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,070
Or is Hongzhou about to go
to war with Yuzhou?

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,640
Ah.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
I knew he'd have
one more trick up his sleeve.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,150
I didn't expect you back so soon.

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,870
So, how are you going to end this game?

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,350
After I was shot,

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,120
I holed up for three months
in Yuzhou doing some digging.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,350
Gathering information on me

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,920
isn't going to change anything.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
It didn't take me three months

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,480
to investigate you.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,040
What are you getting at?

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,560
Zhao Ying,

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,120
as a secret agent,

33
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,400
you should know

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,480
variable tops the list
of your kind's most hated things.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,590
The Hu family in Jiangzhou

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
runs a large company
specializing in long-distance sea trade.

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
At full stretch,

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,760
the family was capable

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,680
of sending lots of fake information
your way.

40
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,590
You were the bad apple

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,950
that ruined the whole bunch.

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,760
So, I did the opposite

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,310
and used all the misleading information

44
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,040
to nullify the leads
you obtained through hard work.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,680
If you don't go back,

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
what do you think they'll do

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,590
to identify fake news from real?

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,950
And do you think

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,230
Yuzhou is still going to send troops here?

50
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,480
Simple

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
but effective.

52
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,030
But what makes you think

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,590
I can't make it out of Hongzhou?

54
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,430
What?

55
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,750
Do you plan on

56
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,680
stabbing me to death right here?

57
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,240
Oh, no.

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,870
Where's the fun in that?

59
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,750
Who I really want dead is
the person you want to save.

60
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,870
The person you admire.

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,910
The person you care about.

62
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,800
And lastly,

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
the person you love.

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,240
Oh yeah?

65
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,960
Where is she?

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,910
Where is she,

67
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
huh?

68
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,750
I thought she was with you the whole time!

69
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,000
Where the hell did that b*tch go?

70
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,360
Be careful with your choice of words.

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,630
It doesn't matter

72
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
she's out there.

73
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm warning you, Nie Zhen.

74
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,190
If you don't escort me out of Hongzhou,

75
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,710
the others will...

76
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm going to give you one last chance

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,240
to tell me the truth.

78
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,910
And I'll let you go.

79
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,910
I drugged Shen Qingxia

80
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,000
as I did to your father.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,750
That's all it is.

82
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,030
What more do you want to know?

83
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,870
Actually, I don't.

84
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,870
I just

85
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,240
needed to hear you say it.

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,590
This last game was her idea.

87
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,750
Flawless.

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,710
That's not possible.

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,030
Why her?

90
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,910
Are you surprised, Mr. Zhao?

91
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,030
The clinics owned by the Nies and Shens

92
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,310
were enough to accommodate
all three Division Commanders.

93
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,630
Zhao Ying,

94
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,360
you're never going to deceive
anyone here ever again.

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,190
Mr. Zhao,

96
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,030
we're here to see you off.

97
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,030
Zhao Ying,

98
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,800
you've lost.

99
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,630
Nie Zhen,

100
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,710
I wonder

101
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,150
what would have happened

102
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,360
if you had never met your wife.

103
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,190
That's a purely hypothetical situation.

104
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,680
Because she and I

105
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,190
are meant to be.

106
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,240
Young Marshal,

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,870
are you not going to do it yourself?

108
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,310
You know

109
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,600
guns have never been my weapon of choice.

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
Father...

111
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,870
Thanks to

112
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,430
the adrenalin

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,360
Miss Shen gave me,

114
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm able

115
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,000
to come in person

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,560
and utter my last words.

117
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
When the press conference is over,

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,040
there's no telling

119
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
what will become of Hongzhou.

120
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,870
Do you care?

121
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,750
Is there something you want to tell me?

122
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,560
I...

123
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm not...

124
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm not...

125
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,630
Never mind.

126
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,040
Now you listen to me.

127
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Your son has returned.

128
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,870
I'll leave it to you

129
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,000
for the sake of your dignity.

130
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,820
Father...

131
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
I already

132
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,870
made a sincere apology

133
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,720
to her.

134
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,630
Zhen...

135
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,000
for years,

136
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,870
I've kept this

137
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,560
to myself.

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
Zhen...

139
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
I've done you wrong.

141
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,000
I've done your mother wrong.

142
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,800
And I've done all of Hongzhou wrong.

143
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry...

144
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,240
Father...

145
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Zhen...

146
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,630
will you forgive me?
