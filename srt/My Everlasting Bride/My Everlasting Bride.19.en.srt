00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,070
This is the place

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,320
where Nie Zhen
and I were supposed to escape.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,640
You've got a lot of nerve

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,030
to choose such an obvious place.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,240
Hidden in plain sight.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
It's a safe bet.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,280
But you still reached out to me.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,000
You didn't follow Nie Zhen's plan.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,110
I have my own plan, too.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,280
Let's go.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,560
I'll go back to Nie Manor with you.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,200
Wait a little longer.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,710
Save it.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,710
He won't come.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,710
He has a more important mission.

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,030
The entire Hongzhou

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,880
is waiting for his rescue.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,110
Xiaodie.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,790
How come you know less
about Nie Zhen than I do?

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,200
In his heart,

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,790
nothing in the world is
as important as you.

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,350
He listens to advice.

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,510
Does he?

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,400
If he did, he wouldn't be Nie Zhen.

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,230
Why can't you listen to me for once?

29
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,430
It's time to pay me back

30
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,150
the five minutes you owe me.

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,790
Xiaodie.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
You're truly a doomed couple.

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,150
You're both annoying and ridiculous.

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,870
I know what you want.

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,760
You and Mr. Zhao
didn't get enough information, did you?

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,870
Is a large part of it

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,400
in the hands
of the three division commanders?

38
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,590
But I've already moved those documents.

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,750
You've taken so many precautions.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,800
How does it feel to be fooled by me?

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
Where is it?

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
What's going on, Young Marshal?

43
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,310
Let Xiaodie go with my men.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,430
I'll give you the other half.

45
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,030
There's no such thing
as doing business by halves.

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give you

47
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,560
the other half in three months.

48
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,680
But I've encrypted those documents.

49
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,080
Only Second Young Master Shen
knows how to decipher it.

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,280
So you used this method to keep him alive.

51
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Of course, I'm not bold enough

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,080
to test your limits

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
