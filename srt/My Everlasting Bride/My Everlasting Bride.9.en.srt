00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,780
[Episode 9]

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,540
Qingxia,

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,470
why didn't you tell me earlier

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,790
that your old schoolmate, Ms. Yan,

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,100
would get here today?

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,740
I...

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,670
Don't blame her, Grand Marshal.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,310
It was me
who reached out to contact you.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,460
I just arrived
in Hongzhou a few days ago.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,380
When I came to the manor
the day before yesterday,

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,950
Qingxia happened not to be there.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,630
I figured I'd see her eventually,

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,990
so I went ahead and discussed
treatment arrangements with you first.

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,780
I see.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,870
Qingxia

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,500
always talked a lot about Hongzhou
when she was in Germany.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,270
OK.

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,630
I heard from others

21
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,550
that you've long suffered from headaches

22
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,310
and shaky hands.

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,670
So I came to see you myself.

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,870
Have you prepared
the medicinal ingredients

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,350
these past couple of days?

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:02,740
Oh,

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,980
I have sent people to get them for me.

28
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,900
Thank you very much, Ms. Yan.

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,740
Don't mention it, Grand Marshal.

30
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,030
Hahaha.

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,070
Qingxia...

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,670
(Today, I, Xiaodie,)

33
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,980
(have become sworn sisters
with Miss Shen.)

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,150
(I will always protect Miss Shen)

35
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,310
(and keep her safe for life.)

36
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,340
Qingxia!

37
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,150
Oh!

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,380
Yes.

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,230
I'll need to do
a thorough examination of Mr. Nie,

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,070
Um...

41
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,070
which may involve some private areas.

42
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,070
Why don't you and the Young Marshal
step outside for now?

43
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,670
OK.

44
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,870
Ms. Yan, please check him as you want.

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,230
Xiaodie,

46
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,150
how are you feeling?

47
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,150
I'm fine.

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,030
That Yan Bingbing...

49
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,180
Who is she?

50
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,670
You are not Shen Qingxia
or have been abroad.

51
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,460
Whatever she said must be lies.

52
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,260
Did she threaten you?

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,460
Promise me,

54
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,830
don't ask any more
about this thing, okay?

55
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,900
OK.

56
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,500
You will look into it yourself,

57
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,660
right?

58
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,620
I won't force you
if you don't want to tell me.

59
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,590
I just don't like unstable factors,

60
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,180
especially the ones

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,870
that would endanger you.

62
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,660
Nie Zhen,

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,740
don't worry.

64
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,220
This Yan Bingbing

65
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,430
won't threaten me.

66
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,270
Xiaodie,

67
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,270
in this world,

68
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,710
I am the only one
who is sincerely treating you well.

69
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,940
I don't trust

70
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,060
any other people.

71
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,390
Ms. Yan.

72
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,990
Yes?

73
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,990
Sorry, my son

74
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,660
is such an embarrassment.

75
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,660
Not at all.

76
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,830
I envy them, to be honest.

77
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,940
What do you mean?

78
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,110
I envy the Young Marshal
and the Young Madam

79
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,110
can rely on such a powerful person.

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,990
They are able to live so carefreely

81
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,940
in this chaotic world.

82
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,220
Not like me,

83
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,830
all alone without any support.

84
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,390
You are Qingxia's friend.

85
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,460
From now on,

86
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,590
you can also

87
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,940
have the Nie family as your backer.

88
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,110
Um,

89
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,830
as long as you don't mind,

90
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,390
why don't you just stay here?

91
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,110
Sounds good.

92
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,500
I can live here

93
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,990
and keep an eye on you

94
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,940
until I help you fully recover.

95
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,870
The blood pressure monitor
seems a little insensitive.

96
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,710
Does your head still hurt now?

97
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,390
Oh,

98
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,710
a little bit.

99
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,740
Well,

100
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
then,

101
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,310
I will have to test you with my hands.

102
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,590
Do you mind?

103
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,500
Of course not.

104
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,630
I have something rather abrupt to say,

105
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,750
which is

106
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,780
that I find

107
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,860
your face

108
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,190
somewhat

109
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,780
familiar.

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,510
What a strange fate!

111
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,420
You can call me Bingbing from now on.

112
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,950
OK, Bingbing.

113
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,660
Oh.

114
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Young Marshal,

115
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,190
I have finished investigating
that woman named Yan Bingbing

116
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,420
as you ordered.

117
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,590
As you suspected,

118
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,660
her identity is fake.

119
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,190
I checked the student lists
of all German medical schools these years,

120
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,340
as well as the records of students
from Hongzhou who went abroad,

121
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,980
and there is no student
called Yan Bingbing at all.

122
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,220
I see.

123
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,510
Go to the north of the city.

124
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,070
I need to verify my thoughts.

125
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,590
Miss Shen,

126
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,950
I didn't expect

127
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,150
that I could see you again.

128
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,150
I didn't expect

129
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,390
that we could be like
when we were young again.

130
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,630
So,

131
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,860
what exactly happened that day?

132
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,710
I have forgotten

133
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,780
most of what happened that day.

134
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,660
Miss Shen,

135
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,710
I'm so sorry about what happened to you.

136
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,980
Don't worry.

137
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,780
I have found the person who hurt you.

138
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,780
Nie Ping should indeed die

139
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,980
for his hypocrisy and evil deeds.

140
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,100
You already know?

141
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Certainly.

142
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,270
But he is only one of them

143
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,030
and has to be the last one to face doom.

144
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,190
Are you going to

145
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,590
deal with the whole Nie family?

146
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,460
Will you help me?

147
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,150
Yes.

148
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,190
Then I need you

149
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,100
to get rid of one person for me.
