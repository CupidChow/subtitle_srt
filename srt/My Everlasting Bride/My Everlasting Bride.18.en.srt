00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,700
Ms. Yan,

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,030
are you seriously doing this?

7
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,950
Duoran,

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,380
give it up.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,670
I don't want to hurt you any more
than I have to.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,100
Why can't you

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,670
show Xiaodie the same kindness?

12
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,780
You know nothing.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,950
To you, she's Xiaodie.

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,910
But in my eyes, she's a nasty woman.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,910
A schemer.

16
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,310

I haven't seen you in a month.

41
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,110
I'm trying to make up for lost time.

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,830
(He's not here. Search that area.)

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,310
are you sure Second Young Master is safe?

46
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,060
He's going to suffer a bit.

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,110
But he'll live.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,590
So how did you convince him?

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,590
Because I'm Nie Zhen.

50
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,870
I don't lose.

51
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,110
What were you thinking?

52
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,340
You're putting your life
on the line running away.

53
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,710
Because I wanted to see you.

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,500
When the time is right,

55
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,310
we'll go back
and rescue Second Young Master.

56
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,270
Xiaodie,

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,590
I know you're worried about Miss Shen.

58
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,900
But she's been through so much.

59
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,500
She's holding a grudge.

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,830
And that grudge has made her

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,500
an unwitting tool of someone else.

62
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,030
Is that Mr. Zhao?

63
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,500
The guy
who drugged you disguised as a doctor

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,460
and dared you to pull the trigger?

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,900
That's right.

66
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,740
I've been trying to gather intel on him.

67
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,270
But my efforts have not been fruitful.

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,180
Nie Zhen,

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,460
actually...

70
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,150
You're trying to bail Miss Shen out,

71
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,180
aren't you?

72
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,780
She's the most important person
in my life.

73
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,180
If it's just pure hatred for me,

74
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,460
I can live with that.

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,460
But if she's being used by someone
with hidden motives,

76
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,180
I will do everything I can
to get her out of this big mess.

77
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,900
Xiaodie,

78
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,990
just leave everything to me.

79
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,900
When we get out of Hongzhou,

80
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,060
I'll get to the bottom of this.

81
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,630
Xiaodie,

82
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,420
do you not trust me?

83
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,030
I knew

84
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,710
Second Young Master
would tell you about my whole plan.

85
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,510
I just knew it.

86
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,710
Are you keeping something back from him?

87
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,270
All these diversions

88
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,030
didn't exactly
divert Mr. Zhao's attention.

89
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,460
There has to be a hostage.

90
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,070
Xiaodie,

91
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,950
don't go doing anything stupid.

92
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,190
You're the one doing stupid things.

93
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,590
You got out of there too soon.

94
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,710
Only when we're alive can there be hope.
Do you understand?

95
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,710
We'll talk about it

96
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,150
when we leave Hongzhou.

97
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,510
It's too dangerous for you

98
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,590
to be here.

99
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,900
Let's not forget.

100
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,630
Keeping Hongzhou safe

101
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,150
is something much bigger than me.

don't do this.

we would eventually
