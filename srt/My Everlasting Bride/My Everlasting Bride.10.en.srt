[Episode 10]

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,350
What's wrong?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,550
Is something bothering you?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,190
Have a drink with me.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,030
Okay.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,160
Wait.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,600
Shouldn't you

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,390
say something before drinking it?

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,560
What do you want me to say to you?

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,880
You may say whatever you want to say.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,920
The day we first met,

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,070
you owed me five minutes.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,000
Remember?

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,390
(You've wasted five minutes
of my time today.)

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,430
I'll find an opportunity later
to have you make up for it to me.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,470
Let's see if you will find the chance.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,790
I've been wondering

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,070
how you are

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,750
going to compensate me
for the five minutes.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Tell me.

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,150
Have you figured it out?

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,310
I thought

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,870
of having you hug me for five minutes,

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,870
but the novelty of that has worn off.

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,150
I also thought
of having you kiss me for five minutes,

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,400
but I fear you're too shy to do that.

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,150
Eventually, after some thinking,
I dropped the idea.

30
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,230
I'll leave the debt uncollected for now.

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,070
Someday, if the occasion arises,

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,150
I'll collect it from you.

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,150
Anyway,

34
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,430
every second of every minute
I spend with you

35
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,680
strikes me as precious.

Miss Shen

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
is the one closest

44
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,080
and kindest to me.

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,190
More often than not, I get the sense

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,800
that I cannot live without her.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,800
I owe everything I now have to her.

48
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,030
So there's no way I'm betraying her.

I, uh,

have no idea what protein is,

93
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,430
so I'll just

Uh,

00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,070
well then,

111
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,630
you should keep Bingbing company.

112
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,190
You're old classmates.

113
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,390
I think you could use some time
to catch up.

114
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,630
I have an errand to run.

115
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,750
I'll leave Bingbing to you.

116
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,430
Yes.

117
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,630
Why are you silent?

118
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,560
What is this exactly?

119
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Haven't you tried it already?

120
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,070
Why are you still asking me?

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,190
Why did you do that?

122
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,920
Isn't it obvious enough?

123
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,360
I did it to help you.

124
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,950
Help me?

125
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,920
With what?

126
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,070
Xiaodie,

127
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,560
actually you've long since fallen
for Mr. Nie, right?

128
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,560
I perceived it the day you were
at the front gates of this manor.

129
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
Xiaodie,

130
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,480
you're the smartest girl I've seen
in all these years.

131
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,190
You can handle both people and business

132
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,680
better than I do.

133
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,190
But

134
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,480
your only shortcoming

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,950
is your inexperience in sex.

136
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,680
We've been inseparable
since our childhood,

137
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,480
and you never studied overseas as I did.

138
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,830
At least

139
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,680
I saw romantic love
expressed in a direct manner.

140
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,910
Therefore, I felt

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,960
that considering your unromantic nature,

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,440
there's no telling how many years

143
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,440
it'd take you to make that move,

144
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,200
which was why I gave you a push.

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,670
Besides,

146
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,320
my intention to bring down
the Nie family is also true.

147
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,080
It's just

148
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,960
I need you

149
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
to keep Nie Zhen under control.

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,790
We can use

151
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,080
everything we should use

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,080
so long as our ends are achieved,

153
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
and I learned this from you.

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
By the way,

155
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,910
you'd better pray

156
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,790
Nie Zhen is as clever as always.

157
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,440
Then why did you lie to me?

158
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,790
I was just kidding you,

159
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,720
