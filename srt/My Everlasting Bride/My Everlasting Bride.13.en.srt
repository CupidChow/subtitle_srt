00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,430
what's your next requirement?

Didn't Ms. Yan tell you?

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,840

00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,870
How do you want to play?

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,400
Very simple.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,790
One bullet means one antidote pill,

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,640

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,790
Even missing one pill,

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,430
your wife will face certain death.
