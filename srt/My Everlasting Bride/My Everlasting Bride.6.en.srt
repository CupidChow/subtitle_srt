00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:15,980
[My Everlasting Bride]

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,980
[I have feelings for you,
and that's the most genuine part.]

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,660
[Episode 6]

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,670
Young Madam, you're up so early.

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,830
Are you going out?

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,920
Yes.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,030
I'm going to the pharmacy
since it's early.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,830
The pharmacy?

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,670
I can drive you there.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,470
Huh?

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,390
No need.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,470
The weather is changing,

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,640
so I want to prepare
some Poria cocos and licorice

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,880
for Young Marshal.

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,070
Oh, I see.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,520
I get what you mean.
He does need some supplements.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,240
It's a good thing.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,920
Why didn't you tell me

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,840
about what happened to my sister?

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,150
Her entire life was beautiful and pure.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
I don't want her name tainted

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,070
in the mouths of the living.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I only want to avenge her myself.

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,350
Initially, I planned to infiltrate
the Nie family through marriage

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,510
and then use the identity of the hostess
to conduct an investigation.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,070
However, that thing happened
on the night before.

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,280
Xiaodie,

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,920
what do you plan to do?

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,280
Nie Zhen is utterly hypocritical,

30
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,070
causing the death of Young Miss.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,790
He must die.

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,510
What do you need?

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
I can help you,

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,070
even by sacrificing my life.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,790
Do as I instructed.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,920
Lure him out,

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,920
and I won't let your life be in danger,

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,630
nor will I allow any harm
to befall the Shen family.

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,750
Young Marshal.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Where is she?

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,310
Probably still at the pharmacy.

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,590
Young Marshal,

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,680
the Shen family sent you this.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,520
The Shen family?

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,560
Who delivered this?

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,800
A servant.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,430
I came across him outside the manor.

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,100
[630, Huashan Road]

49
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,000
Shen Duoran.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,400
What if

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,150
Nie Zhen doesn't show up?

52
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,590
No.

53
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,000
He will definitely show up.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,870
Young Madam.

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,870
It's all thanks to you.

56
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,560
My sister has told me

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,150
about your smart plan.

58
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,710
Rest assured.

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,840
We will surely eliminate
Nie Zhen this time.

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,310
Thank you very much, Mr. Hou.

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,590
I've made it clear
to Mistress Nie as well.

62
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,960
All I want is money.

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,310
When the day comes for you
to take charge of Hongzhou,

64
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,560
our Shen family

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,710
will rely entirely on you, Mr. Hou.

66
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,560
Nope,

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,960
Grand Marshal Hou.

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,280
As expected, you are a talented woman
who has returned from studying abroad.

69
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
Your mind is steady,

70
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,840
and your methods are ruthless.

71
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,470
Oh, I see.

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,630
It's just a false alarm.

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,360
Hahaha!

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,470
A false alarm?

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Son,

76
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,000
don't you see the current situation?

77
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,590
If my wife is unharmed,

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
then it's indeed a false alarm.

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Oh, my Young Marshal,

80
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,630
how much longer
are you going to be foolish?

81
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,190
Your wife and I
set a trap to lure you here,

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,840
and we had no intention
of letting you leave alive.

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,870
As for the position
of the Grand Marshal,

84
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,280
do you think someone like you,
with no skills or talents, can take it?

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
Nie Ping may protect his son,

86
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
but I'm not blind.

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Hongzhou absolutely cannot be ruined
in your hands.

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Honey,

89
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,270
come here.

90
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,600
Shut up, Nie Zhen!

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
I'll shoot you!

92
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,310
Loaded with blanks.

93
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,310
Was that fun?

94
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,190
I don't like guns.

95
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,270
So, of course,

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't like
gunpowder or bullets either.

97
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,390
What?

98
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,190
Shoot him!

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,390
Fire now!

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
What kind of Division Commander are you?

101
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,600
You don't even know
that your own guards are undercover.

102
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,920
You...

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Sorry, Mr. Hou.

104
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,040
You have to take the bullet

105
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,720
as a warning.

106
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,160
You've been pretending
to be dumb this whole time!

107
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,120
I don't have the time
to play games with you.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
Originally,
if you didn't try to kill me,

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
these people would never have shot you.

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
Besides,

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,920
you've implicated people
you shouldn't have.

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,270
Also,

113
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,680
I genuinely have no interest
in the position of the Grand Marshal.

114
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,830
My dear wife,

115
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,160
are you done pretending?

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,950
I see,

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,920
it's you.

118
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
You've been planning
to harm me all along.

119
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,070
As for you,

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,040
you will never be a match for me.

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Honey,

122
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,510
let's talk at home.

123
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,950
Mr. Hou,

124
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,190
the Young Marshal said that

125
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,630
you shouldn't die

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,920
because you are different
from your sister.

127
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,310
Mr. Hou is

128
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,870
truly a talented commander
who cares deeply for Hongzhou.

129
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,870
You just went off the track for a bit.

130
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
What happened today,

131
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,510
he will forget all about it.

132
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,310
Tell Young Marshal and Young Madam

133
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,870
that I, Hou Ping,

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,560
take the loss.

135
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,720
I take the loss.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
Let go of me!

137
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
I think there is a big misunderstanding

138
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,680
between us.

139
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,360
You raped Young Miss,

140
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
causing her to drown herself in a river.

141
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
How dare you
call this a misunderstanding?

142
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
I don't even know
Shen Qingxia, your Young Miss,

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
let alone raping her!

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Do you remember the first time we met?

145
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,390
In the Tailor Shop.

146
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,160
Do you dare to say that after we met,

147
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,270
you didn't go to the old dyeing workshop
in the north to commit violence?

148
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,040
Of course I do!

149
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,950
You've seen my ledger.

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,270
You know what I do.

151
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
Stop lying, Nie Zhen!

152
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,600
I've searched the dyeing workshop

153
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,190
and found physical evidence
at the scene.

154
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,070
The person who assaulted her

155
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,270
had a custom-made iron rose emblem
on their chest,

156
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,310
identical to the one on your desk.

157
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Go ahead and kill me,

158
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,190
then I can haunt you
even in the afterlife.

159
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,270
Xiaodie,

160
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,750
I know what's going on now.

161
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
You've chosen
the wrong target for revenge.

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
That emblem

163
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,480
was bestowed upon me by my father.

164
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,750
Both my father and I have it,

165
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
and besides us,

166
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,310
three other Division Commanders
also have it,

167
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,120
including Mr. Hou, whom you saw tonight.

168
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Xiaodie,

169
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
believe me,

170
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,430
I truly did not harm Young Miss,

171
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,200
but I will quickly get to
the bottom of all this

172
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,200
and provide you
with a reasonable answer.

173
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,870
I initially thought that

174
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,270
I could avenge her tonight.

175
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,270
It won't take long.

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,120
Believe me.

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,960
I almost got you killed.

178
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,270
You are very smart

179
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,390
but still a little behind me.

180
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,790
Did you switch the bullets?

181
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,270
I hate guns.

182
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,720
Did you not notice that
everyone in the entire Nie manor,

183
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,630
including my father,

184
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,870
doesn't carry guns?

185
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,270
This was an unreasonable demand

186
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,670
I, this unruly Young Marshal, made.

187
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,750
I couldn't throw away
the gift my father gave me,

188
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,120
so I had to replace the bullet.

189
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,790
I didn't expect that
this unintended action

190
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,030
would save you,

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,910
and save me myself as well.

192
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,390
Do you really not hate me?

193
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,360
For real, I don't hate you.

194
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,510
But I do hate guns

195
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,150
and the fact that
the Fourth Concubine bullies you.

196
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,150
When I saw the dagger
sent by Shen Duoran,

197
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,150
my heart skipped a beat.

198
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,240
That part was true.

199
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,240
But most importantly,

200
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
I have feelings for you,

201
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,510
and that's the most genuine part.
