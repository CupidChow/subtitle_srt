[My Everlasting Bride]

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,820
[Young Marshal, you are my nightmare!]

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,820
[Episode 2]

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,300
Mr. Shen,

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,530
I was wondering
if I could ask you a favor.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,250
Go ahead.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,020
Would it be possible for Miss Shen

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,850
to move into my house first?

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,220
What do you think,

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,620
Miss Shen?

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,900
(The medal...)

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,810
(He's part of the armed organization.)

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,770
That's unheard of.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,900
No woman

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,810
has ever moved

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,980
into their soon-to-be husband's home
before marriage.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,370
Well then, the wedding
ought to be put together at full speed.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,060
Miss Shen and I

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,730
will decide on all the details
as a team.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,370
Do you have a problem with that?

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,610
You bet I do.

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,090
My sister's wedding will be done

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,530
in accordance with the ancestral tenets.

24
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,060
It's not up to you, Young Marshal.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,450
I assume you're the Second Young Master
of the Shen family.

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,330
Your opinion doesn't matter here.

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,730
Well, this is my house,

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,330
not yours.

29
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,890
The entire Hongzhou

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,370
belongs to my mansion.

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,090
So we meet again.

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,700
It just wasn't

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,810
in the way I expected,

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,060
servant girl.

35
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,370
Do I not cut it as Shen Qingxia?

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,370
You do smell richer
than you did yesterday.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,860
But your shoes are ill-fitting.

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,020
And there's dried blood
around your newly pierced ears.

39
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,780
Need I say more?

40
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,810
Young Marshal,

41
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,580
we've arrived.

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,490
Here we are,

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,140
my missus.

44
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,980
You aren't exactly

45
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
what you're made out to be.

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,980
What do you want?

47
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,540
Don't you also have your own intention?

48
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,020
Me?

49
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,890
You think I don't know
this is you saving her bacon?

50
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,650
Yeah, I'll gladly play along.

51
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
So you've met Miss Qingxia before?

52
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,020
Never.

53
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,450
Then why would you...?

54
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,730
Stay back.

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,980
Give me it.

56
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,850
This is my favorite pen.

57
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,700
It means more to me than your life.

58
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,890
Missus.

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,940
Don't make yourself too important.

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,500
Remember,

61
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,260
under my roof,

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,850
you will do as I say.

63
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,500
You have no other choice.

64
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,290
Nope, next one.

65
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,210
Next.

66
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,060
Next one again.

67
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,970
I'm curious, Young Marshal.

68
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,850
Don't you have work to do?

69
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,530
I'm perfectly capable of choosing

70
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,210
my wedding dress
and accessories on my own.

71
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,180
Well, keeping tabs on you

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,330
is my priority right now.

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,500
What?

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Are you afraid I'm going to slip away?

75
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,060
You said I was marrying you
in place of Miss Qingxia, remember?

76
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,330
I have no reason to run away.

77
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,020
You're smart.

78
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,850
It means unpredictable variables.

79
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,530
And I don't like variables.

80
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,650
Young Marshal,

81
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,820
you too are a wild card.

82
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,890
Am I?

83
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,620
Actually,

84
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,820
I think this dress looks good on you.

85
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,940
Let me tell you something.

86
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,700
If you behave yourself,

87
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,970
I'll set you free

88
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,580
on our big day.

89
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,180
How do you feel

90
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,890
about this hairpin?

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,330
I'm not fond of it.

92
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,060
Do you have an iron one with roses?

93
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,450
I don't think so.

94
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,090
Madam,

95
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,530
are you happy with how you look?

96
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,890
Not really, no.

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,060
You are brainy,

98
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,530
and so am I.

99
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,260
Except I take much more
drastic measures.

100
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,740
And I'm capable of murder.

101
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,380
If nothing here piques your interest,

102
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,850
we'll press on
with the wedding dress hunt

103
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,380
until you find something
that strikes your fancy.

104
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,700
What,

105
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,090
are you scared of me?

106
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,140
See how large the gap between us is?

107
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,970
Do you still think you have
what it takes to work against me?

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,180
(I've got to toughen up)

109
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
