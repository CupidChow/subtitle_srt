[My Everlasting Bride]

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,980
[Nothing is more important than you!]

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,700
[Episode 11]

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
Are you going to deal with me now?

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,120
That coward Hou Ping may fear you,

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,120
but I will never submit to you.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,430
Why have you been
targeting me all this time?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,880
Don't pretend to be dumb with me.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,000
What I want is the same
as what everyone wants -

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,390
power.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,640
Power...

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,430
Is power that appealing to you?

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,350
If not, why would I marry your father?

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,000
He treats me

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,200
not so well after all.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,070
Mistress Nie,

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,840
you indeed made a wrong choice.

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,960
I don't need you to tell me
what I did wrong.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,150
Enough.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
You should leave
the Nie Manor as soon as possible.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,000
See?

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,680
Don't you also want to drive away people
who pose a threat to you?

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,760
Isn't that consolidating your own power?

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,920
I don't care about power.

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,070
You don't pose any threat to me, either.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,710
I'm only trying to

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,840
save your life.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Last night...

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Last night, I had a sweet dream.

30
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,560
I was with you.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,790
Xiaodie,

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,950
are you in a bad mood?

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,400
No.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,000
I can feel that you are down.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,150
Nie Zhen,

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
if someone has completely changed

37
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,400
into someone unrecognizable to you,

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,960
what would you do?

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,840
Get to know them again.

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,800
But what if the process
of getting to know this person again

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
is very dangerous?

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
Then come to me.

43
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,310
Here I am, coming to you.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,590
She

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,750
didn't do anything
too outrageous to you, did she?

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,430
Was what happened last night

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
too outrageous?

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,750
Xiaodie,

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,630
if

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,080
last night didn't happen,

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,870
when would we become a real couple?

52
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,710
Xiaodie,

53
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,030
Xiaodie, are you OK?

54
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,750
Xiaodie!

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,560
Xiaodie!

56
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,310
Xiaodie!

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,590
Shen Qingxia,

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,800
what did you give her?

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,190
Answer me!

60
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
What else could it be?

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Aphrodisiac drug.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,590
You poisoned the drug.

63
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,750
Give me the antidote!

64
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,430
I don't have it.

65
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,960
Cut the crap. Give me the antidote!

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,750
That is a toluene compound.

67
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,150
Ordinary doctors can't even detect it.

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,750
In the entire Hongzhou,

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,870
I only know one person
who has the antidote.

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,710
However,

71
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,520
he is a somewhat eccentric madman.

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,870
You probably won't find it easy

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,310
to get the antidote from him.

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,160
What on earth do you want?

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,630
This is not a negotiation.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,750
My goal has already been achieved.

77
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,800
I think you should know the story

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,750
"killing three warriors with one peach",

79
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,480
which utilizes jealousy

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,560
but is not cruel enough.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Be good and go get your antidote,

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,560
74 Yuhua Alley, Bailing Town.

83
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,950
I will take care of

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,870
the Nie Manor for you.

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,920
Young Marshal!

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Young Marshal,

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,800
The doctors all said

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,720
they couldn't figure out
what was wrong with Young Madam.

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,750
I already got some answers
from Yan Bingbing.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,310
What do I need to do?

91
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,360
Has the Fourth Concubine left?

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,630
Uh...

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,190
I haven't heard anything
from the housekeeper.

94
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,950
Isn't the Grand Marshal home?

95
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,750
Are you the new nurse?

96
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,310
You just came back,
and you're leaving again?

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,270
Did Nie Zhen tell you to flee?

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
So, you are the threat!

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,630
Fourth Concubine, are you too old

100
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,310
to run fast enough?

101
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,830
Miss Qingxia,

102
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,160
how far do you want to go?

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,070
I'm here to do good deeds.

104
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,430
It's fine if you don't believe me.

105
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,070
What evil deed did I do

106
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,750
to deserve being drugged unconscious
with an aphrodisiac drug

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,000
and then poisoned to death?

108
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,310
What?

109
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Are you feeling wronged?

110
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,510
For you,

111
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,950
I can even sacrifice my life,

112
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,160
so I don't feel wronged.

113
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,310
Your life doesn't seem too valuable.

114
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,190
You're willing to sacrifice it
for Nie Zhen too, aren't you?

115
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,510
The Miss Qingxia I know

116
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,750
was never like this.

117
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,390
These flowers

118
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,270
are called manjushakas,

119
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,720
and it's best to water them
with human blood.

120
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,070
The Fourth Concubine
didn't seem too friendly to you before,

121
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,950
so I took care of her for you

122
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,950
and also watered the flowers.

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,750
Shouldn't you thank me?

124
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,630
Why did you become like this?

125
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,600
Are you out of your mind?

126
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,430
It's all thanks to you.
