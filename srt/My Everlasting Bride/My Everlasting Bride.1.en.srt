announced a military order)

were unceasing,)

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,660

was overbearing and debauched,)

Speak.

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm just a servant girl
from the restaurant at Tong Street.

20
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,580
- I saw you're bullying...
- Liar.

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,260
Compared to a restaurant servant,

22
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,740
the smell of cosmetics on you
is way too strong.

23
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,500
Besides, you don't have
any cooking odors.

24

the Shen family in the south of the city.

Go on.

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Miss Shen and I
are leaving the city today.

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,580
We have prepared
the train tickets and money.

Miss Shen is engaged to Mr. Nie.

32
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,260
Why do you want to leave?

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,420
Have you thought
about the consequences of escaping?

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,700
He's a scumbag.

35
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,100
A scumbag?

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,340
I'm telling the truth.

37
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,980
Don't be nervous.

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,500
I should praise you

39
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,940
for making a great remark.

40
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,460
I've said everything I need to say,

41
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,620
so can you let me go?

42
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,700
Let you go?

43
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,180
Of course.

44
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,780
Don't move.

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,460
Looks like

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,260
you are not so meek after all.

47

Hand me your pass.

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,780
It seems like your military rank
is not low, either.

49
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,820
Fine.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,940
Indeed, mine works better.

Move!

52
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,780
Stay where you are.

53
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,700
Don't shoot!

54
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,220
Put your guns down!

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,180
You've wasted five minutes
of my time today.

56

I'll find an opportunity later

57

to have you make up for it to me.

58

Let's see if you will find the chance.

59
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,460
Shouldn't we catch her?

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,420
No need.

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,340
Young Marshal,

62
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,700
it's time to get yourself a real gun.

63
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,380
No marshals hate guns.

64
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,260
Don't be a blabber.

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,180
But it's fortunate

66
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,860
that it was just a fake gun,
so nothing happened.

67
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,180
What's even more coincidental is that

68
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,540
she is Miss Shen's personal maid.

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,380

70
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,580

Remember to fully compensate
for the damages in this tailor shop.

72
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,740

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,980
it was my fault.

88
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,980
I shouldn't have come here so late.

89
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,060
It's all my fault!

90

Miss Qingxia!

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,580
Did Qingxia really leave?

92
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,380
Miss Shen was determined to leave

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,900
and only left this ticket stub.

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,180
It's all because of me

95
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,380
that I forced her away.

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,300

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,860

116
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,140

taught me that

to establish authority,

124
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,540
one must first develop
a strong personality.

to forgive me?
