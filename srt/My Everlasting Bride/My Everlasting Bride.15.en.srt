00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,980
[My Everlasting Bride]

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,020
[I can't keep up the charade anymore.]

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,740
[Episode 15]

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,280
Do I not look good enough?

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,190
Mistress Yan,

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,600
put your clothes back on.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,710
I'm trying to read.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,150
Well, I don't exist in your book.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,750
Zhen,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm here.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,920
Right before you.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,790
Quit acting like you don't want this.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,470
You are no different

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,470
from your father.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,030
Even if you drugged me as you did Xiaodie,

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,960
I would still not play along.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,350
Because, in all honesty,

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,960
it kind of makes me sick.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,200
Don't say that wench's name to me.

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,750
Let me tell you something.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,600
If you don't do as I say,

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll gladly pull out of the deal

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,040
and have

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,150
your beloved Xiaodie killed.

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
You have no plans to let her off.

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
But neither she nor I can die just yet.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,560
Just like my father.

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,870
Killing a maid
isn't going to change anything.

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,870
Push your luck if you dare.

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,680
I hold the whip hand here.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,200
Zhen,

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,150
I'll be back tonight.

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,070
If you have made up your mind

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,230
by then,

35
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,230
make it crystal clear.

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,020
[Seal]

37
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,590
That's the last batch.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,640
Are you sure

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,840
the entire house has been combed?

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,310
Not a single piece of paper was left out.

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,510
But that

42
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,790
might not be enough.

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640
(I believe those three Division Commanders
have the rest of the documents.)

44
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,560
(I've got to find another way)

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
(to make them hand over the papers.)

46
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,000
You seem bummed.

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,310
I'm fine.

48
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,430
Time is of the essence.

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,590
Our trapped comrades
can't hold on much longer.

50
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,000
Those documents
are the only way to free them.

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,360
(Don't worry. I'll get it handled.)

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,400
(It's only been a short while,)

53
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,360
(but it's something I will never forget.)

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,030
Xiaodie,

55
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm back.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,150
Wonderful.

57
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,590
Have some tea.

58
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,430
What happened with Nie Zhen...

59
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,310
is it true?

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
Xiaodie,

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,520
on my trip to Jiangzhou,

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,870
I managed to track down your family.

63
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
(Eighteen years ago,)

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
(the Hu family of Jiangzhou
were persecuted.)

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,030
(The family was falling apart.)

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,960
(And to protect his only daughter Hu Die)

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
(who was only two then from harm,)

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,150
(Mr. Hu had his most trusted stableman)

69
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,520
(take her, and that's you, to Hongzhou.)

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,960
(The city was in chaos at the time.)

71
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,240
[Chang Mei Ju, Local Specialties]
(The stableman couldn't)

72
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,680
(make it to the home
of a close acquaintance.)

73
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,520
(Having been wounded,)

74
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,800
(he had no choice but to leave you
to a family living nearby.)

75
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,430
(It turned out to be
none other than the Shen family.)

76
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,960
(Perhaps it was the severe injury,)

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,590
(or perhaps the stableman
wanted to keep you out of trouble,)

78
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,080
(the secret of your true identity)

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
(died with him.)

80
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,630
Hu Die...

81
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,910
It's a lovely name.

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
And don't you worry.

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
There's no mistake.

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,960
Mr. Hu recognized you

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
when he saw your photo.

86
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
And besides,

87
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,400
the butterfly-shaped birthmark
on your wrist

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,360
speaks for itself.

89
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,750
Second Young Master,

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
thank you.

91
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
You don't have to thank me.

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,960
I thought it was something worth doing.

93
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,280
And I also know that

94
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
what I've done

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
isn't enough for me
to gain an advantage over Nie Zhen.

96
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,400
My bad.

97
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,560
I shouldn't have brought it up.

98
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,070
It's getting late,

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,560
Second Young Master.

100
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,480
Why don't we

101
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
call it a night and get some rest?

102
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,830
I'll make you

103
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,240
a hearty meal tomorrow.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Xiaodie,

105
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,070
your family

106
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,800
is the wealthiest family
in Jiangzhou today.

107
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,630
Hongzhou is facing a period of unrest.

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
I hope

109
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,390
you'll return to Jiangzhou.

110
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,510
Go back to your home.

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,390
It's the safest place

112
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,190
you could possibly be.

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,190
It's war-free in the South.

114
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,800
And you'll be able
to get out of the mess you're in.

115
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,680
If I'm going back,

116
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm going to bring Nie Zhen with me.

117
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,000
But

118
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
it's not time yet.

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Is he really worth it?

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,190
Second Young Master,

121
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,070
I'm grateful
for everything you've done for me,

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,390
and for your help in finding my family.

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,800
But Nie Zhen...

124
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,000
I see my future with him.

125
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,000
I assume you've come to your senses?

126
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
I thought

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
it was pretty obvious.

128
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,040
Young Marshal,

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
with time,

130
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,310
you will get over that someone

131
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,510
and let go of the past.

132
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,480
Before we do it,

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
I want to know

134
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
everything there is to know.

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,920
What's your game this time?

136
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Relax.

137
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I am now

138
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,390
completely at your mercy.

139
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm all yours.

140
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,510
But I hate variables.

141
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,510
I don't do well not knowing.

142
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,040
By the way,

143
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,720
your perfume

144
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,920
smells uniquely wonderful.

145
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,720
That's more like it.

146
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,920
Everything that I do,

147
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,160
I do it for the Hongzhou Society.

148
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,510
The Hongzhou Society?

149
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,160
Why have I never heard of it?

150
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,160
Your father took a lot
of the crown jewels of the Society.

151
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,390
He had his people
lock them away on the quiet.

152
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,830
Couldn't be bothered to ask the location.

153
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,390
This Mr. Zhao guy that I work for,
he's the head of the Society.

154
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,360
He needed clues to rescue the captives.

155
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,270
Having been saved by him

156
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,600
and as someone
who hated your father's guts,

157
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,720
I clicked with him right away.

158
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,390
I was able to bring down your family

159
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,040
and get you back

160
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,510
all because of him.

161
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,600
So all those papers

162
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
you've removed in the past month,

163
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,040
it's to locate the place where
those people are being held, right?

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
Anyway, get your mind off it.

165
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,360
Honestly,

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,510
I don't care about any of that stuff.

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
You can't stop us even if you do.

168
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,830
Then your doings...

169
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm simply returning the favor.

170
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,160
You mean Mr. Zhao's favor?

171
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
He saved my life.

172
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,360
It's only natural that I should help him.

173
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,070
But I'm fixated on getting revenge.

174
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,040
Mr. Zhao let your father live,

175
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,390
which is fine with me.

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,040
Mr. Zhao is planning
on turning Hongzhou upside down

177
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
as soon as he frees his associates

178
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,920
to liberate the people
and reshuffle the order of the city.

179
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Zhen,

180
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,390
forget Xiaodie.

181
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,720
I won't kill her.

182
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
Be mine,

183
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,920
won't you?

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,510
Sounds like a plan.

185
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
Fall for me, Zhen.

186
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,270
Three days

187
