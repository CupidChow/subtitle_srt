can only be Xiaodie.]

[Episode 14]

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,050
[Hongzhou Grand Marshal's Manor]

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,000
(After that day,)

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,280
(the Young Madam went back
to the Shen family.)

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,050
[Hongzhou Grand Marshal's Manor]

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,800
(and the Young Marshal has been
in seclusion for a month.)

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,530
[Hongzhou Grand Marshal's Manor]

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,510
(And now Yan Bingbing is
in control of the Manor.)

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,070
(She has replaced the personal guards
with new ones.)

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,520
(No way.)

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,960
(I must think of something soon)

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,430
(to meet the Young Marshal.)

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,710
Someone is waiting for me downstairs.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,750
Just sign

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,200
the rest of the papers later.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,920
Ms. Yan.

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,070
The three of us

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,920
haven't seen the Grand Marshal

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,350
for over a month.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,200
It seems inappropriate for you

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,000
to handle military intelligence.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,790
I don't know much about military affairs.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,920
But as the Grand Marshal's physician.

26
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,560
I know very well
about his current physical condition.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,150
It's even more inappropriate

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,280
for him to attend meetings now.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,000
Ms. Yan.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,150
If you say so,

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,790
perhaps the three of us
won't be polite today.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh?

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,280
What do you want?

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,150
If you don't allow us
to see the Grand Marshal today,

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,070
I'm afraid we'll have to break the rule
of not bringing guns to the Manor.

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
You're too worried.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,760
My father is indeed unwell.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,640
You can trust Ms. Yan completely.

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,230
Not long ago,

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,230
my father took Ms. Yan as his concubine.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,000
Regarding all military affairs,

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
you can report directly to her.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
She'll do it for you.

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,150
Thank you, Division Commanders.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,080
You may leave.

46
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,310
As the Fifth Concubine,

47
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,590
I have to thank you,

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,870
Young Marshal.

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,310
Do you pity him?

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,310
There's nothing to pity about my father.

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,750
He's made his own mistakes.

52
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,310
He knows it very well.

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,430
Then why are you pretending to be filial?

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,590
Back then, he was obsessed with war

55
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,520
and indirectly caused
the death of my mother.

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,910
So, compared to you,

57
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,800
I hate him just as much as you do.

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,630
But he's my father, after all.

59
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,030
I couldn't stand by and watch him die.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
That's all.

61
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,150
That seems to make a lot of sense.

62
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,150
But I can never

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,000
fully understand you.

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,470
That's all right.

65
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,590
Without my antidote every three days,

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,750
the Grand Marshal will die at any moment.

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,190
I'll take my father back first.

68
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,750
He needs me to take care of him.

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,190
I don't buy into your act.

70
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,190
In consideration of your father,

71
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,520
the two of us

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,910
should get along well.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
You better live well,

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,360
like a dead dog with the plague.

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,870
I understand your hatred for him.

76
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,240
But

77
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,560
don't go too far.

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
When did you get here?

79
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,390
I have to make sure that my people have
successfully settled in the Nie Manor.

80
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,680
Besides,

81
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,480
today is the day of delivery.

82
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,870
I've prepared everything in advance.

83
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,310
Don't worry.

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll keep him alive.

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,870
I know what's more important.

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,430
The most important thing right now

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,160
might be related to Nie Zhen.

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,120
What do you mean?

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,310
The division commanders
put pressure on you today.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,950
Such situations will only increase
in the future.

91
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,190
You know why
I formed the Hongzhou Society.

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,870
Once we gather the secret documents
and rescue our colleagues,

93
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,190
we need Nie Zhen as our new pawn.

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,240
After all,

95
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,480
when is this old guy going to die?

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,190
We don't know.

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
So what do you need me to do?

98
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,680
Find a way to take down Nie Zhen.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,310
Any way!

100
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,310
Don't delay the handover of documents.

101
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,870
I have to remind you of one last thing.

102
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Nie Zhen

103
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,600
was supposed to be yours.

104
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,480
