00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,130
[Episode 4]
Grand Marshal, Fourth Concubine.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,070
Congratulations, Grand Marshal.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,060
Young Marshal and Miss Shen tie the knot.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,300
Grand Marshal,
Hongzhou is indeed a nice place.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,510
Young Marshal,

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,320
bring me the bridal veil, please.

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,200
Why take it so seriously?

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,560
The desire to look attractive
is universal.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,350
Though it'll be all an act,

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,200
being pretty beats being ugly.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,560
Well, which parts

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,790
do you think are not an act?

16
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,120
Madam,

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm a waiter.

18
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,590
I'm here to deliver tea to you.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,200
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,870
Xiaodie,

21
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,200
come away with me.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,120
This is my only chance to save you.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
I can't leave right now.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
You should get out of here.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,310
What do you want to do?

26
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,630
Let him go.

27
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,030
Don't forget we have a deal.

28
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,800
What kind of deal

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,360
is worth staking your life on?

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,750
Second Young Master, trust me.

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,750
Second Young Master of the Shen family,

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,560
today is my wedding day.

33
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,910
If you value your life,

34
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,000
get lost right now.

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,150
Go.

36
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,750
Just go.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,870
Wait.

38
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,910
Is this how you put on an act?

39
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,470
Today,

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
we gather here

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,870
to bear witness to Mr. Nie Zhen

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,120
and Ms Shen Qingxia's sacred wedding.

43
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,590
This

44
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,710
is a glorious moment.

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,240
Therefore,

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,430
it's not reckless

47
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,590
or thoughtless.

48
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,680
Instead, it's pious and solemn.

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,510
Now,

50
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,190
Mr. Nie Zhen,

51
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,870
please address the ceremony

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
and toss the bride's bouquet

53
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,750
to its destined recipient.

54
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,750
Sorry, my honored guests,

55
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,070
I never do things by the book.

56
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,310
(Sorry, Miss Qingxia.)

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,070
(Xiaodie failed to uphold
the Shen family's dignity.)

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,720
In the Western world,

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,240
a bride's bouquet is a gift
from the newly-weds.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,070
It represents sharing goodness
with those they care about.

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,680
But I'm a very selfish man.

62
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,850
I don't want to dilute
what Ms Shen Qingxia

63
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,240
and I are fated to have.

64
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,920
Therefore,

65
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,630
I swear,

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,430
no matter whether poverty
or wealth in the future,

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,630
I'm willing to take you as my wife.

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Ms Shen Qingxia,

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,950

95

Um.

96
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,560
Well, your chief really did me proud.

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,950
He sure did.

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,630
Young Marshal's charm is matched
by his eloquence,

99
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,870
which undeniably proves
that a hero fathers no weakling.

100
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,750
You, uh,

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,310
need to keep close tabs on him.

102
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,750
Do not let him do anything stupid again.

103
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,120
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,630
Why did you change your mind
at the last moment

105
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
instead of unmasking me?

106
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
That Second Young Master has feelings
for you?

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,950
He and I grew up together,

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
but he's way out of my league.

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,040
There's no way we can be together.

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,480
Is he as much out of your league
as I am?

111
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,750
What you just said has nothing to do
with my question.

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,600
Are you doing all this to spite him?

113
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,560
If I wanted to blow your cover,

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,160
the easiest way
would be through the reporters,

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,830
but I didn't do that

116
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,390
because I gave up my plan last night.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
That Second Young Master's got nothing
to do with it.

118
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Why?

119
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,270
You're just a maid,

120
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,560
but you actually dared abduct me

121
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,870
for a mere pass.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,830
I was just a bit desperate.

123
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
You're a mere servant girl,

124
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,240
but your young master risked his life
for your affections.

125
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,560
There are fools aplenty

126
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,750
in this world.

127
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
You're just a maid,

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,040
but you found out everything about me

129
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
in only an afternoon.

130
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
You left some vital clues behind.

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,360
I just appreciate your talents.

132
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,870
Because it strikes me

133
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,960
that you might surprise me again
if I keep you around.

134
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,840
That's all.

135
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,390
Young Marshal, don't you think

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,440
your explanation's a bit far-fetched?

137
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,390
What other reason do you need?

138
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,630
One that I find convincing enough.

139
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm starting to take an interest in you.

140
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,200
Does this reason

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,270
sound convincing enough?

142
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,390
Let's make a deal.

143
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,790
This is a contract I drafted beforehand.

144
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,240
I'll try tracking down the one
you want to find,

145
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,270
and you'll stay by my side at all times.

146
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,360
I'll be your Young Marshal of a husband,

147
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,670
and you'll be my contractual bride.

148
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,510
We'll honor our deal,

149
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,030
sign our names, and make our crosses.
