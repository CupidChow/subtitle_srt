00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,150
Do not move.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,100
You know, I was going to recruit you.

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,030
It's too bad that

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,910
you're helplessly blinded by your feelings

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,060
for a servant girl.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,590
You're risking Ms. Yan's life here.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,820
A life for a life.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,270
Is it really worth it?

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,060
Mr. Zhao.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,140
Of course, it isn't.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,140
Ruyu is the ideal person
I can use to pull your father's strings.

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,820
You know too much.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,670
The society was founded
to take out your Nie family.

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,630
Knowing your temperament and story,

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,030
I had to dig deep.

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,420
The Hongzhou Society, huh?

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,780
Ms. Yan trusts you,

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,550
but I don't.

22
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,030
Nie Zhen,

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,740
what's that supposed to mean?

24
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,630
Right.

25
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,740
Mr. Nie,

26
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,990
you may seem like a pleasure seeker,

27
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
but actually, you keep your finger
on the pulse of the city.

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,820
You want to run a background check on me?

29
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,980
Go ahead if you can.

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,180
You're quite something.

31
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,100
You'd be a match for me.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,340
But then,

33
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,820
I'm Nie Zhen.

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,180
It means

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,430
you're not going to pull the trigger.

36
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,900
No, I'm not.

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,620
I'm out in the open,
whereas you're lurking in the dark.

38
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,260
I just want to get out of here.

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,150
What did you just say?

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,950
Nie Zhen

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,590
broke out of his home.

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,150
I learned from a reliable source.

43
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,950
He's going to come for you.

44
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,150
Whatever happens, I can't see him.

45
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,710
I used the worst way

46
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,590
to convince Young Miss

47
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,710
that I'd have nothing
to do with the Nies ever again.

48
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,070
That kept Nie Zhen from getting killed.

49
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,030
And now he's on the run.

50
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,430
I'd be going back
on my word if we met again.

51
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,980

52
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,980
what Young Miss

53
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,310
would do.

54
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,430
But we can't just do nothing.

55
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,150
