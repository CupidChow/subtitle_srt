[Episode 17]
Papers, papers, papers!

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,900
Young Marshal of Hongzhou
Nie Zhen is a wanted man in the city!

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,670
[Hongzhou Restaurant]
The Nie family is in hot water!

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,790
Why did you ask me here?

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,510
I thought I made

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,220
Xiaodie's message clear last night.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,670
She won't see you.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,950
Remember the blade you came at me with?

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,060
Do not start this with me.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,380
I don't owe you a thing.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,780
The eviction order you've received

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,590
is keeping me out of Hongzhou.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,500
You should thank your sister.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,460
If she hadn't assumed power,

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,670
you wouldn't have been able
to set foot in here again.

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,990
Well, it's a string of strange encounters.

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,180
Let's get right into it, shall we?

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,500
Let me in on Xiaodie's plans.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,950
You don't get to be a smarty-pants.

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,500
You don't trust me to do a good job?

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,900
Actually, I do.

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,670
And I also think
that you're cleverer than Xiaodie.

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,230
But I like her.

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,460
So whatever she says goes.

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,540
Life is uncertain.

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,870
Who knows?

29
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,260
Maybe I might stand a chance with her.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,590
I've been doing some digging
on your sister's backer.

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,310
The truth is,

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,310
Xiaodie isn't exactly safe.

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,380
Because all of her plans

34
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,950
practically focus on me.

35
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,590
If you go on doing her bidding,

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,310
I can get out of it alive,

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,820
but that's not necessarily
the case for Xiaodie.

38
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,460
Is that really what you want?

39
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,310
(Xiaodie has spent every penny)

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,100
(and all the gold
and silver bullion my family had)

41
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,460
(to clear an escape route for you.)

42
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,460
(She bought off
all the sentry posts in Hongzhou)

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,230
(with a substantial amount of money.)

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,100
(With gold or silver ingots)

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,670
(scattered all over the city,)

46
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,460
(it'll be impossible
to maintain law and order.)

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,870
(At the border,)

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,230
(nearly 100 cars will cross
at the same time.)

49
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,660
(They will all be)

50
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,460
(under suspicion of carrying you.)

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,030
(All local fishermen hunted offshore
have been bribed and assembled.)

52
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,940
(The waterway that leads to the South)

53
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,220
(is the secret path
Xiaodie has fixed you up with.)

54
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,310
When you arrive in Jiangzhou,
contact this person.

55
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,390
He'll take you to the Hu family.

56
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,150
Xiaodie's real family.

57
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,590
The family that's had a monopoly
on the jewelry market in the South?

58
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,590
That's correct.

59
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,870
What about you?

60
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,060
I'm going to play the fool

61
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,870
and drink my problems away.

62
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,390
Sounds like a well-thought-out plan.

63
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,990
But you haven't told me
the most important part,

64
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,660
have you?

65
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,180
(She'll go to your house
to find my sister,)

66
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,030
(and volunteer)

67
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,180
(as a hostage in place of you.)

68
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,060
It won't work.

69
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,870
Do you think
my sister's going to kill Xiaodie?

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,310
Maybe she won't.

71
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,460
But I bet my bottom dollar that
whoever she's working for

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,310
will use Xiaodie to blackmail me
into coming back here.

73
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,430
Then can you save her?

74
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,940
A part is missing.

75
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
The part where you upset the balance

76
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,620
by getting Xiaodie out of there,

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,460
leaving my sister with no hostage?

78
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,220
Yes.

79
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,990
You know, I deeply regret

80
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,270
not stopping her from marrying you.

81
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,550
Well, I did not meet her at my house.

82
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,270
You never stood a chance.

83
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,940
Hmph.

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,030
This isn't really a good time

85
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,550
for sarcasm.

86
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,430
The information you have,

87
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,150
is it enough to turn the table?

88
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,550
Not enough.

89
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,030
Not enough?

90
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,590
How much more evidence do you need?

91
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,430
She's facing a backlash
for trying to keep you safe.

92
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,460
And she's too worried about you to eat.

93
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,550
Gosh, I wish I could stab you right now.

94
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,620
Sometimes,

95
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,110
I just can't stand brainiacs like you.

96
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,550
But you people are the only ones

97
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,590
capable of tackling thorny issues.

98
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,390
You and Xiaodie...

99
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,390
you guys are a match made in heaven.

100
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,100
[Wanted]
Why haven't you found him yet?

101
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,150
Get out.

102
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,390
Be patient.

103
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,980
It's just one bad move.

104
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,150
We just have to win.

105
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,710
Easier said than done.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,510
Just think about it, Ms. Yan.

107
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,390
Where will Nie Zhen go

108
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,390
after getting

109
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,390
out of here?

110
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,390
But that's my home.

111
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,390
Losing a pawn won't matter much.

112
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,390
But if our king is captured,

113
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,270
we lose the game.

114
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,190
What,

115
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,390
couldn't find your precious handmaiden?

116
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,750
Mm.

117
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,750
She's always been out of my reach.

118
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,300
It's been so long,

119
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,390
big sister.

120
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,950
It's you.

121
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,390
It can only be me.

122
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,420
It has to be.

123
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,030
Business is a gamble.

124
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,070
Xiaodie's always been the one

125
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,540
to run my family business.

126
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,070
I feel like a useless weakling.

127
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,420
But this time...

128
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,150
I want in.

129
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,750
I'm going to take a chance

130
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,830
on you.

131
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,070
