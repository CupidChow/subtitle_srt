00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,320
[My Everlasting Bride]

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,820
[You've ignited my heart.]

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,780
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
Qingxia...

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,230
Get me a glass of water.

6
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,510
Coming.

7
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,870
Did you have a nightmare?

8
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,840
My noon naps have been restless.

9
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,040
My bad.

10
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,790
I cut you and made you bleed

11
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,230
while shaving your face.

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,870
Don't worry.

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,510
I can't always rely on you.

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,870
That's inappropriate.

15
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,200
Qingxia,

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,870
You should spend
more time with Nie Zhen.

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,150
Without you watching him,

18
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,150
he's probably

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,070
creating trouble out there.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Alright,

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
let me nap a bit more.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,800
I am waiting for him to come back.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,910
Faster.

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,560
Yes.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Even faster.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,590
Housekeeper,

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,910
Go to the shop in the north
and buy some calming incense ingredients

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,430
for the Grand Marshal.
He has had trouble sleeping well lately.

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,310
He can burn incense while working

30
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,520
to calm his nerves.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,870
OK, Young Madam.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Xiaoyu,

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
go to the flower shop south of the city

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,710
and buy some fresh flowers.

35
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,280
Our Nie manor

36
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,910
is dreary every day,

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,190
But the Young Marshal and Grand Marshal

38
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,080
both like vitality.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,470
Yes, Young Madam.

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,710
Xuan,

41
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,120
go to the warehouse
and move the kerosene out.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,750
The Young Marshal said today

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
that keeping it there seems dangerous.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,870
Take it out first,

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,470
and move it to the garage tomorrow.

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,400
Yes,

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,470
Young Madam.

48
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,710
You already know.

49
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,590
I'm waiting for you to come back.

50
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,630
I've never hidden anything from you.

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
I know you haven't.

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,840
I know you are dealing
with the Division Commanders,

53
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,030
and will surely uncover
the truth very soon.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,430
So I've been waiting for you.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,520
But I've just realized

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,510
I actually have no choice.

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,430
Whatever is meant to end
will end eventually.

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,870
I've been waiting for your return

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,480
because I want to
properly bid you farewell.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,430
Xiaodie,

61
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,510
don't do anything stupid.

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Young Marshal,

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,000
Nie Zhen,

64
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,310
I'm very glad to meet you,

65
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,160
very, very glad.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Xiaodie,

67
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,360
put down the kerosene lamp first.

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
OK?

69
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,240
Nie Zhen,

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,390
do you know

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
that I really have no choice?

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,270
I have to avenge Qingxia.

73
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,430
For the sake of revenge,
I've harmed you.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,040
and we were brought together
because of it.

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,750
Now I know that

76
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,480
it was the Grand Marshal
who caused Qingxia's death.

77
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,560
After properly bidding you farewell,

78
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,390
I can rest in peace.

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,600
Xiaodie,

80
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
don't worry.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,750
I have sent everyone away

82
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,480
in the entire Nie manor.

83
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,950
Tonight,

84
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,240
only the Grand Marshal and I

85
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,830
will die

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,190
in this fire.

87
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,000
Xiaodie,

88
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,680
I know avenging Miss Shen

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,630
is the most important thing to you,

90
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,600
and I know

91
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,750
you must
deeply despise my father right now.

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,510
But I want you to know that

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,870
I also deeply hate my father.

94
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
He has committed
all sorts of evil deeds in Hongzhou,

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,830
constantly wearing a hypocritical mask.

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,630
He even,

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,630
he even killed my own mother.

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,160
So I should be the one

99
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,070
to set this fire.
