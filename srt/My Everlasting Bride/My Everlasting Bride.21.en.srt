00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,660
[Episode 21]

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,150
Let me tell you the story

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,740
of me and your mother.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,790
Your mother

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,260
was the most gentle person ever.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,380
These are love letters
I wrote to her back in the day.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,910
Take a look at them.

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,740
A love letter

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,460
for someone who matters most to me.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,950
There are no words

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,700
that can express how much you mean to me.

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,430
When the dark clouds go away,

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,710
I see the brightest moon I've ever seen.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,100
When the torrential rain stops,

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,230
I see the most beautiful rainbow
I've ever seen.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,540
If you feel the same way,

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,540
come looking for me.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,180
Come meet me.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,900
Come love me.

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,710
I will keep these promises
I've made to you.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,980
Can you do the same?

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,900
Swear by

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,620
the sky

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,710
and the ocean?

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,620
I swear.

28
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,620
Sorry to keep you waiting,

29
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,340

Well, you left me home alone

48
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,590
for a press conference.

49
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,780
Now we can

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,990

Please don't hate me.

54
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,990
I knew you would be all right.

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,710
I missed you.

56
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,430
I missed you too.

57
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,550
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,270
So, what exactly was your plan?

59
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,390
Why wouldn't you tell me?

60
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,990
You wouldn't have returned to Jiangzhou

61
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,060
if I had told you.

62
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,550
You can come out now.

63
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,870
You two can catch up later.

64
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,710
I came here

65
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,710
pretending to negotiate an arms deal.

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,030
The longer I stay,

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,220
the higher the risk.

68
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,510
It's you.

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,710
Ah,

70
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,980
I hope you don't blame me
for firing that shot.

71
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,510
I was on Young Marshal's orders.

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,830
I'm just glad

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,150
I wasn't too bad a shooter,

74
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,100
and I did not fail Young Marshal.

75
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
So, it all started then...

76
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,030
Long before that.

77
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,340
My top priority

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,900
was to investigate
the people Yan Bingbing,

79
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,100
or rather, Miss Shen Qingxia,
was in the service of.

80
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,100
Mr. Hou here

81
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,590
was the most covert card in my hand.

82
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,540
(When I was held hostage
by Yan Bingbing in my own home,)

83
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,150
(I learned)

84
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,750
(that an organization called
Hongzhou Society seemed to be at work.)

85
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,220
(But I had eyes all over Hongzhou.)

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
(The organization never existed.)

87
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,660
(And to get to the bottom of it,)

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,660
(I faked my death)

89
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,750
(so I could get to work)

90
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,860
(in the safest possible way)

91
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,150
(and without restraint.)

92
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,630
(When I was on my solo mission,)

93
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,070
(a trail of clues led me to Yuzhou.)

94
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,390
(Six cities,)

95
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,750
(nineteen fake identities,)

96
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,710
(and 54 leads.)

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,950
(There you are.)

98
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,710
(Zhao Ying the Director.)

99
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,390
(Zhao Ying,)

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,950
(the Director
of the Yuzhou's Intelligence Agency.)

101
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,390
(He's trying to spark a war
between the two provinces)

102
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,630
(And he will figure out a way)

103
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,270
to steer Yuzhou to victory.

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,710
All the documents removed from my house

105
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,300
were sent back to Yuzhou.

106
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,710
It was an attempt

107
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,750
to craft
a well-directed military strategy.

108
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,150
Troops are typically deployed
on very short notice.

109
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,830
This is not chess.

110
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,340
Well, times have changed.

111
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,590
Military strategy is no longer

112
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,460
what it takes to win a war.

113
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,150
It's the information gap.

114
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,710
And that's exactly

115
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,660
what Yuzhou was after.

116
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,030
Hongzhou has been dragged out
into the open.

117
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,660
If Yuzhou goes to war with Hongzhou,

118
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,590
Hongzhou

119
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,270
will be utterly crushed.

120
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,630
Hongzhou is already teetering
on the brink.

121
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,510
We need to go back to Hongzhou.

122
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,950
This is a make-or-break time

123
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,070
for the people there.

124
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,420
This time,

125
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,860
we're going back together.

126
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,980
But am I going

127
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,420
to get you in trouble?

128
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,860
There won't be any more trouble.

129
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,660
But there is something we need to do
at your home

130
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
before we leave.

131
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,860
What is it?

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,190
Serve tea to your parents.
