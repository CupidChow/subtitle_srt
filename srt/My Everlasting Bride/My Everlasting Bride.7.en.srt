some gifts for you guys.

184
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,030
Young Marshal,

185
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,440
just forget about me.

186
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,320
I obtained all this info

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,270
when I joked around

188
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,150
with the others on usual days.

189
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,320
My father has no idea
that I have this with me.

190
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
Dear uncles,

191
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,080
if you don't want my father
to get his hands on this,

192
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
please answer my questions

193
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,480
honestly and truthfully.

194
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,360
I wish to know where you guys were

195
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,750
and what you guys were doing

196
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,000
ten days ago.

197
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,910
I'll be done in just a minute.

198
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,550
Everything becomes troublesome

199
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,120
as you get older.

200
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,670
I can't even take alcohol now.

201
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,390
I'm too forgetful.

202
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,480
If so, you should take less alcohol.

203
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,870
It's not good for your health anyway.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,750
I remember I had a business meeting

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,390
with business partners from the South
in the north of the city.

206
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,630
I attended
the post-meeting celebration banquet.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,630
I was utterly drunk

208
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,790
even though I barely drank.

209
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,390
When I sobered up, my adjutant told me

210
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,720
that I went to the dyehouse next door.

211
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,360
My old friends,
who were there with me, teased me

212
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,000
and said that I had bullied a young girl.

213
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,360
Anyway, I don't remember what happened.

214
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,750
I had no recollection of it,

215
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,120
even if I wished to refute them.

216
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,610
My nephew.

217
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,870
I mean, Young Marshal.

218
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,270
Everything I said was true.

219
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,790
Hou,

220
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,910
you're closer to Young Marshal.

221
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,150
Speak up for me.

222
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,750
Young Marshal,

223
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,510
Jia and I were on standby
at Command HQ that day.

224
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,360
That's what I told Young Marshal too.

225
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,910
Young Marshal
will make his own judgment.
