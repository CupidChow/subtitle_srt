1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,354
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,982
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:12,072
10 YEARS AGO

4
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,240
Why did you apply for this position?

5
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,118
It's better to join the police.

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,206
There's no pension,
and it's a contract position.

7
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,291
Because I want to change the world.

8
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,133
Look at you making such a cheesy remark
without even batting an eye.

9
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,345
Doesn't it make you cringe
when you say things like that?

10
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,432
No, because I mean it.

11
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,982
5 YEARS AGO
SECRETARY, JANG TAE-JUN

12
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,859
You can refer to this. Like this.

13
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,361
Just check this part.

14
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,280
Got it, sir.

15
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,377
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE JONG-DAE

16
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,257
You call this a speech?

17
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,425
Rewrite the whole thing.

18
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,679
Train him well, for God's sake.

19
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,275
You see...

20
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,611
You're doing a great job,
so don't be discouraged.

21
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,865
It's just that Assemblyman Lee
can't see the potential in you yet.

22
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,618
I heard you received an offer

23
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,706
from Assemblyman Song's office
to join them as the Chief of Staff.

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,710
Yes, I did.

25
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,087
That man, Mr. Song...

26
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,007
Everything he does irks me,

27
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,759
but he has such a keen eye for talent.
I've got to give him that.

28
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,555
You got an offer from a big shot
in one of the opposition parties,

29
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,682
so you should be proud of yourself.

30
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,976
You're all grown up now.

31
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,608
What about you?
When will you join the Assembly?

32
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,488
You should start preparing for it.

33
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,283
I should give it a shot next year.

34
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,202
I see.

35
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,662
Do you have someone who can help you?

36
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,624
I'll start looking.

37
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,628
So when are you joining Mr. Song's office?

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,962
Well...

39
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,467
How can I go anywhere when I know
all you can do is poke your nose

40
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,927
into other people's business?

41
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,763
Even when I'm here looking after you,
I'm still worried about you.

42
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,648
What's with that look?

43
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,276
I guess you weren't planning on taking me.

44
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,445
Fine. Forget it, then.

45
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,822
I guess I counted my chickens
before they were hatched.

46
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,077
Forget it.
Don't take me if you don't want to.

47
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,828
Goodness.

48
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,372
Gosh.

49
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,377
I'm touched.

50
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,757
What are you doing?

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,801
Seriously? Look at me.

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,928
What the hell?

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,807
I'm not crying.
It's just that the chili is spicy.

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,478
Come on. What are you doing now?

55
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,612
Seong-min.

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,906
Both you

57
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,117
and I...

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,329
should get elected as an assemblyman
with a badge on our chest

59
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,832
and walk in there triumphantly!

60
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,836
A fair, corruption-free nation!

61
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,964
A country
where all of its people can prosper!

62
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,717
Let's work together
to create such a world!

63
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,386
Yes!

64
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,888
Like you said,

65
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,309
let's make a change in this world!

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,603
-Let's make a change!
-Let's make a change!

67
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,772
Let's make a change!

68
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,567
Stuck in a place
where the skies can't be seen

69
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,945
while having to fight against time
that can't be measured,

70
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,742
you must push the rock upward
so that it doesn't fall down the hill.

71
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,914
My apologies, sir.

72
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,547
To survive in this disgusting world,

73
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,299
I had to lower my head

74
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,259
and swallow my pride.

75
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,641
It's about time you were introduced.

76
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,643
I...

77
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,936
Come in.

78
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,110
Hey, Mr. Jang.

79
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,406
Hello.

80
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,700
I am Jang Tae-jun.

81
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,830
Just like that,
I managed to climb up the ladder.

82
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,804
With my dogged persistence and tenacity,
I survived.

83
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,934
However, there is nothing

84
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,686
in my hands now.

85
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,331
EPISODE 8

86
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,878
If Iâ€™m given the opportunity to serve
as the Minister of Justice,

87
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,048
I will work hard to serve my country
and its people

88
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,509
in the best way that I can.

89
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
Thank you.

90
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,392
Mr. Ahn is one of Mr. Song's closest men.

91
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,687
He wouldn't have added this question
without discussing it with Mr. Song.

92
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,647
Your name is mentioned here.

93
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,983
It's weird enough
that Mr. Lee got picked as a witness.

94
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,027
They're trying to blame you
for all the suspicions regarding Mr. Song.

95
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,323
They're going to make it seem like
it was all your own personal doing.

96
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,579
We will now accept questions

97
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,373
for the Minister of Justice nominee.

98
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,876
Each committee member will have

99
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,796
up to seven minutes to ask the questions
that they have prepared.

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,924
This confirmation hearing
is being broadcast live,

101
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,927
so please make sure
you don't exceed your speaking time.

102
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,139
Assemblyman Ahn Hyeon-min,
you may go ahead.

103
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,141
I'm Ahn Hyeon-min from the Daehan Party.

104
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,186
First and foremost,
congratulations on your nomination.

105
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,854
Thank you.

106
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,274
From what I've observed over the years,
I know that the candidate

107
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,734
always does his best

108
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,403
to protect the law
and never compromise his morals.

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,031
I asked many people's opinions
while preparing for this hearing,

110
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,826
and many of them agreed with me.

111
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,163
It's pretty quiet so far.

112
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,999
It won't last long.
It'll get noisy very soon.

113
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,213
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min,
you may go next.

114
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,967
I'm Assemblyman Lee Seong-min,
a nonpartisan.

115
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,137
First, I'd like to mention something
regarding the submitted materials.

116
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,640
We requested documents
regarding the social groups

117
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,559
and organizations you were part of
during your tenure as a prosecutor,

118
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,104
but we were told they can't be submitted
as they're considered personal matters.

119
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,274
I think such documents are crucial
in determining your eligibility.

120
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,694
We did our best to submit
everything that you requested.

121
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,863
If there is anything that's missing,

122
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,449
I'll answer whatever questions
you may have, right here.

123
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,909
That won't suffice.

124
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,494
I'd like those documents immediately.

125
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,455
Please submit them before noon.

126
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,585
Chairperson Lee, please tell him.

127
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,504
He is clearly unprepared.

128
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,214
This will set a bad precedent.

129
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,133
Mr. Song, would you be able
to submit all the requested materials?

130
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,469
Yes, I will submit them.

131
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,431
You just made a promise
before the people of this country,

132
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,058
so I trust that you will submit them.

133
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,352
Yes, sure.

134
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,606
I'll explain why it's important. When
a new Minister of Justice is appointed,

135
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,608
all the corporations
change their law firms

136
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,154
to the ones where those who are acquainted
with the new minister.

137
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,699
That is why I believe it's important
to find out

138
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,784
who aligns interests with the candidate.

139
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,829
-Am I wrong?
-I agree.

140
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,123
And that being said,

141
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,543
I'm sure you're aware of
the recent conveyor belt accident

142
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,795
at Joojin Constructions,
a subsidiary of Joojin Chemical.

143
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,921
Yes, I am.

144
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,967
It was a truly unfortunate accident.

145
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,177
From what I know,
you and Mr. Lee Chang-jin,

146
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,471
the CEO of Joojin Chemical,
are very close. Am I right?

147
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,224
Yes. We met at an entrepreneurs' forum,

148
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,643
and we're still quite close.

149
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,272
The documents you submitted
tell us how close the two of you are,

150
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,648
so you probably can't deny it.

151
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,317
When you were a prosecutor,

152
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,528
you handled five cases
related to Mr. Lee Chang-jin,

153
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,073
and he was acquitted of all charges.

154
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,578
Mr. Lee did apologize
for the unfortunate accident,

155
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,539
but he's completely ignoring
the aftermath of the accident.

156
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,167
Isn't this because he's counting on
his friendship with you?

157
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,295
Let me say this again.

158
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,548
Mr. Lee Chang-jin
is my personal acquaintance,

159
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,426
but I've never helped him benefit
or profit in any way.

160
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,930
However, some unsavory deeds

161
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,558
recently came to my knowledge.

162
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,272
What are they?

163
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,775
I recently found out

164
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,153
about some unsavory transactions
between Mr. Lee

165
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,198
and one of my closest aides,
who has been meeting him personally.

166
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,367
It only came to my knowledge recently.

167
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,576
Please be more specific.

168
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,204
Who is that person?

169
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:08,167
I do not think it's appropriate
to disclose his name here, but...

170
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,464
Since all of you want to know who it is,
I will tell you.

171
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm ashamed to say this,

172
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,639
but it's my chief of staff,
Mr. Jang Tae-jun.

173
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,103
What? What's he talking about?

174
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,952
Oh, dear. Jang Tae-jun is in deep shit.

175
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,422
Ms. Kang.

176
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,258
He wants the hearing
to be all about Mr. Jang,

177
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,719
not about his eligibility
to be Minister of Justice.

178
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,642
The number you have dialed is not...

179
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,436
Gosh, why isn't he picking up?

180
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,357
Mr. Jang!

181
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,777
Were you aware that Mr. Lee and Mr. Jang

182
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,321
had been meeting privately?

183
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,451
I only found out recently.

184
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,202
According to a report we received,

185
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,288
Mr. Jang threatened Mr. Lee using the fact

186
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,665
that he works for you
to illegally obtain stock information

187
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,168
and even asked for a director position.

188
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,419
Is it true?

189
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,174
Yes, as far as I know.

190
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,469
Chairperson Lee, we'll have to
find out more about this allegation.

191
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,513
We'd like Mr. Lee Chang-jin
to take the witness stand.

192
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,348
Please proceed.

193
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:49,935
What is happening?

194
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,104
Mr. Song wants to use me
to make sure he is appointed.

195
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,482
He's trying to put all the blame on me.

196
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,401
If Lee Chang-jin testifies against me,
I'll be finished.

197
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
But it'd only be words without evidence--

198
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,572
Evidence can be crafted.

199
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,741
He's so close to becoming a minister.

200
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,619
Everyone in the prosecution is
at his disposal. He has the power.

201
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,413
Destroy all the documents I have.

202
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,165
Who knows what he'll use?

203
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,709
Why don't we get help

204
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,961
from Assemblyman Lee
to prepare materials for refutation?

205
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,546
We have time until the afternoon.

206
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,465
The confirmation hearing
will be adjourned.

207
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,925
What?

208
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,469
Before taking the oath,

209
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,472
please note that this part of the hearing
will not be open to the public

210
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,600
according to Article 14
of the Personnel Hearing Act.

211
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,060
-What?
-Can they do that?

212
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,231
All reporters, note that no photography
or recording is allowed from here on.

213
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,483
It's not open to the public?
What do you mean?

214
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,152
According to Article 14.3
of the Personnel Hearing Act--

215
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,072
I think this is crucial in determining
the candidate's eligibility.

216
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,490
Why must we go off-the-record?

217
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,826
"Because information
about a legitimate financial

218
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,329
or commercial transaction of an enterprise
or an individual is likely to be--"

219
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,997
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

220
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
Are you trying to protect him?

221
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,168
Have we ever obeyed Article 14
of the Act?

222
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,963
Are you saying
we can completely ignore it, then?

223
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,423
-We're going by the law.
-This is unprecedented.

224
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,802
-You're protecting him, aren't you?
-Look, watch what you say!

225
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,187
Quiet down, please.

226
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,149
He brought Mr. Lee to make sure
the hearing ends up being adjourned.

227
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,821
If it's adjourned only after he brings up
the allegations about me...

228
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,031
That way, all the suspicions
about him will dissipate,

229
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,659
and people will only talk about you.

230
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,039
-Come on.
-Sir, please reconsider this.

231
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,083
Prior to becoming
a Minister of Justice nominee...

232
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,086
-When did you find out about Mr. Jang?
-Have you been overlooking it?

233
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,170
Tell us more.

234
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,924
I only found out about it while preparing
for my confirmation hearing.

235
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:48,721
I do not know any details
about the transactions between them.

236
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,015
But as the protector of the Constitution,

237
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,019
I believe that I mustn't side with him
even if he's my chief of staff.

238
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,479
If I'm appointed Minister of Justice,

239
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,317
I'll be sure to get to the bottom of this.

240
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,320
The Seoul Western Prosecutor's Office
is already looking into the case.

241
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,574
This will pain me for a while.
However, I promise

242
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,035
that I will faithfully cooperate
with the investigation.

243
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,623
Once again, I'd like to sincerely
apologize to the people of this country.

244
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,125
Please say a few more words.

245
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,628
-Did you really not know?
-How do you feel now?

246
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,796
-Please tell us more.
-Another comment, please.

247
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,090
-Sir, please tell us.
-Sir.

248
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,384
Did you really not know about it?

249
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,100
Hurry up already!

250
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,439
Mr. Jang, what is happening?

251
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,667
Mr. Jang Tae-jun, it's been a while.

252
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,048
ARREST WARRANT

253
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,847
-Gosh, what is happening?
-What's going on?

254
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,933
Is it true?

255
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,394
My gosh, it must be true.

256
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,201
I'm Prosecutor Seo Hyeong-cheol.

257
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,456
Is this really necessary?

258
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,168
We were a family. I should at least
buy him a meal before I send him off.

259
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,462
Sure. That will be fine, sir.

260
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,717
Let's go.

261
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,482
I'm so hungry from being pestered
by everyone since this morning.

262
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,901
Eat up.
It won't taste good when it gets cold.

263
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,698
What good will it do
if both of us fall into the water?

264
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,617
At least one of us should be standing
to help the other one get out.

265
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,496
Don't take this to heart.

266
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,665
I told you
when you first joined my office.

267
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,625
When I'm appointed as a minister,

268
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,003
my district will be all yours.

269
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,007
We don't even need to wait
until the legislative election.

270
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,510
The by-election is just around the corner,
but the legislative election is next year.

271
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,013
If I'm appointed,

272
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,807
I'll give up my seat
in the Assembly right away.

273
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,144
Then Uigwang City
will need to elect my replacement

274
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,520
in the by-election.

275
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,733
Are you saying you'll grant me
the nomination rights?

276
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,902
Who else, if not you?

277
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:51,945
Goodness.

278
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,410
And as for the allegations
that were brought up at the hearing...

279
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,080
As soon as I'm appointed
Minister of Justice...

280
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,248
You see these conch shells?

281
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:08,087
They'll dissipate like snails
crawling back into their shells.

282
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,631
It'll be just for a day or two.

283
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,258
I've already talked to everyone
in the prosecution.

284
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,011
So just go with them
and let them ask you a few questions.

285
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,138
It's just a formality.

286
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,807
You understand, right?

287
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,772
Goodness, what's there to hesitate?

288
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,857
The table is set,
so all you have to do is eat.

289
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,317
Your soup is getting cold.

290
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,038
How should we handle this, sir?

291
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,749
Should we let him go
after interviewing him as a witness? Or...

292
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,210
A viper mustn't be let loose.

293
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,838
We need to make sure
this won't backfire on Mr. Lee,

294
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,257
so see what you can do
to get an arrest warrant issued.

295
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,635
Insider trading and graft.

296
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,139
-Five years should be good enough.
-Understood, sir.

297
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,216
Come with us.

298
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,711
-Jang Tae-jun bolted.
-What?

299
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,297
-Put out an APB now.
-Yes, sir.

300
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,633
Hey, start the car!

301
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,388
I was going to send him off
on a good note.

302
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,642
He's making trouble to the end.

303
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,270
-Tell Won-sik to come back.
-Yes, sir.

304
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,397
SEONGJIN CITY DAEHAN PARTY COMMITTEE

305
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,984
What happened to you?

306
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,698
I was bitten by a viper.

307
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,325
What do you want to know?

308
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,745
Last legislative election...

309
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,373
Are you sure that Lee Seong-min
was the one who exposed

310
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,874
your bribery case?

311
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,378
I had to withdraw from the race
because of that.

312
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,546
And he was elected.
Do you need more proof?

313
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,216
The organization that was supporting me
switched to him, too.

314
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,425
Who else could it be?

315
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,096
But how do you think he found out?

316
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,557
Beats me.
That's what I'd like to know, too.

317
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,602
There's no way he could've known about it
unless it came from our side.

318
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,064
Who was the detective on the case?

319
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,858
His name is Lee Hyeong-bae.

320
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,486
He's a detective
at Seongjin Police Agency.

321
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,614
He got promoted after my case
and was transferred to Seoul.

322
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,911
Detective Lee Hyeong-bae.

323
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,301
What's your plan now?

324
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,388
I should get off the tiger's back.

325
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,975
Will Mr. Song let you?

326
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,520
I'll bite off the tiger's neck
if I have to.

327
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,523
How can I help?

328
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,153
See you at the park.

329
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,948
Gather information
on Mr. Song's first election.

330
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,200
-We'll find something.
-Okay.

331
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,202
I need your help.

332
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,673
Suspicions that Assemblyman Song's
chief of staff Mr. Jang

333
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,842
threatened Lee Chang-jin,

334
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,636
the CEO of Joojin Chemical,
to gain privileges have been brought up

335
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,681
at Assemblyman Song's confirmation
hearing for the Minister of Justice today.

336
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,142
Mr. Jang even mobilized
his father to disrupt

337
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,894
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min's office

338
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,104
that was in charge
of the redevelopment project.

339
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,315
It's been confirmed
that he has been also involved in

340
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,192
Uigwang's and Seongjin's
redevelopment project.

341
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,778
The authority has put out an APB
on Mr. Jang.

342
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,238
Prosecutor Seo from the Western
Prosecutor's Office is in charge.

343
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,492
Prosecutor Seo is one
of Mr. Jo's connections.

344
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,662
Mr. Jo told me to step back
from the hearing.

345
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,790
I'm sure he's siding with Mr. Song now.

346
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,795
Bringing in Mr. Lee as a witness
was all part of their plan.

347
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,339
He was planning
to pin everything on Tae-jun.

348
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,716
Will the hearing reconvene?

349
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,051
Even if it does,

350
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,387
we don't have anything
we can use against Mr. Song.

351
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,848
What about the additional materials
from Mr. Song?

352
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,726
I did receive them,
but I didn't find anything useful.

353
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,230
If the hearing ends like this,

354
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,649
Mr. Song will be appointed
as the Minister of Justice.

355
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,194
If that happens,
we won't be able to save Tae-jun.

356
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,286
Mr. Lee, you should prepare
for the afternoon session for now.

357
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,455
I'll call Mr. Jang.

358
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,291
Okay.

359
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,256

Don't give up.

362
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,574
Mr. Han,

363
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,911
you must keep going
for the sake of Yu Jin-su's grandmother.

364
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,623
And it doesn't have to be
at Mr. Song's office.

365
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,542
As long as you stick to your beliefs,

366
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,211
I'm sure you'll find a place
where you can work at.

No coffee today?

369
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,483
I'll buy you double shot coffee next time.

370
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,153
Hey, the prosecution is going berserk,
trying to arrest you.

371
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,655
But you're still making jokes
and haven't lost your cool yet.

372
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,036
-Is that what I requested?
-Well, I didn't find much on Mr. Song.

373
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,580
He must've cleaned up well. It's spotless.

374
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,458
This is all there's left to his dirt.

375
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,759
Let's stop here.
He's too big of a fish for us to catch.

376
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,220
I'll make sure this doesn't affect you.
Don't worry.

377
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,850
I can take care of myself.
Just take care of yourself.

378
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,477
Bye.

379
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,502
-Hello.
-It's me.

380
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,881
Where are you?

381
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,843
I'll head over there.

382
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,307
While the confirmation hearing

383
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,434
of Assemblyman Song Hui-seop
is in full swing,

384
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,145
the suspicion that Mr. Jang,
Assemblyman Song's chief of staff,

385
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,773
threatened the CEO
of Joojin Chemical, Lee Chang-jin,

386
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,276
to gain numerous privileges
has been brought up.

387
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,819
-Mr. Jang.
-The prosecution

388
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,237
has issued an APB on Mr. Jang

389
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,739
-and has launched an investigation on him.
-Ms. Yun.

390
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,993
Did you hear?
They issued an APB on Mr. Jang.

391
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,370
Did Mr. Jang really do something wrong?

392
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,123
I don't have the faintest idea
of what's happening.

393
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,457
Mr. Oh and Mr. Jang aren't here.

394
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,585
Will I have to help Mr. Song
for the hearing?

395
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,422
You're here.

396
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,175
-Has Tae-jun called?
-No, he hasn't.

397
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,345
No, he hasn't.

398
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,390
Report to me if he calls.

399
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,766
Yes, sir.

400
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:56,156
I heard the prosecution
put out an APB on you. What's your plan?

401
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,452
Just go to the prosecutor's office.
I'll help you.

402
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,245
You can't be on the run forever.

403
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,415
Once I go in, my life will be over.

404
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,877
Even so, Tae-jun,
if Mr. Song's hearing reconvenes,

405
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,212
Assemblyman Lee won't be able
to stop him by himself.

406
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,798
I'm not going after Mr. Song.

407
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,967
I must go after someone more powerful.

408
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,429
The chairman of Youngil Group,
Sung Yeong-gi.

409
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,515
Is there anything I should know
regarding Youngil Group?

410
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,808
I told you not to worry!

411
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,977
When Mr. Song worked as a prosecutor,

412
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,021
he covered up Youngil Group's
slush fund case.

413
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,441
That's how he got into politics.
Youngil Group is his weak point right now.

414
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,153
I know that. But we didn't find
a single trace of his involvement

415
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,739
from the complete enumeration
of the borrowed-name bank accounts.

416
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,660
This will help.

417
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,879
How did the meeting
with the administrator go?

418
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,634
Mr. Lee Chang-jin
will be the last witness at the hearing.

419
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,679
It's been settled that the hearing
will start with the rest of the questions.

420
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,265
When the hearing resumes this afternoon,
you'll be asked some basic questions.

421
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,351
Consider this a formality

422
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,353
and answer the questions accordingly.

423
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,854
What about Lee Seong-min?

424
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,316
Don't worry. We've already changed
the order of his speaking time.

425
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,068
And Assemblyman Ahn will ask...

426
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,238
questions Assemblyman Lee
was planning to ask before his turn.

427
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,282
Until we resume, please get some rest.

428
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,537
Why do you still look concerned?

429
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,914
Aren't things going well
according to the plan?

430
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,585
Thinking of that punk Jang Tae-jun
is bothering me.

431
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,049
You and he are no longer in the same boat.
What can he do?

432
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,468
Both prosecutors are involved now.

433
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,304
I'm sure they will have him
in custody soon.

434
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,014
Please rest up for the time being.

435
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,728
They suddenly changed
the order of your speaking time.

436
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,188
They are trying to stop you
from asking these questions.

437
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,864
Mr. Song will end up becoming
the Minister of Justice,

438
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,324
so let's not provoke him
and end the hearing--

439
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,951
Even if the hearing ends in his favor,

440
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,954
Mr. Song won't let this slide.

441
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,457
He'll put more pressure on us
from a more powerful position.

442
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,375
But there's nothing we can do now.

443
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,335
Let's start with this.

444
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,342
The honorary chairman of Youngil Group,
Sung Yeong-gi.

445
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,137
During the slush fund case,
he divided the group and stepped back

446
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,555
as the honorary chairman.

447
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,099
That's when
Youngil Constructions' value dropped

448
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,727
and he sold it to Mr. Lee
of Joojin Chemical.

449
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,395
Then it became Joojin Constructions.

450
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,899
Mr. Lee bought a company
that was crumbling down

451
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,360
and has succeeded in growing the company.

452
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,155
This was possible
because he had an unexpected investor.

453
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:45,408
LD Global from Singapore
invested in his company.

454
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:50,163
The biggest shareholder with 33%
of Joojin Constructions' shares.

455
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,793
LD Global... Is that a paper company?

456
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,129
Yes, it only exists on paper.

457
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,633
The real owner of LD Global
is Chairman Sung Yeong-gi.

458
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,679
That means Lee Chang-jin
is only a figurehead.

459
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,348
The real owner of Joojin Constructions

460
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,683
is Sung Yeong-gi,
the honorary chairman of Youngil Group.

461
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,894
Yes, when Mr. Song worked as a prosecutor,

462
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,105
he didn't include any of this
in his report and ignored evidence.

463
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,149
And with the funds
he received from Youngil Group,

464
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,484
he got into politics.

465
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,944
And I'm pretty sure the fund came

466
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,488
from the slush fund
he created with the paper company.

467
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,282
I think he set up the slush fund
by selling off the shares

468
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,034
of LD Global.

469
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,702
And the fund is being used to lobby

470
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,579
Mr. Song and Samil Association.

471
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,709
Request the Financial Intelligence Unit
for the overseas transaction.

472
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,087
Once we trace the transfer
of the assets overseas,

473
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,505
we can find the flow of the funds

474
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,092
It will take over a month to receive
such information from the FIU.

475
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,677
Meanwhile,

476
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,930
we must find a connection
between Mr. Song and Chairman Sung.

477
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,516
We don't have much time left.
Where can we find it?

478
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,686
When LD Global increased the capital
by issuing new stocks on KOSDAQ,

479
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,438
an accounting firm was in charge
of evaluating the company's value.

480
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,899
It's Naon Accounting.

481
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,235
Naon Accounting...

482
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,573
They were once investigated
for fraudulent accounting and tax evasion.

483
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,033
And Mr. Song was
the prosecutor in charge again.

484
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,827
And of course, charges were cleared.

485
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,538
I'm sure the firm has
some relevant files left.

486
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,832
But do you think
they'll hand over the files?

487
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,169
Mr. Jang will take care of it.

488
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,219
NAON ACCOUNTING

489
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,643
Sir, you have a visitor.

490
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,270
Is that so? Okay.

491
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,358
So you're interested
in making investments?

492
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,776
Yes.

493
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,695
I'm Oh Yong-su, the CEO of the firm.

494
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,785
What kind of companies
are you interested in?

495
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,246
LD Global.

496
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,710
Where are you from?

497
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,045
Aren't you being investigated

498
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,714
by Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
on fraud charges?

499
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,095
Who are you? Get out of here quietly
before I call the police.

500
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,101
What do you think you're doing now?

501
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,145
We've arrived.

502
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,317
-Hey, call the police.
-There's no need.

503
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,653
-They are already here.
-Come in quickly.

504
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,405
What is this about?

505
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,283
We're from Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency. Please cooperate with us.

506
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,284
Start the search.

507
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,038
-What are you doing?
-I'm giving you a chance to choose.

508
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,374
It'll be only three years in prison
and two years on probation

509
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,583
for a simple fraud charge.

510
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,753
But you'll serve ten years max
for fraudulent accounting and tax evasion.

511
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,007
What is it that you want?

512
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,134
LD Global's ledger.

513
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,679
I think that will be enough
to save your life.

514
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,853
-Mr. Go.
-Yes.

515
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,896
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

516
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,358
Ms. Kang.

517
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,700
This isn't enough,

518
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,910
but you'll be able to pressure
Mr. Song with this.

519
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,538
Nonetheless, he'll keep denying
any connections with Youngil Group.

520
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,999
Even so, it will leave suspicions.

521
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,709
If he can't resolve them,

522
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,461
getting the hearing report approved
will be difficult.

523
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,716
Mr. Lee, the hearing will reconvene soon.

524
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,431
Let's try everything we can.

525
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,650
NOMINEE SONG HUI-SEOP'S HEARING

526
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,072
MINISTER OF JUSTICE NOMINEE

527
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,346
Mr. Song,
didn't you investigate Youngil Group

528
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,557
regarding their slush fund
when you were a prosecutor?

529
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,184
That's correct.

530
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,228
After the investigation, when some of
Youngil Group's companies were divided,

531
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,355
they sold off a few subsidiaries.

532
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,566
And one of them was Youngil Constructions.

533
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,986
Mr. Lee Chang-jin was the one
who bought Youngil Constructions,

534
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,113
which became Joojin Constructions
that we know of now.

535
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,909
This morning, you admitted to being
well-acquainted with Mr. Lee Chang-jin.

536
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,537
By any chance, are you also
well-acquainted with Youngil Group?

537
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,456
You sure jump to conclusions.

538
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,500
I do not know anyone from Youngil Group.

539
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,918
Are you certain?

540
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,920
Yes, I am.

541
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,630
Okay.

542
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,093
Then, have you heard
of a company called LD Global?

543
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,595
No, I have not.

544
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,971
Assemblyman Lee.

545
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,266
Please ask questions
that only concern the nominee.

546
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,434
LD Global is

547
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,437
the biggest shareholder with 33%
of Joojin Constructions' shares.

548
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,772
Surely, you must know that.

549
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,024
No, I don't.

550
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,402
When Mr. Lee and I meet,

551
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,949
we don't discuss anything
that has to do with his business.

552
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,452
Mr. Lee, as your time has run out--

553
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,454
You've met the CEO of LD Global,
haven't you?

554
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,290
-Who's the CEO?
-Turn off his microphone.

555
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,918
You know the connection
between Youngil Group and LD Global.

556
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,171
-Why aren't you answering?
-Time's up.

557
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,549
We'll adjourn for the time being.

558
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,188
How is it going?

559
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,315
-He won't talk.
-It's confidential.

560
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,943
I don't think I can acquire the info
before the hearing is over.

561
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,570
How's the hearing going?

562
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,697
Assemblyman Lee is doing a great job,

563
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,532
but we need definite proof.

564
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,035
If I have nothing,
I must fight with my bare hands.

565
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,122
Mr. Song doesn't know what card I have.

566
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,541
I must use this opportunity
and drive him into a corner.

567
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,294
-Then, he'll crumble on his own.
-What's your plan?

568
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,256
I must go into the tiger's den.

569
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,175
I'll call you.

570
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,517
Keep him for a few days.

571
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,227
Okay.

572
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,650
How did Assemblyman Lee find out
about LD Global?

573
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,528
It's probably that bastard, Jang Tae-jun.

574
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,992
Where's Tae-jun?
They still haven't caught him?

575
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,995
No, not yet. He went to Naon Accounting.

576
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,080
-What?
-But he had already left by the time

577
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,999
-the investigation team arrived.
-You idiot!

578
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,085
-Hey, Prosecutor Seo.
-Yes, sir.

579
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,378
You moron!

580
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,547
-Is this the best you can do?
-I'm sorry.

581
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,091
Find Jang Tae-jun
and bring him to me immediately.

582
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,509
Yes, sir.

583
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,013
We should go.

584
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,515
Damn it. That bastard.

585
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,256
I'm keeping him for the time being.

586
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,217
What do you think he told me?

587
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,639
What are you getting at?

588
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,724
You want to drag everyone down?

589
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,144
No, I want everyone to survive.

590
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,272
Including you

591
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,732
and me.

592
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,738
It seems like you're mistaken
about something.

593
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,616
You're just a chief of staff.

594
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,120
And Iâ€™m the future Minister of Justice
who will soon have the power

595
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,663
to move all the prosecutors in Korea.

596
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,499
But not yet.

597
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,670
It's such a pity.

598
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,216
I know how much you wanted
to become the Minister of Justice.

599
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,553
Are you threatening me?

600
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,680
Yes.

601
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,475
Go ahead and charge me
for blackmailing you as well.

602
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,769
You've already dumped
all your garbage on me.

603
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,522
Adding that to the list
won't make much of a difference.

604
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,326
Mr. Song.

605
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,703
If you want to live,

606
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,205
you'd better save me first.

607
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,416
Do you understand?

608
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,629
Good luck with the rest of your hearing.

609
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,269
Let's go.

610
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,692
Take him.

611
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,925
I'd like to thank all the assembly members
and the nominee

612
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,427
for having attended the hearing
which lasted a very long time.

613
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,348
I will now dismiss the hearing
regarding Assemblyman Song's

614
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,558
nomination for Minister of Justice.

615
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,811
The hearing is adjourned.

616
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,942
-Good work, everyone.
-Let's go.

617
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,903
What's your relationship
with Youngil Group and LD Global?

618
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,280
-Please explain to us, sir
-Okay, we'll explain next time.

619
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,825
-Please tell us how you're related.
-We'll tell you next time.

620
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,452
What kind of company is LD Global?

621
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,955
From what I know,
it's an investment company.

622
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,833
What does Assemblyman Song
have anything to do with LD Global?

623
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,544
I think you should ask that question
to Assemblyman Song

624
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,296
since he's already acquainted
with the owner of LD Global.

625
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,215
Before all these suspicions
get cleared up,

626
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,385
I don't think Assemblyman Song's
hearing report

627
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,053
should be approved.

628
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,474
And more importantly,
I request Assemblyman Song

629
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,810
to tell us the truth
regarding these suspicions himself.

630
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,062
The most important issue...

631
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,191
I'm so exhausted
after all that I had to go through today.

632
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,568
Why did you ask me to come?

633
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,570
I'm not the one who asked for you.

634
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,365
Chairman Sung returned to Korea today.

635
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,418
It's been a long time, Chairman Sung.

636
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,632
How was your trip?

637
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,468
You came back earlier than planned.

638
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,181
Why do you think I had to

639
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,932
alter my schedule?

640
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,352
I want you to step down from the candidacy

641
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,730
for Minister of Justice
before things get out of hand.

642
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,648
Sir.

643
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,193
I don't need to hear any more from you.

644
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,360
You don't need to worry.

645
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,906
-I'll make sure this doesn't affect you--
-Mr. Song.

646
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,617
Is it so hard for you
to understand what I'm saying?

647
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,080
I hope you didn't forget who helped you

648
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,166
come this far in the first place.

649
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,335
Of course not, sir.

650
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,647
If the hearing progress report
isn't approved,

651
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,274
it'll impose a great deal
of pressure on the Blue House.

652
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,984
As the former minister stepped down,

653
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,947
the president is even considering
withdrawing the minister appointment.

654
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,126
What took you so long to get here?

655
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,754
I'm sorry, sir.
I had to look into something.

656
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,804
I think Tae-jun did something
during last year's legislative election.

657
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,101
Lee Hyeong-bae?

658
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,936
Yes, he was the detective in charge

659
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,605
of Assemblyman Jo Nam-gi's bribery case
last legislative election.

660
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,733
It turns out that he and Tae-jun
went to the same police academy.

661
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,819
And they also worked together
for quite a long time.

662
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,363
They've exchanged quite a lot
of phone calls with each other.

663
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,783
-Detective Lee Hyeong-bae?
-Yes.

664
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,536
I'm from the Western Prosecutor's Office.

665
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,581
Please come with us.

666
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,710
Let go of me.

667
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,671
Apparently, Tae-jun was the one
who reported

668
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,924
Assemblyman Jo's bribery case
to Lee Hyeong-bae.

669
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,217
After the case became an issue,

670
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,344
one of the organizations
that supported Assemblyman Jo

671
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,513
paid for Assemblyman Lee's
election campaign fund.

672
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,183
And that organization
got exempted from the investigation.

673
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,768
Tae-jun blackmailed them for money

674
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,646
and agreed to let them get away
with the bribery in return.

675
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,523
And that money was used

676
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,984
for the election campaign fund
in the form of a donation.

677
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,990
So simply put, you're telling me

678
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:42,911
that Tae-jun threatened them
and received an illegal campaign fund?

679
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,371
-That's right.
-Are you sure?

680
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,374
Prosecutor Seo is investigating
the organization that funded Mr. Lee.

681
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,667
He'll find something for sure.

682
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,919
Let me think.

683
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,005
The legislative election was in March.

684
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:57,176
That's exactly when Tae-jun left
Assemblyman Lee's election camp

685
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,303
and started working for me.

686
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,387
That's right.

687
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,014
This is so touching.

688
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,184
Tae-jun left the camp
so it won't affect him.

689
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,352
What should I do?

690
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:10,439
I think this will be enough
to end Tae-jun's career.

691
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,568
It'll be such a waste
to only use this on Tae-jun.

692
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,572
If they're so close with each other,

693
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
they should go down together.

694
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:28,999
I guess we won't be having the meeting
regarding the hearing report tomorrow.

695
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,111
What are you doing here?

696
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,238
It's only right to visit a colleague

697
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,864
when he is being investigated.

698
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,287
I didn't know we were so close.

699
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,040
Hey, we've worked together for four years.

700
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,042
You're still so cold-hearted.

701
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,878
Hate is also a form of affection.
This is how nice I am.

702
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm here to relay Mr. Song's message.

703
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,343
He wants you released.

704
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,807
Hey, sit back down. I'm not done talking.

705
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,435
-Let's talk next time.
-You'll want to hear this.

706
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,062
It'll give you time to brace yourself.

707
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,777
You know Detective Lee Hyeong-bae, right?

708
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,072
He seems to be very successful for his age
and even got a special promotion.

709
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,991
I noticed that you helped him out a lot.

710
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,617
I don't know what you're talking about.

711
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,081
"I don't know what you're talking about."

712
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,584
Stop the act, you little jerk.

713
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,503
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min is
being accused of having received

714
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,340
an illegal campaign fund
during the last general election.

715
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,551
Heâ€™s being suspected of having received

716
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,179
tens of million won from his supporters
before the election

717
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,599
and having used that money
as an illegal campaign fund.

718
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,601
The prosecution will seize and search

719
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,144
Assemblyman Leeâ€™s office

720
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,521
-to find any relevant evidence...
-We're the prosecution.

721
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,606
and summon him.

722
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,025
And in order to carry out
a thorough investigation,

723
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,987
the prosecution will also be
investigating everyone

724
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,991
that took part in Assemblyman Lee's
election campaign.

725
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:30,078
The prosecution will seize and search
Assemblyman Lee's office in the morning,

726
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:34,208
and they claimed that they'll be
summoning Assemblyman Lee...

727
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,251
You acted all noble.

728
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,378
But I guess you're not so clean after all.

729
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,549
We've secured a testimony
from the organization that paid you.

730
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,219
What are you up to this time?

731
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,929
Where's Song Hui-seop?

732
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,305
"Song Hui-seop"?

733
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,686
You little jerk.

734
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,231
You'd better watch what you say.

735
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,857
Mr. Song's watching.

736
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,162
The prosecution is going to issue
an arrest warrant for you in two days.

737
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,498
You're only being released today

738
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:18,210
because Mr. Song was considerate enough
to give you time to settle things.

739
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,711
Right.

740
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,506
But you're lucky

741
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,759
since you have a girlfriend who can
take care of you when you're in custody.

742
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,011
Ask Ms. Kang

743
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,556
to pack you a lot of underwear.

744
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,018
It can get really hot in prison
during the summer.

745
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,273
You punk.

746
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,234
You totally messed up my tie.

747
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,482
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

748
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,223
SEOUL WESTERN DISTRICT COURT
SUMMONS

749
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,154
Assemblyman Lee.

750
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,114
Are you okay?

751
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,575
Yes.

752
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,204
I'm okay.

753
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,789
-Stop them!
-Assemblyman Lee!

754
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,541
-Did you receive illegal funds?
-Please explain how it happened.

755
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,752
Can you say a word
to those who are disappointed?

756
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,088
-Please explain what happened!
-Are the suspicions true?

757
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,383
-How did it happen?
-Please explain what happened!

758
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,553
Tae-jun did this all by himself!

759
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,430
Sir, you must act like
you weren't aware of it.

760
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,183
That jerk is nothing but trouble.

761
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,021
Assemblyman Lee, you must stand strong.

762
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,564
Nothing's been settled yet.

763
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,816
They can't investigate you

764
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,443
without the National Assembly's consent,
even with a warrant.

765
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,903
If you get investigated,

766
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,114
Mr. Song will do everything he can

767
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,366
to make you receive a sentence
for bribery.

768
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,204
Tell the prosecution...

769
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,500
that I'll get investigated.

770
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,793
Assemblyman Lee.

771
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,046
Assemblyman Lee, please reconsider.

772
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,685
This is why you should've
accepted my offer.

773
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,104
Then none of this would've happened.

774
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,404
I will never

775
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,406
cooperate with you.

776
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,243
I guess you really cherish
that pride of yours.

777
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,662
You're mistaken about something.

778
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,044
This is just the beginning.

779
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,589
I'll show you what happens

780
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,591
when you treat me with arrogance.

781
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,760
You completely ruined my hearing,

782
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:58,764
so you should be ready to pay for that.

783
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,853
The prosecution has started investigating

784
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,857
Assemblyman Lee's illegal fund case
and has decided to seize and search

785
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,319
Assemblyman Lee's house
to obtain evidence.

786
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,822
They've already seized and searched
Assemblyman Lee's office

787
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,574
in order to find evidence

788
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,701
-regarding the suspicions.
-Mom.

789
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,954
-And they announced that they will be
-Everything will be okay.

790
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,040
putting in their best effort
to solve the case

791
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:28,585
by investigating all the relevant people
and organizations regarding the suspicion.

792
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,253
It's okay.

793
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,306
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

794
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,442
The suspicions regarding
Assemblyman Lee...

795
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:53,944
Are they all true?

796
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,572
-If they're not true--
-They're true.

797
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,580
But he doesn't know anything.

798
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,165
I did it without telling him.

799
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,211
What are you going to do now?

800
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,549
There's nothing I can do.

801
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,385
If I get charged with bribery
on top of everything else,

802
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,846
I won't even be able to run
for the by-election.

803
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,099
Then that will eventually end
my political career.

804
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,312
-Tae-jun.
-How's Assemblyman Lee?

805
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,859
He agreed to get investigated.

806
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,694
He'll be going there soon.

807
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,029
I need to meet him.

808
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,616
I'll call you.

809
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,294
The prosecution announced
that theyâ€™ve obtained testimonial evidence

810
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,130
regarding suspicions of Assemblyman Leeâ€™s
illegal campaign fund.

811
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,633
According to the testimony,
Assemblyman Lee was given

812
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,968
a total of 50 million won.

813
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,846
And the relevant evidence
has been handed in.

814
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,433
A National Assembly source claimed
that both the ruling and opposition party

815
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,686
agree that this case needs to be
thoroughly investigated

816
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,647
and said theyâ€™re thinking of assigning
a special prosecutor.

817
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,565
The prosecution--

818
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,985
Don't bother watching that.

819
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,820
I know very well that you'd never

820
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,614
do something like that.

821
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,408
I know that, and our daughter knows that.

822
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,870
So please don't be bothered
by what they say.

823
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,499
I trust you, Dad.

824
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,502
This is all just a lie, right?

825
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,432
I need to go somewhere.

826
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,352
Where are you going?

827
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,230
The district office.

828
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,690
I need to settle some things there.

829
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,616
Honey.

830
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,409
My daughter.

831
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,329
I'm sorry.

832
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,614
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

833
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,671
BEST FATHER AWARD

834
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,590
THIS MAN WORKED HARD FOR HIS FAMILY,
MADE EFFORT TO CREATE A BETTER WORLD

835
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,176
AND TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY.
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR HERO.

836
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,149
Seong-min!

837
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,902
-Tae-jun.
-Hello.

838
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,362
Is Mr. Lee inside?

839
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,197
No, he just went to the district office.

840
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,366
-I see.
-Hey, Tae-jun.

841
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,618
Will my husband be okay?

842
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,037
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

843
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,913
Nothing will happen to him.

844
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,457
I'm sorry.

845
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,541
I'm really sorry.

846
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,126
-I'll be in touch.
-Okay.

847
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,382
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN'S OFFICE

848
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,684
Seong-min.

849
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,228
Open the door!

850
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,732
I know you're in there.
Please open the door.

851
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,193
Just go back.

852
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,403
I have nothing to say to you.

853
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,156
I know you're disappointed in me.

854
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,243
I'm sorry for making you go through this.

855
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,373
Don't go to the prosecution.

856
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,667
If you start getting investigated,

857
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,419
they'll summon you again and again,

858
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,670
and it'll never end.

859
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,547
They'll even get your wife involved.

860
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,717
I'll confess everything
and tell them you didn't know anything.

861
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,260
I'll tell them I did it!

862
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,720
And it's true!

863
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,184
Seong-min, you were right.

864
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,105
I must've come too far.

865
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,856
I'm sorry.

866
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,652
I'll take care of this.

867
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,612
I can do it.

868
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,660
I'll deal with everything.

869
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,578
I'm sorry, Seong-min.

870
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,708
I'm sorry.

871
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,752
I'll take care of it.

872
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,483
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

873
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,199
Minister Song, that's enough talking.
You should join us now.

874
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,492
We're all waiting for you.

875
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,077
Come on over, sir.

876
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,915
-Congratulations.
-There he is.

877
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,795
My goodness.

878
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,630
-Let's sit down.
-Yes.

879
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:52,594
Chairperson Lee also put in
a lot of effort to help us out.

880
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,511
Thank you, sir.

881
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,057
-Thank you.
-Great job.

882
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,767
Good work, everyone.

883
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,731
Assemblyman Song.

884
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,443
Now, you just need to get appointed
as the Minister of Justice.

885
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,323
Today will be the last day
we get to call you Assemblyman Song.

886
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,494
Is it okay if I call you
Minister Song now?

887
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,752
If I start counting my chickens
before they're even hatched,

888
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,213
people will think I lack prudence.

889
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,132
Don't refer to me as a minister yet.

890
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,470
Come to think of it, you're right.

891
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,388
I'm a businessman,

892
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,307
so I tend to be very impatient.

893
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,353
If you're a businessman,
it's only right to be impatient.

894
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,855
That's how you grow your business
and pay your employees.

895
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,440
-Right?
-Yes, sir.

896
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,817
By the way, about Assemblyman Lee...

897
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,653
He acted as if he was all noble.

898
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,404
But he received illegal campaign funds.

899
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,741
My goodness, I never thought
he'd do such a thing.

900
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,494
Assemblyman Lee always seemed

901
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:03,665
like a guy from the Joseon Dynasty.
And I sometimes even felt sorry for him.

902
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,084
It's quite sad to see his career
get ruined like this

903
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,711
just because of 50 million won.

904
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,879
Hey, come on.

905
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:13,299
Some people take big money,
and some people take small money.

906
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,510
But big or small, it's still money.

907
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,388
-You're right.
-So

908
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,139
let's all just take big money.

909
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,061
Cheers to big money.

910
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,312
Cheers!

911
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,390
I really wanted to build the world
we both always dreamed about.

912
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,477
I'm sorry.

913
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,356
You're on your own now.

914
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,942
Mr. Jang.

915
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,028
Just keep doing what you've been doing.

916
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,489
You'll do a great job.

917
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,666
Wish you luck.

918
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:56,444
Assemblyman Lee, who's suspected
of accepting illegal campaign funds,

919
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,404
will be investigated
by the prosecution tomorrow.

920
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,698
Meanwhile, the prosecution claims
to have secured evidence

921
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,492
to prove the suspicions
regarding the issue.

922
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,079
I want you to cause a bigger issue
regarding this case so that his name

923
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,789
will be all over the news tomorrow.

924
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,999
I've already sent additional information
to the press.

925
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,919
And the prosecution will be appointing
a special prosecutor for the case.

926
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,212
Good.

927
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,838
Assemblyman Lee...

928
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,216
He was such a hard-working politician.

929
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,135
He's finally going to become a star.

930
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,724
Mr. Song.

931
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,895
You're soon going to become a minister,

932
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,690
and Tae-jun's career is over.

933
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,025
Does that mean
I'll get to take over your district?

934
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,778
The chairperson
of the Judiciary Committee...

935
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,655
Don't get too greedy.

936
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,158
If you ask more than you can handle,
you'll end up in a mess.

937
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,995
Yes, sir. I just thought I'd ask.

938
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,708
You're good where you are.

939
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,085
-Yes, of course.
-If the suspicions turn out to be true,

940
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:55,586
he might end up...

941
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,675
Gosh, it seems like it's going to rain.

942
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,792
Seong-min. Both you

943
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,961
and I...

944
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,340
should get elected as an assemblyman
with a badge on our chest

945
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,718
and walk in there triumphantly!

946
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,847
A fair, corruption-free nation!

947
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,850
A country
where all of its people can prosper!

948
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,603
Let's work together
to create such a world!

949
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,230
Yes!

950
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,775
Like you said,

951
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,195
let's make a change in this world!

952
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,322
Let's make a change!

953
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,700
-Let's make a change!
-Let's make a change!

954
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,171
JANG TAE-JUN

955
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,217
Tae-jun.

956
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,052
Seong-min.

957
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,386
Tae-jun.

958
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,515
You don't need to go to the prosecution.

959
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,642
What do you mean?

960
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,854
And there's no need to feel sorry.

961
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,440
What are you talking about?

962
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,693
Let's meet. Where are you?
You're at the district office, right?

963
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,199
Hello... Hello?

964
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:55,873
Damn it.

965
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,922
Iâ€™ll take responsibility for everything.

966
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:08,923
Donâ€™t give up.

967
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,301
It takes ages for a flower to bloom,
but it withers in an instant.

968
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,554
I want you to trust whatever choice
I decide to make.

969
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,766
Tae-junâ€™s been missing
ever since he left the funeral.

970
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,351
Did you really take part in this?

971
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,561
You could receive
a criminal penalty for this.

972
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,772
The viper lost its fangs,

973
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:27,108
and the fox will soon get arrested.
So what do you say?

974
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,318
Ms. Kang, peopleâ€™s words

975
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,947
are more feared than the law in politics.

976
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,176
