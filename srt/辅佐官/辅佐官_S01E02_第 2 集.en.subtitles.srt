1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,229
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATE

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,982
WITH ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,413
-What about Jo Gap-yeong's material on me?
-They were destroyed.

4
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,954
ABOLISH SPECIAL ACTIVITY EXPENSES

5
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,713
HUNGER STRIKE

6
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,343
My goodness!

7
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,636
Let go!

8
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,933
Our job is like that of a doctor's.

9
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,020
We must take a close look
at people's scars in life

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,856
and get rid of what's veiled underneath.

11
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:32,193
A young man in his 20s passed away
while repairing a platform screen door.

12
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,279
-Dispatched workers...
-Numerous deaths due to...

13
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,948
Unsafe work environment
for subcontracted laborers

14
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,576
-is causing numerous deaths...
-Another unfortunate news...

15
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,828
A month after the death of Lee Yong-tae,

16
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,454
an employee of Bugang's subcontractor,

17
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,498
Kim Gwang-hun, who was
on a hunger strike,

18
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,083
committed suicide.

19
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,002
The protest of Bugang Electronics
employees

20
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,962
accusing them for wrongful dismissal

21
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,714
and demanding a better working environment

22
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,049
-marks its 4th year today.
-Find the essence of the problem

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,177
and fill in the gaps.

24
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,387
A total of 2.2 billion won
was provided nationwide.

25
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,264
Show me the graph.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,437
However, no one can predict the outcome.

27
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,771
Are you okay?

28
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,650
-Are you okay, sir?
-Yes.

29
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,027
-Please move.
-Are you okay?

30
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,111
Sir, please say something.

31
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,041
What matters is if he went against
the basic purpose of the audit.

32
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,376
We request a witness.

33
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,544
Da-jeong.

34
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,546
-Over here.
-Coffee, please.

35
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,631
Okay.

36
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,389
RESUME

37
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,603
A part-timer at a library, chauffeur
service driver, waiter, delivery man...

38
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,230
What a colorful resume.

39
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,106
You majored
in Library Information and Science?

40
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,609
He graduated from a local university.

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,654
I knew it. I heard working
as a chief of staff

42
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
is a plus when you take
the civil service exam.

43
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,991
He came here to improve his resume
using his connections.

44
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,534
-Here.
-Gosh.

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,957
Were you able to find
Mr. Jo's autobiography

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,334
because you used to work at a library?

47
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,379
Yes, I worked part-time
at the city library for a year.

48
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,298
And assemblymen's autobiographies
were donated occasionally.

49
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,676
I wanted to be of help
to you in any kind of way,

50
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,344
and I got really lucky.

51
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,180
Yes, you're a lucky guy.

52
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,307
I know it's an intern position,

53
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,519
but it's not easy to set foot here
in the first place.

54
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,772
Yes, I'm aware of that.

55
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,149
But I really want this job.

56
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,986
I'd like to learn from you,
whom I very much respect--

57
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,529
Okay, I get it.

58
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,410
Da-jeong. Prepare the recruitment
documents and send it to the secretariat.

59
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,162
-Okay, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

60
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,790
I know I have a lot to learn,
but I will do my best

61
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,792
to win your favor, sir.

62
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,298
Hello.

63
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,425
-Let's start the meeting.
-Yes.

64
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,810
-What are you doing?
-I should attend the meeting.

65
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,312
That's not necessary.

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,318
-Mr. Han.
-Yes?

67
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,112
You can use the desk over there.

68
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,656
Okay.

69
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,759
-I'll take that.
-Thank you.

70
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,263
-So you've started working here.
-Hello.

71
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,015
This is Secretary Lee Gwi-dong.

72
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,185
Just call me Mr. Lee. I'm fine with that.

73
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,187
-Thank you, sir.
-Work hard.

74
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,188
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,441
I'll be waiting downstairs.
Call me when he's out.

76
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,942
Okay.

77
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,323
Did you bring the required documents?

78
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,241
Oh, yes.

79
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,748
Here you go.

80
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,043
CERTIFICATE OF RESIDENCE

81
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,839
The CEO of UD Communications,
the director of Kangjin CNS,

82
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,508
the Board of Audit and Inspection's judge

83
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,511
will be our non-expert witnesses
for the inspection.

84
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,262
We found an issue regarding the court,

85
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,889
but we have nothing on the prosecution,

86
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,017
so we'll do what we can to find something
and report it to you by today.

87
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,858
Mr. Jo is meeting Park Jong-gil,
the Ministry of Justice.

88
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,943
What?

89
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,572
Jo Gap-yeong and Park Jong-gil?

90
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,491
What are they up to?

91
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,286
I really don't know what to say.

92
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,957
I just wanted to fright a mouse away,
but I ended up burning down my house.

93
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,253
Mr. Song has a great chief of staff.

94
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,088
Jang Tae-jun, right?

95
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,383
He's the reason why you gave up
on running for floor leader, right?

96
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,301
Well, I can't blame it all on him.

97
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,178
I blame it on myself.

98
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,682
I've never met anyone
who has a better character than you do.

99
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,310
But now that you're no longer
going to run for floor leader,

100
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,979
what do you plan to do now?

101
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,191
When you're in politics, good or bad,
you should never forget what happened.

102
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,944
I should repay Song Hui-seop
for what he did to me.

103
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,659
The audit is coming up.

104
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,995
Isn't Lee Chang-jin,
the CEO of Joojin Chemical

105
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,330
being internally investigated
by the prosecution?

106
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,751
He's being investigated
for illegal gift exchange and bribery.

107
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,629
Lee Chang-jin...

108
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,756
It's a nice move.

109
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,551
I'm being sensitive
because they're meeting right now.

110
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,677
Mr. Jang.

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,138
-I'll call you back.
-You know Jang Yong-gi of Kookmin Party?

112
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,848
Who joined the Judiciary Committee?

113
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,933
Yes, he may be in a different party,

114
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,852
but he's very close with Assemblyman Jo.

115
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,188
He moved the standing committee
to the Judiciary Committee,

116
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,065
and his office requested for a witness.
I think you need to have a look.

117
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,616
I'm going to convince the opposition party

118
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,869
to make Lee Chang-jin attend
the audit of the Judiciary Committee.

119
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,537
Imagine the look

120
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,457
on Song Hui-seop's face
when he sees him at the audit.

121
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,709
LIST OF WITNESSES

122
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,298
Hello, I'm Jang Tae-jun.

123
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,097
I'm Lee Chang-jin,
the manager of Samil Association.

124
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,016
-It's nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

125
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,478
The only reason Mr. Song
was able to last this long

126
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,355
was all thanks to Lee Chang-jin.

127
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,106
If we separate those two,

128
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,943
he'll have no one to depend on,
and his career will eventually be over.

129
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,950
So I'm actually here to ask you
for a favor.

130
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,868
Up until now,

131
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,121
Lee Chang-jin has not once
attended the audit as a witness.

132
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,000
I know that he's been using excuses

133
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,378
such as business trips
and his health issues to avoid them.

134
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,337
Yes.

135
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,008
He's planning to go on another
business trip abroad this time around.

136
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,095
Darn it.

137
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,933
Today a school bus for children
was involved in an accident...

138
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,895
It was later found out that the bus
was not registered as...

139
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,438
Hey, Mr. Lee. It's me.

140
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,315
Yes, I know.

141
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,694
Just say you have a business trip abroad
and stay there for a while.

142
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,654
We need to avoid what we can.

143
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,990
What?

144
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,326
But he won't be able to avoid
the audit this time.

145
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,662
We banned him from leaving the country.

146
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,127
But do you think Mr. Song will stay still?

147
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,380
How is he going to protect a law-breaker?

148
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,803
-Those little jerks.
-Last night, Minister Park Jong-gil...

149
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,098
They've done tons of illegal stuff.

150
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,475
I can't believe they're acting
like they haven't!

151
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,396
He promised that the reformation
will set an example to the prosecution

152
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,441
and showed his determination
to do his best until the end.

153
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,109
Up until now...

154
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,486
He was a nobody
back when I was the chief prosecutor.

155
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,407
But now that he took my place,
he must be having the time of his life.

156
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,909
How impressive, Park Jong-gil.

157
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,453
What's your plan?

158
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,455
If you stop him
from standing as a witness,

159
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,373
The opposition party won't stay still.

160
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,293
And that will take a toll on you, sir.

161
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,920
They started this fight
because they knew that.

162
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,381
Jo Gap-yeong, that dumb punk,

163
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,550
came up with a smart move this time.

164
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,636
My goodness.

165
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,099
Lee Chang-jin is the one
who will pave the way for us.

166
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,893
We need to do something.

167
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,692
Mr. Jang, shouldn't you begin
forming a campaign club?

168
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,196
If you put me in charge,
I promise I'll do my best.

169
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,490
-Have a glass.
-Okay.

170
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,535
My goodness, it seems
like I'm going to be busy next year.

171
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,620
What?

172
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,622
I'll be aiding our future assemblyman

173
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,917
and our future Minister of Justice.

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,085
My goodness.

175
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,672
-Let's all have a glass!
-Sure.

176
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,424
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,475
-What happened?
-I also got a call 10 minutes ago.

178
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,185
So I'm not quite sure.

179
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,145
Ms. Kang.

180
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,940
You're late. The meeting ended just now.

181
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,858
You should learn to be on time.

182
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,574
Are you done?

183
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,493
This is different from mine.

184
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,704
What happened?

185
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,330
You should've at least told me.

186
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,959
Can I see
the Environmental Protection Bill file?

187
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,752
-That one.
-Yes, sir.

188
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,428
I thought the Environment
and Labor Committee meeting was at 10 a.m.

189
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,805
I guess I was wrong.

190
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,474
Something came up, so I changed the time.

191
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,309
I'm sure someone contacted you.

192
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,563
My secretary must've made a mistake.

193
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,775
I doubt your secretary
would make such a mistake.

194
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm sure it was our mistake.

195
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,786
I really can't seem
to trust anyone these days.

196
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,543
The meeting I had last time
regarding environmental law...

197
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,712
Not many were involved
in submitting the bill,

198
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,923
so I wonder how Jang Tae-jun ended up
hearing about it.

199
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,509
I'll look into it, sir.

200
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,932
I should've prepared for it.

201
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,227
I'm really ashamed, sir.

202
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,900
It wasn't your fault.

203
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,070
I'll send the meeting materials
via your chief of staff.

204
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,491
Thank you, sir.

205
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,205
ENVIRONMENT AND LABOR COMMITTEE
CHAIRPERSON'S OFFICE

206
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,539
It seems like he's thinking

207
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,084
that you helped Tae-jun get the files.

208
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,628
The materials on the bill.

209
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,130
-He's not mistaken.
-Pardon?

210
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,633
-I gave them to him.
-Really?

211
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,594
Why did you do that?

212
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,680
We were bound to split up one day.
It's just a little earlier than expected.

213
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,726
Don't tell Mr. Jang, okay?
It's embarrassing.

214
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,275
Mr. Jang.

215
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,070
We need to settle
the list of witnesses by today.

216
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,613
It has been continuing for four years.

217
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,281
That's going to bury most of the issues

218
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,658
that arise at the audit.

219
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,203
A month after a subcontractor employee
passed away,

220
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,164
Kim Gwang-hun, another protestor
who's been demanding the cancellation

221
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,668
of the wrongful dismissal and a better
working environment, committed suicide.

222
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,461
What's the death toll
on Bugang's laborers?

223
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,630
-Just a second.
-It's 30, sir.

224
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,382
Many people are enraged...

225
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,551
That's including Kim Gwang-hun
who died yesterday.

226
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,220
I always make sure to watch the news.

227
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,721
That is the overall analysis.

228
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,225
The families of the deceased
are planning to hold a protest.

229
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,519
How many cases are there
regarding Bugang Electronics?

230
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,981
There are 18 including this case
and the unfair dismissal from 4 years ago.

231
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,234
They will be joining the protest
along with civic group.

232
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,070
By doing so, they hope the company
will respond

233
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,865
to the unfairly dismissed laborers
and their questions...

234
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,032
Bye, sir.

235
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,203
Hurry up and finish.
Are you going to take all day?

236
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,873
Okay.

237
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,127
I'll call the CEO of Bugang Electronics
to the Judiciary Committee.

238
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,511
-Bugang?
-The ruling party and the opposition party

239
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,889
will both favor the CEO of Bugang
more than Lee Chang-jin.

240
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,682
And the prosecution is
in charge of his case.

241
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,810
The district attorney is
very close with the Minister of Justice.

242
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,355
If we get him involved in the audit,
the minister will be put in a pickle.

243
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,900
But will it be possible?

244
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,319
He even avoids getting investigated
by the prosecution.

245
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,653
I'll do what I can.

246
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,240
Okay, make sure we get Bugang
as our witness.

247
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,784
I'll talk to the chairperson
of the standing committee

248
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,162
and the coordinator
of the opposition party.

249
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,539
Bugang Electronics...

250
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,207
Sounds perfect.

251
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,212
We're going to call the CEO of Bugang

252
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,214
-as our witness.
-What?

253
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,175
The Environment and Labor Committee
already did.

254
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,636
And the schedule overlaps with ours.

255
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,138
-Who requested him?
-Ms. Kang.

256
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,766
-The restructuring of Bugang--
-What's this?

257
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,560
The Judiciary Committee
also made a request for Bugang's CEO

258
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,937
It's Mr. Song's office.

259
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,315
Jang Tae-jun, that sly little jerk.
He's trying to take everything.

260
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,192
Don't worry too much.

261
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,985
I'll go talk some sense into him.

262
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,488
The sly little jerk is already here.

263
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,991
Well, speak of the devil.
I guess he knew we were talking about him.

264
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,243
Hey, Mr. Jang, we need to talk.

265
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,621
I'll talk to him.

266
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,581
Come inside.

267
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,291
But ma'am...

268
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,793
What's up with her?

269
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,676
He must think he's on the same level
as Ms. Kang now.

270
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,847
You don't look like someone
who's here to ask for a favor.

271
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,976
-Is this a declaration of war?
-It's both.

272
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,270
I'm going to make the CEO of Bugang
stand as our witness.

273
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,231
You're trying to use him

274
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,817
so Lee Chang-jin won't have to attend
the audit, right?

275
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,656
My gosh, I really can't fool you.

276
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,202
-Yes, you're right.
-Use one issue to cover another issue?

277
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,665
I'm not surprised that you came up
with that idea.

278
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,252
But you know it's going to be hard
to bring the CEO of Bugang as a witness.

279
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,545
And if you mess with him,

280
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,089
you'll be going against the Environment
and Labor Committee.

281
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,009
-Is that really necessary?
-If I want something,

282
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,969
I should take the necessary risks.

283
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,645
I'll be put in a pickle
if I lose our core witness to you.

284
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,773
And shouldn't you convince someone else
before you try to convince me?

285
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,275
What?

286
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,194
The guy who's been wanting to deal
with Bugang for a long time.

287
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,864
-Who's that?
-Assemblyman Lee Seong-min.

288
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,909
He also requested him as a witness.

289
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,953
We'll be working on Bugang together.

290
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,123
DISPOSAL OF BUGANG'S ASSETS

291
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,291
BUGANG'S SALES DATA

292
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,800
MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND SAFETY

293
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,346
Hello, Minister. Have you been well?

294
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,015
I'm sorry I haven't called.

295
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,892
You're sorry?

296
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,478
What have you been so busy with?

297
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,605
The audit's coming up.

298
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,816
I'm so busy with work these days.

299
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,942
Do you want to die?

300
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,738
My goodness.

301
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,365
Who would want to die?

302
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,035
Then why don't you ever call?

303
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,204
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,415
If you don't answer my phone call again,
I'll really kill you.

305
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,460
I sent you some extra clothes,
so get changed.

306
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,754
Don't go around looking all shabby.

307
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,339
Okay.

308
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,673
You should come home next week.

309
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,926
Your daughter misses you. Okay?

310
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,554
Okay, ma'am. Have a good day.

311
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,392
-Sir.
-Is everything ready for the meeting?

312
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,770
Yes, sir. Should I postpone the meeting?

313
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,647
You haven't slept for days, so you--

314
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,856
No, it's okay.

315
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,526
-I'll keep postponing it then.
-But...

316
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,487
-Gosh, I'm fine.
-You should at least get the IV out.

317
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,698
-Doctor.
-No, it's okay. Just leave it.

318
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,492
Take this.

319
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,832
Of all people, why does it have to be
Mr. Lee Seong-min?

320
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,583
-What about him?
-Mr. Jang

321
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,086
was a member of Mr. Lee's campaign team.

322
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,338
But he quit in the middle.

323
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,758
It was very unlikely for Mr. Lee
to get elected back then.

324
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,636
But the other competing candidate resigned
after being accused of corruption.

325
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,264
He ended up getting elected even though
he was affiliated with no party.

326
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,184
In other words,
Mr. Jang ended up becoming a traitor.

327
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,063
Don't say that
when you don't even know anything.

328
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,108
I didn't say anything wrong.

329
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,694
I'm sure Mr. Jang had his reasons.

330
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,237
He's not a traitor.

331
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,781
What's with him?

332
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,035
You're still on bad terms
with Mr. Lee, right?

333
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,747
Who would like a traitor?

334
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,293
The unfair dismissal of Bugang
is currently under investigation.

335
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,044
It'd be better to yield him to us...

336
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,801
He wants us to yield Mr. Kim
to the Judiciary Committee.

337
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,428
"Yield"?

338
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,097
Do you think this is a joke?

339
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,478
You guys were never even interested
in Bugang.

340
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,356
-So why the sudden interest?
-Mass dismissal. Industrial accidents.

341
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,609
They're all problems
regarding the Subcontract Act.

342
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,611
The modified act already got proposed,

343
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,822
and it'll be more effective for us
to deal with Bugang's issues.

344
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,699
You neglected it even when you knew that?

345
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,034
I'll do my best to--

346
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,204
Tae-jun, the audit isn't a place
for you to show off how good you are.

347
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,998
Are you trying to use the weak
to make yourself stand out?

348
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,708
We need to be very careful about this.

349
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,668
The Environment and Labor Committee
has been--

350
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,629
You've tried to resolve the issue
for four years,

351
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,006
but there was no progress.

352
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,051
We'll do what you've failed to do.

353
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,182
What happens if both sides don't yield?

354
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,184
Then both sides will end up
losing a witness.

355
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,144
It'll only end up
benefitting the CEO of Bugang.

356
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,480
Should we find another issue?

357
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,776
There's no need. Just stick to the plan.

358
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,111
Mr. Jang, if we fail to make him stand
as our witness,

359
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,780
we'll have to take responsibility.

360
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,323
But what if they refuse to yield?

361
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,116
We need to make them give up.

362
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,202
Get me the recent issues
of their Committee.

363
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,119
Yes, sir.

364
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,542
My gosh, when is he going to finish
going through all of that?

365
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,212
We should at least know
what they're preparing.

366
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,922
He's so stubborn.

367
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,511
Da-jeong, get us some lunch boxes.
We'll have no time to eat outside.

368
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,805
-Okay.
-I'll go.

369
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,142
-What do I need to get?
-Anything's fine.

370
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,354
Anything? Okay.

371
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,191
The doors are opening.

372
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,905
He's asking so many questions.

373
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,783
Excuse me.

374
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,582
We should at least know
what they're preparing.

375
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,296
Okay, great.
Where's the questionnaire draft?

376
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,131
-Give me the draft.
-Just a second.

377
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,925
-What?
-It's not here.

378
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,760
-What are you talking about?
-What?

379
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,470
-Where is it?
-It was here a while ago.

380
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,930
Are you kidding me?

381
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,931
I think I dropped it.

382
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,268
-Darn it.
-Damn it.

383
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,571
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP

384
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,907
What took you so long?
I was about to starve to death.

385
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,368
What's that?

386
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,038
I found this in the corridor.

387
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,622
Would this be of help?

388
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,087
Gosh, you are driving me crazy.

389
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,466
Mr. Han, you can't bring stuff like this.

390
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,135
-Well, I...
-My gosh.

391
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,305
They're coming.
I had nothing to do with this.

392
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,766
You take care of it.

393
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,898
What's this? Is he your intern?

394
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,151
I'm sorry. He just started working here,
so he must've made a mistake.

395
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,819
I'll apologize on his behalf.

396
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,529
An apology isn't going to cut it.

397
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,448
Where's Jang Tae-jun?

398
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,449
-Sir.
-Jang Tae-jun!

399
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,745
Hey, Tae-jun.

400
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,332
You're asking your intern
to steal stuff now?

401
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,334
What are you talking about?

402
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,712
I get that you want our witness,

403
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,673
but did you seriously have to steal
our questionnaire?

404
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,759
-Sir...
-Stay still.

405
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,011
I guess you taught him to steal stuff.

406
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,721
What a way to educate your intern.

407
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,600
Sir, you know Mr. Jang would never ask
anyone to do something like this.

408
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,561
He's a traitor who betrays people
for his own good.

409
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,021
So he's more than capable.

410
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,358
That was out of line.

411
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,777
I already told you it was a mistake
and even apologized.

412
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,779
You're being very rude right now.

413
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:26,947
"Rude"?

414
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,533
Ms. Yun, you sound very arrogant.

415
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,493
How long have you even worked here?

416
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,370
That's enough.

417
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,422
We all used to work as a team,
so don't cause a fuss like this.

418
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,467
Mr. Jang.

419
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,221
Let's be fair, okay?

420
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,807
I'm sorry, sir.

421
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,323
Are you serious?

422
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,577
What were you thinking?

423
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,497
My gosh. You are unbelievable.

424
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,249
I'm sorry.

425
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,544
Why did you bring that here?

426
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,046
-Mr. Han.
-That's enough.

427
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,803
Mr. Jang, things are really
getting out of hand.

428
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,930
Let's just give up on Bugang.

429
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,142
We're bound to get criticized
if things keep going this way.

430
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,144
We have no way to make him our witness.

431
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,688
Let's say there's a divorce suit.

432
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,107
And both sides want custody
of their child.

433
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,066
What do you do then?

434
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,112
Let the child choose.

435
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,118
I'll meet the CEO of Bugang.

436
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,245
Mr. Kim, keep me updated
on what's going on.

437
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,372
Hye-won, talk to reporters
and raise the issue.

438
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,041
-Okay.
-Okay.

439
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,252
Go ahead and eat.

440
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,674
I won't ever make the same mistake again.
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,640
Our stock price is plummeting

442
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,683
after the recent suicide of our employee.

443
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,394
We really need to do something to...

444
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,647
Try your best to keep the press quiet.

445
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,148
I'll take care of the rest.

446
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:26,900
Okay, sir.

447
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,402
What are you doing?
Shouldn't you be in a hurry?

448
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,989
Yes, of course.

449
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,082
You're Mr. Kim Hyeon-su,
the CEO of Bugang, right?

450
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,292
I'm Jang Tae-jun from Mr. Song's office,

451
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,962
and I called you regarding your attendance
as our witness.

452
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,547
I'm sure my secretary called you.

453
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,341
I'll be going on a business trip
in three days for a month.

454
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,261
So I won't be able to attend the audit
for both committees.

455
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,762
Yes, I heard.

456
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,181
But if you refuse to attend,

457
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,183
we'll have to file a warrant
to accompany you,

458
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,060
and we might even sue you
for not attending.

459
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,523
Fine.

460
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,733
You're going to sue me? Go ahead.

461
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,111
How much is the fine again?

462
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,530
Was it 10 million won or 20 million won?

463
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,034
That's less than one day's worth
of alcohol.

464
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,541
What a waste.

465
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,211
You can eat the rest if you didn't eat.

466
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,148
-Hey.
-What happened?

467
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,692
He's throwing a tantrum
saying he doesn't want to go.

468
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,570
-What about the reporters?
-Bugang must be pressuring them.

469
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,990
I didn't think the others would cooperate,
so I came to Dodam Daily.

470
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,074
Dodam Daily?

471
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,245
-Will you be okay?
-I can handle it.

472
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,788
What are you going to do?

473
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,916
If I can't convince him with words,
I'll just have to pressure him.

474
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,001
Good luck.

475
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
-Isn't that her?
-Yes, it is.

476
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,926
-Is she nuts?
-She must be crazy.

477
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,637
-She's one of a kind.
-Seriously.

478
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,726
-Hye-won.
-Seung-u.

479
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,211
Do you have something for me?

480
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,841
Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office
is in charge of all Bugang cases.

481
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,095
And they're constantly
delaying the summons on the CEO.

482
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,473
And this even got sent
to the Prosecutor's Office.

483
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,225
But they're not even budging.

484
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,019
That's how sensitive this issue is.

485
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,771
They're being very careful.

486
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,857
If things go haywire,

487
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,819
we won't be the only ones in trouble.

488
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:20,699
I'm trying to tell you that it took me
a lot of effort to get that.

489
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:25,120
Anyway, you'll have to buy me
something better than coffee this time.

490
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,796
You know Bugang's our main advertiser.

491
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,883
So even if I write an article about them,
it won't be published.

492
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,386
I don't like it, but I have no choice.

493
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,808
Check your email.

494
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,067
What about another article?

495
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,736
If you write this article,

496
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,321
you can report
our inspection press release exclusively.

497
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,158
I have nothing to lose
if it's from Mr. Song's office.

498
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,077
-What is it about?
-I'll round it up and send it.

499
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,538
You'll like it too. I'll get going.

500
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,456
Sure.

501
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,374
Hey, Hye-won.

502
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,585
Tell me if you wish to return.

503
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,378
I'll make sure I find you a job.

504
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,380
Thanks.

505
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,507
But I like my current job better.

506
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,143
-Mr. Jang?
-Yes, I'm on my way back.

507
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,729
The CEO of Bugang changed
his business trip schedule.

508
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,397
He's leaving the country today.

509
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,025
What time is his flight?

510
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
Why are you here?

511
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,291
Are you going to drag me out or something?

512
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,959
No way.

513
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,378
You'll be bored during your long flight.

514
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,797
You should read this on the plane.

515
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,678
INVESTIGATION REPORT

516
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,103
The news article has been uploaded.

517
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,778
You should check that too.

518
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,119
CEO A OF A MAJOR CORPORATE
ASSAULTS HIS MISTRESS AND ABUSES DRUG

519
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,458
Who do you think President A is?

520
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,629
You should take our hand
before you drop down any further.

521
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,089
If you go to the inspection,

522
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,466
you must give up
on all the trials you are involved in.

523
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,968
The amount of damage,

524
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,428
fine, and compensation
the company must pay will be astronomical.

525
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,055
Mr. Kim.

526
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,684
You should be more worried about yourself
than your company.

527
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,770
See you at the inspection.

528
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,319
-We'll look into the employment
-Okay.

529
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,446
-security agreement of developed nations.
-Ms. Kang.

530
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,408
Mr. Kim refused to be
a witness for our standing committee.

531
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,705
-That happens often.
-It's not like that.

532
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,040
He'll be a witness
for the Judiciary Committee.

533
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,024
I will call you back in a moment.

534
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,781
How did you persuade Mr. Kim?

535
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,867
You won't take any damage.

536
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,911
And don't worry
about Bugang's trial either.

537
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,120
Jang Tae-jun.

538
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,998
Don't worry about the process.
Just look at the result.

539
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,792
If the process wasn't right,
the result won't be right either.

540
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,628
Do you have to win by all means?

541
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,880
Is that so important?
It's more important to win.

542
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,382
You said you wanted to change the world.

543
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,885
You must win to be able to do anything.

544
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,057
Do you know why they have been
protesting here every year?

545
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,810
Because they have never won.

546
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,145
If things were done your way,

547
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,606
they will continue to sit there
next year too.

548
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,657
You know why
I quit my job with the police.

549
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,493
Tae-jun, but there is a line
you must never cross!

550
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,411
I do not care if you criticize my tactics.

551
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,830
You can't change anything without power.

552
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,835
I will do this.
And I will take responsibility.

553
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,603
They completely ignore

554
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,190
the nature of this incident
and keeps on discussing the background.

555
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,068
The unfair investigation of...

556
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,320
Do not let the situation get out of hand.

557
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,031
What is it? What are you doing?

558
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,158
Go back! You'll hurt those people
if you go up now!

559
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,495
Come down.
People will get hurt if you go up now.

560
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,665
Don't go up!

561
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,295
The SWAT team was deployed

562
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,589
to disperse the employees

563
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,299
of Bugang Electronics in protest.

564
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,469
The police said this particular operation
was an execution of their duty.

565
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,681
They arrested around 20 people who are
responsible for the violent protest.

566
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,615
I should have given up
and looked for something else.

567
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,201
The Environment and Labor Committee
can handle it with no witness.

568
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,163
But with witnesses
you could grab more attention.

569
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,499
I'm sorry about this.

570
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,460
Don't be sorry.

571
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,503
This is why I like you, Tae-jun.

572
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,547
Will Mr. Jo just stay still?

573
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,008
He might hold you responsible for this.

574
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,388
Then I'll find another way
to make a living, thanks to you.

575
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,535
You got here early.

576
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,000
Is the world changing?

577
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,879
I can't believe you asked to see me first.

578
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,839
The world always changes, no?

579
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,980
INSPECTION SCHEDULE

580
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,484
30TH, THURSDAY: PREPARE DOCUMENTS

581
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,735
This is the entire schedule.

582
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,073
We'll get awfully busy starting today.

583
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,742
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

584
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,369
CHOE HYEON-RYONG
KIM HYEON-SU

585
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,121
Forget all the other ones.

586
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,414
Focus on the prosecutor's office
and Bugang.

587
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,543
Mr. Kim, request investigation
and dividend records with the prosecution.

588
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,045
Hye-won, make a draft of questions
based on those records.

589
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,713
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

590
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,968
Excuse me.

591
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,804
No need to raise your hand.

592
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,014
What should I do?

593
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,645
Here are materials regarding work manual,

594
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,814
and the recruitment and punishment manual.

595
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,276
Also, task reports from each organization,
stenographic records,

596
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,653
requested material,
responses, and statute books.

597
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,240
Read these and put together a file
regarding the prosecution.

598
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,700
Yes. Excuse me.

599
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,661
Do I have to finish all this in a day?

600
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,165
Yes. We have no time to waste.
You can keep your questions for later.

601
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,708
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,431
-Right here.
-Take this.

603
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,515
Okay.

604
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,726
Here it is.

605
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,353
The prosecution delayed
Bugang's trial on purpose.

606
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,398
They keep changing the prosecutor
to delay the trial again.

607
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,233
I'm sure all 18 cases are like that.

608
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,068
-Request more files and check.
-Yes.

609
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,030
Focus on the relationship

610
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,615
between the prosecution and Bugang.

611
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,116
Get the materials ready accordingly.

612
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,743
Yes, sir.

613
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,578
-Take out these words and change them.
-Ma'am.

614
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,913
For the press conference.

615
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,790
-Did you check the restructuring?
-I'm on it.

616
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,210
As you can see...

617
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,589
You okay? I'll do it.

618
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,633
-No, we'll do it.
-I'll do it.

619
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,968
-Come on.
-No, we'll do it.

620
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,428
-Goodness.
-No way.

621
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,140
And 17.7 percent of the workforce

622
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,810
are either unemployed
or only holds a temporary position.

623
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,938
-The number of forced layoffs...
-Son.

624
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,648
-and retirements.
-When will you come home?

625
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,442
I'll come home tomorrow. Go to bed.

626
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,236
A total of 974 people, 1.5 billion won.

627
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,862
Last year, a total of 2 billion won.

628
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,614
May I go home now?

629
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,366
It's very late. You should go.

630
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,451
-Yes.
-Goodbye.

631
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,119
Give me the graphs.

632
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,285
Looks like a great start. Good work.

633
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,329
I'll go fix my hair.

634
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,664
The National Assembly began

635
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,166
the inspection of the government offices
as of today.

636
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,961
Including the Judiciary Committee,
the Environment and Labor Committee,

637
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,172
a total of 12 standing committees will
inspect the Central Prosecutors' Office

638
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,632
and the Ministry of Labor today.

639
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,676
The Judiciary Committee will

640
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,929
discuss the recent suicide of a laborer
of Bugang Electronics.

641
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,224
There is a keen interest to find out
if this inspection will resolve

642
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,978
the unfair dismissal of Bugang Electronics
which have been going on for four years.

643
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,821
It finally began.

644
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,875
Gosh, I've only seen this on TV before.
This is so cool.

645
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,461
-to see it in real life.
-What is?

646
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,508
I'm standing in the center
of what moves this nation.

647
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,305
It seems like this is the heart of Korea.

648
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,820
Hey, Mr. Jang.

649
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,697
I liked your item.

650
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,075
Why didn't you give it to us?
You're a bit too harsh.

651
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,618
I just got lucky.

652
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,827
Don't be so humble.

653
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,037
-Excuse me.
-How do you feel?

654
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,247
You brought the CEO of Bugang too.

655
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,208
The viper's season is back.

656
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,959
-Say something.
-A word, please.

657
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,336
-Please, say something.
-Mr. Kim.

658
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,838
-A word, please.
-Anything to the people?

659
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,757
-What will you say?
-Say something.

660
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,050
I'll call later.

661
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,011
-Mr. Song.
-Yes.

662
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,016
Great work, Mr. Jo.

663
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,976
Sure. You too.

664
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,561
You're here for a tough day.

665
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,527
Did he go insane after he got betrayed?

666
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,278
How can he be laughing right now?

667
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,822
-Let's go.
-Yes.

668
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,250
What's going on?

669
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,756
Hello, sir.

670
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,718
KANG SEON-YEONG

671
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,558
LEE SEONG-MIN

672
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,322
Bring him immediately!

673
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,534
How can we get Mr. Lee Chang-jin
of Joojin Chemical as a witness now?

674
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,537
He's the key man of the illegal transfer
of management rights.

675
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,748
And he has ties with the politics,
economics, press, and the prosecution.

676
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,459
You need to call
such an important witness.

677
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,335
-This is enough!
-Is it because Mr. Lee has

678
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,129
a special relationship with Mr. Song?

679
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:08,716
We already finalized the witness list.
What is this nonsense?

680
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,926
You can't overlook
the National Assembly Law like this!

681
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,847
Then who dissipated the witness selection
with the assistants' agreement? Who?

682
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,017
-Mr. Song Hui-seop!
-Quiet, you.

683
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,852
If you do not bring Mr. Lee as a witness,

684
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,812
you can't continue the inspection!

685
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,398
-What did you say?
-Let me go! Let go!

686
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,317
-What's with you?
-Let me go!

687
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,110
That idiot.

688
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,612
Darn it.

689
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,239
CHIEF OF
CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

690
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,164
I'm telling you to call him now. Now!

691
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,541
If you do not bring Mr. Lee as a witness,

692
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,710
you can't continue the inspection!

693
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,629
What did you say?

694
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,757
Ms. Kang Seon-yeong, begin your inquiry.

695
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,762
I would like to ask
the Minister of Employment and Labor.

696
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,806
Are you aware of the disputed
dismissal of Bugang Electronics?

697
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,266
I looked into the matter.

698
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,852
Not only that
but also the subcontractor's laborers--

699
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,688
Ms. Kang.
An issue that is undergoing a trial is

700
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,565
discussed by the Judiciary Committee.

701
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,818
Refrain from asking unrelated questions.

702
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,573
Most laborers who work
for Bugang's subcontractors were

703
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,284
working in a harmful environment,
where occupational illness

704
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,578
cannot be found in an early stage.

705
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,165
Ms. Kang,
the witness isn't from the company.

706
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,417
You must ask appropriate questions.

707
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,835
Refrain from doing that.

708
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,173
CHAIRPERSON JO GAP-YEONG

709
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,971
Have you heard of "outsourcing dangers"?

710
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,683
It means you give dangerous jobs
to laborers of a subcontractor.

711
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,563
Can you give me one more minute?

712
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,861
Bugang has also been
outsourcing dangerous jobs.

713
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,199
Ms. Kang, your time is up.

714
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,118
-You must stop.
-Sir.

715
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,369
We will adjourn the session

716
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,788
and return in two hours.

717
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,670
Let's go.

718
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,677
Ms. Kang, one second.

719
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,891
I think he knows that
you gave the documents to Tae-jun.

720
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,477
He called all the assemblymen
who proposed the bill with him,

721
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,438
but he didn't say a word to us.

722
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,191
Sir.

723
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,573
Do you think I leaked out the proposal?

724
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,782
Did you?

725
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,368
-No way.
-Then why do you ask?

726
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,245
I want to know
why you're doing this to me.

727
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,665
I thought I saw some personal feelings
during the inspection.

728
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,627
What do you think of me
to say something like that?

729
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,087
Are you unable to separate work
from your private life?

730
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,381
This is why people say
assemblywoman who were voted

731
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,133
for proportional representation
are useless.

732
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,802
You should be coming up
with better questions.

733
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,139
How dare you blame me
for your incompetence?

734
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,690
He's being immature.
What should we do now?

735
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,317
If Mr. Jo turns his back on you,

736
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,236
wouldn't it jeopardize your position
as the spokesperson?

737
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,738
-Doing okay?
-Yes.

738
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,533
Let's see who will end up
in bigger danger.

739
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,415
Let's go and eat.

740
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,585
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
MEETING ROOM

741
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,109
Is this the result
of your way of doing things?

742
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,037
During the inspection
of the Judiciary Committee,

743
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,790
there was an uproar over the witness
and Mr. Song's qualification.

744
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,333
The inspection was stopped

745
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,253
for both parties' assistant administrators
to come to an agreement,

746
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,879
but it does not look promising.

747
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,215
The inspection will likely be crippled.

748
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,302
You stole our witness for this?

749
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,471
Good work, man.

750
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,306
Don't start with me.

751
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,850
Your operation was crippled,

752
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,186
and we couldn't read
half of our questionnaires.

753
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,813
Life is so tiring. I'm so tired.

754
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,189
Why?

755
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,358
"Why"?

756
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,027
It's all because of you! You!

757
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,195
You dirty jerk.

758
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,117
What happens if this continues?

759
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,494
It'll continue to be suspended.

760
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,788
Is there any way to stop that?

761
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,415
Mr. Jang may be able to find--

762
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,460
This situation will be difficult to handle
even for someone like him.

763
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,087
The inspection can only be resumed
with the agreement of

764
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,964
the assemblymen
and assistant administrators.

765
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,300
There's nothing
that a chief of staff can do.

766
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,011
We even took the CEO of Bugang for this.
And for what?

767
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,638
Let's go and eat.

768
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,607
The doors are closing.

769
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,861
I heard Mr. Jo is giving you a hard time.

770
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,947
Did Mr. Go tell you?

771
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,033
I told him not to.

772
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,202
I'll find a way to deal with him.

773
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,745
It's okay.

774
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,914
Thank you for the gesture though.

775
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:32,915
This is my problem.

776
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,626
He might end up abandoning you.

777
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,920
I'm the one who chose him.

778
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,255
Since I chose him,
I will be the one to abandon him.

779
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,259
Isn't your problem way more complicated?

780
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,777
We have many pending issues too.

781
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,739
What will the people think of us if we
keep delaying the inspection like this?

782
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,866
The assemblymen are very firm on this.

783
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,369
I may be the assistant administrator,

784
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,954
but I cannot do much.

785
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:15,040
Let's send Bugang's president home
for today

786
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,210
and discuss what we'll do

787
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,837
about Mr. Lee later...

788
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,425
It's already pretty late.

789
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,010
Let's go back to the National Assembly

790
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,303
and decide what to do.

791
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,198
Mr. Jo was really out of line.

792
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,533
We work for the same party.

793
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,951
Isn't it obvious what he's doing?

794
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,912
Shouldn't we apologize to him
or something?

795
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,498
We won't be able to do anything
during the inspection like this.

796
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,709
-When will the hearing resume?
-In an hour.

797
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,127
Hand me the list of questions.

798
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,254
-The list.
-Yes, here it is.

799
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,559
-You're aware of Bugang--
-No off-topic questions, please.

800
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,770
Most of the subcontractors
currently working at Bugang Electronics

801
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,732
-I said, no off-topic questions.
-insist that dangerous tasks

802
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,901
-are generally given to subcontractors--
-Time's up.

803
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,947
Could you look into firms
that have ties to Bugang?

804
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:29,907
Of course.

805
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,991
Let's go.

806
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,791
It won't be easy. They'll keep trying
to bog us down using Lee Chang-jin.

807
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,376
If it doesn't resume today,

808
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,962
it'll be hard to bring in
the CEO of Bugang as a witness again.

809
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,923
I'm aware, but we can't do anything

810
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,634
until the game begins.

811
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,637
God, this is incredibly frustrating.

812
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,973
Hello, I devoted 30 years of my life

813
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,894
-to Bugang Electronics.
-Jeez, those morons protest all the time.

814
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,729
Any ideas?

815
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,902
Mr. Lee.

816
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,070
Yes, Ms. Kang.

817
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,492
What is this?

818
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,836
Are you okay with me bringing this up?

819
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,797
He won't even let me talk, you know.

820
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,674
Please help me out.

821
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,050
It's quite the contrary.

822
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,469
You're helping me.

823
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,597
Let's try.

824
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,768
Because I was let go unexpectedly,

825
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:43,939
my family had to suffer and accept
the fact that I am now jobless.

826
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,858
We lost our jobs
through no fault of our own.

827
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,443
The company wasn't even struggling.

828
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,362
Just to ensure the CEO's

829
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,905
-selfish gain...
-Good day.

830
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,949
-You can't go in.
-Don't worry. It's fine.

831
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:54,866
It's okay.

832
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,662
-Our families--
-How do you do?

833
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,038
This must be exhausting.

834
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,166
Hello, I'm Mr. Song Hui-seop.

835
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,878
Listen. Do you think
this will help you resolve the issue?

836
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,007
I'm well aware
of the situation you are in.

837
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,550
Let's talk it out

838
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,136
and try to get to the bottom of the issue.

839
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,053
Yes.

840
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:20,017
Jeez, this pack of worthless riffraff
always wants something more.

841
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,352
Must they throw a fit like this?
What a headache.

842
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,729
These bastards, seriously.

843
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,313
What did you just say?

844
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,898
-What did he say?
-What?

845
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,987
You worthless riffraff.

846
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,323
-You piece of--
-You can't do this!

847
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,242
-Oh, gosh.
-How dare you!

848
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,411
-Hey!
-What the heck did you say?

849
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,872
-Please don't be like this.
-You bastard!

850
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,665
-Gosh, no!
-Go to hell!

851
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,292
-Get a taste of this!
-You prick!

852
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,210
-Don't do this, please.
-Get back here!

853
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,463
The Judiciary Committee
hearing was adjourned,

854
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,381
and protesters who were criticizing it

855
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,843
attacked Assemblyman Song Hui-seop
earlier today.

856
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:58,472
This left Mr. Song injured,
and he requires three weeks of treatment.

857
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,724
The member of Bugang's labor union
who led the attack

858
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,559
was arrested on site.

859
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,352
Just a moment. Let go.

860
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,316
This certainly isn't their fault.

861
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,194
It's all because of the crippled operation
of the National Assembly.

862
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,779
Once the inspection resumes,

863
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,740
I will wholeheartedly listen
to their issues and concerns

864
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,785
and do my best to find a solution.

865
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,957
Also, I have no interest
in taking legal action against them.

866
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:30,587
I ask the police to be lenient with them.

867
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,713
Please let us through.

868
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,590
Are you really not going to press charges?

869
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:34,883
Are you really all right, sir?

870
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,968
-How's the injury, sir?
-Oh, my...

871
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,387
-Gosh, sir.
-Are you okay, sir?

872
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,848
I'm okay. Let's go.

873
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,100
-How's the wound?
-It's fine.

874
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,518
-Let us through.
-Are you sure?

875
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,436
-Sir.
-Please say a few words.

876
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,982
Are you all right, sir?

877
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,821
Getting beaten up like this
is part of maturing as a politician.

878
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,783
What do you think?
This'll be enough, right?

879
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,992
Yes, sir.

880
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,704
-Hey, let go. It's hot.
-Yes, sir.

881
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,042
Any ideas?

882
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,380
They're pushing ahead with it

883
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,298
because they can justify it.

884
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,426
You should use it too, sir.

885
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,012
Politicians are always
most afraid of public opinion.

886
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,107
Jeez, this foul stench. It stinks.

887
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,985
-Goodness. Hey, hold my arm.
-Pardon me?

888
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,320
-Hold my arm. We're getting off.
-Yes, sir.

889
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,156
Oh, boy. This is killing me.

890
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,661
-Sir.
-Sir.

891
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,621
-Are you all right, sir?
-Yes, I'm fine.

892
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,290
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

893
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,125
-Really?
-Stop it. There are many people here.

894
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,878
-Still, are you sure you'll be okay?
-Hello, good day.

895
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,754
Yes, hello. Goodness!

896
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,510
Are you all right, sir?

897
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,053
CHIEF OF
CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

898
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,146
NO SEUNG-JIN

899
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,361
Aren't we going to get started?

900
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,124
We'll resume the hearing.

901
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:40,717
Ms. Kang, why bring up issues
that weren't discussed beforehand?

902
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,760
I apologize, sir.

903
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,179
I'll stop there.

904
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,766
Mr. Lee Seong-min, you may ask questions.

905
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,434
Sure.

906
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,478
Minister of Employment and Labor,

907
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,688
regarding Bugang Electronics'
subcontractors--

908
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,942
Mr. Lee, you're repeating
what Ms. Kang was doing earlier.

909
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,693
That wasn't agreed upon beforehand.

910
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,238
Well, I think this is an important issue.

911
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:05,200
Sir, you know of a company
called Hyeonmi Hitech, right?

912
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,117
Yes, I do.

913
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:11,289
Hyeonmi Hitech is
one of Bugang's major suppliers.

914
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,667
According to this,
your son, Jo Hyeong-tae,

915
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,669
currently works there.

916
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,964
You keep interrupting
every time the issue is brought up.

917
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,590
If it's because of this--

918
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,009
My son isn't even a permanent employee.

919
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,012
He's just working under a contract.
Please watch what you say.

920
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,891
I brought it up as I was concerned
that the people might view it that way.

921
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,644
Since your son also has
a contract position,

922
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,898
I'm sure you understand
the importance of this issue.

923
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:41,152
I say that because most of the
dispatched workers are contract employees.

924
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:46,449
Well, may I continue on this topic?

925
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:50,954
Yes, continue.

926
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,330
Thank you.

927
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,836
Minister. Among Bugang Electronics'
30 workers that lost their lives,

928
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,505
including Kim Gwang-hun
who died a few days ago,

929
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,383
twenty-nine of them were subcontractors.
You're aware of that, right?

930
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,885
However, Bugang held their subcontractors

931
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,387
responsible for their deaths.

932
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,389
And then, with their zero-accident record,

933
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,017
they got a 21 billion won reduction
from their insurance.

934
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,769
But what Bugang owes
for unpaid wages and pension contributions

935
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:18,356
as well as for the compulsory insurances
amounts to 17 billion won.

936
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,774
Does this make sense to you?

937
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,986
-I'll take care of it.
-Among all the OECD countries,

938
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,071
Korea has the highest
occupational fatality rate.

939
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,990
It's been that way for the past 21 years.

940
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:30,201
Workplace accidents have been killing
5 workers a day, 2,000 workers a year.

941
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,162
We must pass a bill
for workplace fatalities

942
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,831
and establish a separate agency
for occupational safety and health.

943
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,333
What are your thoughts on this?

944
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,626
Mr. Lee.

945
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,131
-What is this?
-We received...

946
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,507
Well...

947
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,385
My office received an anonymous tip.

948
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,138
The occupational health
and safety inspection on Bugang

949
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,223
revealed that 81 percent
of Bugang's labor agencies

950
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:56,478
utilized flextime illegally without
obtaining permission from the workers.

951
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,522
Why didn't you submit this report?

952
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,485
That's--

953
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,404
Laborers who work over 10 hours a day
more than twice a week are 2.7 times

954
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,615
more likely to have depression
and anxiety disorders.

955
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,034
Risks of MI tripled
and for diabetes it quadrupled

956
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,410
when working over 11 hours.

957
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,704
Kim Gwang-hun, who worked with Bugang,
also suffered from

958
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,874
anxiety disorder and myocardial infarction
before his death.

959
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:18,792
Minister.

960
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,213
Do you really think Mr. Kim
took his own life?

961
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,464
Tell me what you think.

962
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:30,428
I think Bugang practically murdered him!

963
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,846
Answer my question!

964
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,141
We must investigate Bugang Electronics'

965
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,019
working environment thoroughly
and as soon as possible

966
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,104
and make improvements.

967
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,942
Also, all workers who were dismissed
wrongfully must be reinstated immediately.

968
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,735
Minister.

969
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,988
Please make sure it's done.
I'll be watching you.

970
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,451
Bugang Electronics' CEO, Mr. Kim.

971
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,579
Did you have lunch? What did you eat?

972
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,623
I brought lunch from home.

973
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,834
Did you enjoy your lunch?

974
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,085
Mr. Kim!

975
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,046
How could you eat anything

976
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,256
after firing so many workers?

977
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,885
Just hearing about it makes me emotional!

978
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,429
How can you even think about food?

979
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,849
Also, Chief of the Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

980
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,394
You are supposedly assisting
the Minister of Justice

981
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,729
in his efforts to reform the prosecution.

982
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,107
How could you conspire with corporations?

983
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,526
You let things slide
and even delayed their indictment.

984
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,195
What's more? The prosecution is actively

985
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,781
trying to dismantle labor unions.

986
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,242
Is that the prosecution's job?
How could you explain this?

987
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,243
Answer my question.

988
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,954
Is that the prosecution's job?

989
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,539
Is it?

990
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,958
How could the prosecution do such things?

991
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,710
Do you think it's acceptable?

992
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,131
-Please make a comment.
-Thank you. Good work.

993
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,217
-Thank you all.
-Most importantly, I think all members

994
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:55,346
of the Assembly need to know
how much the workers are suffering.

995
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,891
I kept my promise,

996
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,726
so it's now your turn to keep your word.

997
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,062
The spokesperson position of
the Daehan Party will always be yours.

998
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,358
Is your son really working there?

999
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,194
We won't be accepting any questions.

1000
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,571
-I'm sorry.
-Move back, please.

1001
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,156
Excuse me for a second.

1002
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,158
-When did your son start...
-Mr. Jo!

1003
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,951
-Please say a few words.
-Mr. Jo.

1004
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,746
Did you cut some sort of deal
with my boss?

1005
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,789
I'll tell you later.

1006
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,501
Good work today, Mr. Jang.

1007
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,878
Oh, thank you. Well done today.

1008
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,255
Once we reach an agreement,

1009
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,258
we'll hand it over
to the Judiciary Committee.

1010
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,511
But what's more important

1011
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:39,390
is thinking about what a worker's
lonely death means to our society and...

1012
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,850
The CEO of Bugang Electronics,

1013
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,770
Mr. Kim Hyeon-su, attended
the first hearing today as a witness.

1014
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,106
The Judiciary Committee...

1015
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,108
Why are you celebrating all alone here?

1016
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,902
You totally stole the limelight today.

1017
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,696
The limelight, my ass.

1018
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,949
It wasn't all me.

1019
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,867
Ms. Kang helped me.

1020
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,956
Drink soju instead.

1021
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,839
Ms. Kang gave me this.

1022
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,174
LIST OF QUESTIONS

1023
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:18,846
And someone mailed this to my office,
but there's no name or address.

1024
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,890
You wrote this, didn't you?

1025
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,434
My job is keeping me busy enough.

1026
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,396
Why would I be concerned with your job?

1027
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,400
I taught you how to write these
when you were still wet behind the ears.

1028
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,651
I'd obviously...

1029
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,028
recognize questionnaires written by you.

1030
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,948
Because Assemblyman Song Hui-seop
brought up Bugang workers'

1031
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,366
wrongful dismissal lawsuit,

1032
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,578
the bill for improving
occupational health and safety...

1033
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,289
In order to do so,
the society needs to improve...

1034
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,708
I'm still getting help from you.

1035
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,252
You'll be a much better assemblyman
than I am.

1036
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,462
Tae-jun.

1037
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,717
Please... Just don't turn out
like your boss, Mr. Song.

1038
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,013
Don't worry about me.
You should worry about yourself.

1039
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,973
Try to be a little ambitious, please.

1040
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,684
Don't get fixated on a single issue.

1041
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,478
-Don't you want to be reelected next year?
-Come on.

1042
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,857
I should be satisfied
with being elected once.

1043
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,734
I'm exhausted. I can't do this anymore.

1044
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,947
Oh, how about I work
as your chief of staff

1045
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,282
when you get elected?

1046
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,076
Who'd hire an old man like you
as their chief of staff?

1047
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:26,122
So you won't even consider hiring me
because I'm old. My goodness.

1048
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,628
HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE DIRECTOR

1049
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:36,758
Hi, my dear daughter.
No, I'm not drinking.

1050
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,093
I'm on my way home now.

1051
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,346
Did you see me on the news?

1052
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,474
I'll be home shortly. All right.

1053
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,685
Hey, you came too late.
I have to go home now.

1054
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,354
Drinks are on me, so finish them.

1055
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,106
Excuse me. Please give him
whatever he asks for.

1056
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,359
I'll pay for everything
next time I'm here. Hey, I'm off.

1057
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,028
You called me here.
How can you just leave?

1058
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,613
Shall I pick up some fried chicken?

1059
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,324
Yes, that one.

1060
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,420
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min also raised
suspicions about the relationship

1061
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,131
between Bugang and Daehan Party's
Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong.

1062
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,009
It has been revealed that
Mr. Jo's son, Mr. Jo Hyeong-tae,

1063
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:24,430
currently works at Hyeonmi Hitech,
which is one of Bugang's suppliers,

1064
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,393
and all eyes are on what stance
Mr. Jo will take regarding it.

1065
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,530
Oh, my. You made it, Mr. Jang.

1066
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,156
Here.

1067
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,034
-How have you been, sir?
-Have a seat over there.

1068
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,035
Yes, sit here.

1069
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,417
Mr. Jang, excellent work today.

1070
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,420
No, sir. It was all Mr. Song's idea.

1071
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,383
This is why I like you.

1072
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,260
You're very modest.

1073
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,346
I want to give my hard-earned money
to my son.

1074
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,765
Why do people have
so much to say about it?

1075
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,602
Anyway, I'll never forget
all the help you've given me, Mr. Jang.

1076
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,273
I'll help you to the best of my ability
so that you can wear

1077
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,650
the assemblyman badge on your chest soon.

1078
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,153
The food will get cold. Dig in.

1079
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,446
-Yes, sir.
-Hey.

1080
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:26,033
You made us come all the way here
from Seoul. Is this really it?

1081
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,620
Of course not.

1082
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,248
I prepared a full package.

1083
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,709
All right, let's drink.

1084
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,252
Okay. Cheers.

1085
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,088
Well...

1086
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,592
Do you know
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min well?

1087
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,512
-Why do you ask?
-You see,

1088
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,432
because he keeps going on about labor laws
and occupational regulations,

1089
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,435
it's practically impossible
to run a business here in Seongjin.

1090
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,437
You saw him acting up
at the hearing earlier.

1091
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,939
If he keeps it up,
he'll cause so much headache for us.

1092
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,819
Sir, is there anything you can do
to shut him up?

1093
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,946
Don't mind him. He's just a small fry.

1094
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:08,910
Goodness, I guess you have no idea.

1095
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,997
Pricks like him are the ones
we must watch out for the most.

1096
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,041
Those who utterly have nothing,
including ambition.

1097
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,880
Look, Mr. Lee.

1098
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,762
Oh, boy. I got all riled up
in front of you

1099
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,680
because of a jerk who talks too much.

1100
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,182
My apologies.

1101
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,520
Here, let's drink.

1102
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,104
-All right.
-Great.

1103
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,273
You too, Mr. Jang.

1104
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,873
This is your hometown, right?

1105
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,041
Yes, sir.

1106
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,001
The subway track runs through here.

1107
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,711
It's a quaint little neighborhood.

1108
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,714
When he asked me to come here for drinks,

1109
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,008
I knew something was up.

1110
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,177
That must be it.

1111
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,805
OFFICE OF ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

1112
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,268
I'll talk to Mr. Lee Seong-min.

1113
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,395
No, it's okay. I'll take care of it.

1114
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,231
Just focus on the inspection for now.

1115
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,317
We have to hit the minister's head hard
on the last day.

1116
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,152
Let's go.

1117
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,708
OFFICE OF ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

1118
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,307
Tae-jun.

1119
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,852
-Did you see the news?
-The sign from Assemblyman Lee's

1120
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,897
district office fell on a passerby,
resulting in a severe injury.

1121
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,441
The victim of the accident,
who is a woman in her 40s,

1122
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,986
was sent to a hospital nearby
and is now undergoing her second surgery.

1123
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,947
The police are trying to find out
if the sign violated any...

1124
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,165
Hello.

1125
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,253
Which one is a latte?

1126
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,464
Oh, the latte is for the chief of staff.

1127
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:27,882
Mr. Jang doesn't drink latte.

1128
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,467
No, the other one.

1129
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,094
"The other one"? Who?

1130
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,347
The police are investigating if the sign

1131
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,266
violated any of the regulations
for signs and advertising devices.

1132
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,353
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min expressed
his regret and visited the victim,

1133
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,688
but the victim's family
refused to meet him.

1134
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,566
Mr. Oh Won-sik is here
from the district office.

1135
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,070
I'll try meeting
with Assemblyman Lee Seong-min.

1136
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,614
No, it's okay. I'll take care of it.

1137
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,953
Hey, you're here.

1138
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,154
Mr. Oh Won-sik is here
from the district office.

1139
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,824
-Hey, you're here.
-He was shunted off because of you.

1140
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,033
He won't just sit still.

1141
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,327
The inspection will probably end
like this. Can you catch him?

1142
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,079
We can't give up now.

1143
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,665
If there is something blocking my way,
I will jump over it.

1144
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,709
There may be material
that hasn't been revealed.

1145
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,585
-Any story will be of value to us.
-Yes, sir.

1146
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,504
I think Tae-jun found something.

1147
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,673
Were you behind the incident
regarding Mr. Lee?

1148
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,758
Don't cross the line, Tae-jun.

1149
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,511
You might get hurt.

1150
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:22,288
