1
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,820
What about the agenda for the AIC?

2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,450
Mr. Jo and Ms. Kang put it
to the National Assembly.

3
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,040
Doubts have arisen over a corruption
scandal of Lee Chang-jin,

4
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,794
CEO of Joojin Chemical
who's been criticized for a chemical leak,

5
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,004
Lee Sang-guk and Ahn Hyeon-min
of the Daehan Party,

6
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,798
and No Seung-jin of the Kookmin Party.

7
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,009
As the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
has obtained related data

8
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,677
and is examining them at the moment,

9
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,347
they are likely to be under investigation.

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,043
Have you proved your innocence?

11
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,296
Choe Gyeong-cheol won't give up so easily.

12
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,882
How are things at the National Assembly?

13
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,928
Minister Song's people have begun to stir.

14
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,224
Some of them are trying
to approach Assemblyman Jo.

15
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,394
Fortunately, I think the bill will
be passed at the National Assembly.

16
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,273
There would be no assemblymen
who want to support Minister Song.

17
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,525
If his relations
with Joojin Chemical is revealed

18
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,193
during the Administrative Investigation,

19
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,446
his political career will be finished.

20
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,952
-What about Joojin Chemical?
-They started publishing rebuttal articles

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,872
with the legal team and promotional team.

22
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,291
The assemblymen who support
the Administrative Investigation

23
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,209
are getting a number
of calls of complaint.

24
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,171
It's a life and death issue
for Mr. Lee and his company.

25
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,131
There will be a lot of opposition.

26
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,133
I know.

27
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,095
It's not like
the investigation will end everything.

28
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,766
It's going to be a long battle.

29
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,476
It's...

30
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,896
more difficult to end a war

31
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,148
than to start one.

32
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,151
It's begun already.

33
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,113
To end a war,

34
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,366
someone has to die.

35
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,213
It was a long and distant path.

36
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,135
Maybe I shouldn't have taken it.

37
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,727
With the steps I took
as though I was branding myself,

38
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,439
I've come this far, led by the light.

39
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,650
Both you

40
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,526
and I...

41
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,697
should get elected as an assemblyman
with a badge on our chest

42
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,242
and walk in there triumphantly!

43
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,329
A fair, corruption-free nation!

44
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,374
A country where all of its people
can prosper!

45
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,085
Let's work together
to create such a world!

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,796
Yes!

47
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,298
Like you said,

48
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,718
let's make a change in this world!

49
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,845
Let's make a change!

50
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,224
-Let's make a change!
-Let's make a change!

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,274
Now I must shed light in the darkness

52
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,735
and fill up

53
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,320
the cracks.

54
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:54,127
EPISODE 5 SHADOW

55
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,171
Assemblyman Jang.

56
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,383
This is the request
for administrative investigation.

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,926
Okay.

58
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,264
Why don't you call it a day?
You seem tired.

59
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,849
Okay.

60
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,684
I'm very tired these days.

61
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,228
I need to rest. You may go home.

62
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,355
I'll see you tomorrow.

63
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,064
The National Assembly
had the plenary session today

64
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,524
and passed the agenda

65
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,193
to investigate the chemical leak

66
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,987
-of Joojin Chemical.
-When does the investigation begin?

67
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,947
The agenda
for the administrative investigation

68
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,783
which is the Daehan Party's
official platform

69
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,409
has passed with a vote

70
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:13,915
of 126 in favor,
86 against, and 15 abstained

71
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,751
among 227 incumbent Assembly members.

72
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,002
But they've remained silent.

73
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,756
Assemblyman Jo, the chairman
of the Emergency Planning Committee claims

74
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,217
that the incident was
a preventable man-made disaster,

75
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,427
so they will make sure to reveal the facts

76
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,221
and clarify where the responsibility lies

77
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,890
through the administrative investigation.

78
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,413
Assemblywoman Kang,
we are ready for the interview.

79
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,715
Gosh.

80
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,217
Assemblyman Jang.

81
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,637
Isn't it time to settle our debts?

82
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,643
This is the original I have.

83
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,192
How can I be sure there's no copy of it?

84
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,155
The prosecution investigation is underway.

85
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,491
If the prosecution
finds out that I have it,

86
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,494
I'll be accused of concealing evidence.

87
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,539
I should give something dangerous
back to the one it belongs to.

88
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,545
I guess you've become timid after coming
back alive from the lion's mouth.

89
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,886
I should probably trust you.

90
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,564
I've set up the dance floor,
so put on a show.

91
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,232
I'll look forward to it.

92
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,866
For today's Politics Live,

93
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,495
we have Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong
of the Daehan Party who recently disclosed

94
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,788
the chemical leak accident
of Joojin Chemical.

95
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,375
You called for the administrative
investigation for this case.

96
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,754
What made you believe
that the investigation is necessary?

97
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,047
We've found out

98
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,549
that a lot of residents
are suffering health problems,

99
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,886
and there was serious oil pollution
due to the leakage.

100
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,097
But Joojin Chemical only
tried to evade responsibility,

101
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,183
so I believed
the National Assembly should step in.

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,436
The victims are blaming
themselves in despair

103
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,313
without knowing what caused their disease.

104
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,608
But Joojin Chemical
was just buying the land

105
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,195
before the investigation instead of
offering an apology and compensation.

106
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,864
It is quite upsetting.

107
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,949
They are still rejecting

108
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,493
media interviews and factory inspections.

109
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,162
They might try to cover it up,

110
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,499
so the National Assembly
must rush the investigation.

111
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,625
JOOJIN MUST APOLOGIZE

112
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,962
There he comes.

113
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,257
Mr. Lee, why are you buying all the land?

114
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,009
-Did you hide the leak on purpose?
-Have you met the victims?

115
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,470
-How are you going to compensate them?
-Please answer us.

116
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,722
Many of them need immediate treatment.

117
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,475
Unfortunately, some of them
have already passed away.

118
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,977
It's a wrongful death.

119
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,438
There's a woman in her early 20s
who died after working at Joojin Chemical.

120
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,566
And even her mother
who lived near the factory

121
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,317
has grown ill,

122
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,695
and she's not able
to move about freely now.

123
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,072
A couple in their 30s in the neighborhood

124
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,740
have had numerous miscarriages.

125
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,744
There seems to be no way
to compensate them for their loss,

126
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,455
-which is truly regrettable.
-I'm taking medication,

127
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,333
-but it's not working.
-Residents near the factory

128
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,460
-are also suffering
-I can't even sleep.

129
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,878
serious crop damage as well.

130
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,590
There's not much we can do.
All we can do is disinfect the crops.

131
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,550
Before the contamination spreads,

132
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,844
we must find the cause.

133
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,725
Only then will we be able to come up
with measures to prevent the spread.

134
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,642
My gosh.

135
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,854
The case of Joojin Chemical isn't
a problem of a specific area.

136
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,898
-It can threaten the future of everyone.
-Look at that.

137
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,152
We will address the cause
and call those in charge to account.

138
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,363
We will also revise laws and institutions

139
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,116
in order to preserve the present
for future generations.

140
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,952
We need your support.

141
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,164
Please

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,334
raise your voices and support us

143
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,588
so such a tragedy won't

144
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,591
happen again.

145
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,598
I knew it. Assemblywoman Kang
shines in front of a camera.

146
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,308
This is now the real beginning.

147
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,603
We still have a long way to go.

148
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,314
We have to form
the Administrative Investigation Committee

149
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,566
and confirm the list
of witnesses and testifiers.

150
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,485
And to discuss
the investigation schedule...

151
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,487
It's one thing after another.

152
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,908
That's why we're doing the whole thing.

153
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,078
We need to conquer the summit
step by step.

154
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,749
I'm so thrilled already
by just thinking about it.

155
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,418
Keep sending out the news releases.

156
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,879
Provide the reporters
with all the materials they ask for.

157
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,881
-Okay.
-We will file a suit against Joojin.

158
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,342
-Do-gyeong?
-We're collecting the medical records

159
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,386
and doctor's notes regarding the victims.

160
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,846
And I'm arranging a meeting
of the victims and attorneys.

161
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,559
What are you waiting for? Let's move.

162
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,229
All right. We have mountains to cross.

163
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,313
Let's do this.

164
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,567
Seon-yeong.

165
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,321
You did a great job today.

166
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,448
I could feel your sincerity.

167
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,285
-Thank you.
-I have to admit.

168
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,082
I wanted to beat you,
and I once thought I could.

169
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,501
But there's no way I can surpass you.

170
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,297
When you appeared
on the political stage as a spokeswoman,

171
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,676
I didn't expect you to show such actions.

172
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,431
Now you look like a real assemblywoman.

173
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,307
That's really cool.

174
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,353
Thank you.

175
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,733
Did we get any new ideas
from other chambers or civic groups

176
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,611
about how we'll make the standard
to assess the damage of the victims?

177
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,029
Yes. I put them together.

178
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,824
We have various opinions,
so we need to sort them out.

179
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,576
We should find an expert

180
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,162
with experience in related diseases.

181
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,289
Make a list with Mr. Jeong.

182
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,041
-Okay.
-Where's Mr. Jeong?

183
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,586
I don't know. He was right here.

184
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,713
-I'll talk to him.
-Okay.

185
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,802
And restrict visitor access to the office.
Pay extra attention to security.

186
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,970
-Okay.
-Yes.

187
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,390
Mr. Yang, can I talk to you
in the conference room?

188
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,392
Sure. Let's do that.

189
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,063
These are documents
about the redevelopment of Seongjin City.

190
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,232
I want you to take it over

191
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,359
from Mr. Ahn.

192
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,487
Okay. Sure.

193
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,407
By the way, isn't it
too much work for you?

194
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,453
You have to take care of
Mr. Jang's affairs and the investigation.

195
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,416
I'll take care of Mr. Jang's
state affairs from now on.

196
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm fine.

197
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,005
Just focus on getting
used to your position.

198
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,175
Once you're done adjusting,
I'll ask you for help.

199
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,014
Okay. Thank you for being so considerate.

200
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,310
I'll try my best with this.

201
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,395
Sure.

202
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,023
-You're back.
-Hello.

203
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,525
Hello, Mr. Jang.

204
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,985
The public seems happy
about the investigation.

205
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,363
More than 70 percent
of people are in favor.

206
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,864
We never know when this will change.

207
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,283
Keep up the research
and hand out a press release.

208
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,618
Yes, sir.

209
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,090
These are the materials
about Seongjin City. Please take a look.

210
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,094
Okay. Thank you.

211
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,897
Assemblyman Jang.

212
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,025
We might be able to move
public opinion with the investigation,

213
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,528
but I'm not sure if we can find
a decent solution with it.

214
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,365
We should give the Administrative
Investigation Committee legislative power.

215
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,951
The committee didn't work properly before

216
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,452
because it didn't have the power.

217
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,707
We have to pass
the occupational health and safety law.

218
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,500
We could've prevented

219
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,420
the case of Joojin Chemical
seven years ago

220
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,338
if we had the law.

221
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,758
There was only one time the committee
was given legislative power.

222
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,885
Do you think it's possible?

223
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,053
The Judiciary Committee
will try to stop it.

224
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,139
Only standing committees
have legislative powers.

225
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,350
Once Chairperson Lee is put
under the prosecutor's investigation,

226
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,769
the Judiciary Committee
won't work properly.

227
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,688
It is definitely worth a try.

228
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,690
Prepare materials to persuade assemblymen.

229
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,900
Okay.

230
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,987
Now we should pressure Lee Chang-jin.

231
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,782
We have to reveal
that he covered up the leakage

232
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,452
knowing all about the contamination.

233
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,995
We'd need an informant

234
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,456
to get the internal data.

235
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,792
But the company must've told
its employees to remain silent.

236
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,753
There must be families

237
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,255
of Joojin Chemical's subcontractors
in the neighborhood.

238
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,050
And they might change their minds
if their family member was a victim.

239
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,343
I'll look into it.

240
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,557
Did you talk to Mr. Jeong?

241
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,685
He just went out for business.

242
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,980
-Do you want me to call him?
-I'll call him.

243
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,858
I'm going to Seongjin City. See you.

244
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,038
Yang Jong-yeol speaking.

245
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,124
No. I'll be there.

246
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,835
Yes. I'll see you then.

247
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,640
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

248
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,854
-Hi.
-Gosh, you startled me.

249
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,357
-Hello.
-Hello.

250
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,655
-What?
-Goodbye then.

251
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,579
MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP

252
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,875
Hello, Minister Song. Yes. Pardon?

253
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,628
Yes. I'll be right there.

254
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,048
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

255
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,177
The Presidential Secretary is waiting.

256
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,681
Darn it.

257
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,647
MINISTER'S OFFICE

258
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
Oh dear.

259
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,244
What brings you to such a humble place?

260
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:22,166
If you had given me a call,
I would've visited your office.

261
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,293
So what is that you want to see me about?

262
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,003
The media is in an uproar.

263
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,048
It causes the VIP so much anxiety.

264
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,007
I see.

265
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,260
The media is always in an uproar.
It's nothing new.

266
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,556
And assemblymen often get
involved in scandalous affairs.

267
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,685
-Minister Song.
-Yes.

268
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,023
I'm aware that people around you
are involved in recent scandals.

269
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,274
Is there any chance

270
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,736
you're involved in any of them?

271
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,322
My gosh. No way.

272
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,577
It is my fault that I didn't take
better care of people around me.

273
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,373
It's important to escape suspicion
as soon as possible.

274
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,460
I agree. The sooner the better.

275
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,215
Then I want you to support the chief of
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

276
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,885
So you can escape suspicion
as soon as possible.

277
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,388
Of course. I should.

278
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,113
LEE CHANG-JIN OF JOOJIN CHEMICAL
IS A MURDERER

279
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,949
LEE CHANG-JIN OF JOOJIN CHEMICAL
MUST APOLOGIZE

280
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,159
The date of investigation is not set,

281
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,162
but Assemblywoman Kang's staff are
preparing lawsuits with the victims.

282
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,168
She's a woman with plenty of guts.

283
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,754
What do we do?

284
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,550
Why do you ask me?

285
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,975
She doesn't get the hint,
so I'll have to force her to understand.

286
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,356
CHAIRMAN SUNG

287
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,692
Yes, Chairman Sung.

288
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
Yes, sir.

289
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,867
-Have the car ready at the back gate.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,582
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SAMIL ASSOCIATION

291
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,880
Where did you get these materials?

292
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,591
Most of the materials
are from government agencies,

293
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,718
but this one is in a different form.

294
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,971
It seems Assemblyman
Jang Tae-jun prepared it.

295
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,225
What is Jang Tae-jun up to?

296
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,728
Chief Choe, this case is getting
the media's attention.

297
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,856
If we don't rush the investigation,
it might cause some problems.

298
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,568
Prosecutor Sim, I'll hand over the data
about Assemblymen Lee, Ahn, and No

299
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,111
to the Special Investigation Team.

300
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,989
-Okay.
-And Prosecutor Lee,

301
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,284
please make a close investigation
of CEO Lee Chang-jin's case.

302
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,327
Okay.

303
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,788
For the time being, I'll take care
of the case regarding

304
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,041
Chairman Sung Yeong-gi
of Youngil Group myself.

305
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,587
No matter what Jang Tae-jun is up to,

306
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,589
he can't secure data like this
all by himself.

307
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,636
Make sure to check all his colleagues
from the Police University and his work.

308
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,971
-That's all for today.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,649
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SAMIL ASSOCIATION

310
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,531
The world you want
isn't that different from the one I want.

311
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,661
Trash belongs in the trashcan.

312
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,330
The choice is yours.

313
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,707
Either choose your honor as a prosecutor

314
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,043
or live as a lapdog of the man in power.

315
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,553
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

316
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,556
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

317
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,028
I was asked to be questioned
as a testifier by the prosecution.

318
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,948
So were Assemblyman
Lee Sang-guk and No Seung-jin.

319
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,910
You won't be arrested since you have
the parliamentary immunity.

320
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,163
-Just hold out as long as you can.
-Then what?

321
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,084
What difference will it make?

322
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,045
I noticed your name
was missing from the list.

323
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,589
Isn't this what you instigated?

324
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,924
Chief Choe Gyeong-cheol.

325
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,138
You're the one who appointed him.

326
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,723
Assemblyman No.

327
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,477
He's just saying that
because he's frustrated.

328
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,876
Step outside for a while.

329
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,967
Hey.

330
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,138
Sit here.

331
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,182
Yes, sir.

332
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,790
Chairman Sung.

333
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,667
I have a schedule this afternoon.

334
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,880
So what?

335
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,216
Nothing.

336
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,473
You were supposed
to sell cattle your whole life.

337
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:17,104
But now that I've established you as a
prosecutor, assemblyman, and minister,

338
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,315
you don't seem to know your place.

339
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,525
I'm sorry, sir.

340
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,985
What are you going to do now?

341
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,821
Do you have any plan?

342
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,989
Once the administrative
investigation begins,

343
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,576
my name will eventually come up.

344
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,996
I'll stop the investigation
no matter what.

345
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,499
I'll make sure it won't
cause you any harm.

346
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,459
Jang Tae-jun.

347
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,796
He used to work for you, right?

348
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,548
Yes.

349
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,300
You can't even deal with your people well.

350
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,763
But now you try
to stop the National Assembly?

351
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:58,103
I guess I've been feeding you
more than what you can take.

352
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,817
How are you going to make
your way into the Blue House?

353
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,176
Hasn't Won-sik called yet?

354
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,804
I heard he took a plane at Manila airport.

355
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,516
He will arrive
at Incheon airport in two hours.

356
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,145
Keep me updated on what Jang Tae-jun
and Kang Seon-yeong are up to.

357
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,231
Contact all the senior party members
and the secretary-general

358
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,317
-and tell them I want to talk to them.
-Yes, sir.

359
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,196
Yes.

360
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,489
Okay.

361
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,743
Can you check who they are?

362
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,370
Yes.

363
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,165
Okay.

364
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,500
I'll be out for a while.

365
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,668
Okay. Thank you.

366
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,089
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

367
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,216
Assemblyman Jang.

368
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,762
Minister Song called in the senior
party members and the secretary-general.

369
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,224
He's trying to use every mean
to obstruct the investigation.

370
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,185
Find out who are meeting
with Minister Song.

371
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,937
Okay.

372
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,359
HANSUNG LAUNDRY

373
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:32,530
The bill for the investigation
on the chemical leak of Joojin Chemistry

374
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,741
was passed
during the plenary session today.

375
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,411
Assemblywoman Kang of the Daehan
Party who pushed for the bill...

376
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,498
What are you doing?
You don't even know I'm here.

377
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,666
Hey.

378
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,543
What are you watching on TV?

379
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,963
Do-gyeong works
at the National Assembly now.

380
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,048
Now that my son is involved,

381
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,425
I can't help but watch the news
these days.

382
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,135
-Is it for dry cleaning?
-Yes.

383
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,138
Does Do-gyeong work
at the National Assembly?

384
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,100
He's a chief of staff or something.

385
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,603
I heard he's an official
in special government service.

386
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,774
It's only a temporary job.
You never know when he'll be fired.

387
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,860
Is that what it is?

388
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,988
Yes. I saw it on TV.

389
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,365
There was news about a chief of staff
who committed suicide.

390
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,533
Assemblymen or women

391
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,994
can hire or fire someone as they like.

392
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,912
Did someone commit suicide?

393
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,999
I hear assemblymen are very bossy.

394
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,961
There's an assemblywoman who
let her chief of staff run in a marathon.

395
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,463
I should get going then.

396
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,841
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

397
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,762
Assemblywoman Kang claims

398
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,807
that the scope of the administrative
investigation should be...

399
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,644
I'll announce the list and plan for the
Administrative Investigation Committee.

400
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,773
We must appoint Lee Chang-jin as
a witness and inspect Joojin Chemistry.

401
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,984
I know.

402
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,114
Lee Chang-jin won't accept it
without resistance though.

403
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,116
I agree.

404
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,410
He will struggle to survive.

405
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,412
You should

406
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,873
take care of the committee.

407
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,208
Aren't you joining the committee?

408
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,545
If I join it, the opposition party will
object fiercely.

409
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,131
I'm still under investigation.

410
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,507
I will back you up.

411
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,885
If the investigation gets delayed

412
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,221
because of me, it will just buy
Minister Song and Lee Chang-jin some time.

413
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,515
What will you do then?

414
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,853
I'll catch Minister Song
and Lee Chang-jin.

415
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,464
Minister Song, the secretary-general
can't make it

416
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,550
as he has something urgent
to take care of.

417
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,765
It wasn't so long ago
that they clamored me to feed them.

418
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,558
Those darn idiots.

419
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,187
SECRETARY-GENERAL

420
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,566
Yes, Jang Tae-jun speaking.

421
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,819
What is going on?

422
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,239
Well, it is what it is.

423
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,992
I guess you're with the secretary-general.

424
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,038
He's sorry that he couldn't
make it there today.

425
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,127
And you don't have to call those
who didn't make it to dinner with you.

426
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,547
You can just leave a message with me.
I can tell them right away.

427
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,968
If you don't have anything to say,
I'm hanging up.

428
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,594
Please enjoy your dinner.

429
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,276
It's not like you're the only ones

430
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,320
who get kickbacks in politics.

431
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,825
I'll overlook your little mistakes.

432
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,871
I'd like the Administrative Investigation
Committee to have legislative powers.

433
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,374
I'll appreciate your cooperation.

434
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,805
That bastard

435
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,308
is trying to cut off my limbs.

436
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,229
How much does he know?
How much has he planned?

437
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,023
That son of a bitch.

438
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,909
Minister Song, I'm sorry I'm late.

439
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,660
How did it go?

440
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,080
I took care of the urgent matters.

441
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,292
They will never be
able to find any traces of you.

442
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,587
Jong-uk told me what has happened.

443
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,671
So how is it going?

444
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,382
Jang Tae-jun has started a game.

445
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,511
What are you going to do?

446
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,681
Call Jo Gap-yeong.

447
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,642
Yes, sir.

448
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,570
HAN DO-GYEONG

449
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,863
Hello.

450
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,949
-I guess everyone's left.
-Yes.

451
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,577
Ms. Lee and Mr. Kim will be going home

452
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,913
after meeting with the civic group
and attorneys outside.

453
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,582
Are you still here because of me?

454
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,669
No, I have some work to do.

455
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,839
Did you have dinner?

456
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,384
Not yet. Do you want me
to get something for you?

457
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,718
No.

458
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,929
Let's go together.

459
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,307
Okay.

460
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,072
Thank you.

461
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,042
Aren't you eating?

462
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,253
Well. Yes.

463
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,338
I don't know what you like,

464
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,174
so I chose one that looked delicious.

465
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,303
I wasn't sure what to pick,
but this one looked really good.

466
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,638
I ate it for lunch, and it was okay.

467
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,016
Did you have lunch here?

468
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,935
I had no idea. We should've
gone someplace else.

469
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,687
Ms. Yun, do you want something else?

470
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,939
We don't have time. I'm okay with this.

471
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:46,529
I found this man named Kim Byeong-chan
in the materials you got me.

472
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,241
Is he the man who works
with his son at Joojin Chemical?

473
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,701
I'd like to meet with him.

474
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,369
Okay.

475
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,079
And there's Ms. Im Sun-yeong.

476
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,874
She told us to call her
if we ever needed her help.

477
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,502
Okay.

478
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,265
And as for Mr. Jo Hyeon-u,
he quit the job quite a while ago.

479
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,934
But he worked there for a long time,

480
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,102
so he knows a lot
about chemical substances.

481
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,314
You met with all of these people yourself?

482
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,983
-That must've been hard.
-Things are

483
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,653
harder for them than for me.

484
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,038
I'm glad that you are still
in this line of work.

485
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,585
You seem better now than the time
when we worked in the same office.

486
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,922
You think so?

487
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,383
Meeting with everyone,

488
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,177
listening to their stories, sympathizing,

489
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,098
and voicing their stories
are never easy to do.

490
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,226
That's a hard task even for me.

491
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,317
I'm learning a lot from you, Ms. Yun.

492
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,027
Thank you.

493
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,738
I realized that the result is

494
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,325
as important as the process
after meeting with them.

495
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,036
If the National Assembly
doesn't come up with solutions,

496
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,287
there's bound to be

497
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,623
more victims like them.

498
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,127
I can

499
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,671
somewhat understand

500
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,007
Mr. Jang's intention.

501
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,441
This tea is great.

502
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,735
As I have other appointments,
I cannot stay for long.

503
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,570
Let's have a quick cup of tea.

504
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,363
You seem all better now.

505
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,367
I suppose Jang Tae-jun
no longer has a leash on you.

506
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,037
My gosh, did he ever have me on his leash?

507
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,705
I'm quite disappointed.

508
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,085
I never thought that you would be the one
stabbing me in the back.

509
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,421
Gosh, I don't know what you mean.

510
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,381
I was only doing my job.

511
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,593
Is trying to do some good
with the taxpayers' money a bad thing?

512
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,056
Once you become the chairperson
of the Emergency Planning Committee

513
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,974
and the Administrative
Investigation Committee,

514
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,226
you'll have nothing to fear in the world.

515
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,814
Well, I'm a nobody compared to you.

516
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,406
That is right. Mr. Jo.

517
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,284
I am the Minister of Justice.

518
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,788
I can influence the prosecution
at my will.

519
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,458
Gosh, you must be very desperate

520
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,211
to threaten a current assemblyman.

521
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,091
Please excuse me. I have a meeting
with the Investigation Committee.

522
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,195
I can no longer stand
watching Jo Gap-yeong

523
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,739
roaming around and making a mess.

524
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,201
I'll teach him
what a Minister of Justice is capable of.

525
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,204
Find everything you can on him.

526
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,416
I want his wife and his daughter
to cry and condemn him

527
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,836
as a bad husband and father
at the National Assembly.

528
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,588
I must get my hands
on Jo Gap-yeong's leash.

529
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,173
Yes, sir.

530
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,940
HANSUNG LAUNDRY

531
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,319
You're still working.

532
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,280
Were you busy today?

533
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,825
Sit down.

534
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,538
What? What's going on?

535
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,915
Is it true that public official

536
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,334
on special duty, can easily get fired?

537
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,798
Well, it is true.

538
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,759
Those assemblymen and women
make their staff get coffee,

539
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,679
shine their shoes, and wash their dogs.

540
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,055
Is that what you're doing?

541
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,016
No.

542
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,476
Some assemblymen and women
do give us such tasks,

543
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,604
but my assemblywoman doesn't.

544
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,814
Bullshit.

545
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,858
Aren't you working for Kang Seon-yeong?

546
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,153
I heard it on the news
that she abuses her power as their boss

547
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,905
and bullies them like crazy.

548
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,241
And her chief of staff
took his own life a while ago.

549
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,619
That's not true. Ms. Kang is--

550
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,537
Forget it.
Don't go to work starting tomorrow.

551
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,749
-Mom.
-Do you think I raised you

552
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,959
with all I have, so you could work
for people like her?

553
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,630
Stop wasting your time,
and quit your job immediately.

554
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,965
No.

555
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,176
-What?
-I won't quit.

556
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,802
Do-gyeong.

557
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,306
I'm working the hardest in my life,
and I'm getting a lot of compliments, too.

558
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,227
My job isn't as useless as you think.

559
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,731
When Dad got in the accident, the person
who came to the hospital to help us

560
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,608
was also a chief of staff.

561
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,862
After that incident, I thought
I should also be helpful to people.

562
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,991
And this is the first job
I'm taking seriously. And I still do.

563
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,786
Can't you

564
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,539
trust me a bit more?

565
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,169
I have never asked you to trust me
on something in my life.

566
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,255
Just this once.

567
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,007
Please trust me on this.

568
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,765
Mom.

569
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,850
What about your dinner?

570
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:51,894
I haven't eaten yet.

571
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,897
Is your job that important?
Why did you skip dinner?

572
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,775
Lock up the place and wash up.
I'll make some food for you.

573
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,069
Okay.

574
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,080
Hey.

575
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,416
You said you found a car.

576
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,377
Yes. I obtained a footage
from a dashcam and compared it.

577
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,632
A car was following Mr. Go that night.

578
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,263
-Did you run the plate number?
-It was reported stolen

579
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,973
and was scrapped right after the incident.

580
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,811
I don't think we can pinpoint a suspect
with the dashcam footage.

581
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,482
I think we might be dealing
with professionals here.

582
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,157
MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP

583
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,761
I'm so close,
but it will be a tough journey.

584
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,434
Because you cut off all of my limbs,

585
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,978
I can't even walk.

586
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,981
Then, why don't you give up now?

587
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,692
I can't do that.

588
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,488
If I can't walk with my legs,
I'll crawl there with my arms.

589
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,661
Don't you want that?

590
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,250
I doubt that you came all this way
just to take revenge for Lee Seong-min.

591
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,377
Didn't I tell you?

592
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,922
If you want to change the world,
you must have the world at your feet!

593
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,715
Yes.

594
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,425
That's what I plan to do.

595
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,969
I must use you as my first stepping stone.

596
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,016
Tae-jun.

597
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,352
Do you think

598
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,979
I'll be the only one getting hurt
in this war between you and me?

599
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,358
You will also get hurt
along with many other people.

600
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,862
If you pull out your sword too rashly,
you might get stabbed before you know it.

601
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,366
However, I cannot stop
what I have already started.

602
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,829
A storm is imminent.

603
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,956
You should brace yourself.

604
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,441
Did you come up with the money?

605
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,693
I must wire the money by this week.

606
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,490
-What was that?
-I'm sorry.

607
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,451
Why are you so distracted?

608
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,286
The car cut in without giving me a signal.

609
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,912
Goodness.

610
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,665
My gosh, start driving already.

611
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,792
-Drive now. What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

612
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,257
All you need to do is drive.

613
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,177
But you even suck at driving.
You can't even drive properly.

614
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,637
Goodness, you're so annoying.

615
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,348
I can't believe I have you as my driver.

616
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,101
Gosh, you're so useless.

617
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,355
The Administrative Investigation Committee
has been formed

618
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,775
to investigate the chemical leak
of Joojin Chemical.

619
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,527
An influential member of the Kookmin Party

620
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,197
and the third-term assemblyman,
Yeon Cheol-u, is the chairperson.

621
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,450
-Nine members of the Daehan Party,
-Isn't Mr. Jang on the committee?

622
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,869
-seven members of the Kookmin Party,
-No.

623
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:37,828
and one independent...

624
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,747
Aren't you joining the committee?

625
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,167
If I join it, the opposition party will
object fiercely.

626
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,793
I'm still under investigation.

627
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,670
I will back you up.

628
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,006
If the investigation gets delayed

629
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,551
because of me, it will just buy
Minister Song and Lee Chang-jin some time.

630
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,512
If Mr. Jang joins the committee,

631
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,514
we'll waste time arguing
against the opposition

632
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,973
about the committee's composition.

633
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,392
Did Mr. Jang decide this himself?

634
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,979
-Yes.
-That's unexpected.

635
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,397
The election is around the corner.

636
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,525
It must've been hard to give up
this opportunity.

637
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,320
It's a chance to be in the limelight.

638
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,239
Speed is crucial in this investigation.

639
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,658
We must end this before
Lee Chang-jin destroys the evidence.

640
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,618
Prepare the materials quickly.

641
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,827
-Got it.
-Okay.

642
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,122
They have finished discussing
their agendas for the investigation.

643
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,791
Two parties have come to agree

644
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,626
upon their investigation plan

645
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,212
which includes the range of investigation
as well as the methods.

646
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:33,217
Joojin Chemical's CEO Lee Chang-jin's name
on the witness list is drawing attention.

647
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,720
The first meeting of the committee
will be held in two days.

648
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,514
The investigation will be launched then.

649
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,641
Do you think Lee Chang-jin
will be present to testify?

650
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,309
He's not the type to follow the law.

651
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,689
Submit a request to ban him from leaving
the country to the Ministry of Justice.

652
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,649
Don't you think they'll reject it?

653
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,401
It will be hard to reject it.

654
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,153
The Minister of Justice
has to approve the request.

655
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:57,199
If he postpones the decision or refuses it
and the witness flees abroad--

656
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,035
Mr. Song will take all the responsibility
as the Minister of Justice.

657
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,372
He already admitted
that he and Mr. Lee are acquainted.

658
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,001
Mr. Song will be in the center
of all the suspicions regarding Mr. Lee.

659
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,460
Mr. Song will not have

660
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,462
any other option.

661
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,549
In the end, he will cut
Lee Chang-jin off himself.

662
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,011
I'll share a press release about
the request to ban him from leaving Korea.

663
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,313
There are two key points we must focus on
during the administrative investigation.

664
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,190
The first key point is whether to not
Joojin Chemical

665
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,277
was aware of the chemical leak
which has been going on for seven years.

666
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,445
The public...

667
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,698
Hey, Mr. Lee. Do you think I want
this investigation to take place?

668
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,619
I'll take care of this. Make sure
the files don't leak from your company.

669
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,245
Just manage your employees.

670
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,622
Are you listening?

671
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,041
Discard all the relevant files
and leave Korea for now.

672
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,292
We need to avoid the worst.

673
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,713
Finding the victims and the source
of disease is proving to be difficult.

674
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,424
Sir, Jang Tae-jun submitted a request to

675
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,343
ban Mr. Lee Chang-jin
from leaving the country.

676
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,679
And the press is already
jabbering about the request.

677
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,807
-If you turn down the request--
-This bastard, Tae-jun,

678
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,312
is shoving a hot potato into my mouth.

679
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,607
If I swallow it,
it will burn the roof of my mouth.

680
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,026
And if I spit it out,
I'll starve to death.

681
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,528
Unbelievable. What about Jo Gap-yeong?

682
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,031
Mr. Seo of Western Prosecutors' Office
is on it.

683
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,285
Tae-jun's little game
is about to cost me my career.

684
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,747
Find a way for Lee Chang-jin
not to testify at the meeting.

685
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,874
-Yes, sir.
-Gosh.

686
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,629
Oh Won-sik is back?

687
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,923
Yes, he came back to Korea last night.

688
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,550
I doubt that Mr. Song will just
sit back and watch.

689
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,136
Tell Mr. Jeong to keep an eye on him.

690
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,889
-Report even the smallest movement to me.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,392
Did you check
Joojin Chemical's internal files?

692
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,770
Mr. Han and I are calling
the current employees of Joojin Chemical.

693
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,063
Mr. Han?

694
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,525
Yes. He's the most well-informed
regarding the situation with the victims.

695
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,859
He's being really helpful.

696
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,569
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

697
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,780
Hello, Mr. Jang.

698
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,825
Have a good day.

699
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,828
-We must hurry.
-Yes, sir.

700
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,456
Going down.

701
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,585
Ms. Yun.

702
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,256
I got in touch with Mr. Kim Byeong-chan.
He works for Joojin Chemical.

703
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,758
He's in Seoul now.
He agreed to meet with me briefly.

704
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,177
That's great news.
I'll be out in a minute.

705
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,429
Okay.

706
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,601
REQUEST SUBMITTED TO BAN THE WITNESS
LEE CHANG-JIN FROM LEAVING KOREA

707
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,359
He's so useless.

708
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,699
Where is Kang Seon-yeong now?

709
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,367
She'll attend a hearing held by

710
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,203
an environmental organization
about the toxicity of chemical substances.

711
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,849
You are indeed diligent, Ms. Kang.

712
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,020
I should say that to you.
You came all this way just to see me.

713
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,981
What is it that you want today?

714
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,275
I came here to talk to you.

715
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,653
-Spare me some of your time.
-I thought I made myself clear.

716
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,906
You don't need to make the trip to see me.

717
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,743
You'll soon receive a request to attend
the administrative investigation.

718
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,286
I'll see you then.

719
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,375
Ms. Kang.

720
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,629
-Let go of me.
-Why?

721
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,508
I guess you're starting to get scared now.

722
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,886
I only give one warning.

723
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,138
Before you find yourself
in bigger trouble,

724
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,683
shut that pretty mouth of yours.

725
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,729
What?

726
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,411
Here are the two people
I was dying to meet with.

727
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,539
I doubt that you have time to waste here.

728
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,250
You should go and come up
with excuses to use when you testify.

729
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,461
Do you think I'll willingly show up
at the National Assembly?

730
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,923
I've never testified even
at the Inspection of State Administration.

731
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,508
You're forgetting something.

732
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,595
I was the one who helped you
stay away from that inspection.

733
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,390
Leave now.

734
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,600
I can't help you this time.

735
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,523
You two give it your best shot.

736
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,401
I won't get beaten like this.

737
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,503
Are you okay?

738
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,594
I'm okay.

739
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,846
You should have your staff accompany you.

740
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:14,016
Lee Chang-jin will probably
take things further.

741
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,319
That bastard, Jang Tae-jun.

742
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,614
Sir, Jang Tae-jun and Kang Seon-yeong
are both current assemblyman and woman.

743
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,867
If you keep provoking them,
it might worsen the situation for us.

744
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,416
-Did you look into what I asked?
-Here.

745
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,128
Ms. Lee Ji-eun
is in charge of the lawsuit.

746
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,047
Ms. Yun Hye-won and Mr. Han Do-gyeong

747
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,798
are contacting the victims
from our company.

748
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,348
Those politicians as well as their staff

749
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,559
are giving me a headache.

750
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,274
-You're here, sir.
-Hey.

751
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,527
-Did you find anything?
-I might be able to find something.

752
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,781
Before the appointment of the chairperson,

753
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,784
-Tae-jun met with Mr. Jo Gap-yeong.
-Okay.

754
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,745
And before that,
he also met with Jeong Seung-yun,

755
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,039
Park Yeong-beom, and Son Jeong-yeol.

756
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,461
Those jerks are siding
with Jo Gap-yeong, right?

757
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,712
-Yes.
-I see.

758
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,715
And they are on the Administrative
Investigation Committee, too.

759
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,217
These three.

760
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:34,805
After Tae-jun had met with these jerks,

761
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,474
Jo Gap-yeong became the chairperson
for the committee.

762
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:41,019
They don't have much influence
and much support from their district.

763
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,272
Right. To get nominated for the committee,

764
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,359
they must have bribed Jo Gap-yeong.

765
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:53,281
This was the leash
Tae-jun has on Jo Gap-yeong.

766
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,158
Shall I contact them?

767
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,371
I don't need all of them.
I'll talk to Park Yeong-beom.

768
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,916
He's the biggest scaredy-cat among them.
Just bring him to me.

769
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,794
Okay, sir.

770
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,879
If he tries to mess with me,

771
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,674
I will have to strike back.

772
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,595
Let's go.

773
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,184
Mr. Han.

774
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,522
-Shall we get going?
-Ms. Lee will be joining, too.

775
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,023
Where is she now?

776
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,693
She was supposed to come
after the meeting with the lawyer.

777
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,361
But she must be running late.

778
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,492
Look at my adorable baby.
Did you have your meal?

779
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,871
You must be so full. Did you just yawn?

780
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,039
Who am I? I'm your mommy.

781
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,209
Where's your mommy? She's right here.

782
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,170
Say, "Mom."

783
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,884
She's right here.

784
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,390
Ms. Lee!

785
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,020
Take care of Ms. Lee!

786
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,938
Ms. Lee.

787
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:08,857
Ms. Lee.

788
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,657
Somebody, please help!

789
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,451
-Goodness!
-Oh, no.

790
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,955
Ms. Lee.

791
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,755
Good work.

792
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,550
HEARING TO DRAFT A BILL TO MANAGE DAMAGE

793
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,551
Yes, Mr. Han.

794
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,849
I'm on my way right now.

795
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,269
Did something happen?

796
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,648
I'll call you later.

797
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,448
Where's everyone?

798
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,409
They're all working
outside the office today.

799
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,745
Everyone seems busy. Except for me.

800
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,333
Here. These are the complaints
from the redevelopment district.

801
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,252
-File them for me.
-Okay.

802
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,257
Ms. No.

803
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,925
-Yes.
-Well,

804
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,845
can I take a look
at the expense record of our office?

805
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,057
May I ask why?

806
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,227
Ms. Yun handles the finance herself.

807
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,148
I mean, I'm also on the staff
of Mr. Jang's office.

808
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,066
I ought to know how things are run here.

809
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,568
I'm Mr. Jang's chief of staff, too.

810
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,528
Don't you agree?

811
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,619
Yes, Mr. Jeong.

812
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,999
Mr. Oh Won-sik?

813
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,253
Okay, I got it.

814
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,869
She fell asleep just now.

815
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,455
It's a relief there's no brain hemorrhage.

816
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,500
But the doctor said
she needs to rest for a few days.

817
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:17,462
Did you contact her family?

818
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:18,964
Yes.

819
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,593
Why?

820
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,846
I guess you're starting to get scared now.

821
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,308
I only give one warning.

822
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,560
Before you find yourself
in bigger trouble,

823
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,064
shut that pretty mouth of yours.

824
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,326
What happened to Ms. Lee?

825
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,246
She was attacked when she was
coming out of the lawyer's office.

826
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,249
We can't trace the motorcycle
because it didn't have a plate number.

827
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,583
How is she?

828
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,460
We need to observe her
for a few more days.

829
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,925
And I got a call from Mr. Jeong.

830
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,927
I think Minister Song is up to something.

831
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,598
Mr. Oh Won-sik met
with Mr. Park Yeong-beom.

832
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,605
Where's Mr. Park Yeong-beom now?

833
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,114
All right. Everything is recorded.

834
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,995
Everything you just told me

835
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:37,208
is exactly what you told Tae-jun, correct?
Everything, word for word?

836
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,378
Of course, Mr. Song.
I repeated it word for word.

837
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,223
Hey, Yeong-beom.

838
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:53,683
Yes, sir.

839
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:57,228
Jeez, there's no need to be scared.

840
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,232
I'll let you keep your seat
in the National Assembly.

841
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,862
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

842
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,657
If Mr. Park tells Mr. Song
that he had given money to Mr. Jo--

843
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,327
Everything we have built so far
will be pointless.

844
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,710
Sir.

845
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,051
It's a request for your attendance
for the investigation.

846
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,557
REQUEST OF WITNESS' ATTENDANCE

847
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,061
Damn it.

848
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,732
What the heck is the Minister of Justice
doing right now?

849
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,693
JOOJIN CHEMICAL

850
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,279
MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP

851
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,783
Yes, Minister Song.

852
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,869
I have just received
a request for attendance.

853
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,002
Is that so?

854
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,297
I see. Yes. I see.

855
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,465
Okay.

856
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,718
You can't barge in like this.

857
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,681
-Goodness.
-Yes, Mr. Song. I'll see you tonight.

858
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,683
Bye.

859
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:26,234
Oh, my. To what do I owe the pleasure?

860
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,236
Is there something wrong?

861
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,655
I'm sure you know why I'm here
better than anyone.

862
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,702
Ms. Lee is hospitalized
after a motorcycle accident.

863
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,958
I had no idea

864
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:44,878
she was in an accident.

865
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,340
She should have been more careful.

866
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,552
You can't afford to lose
one more chief of staff.

867
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,140
Are you behind Mr. Go's death as well?

868
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,685
Why are you accusing me?

869
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,898
I thought he took his own life
because you gave him too much work.

870
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,444
You received a request
of attendance, right?

871
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,531
I will make you rot in prison
for the rest of your miserable life.

872
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,578
Gosh, I'm sorry
you won't be able to do that.

873
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,541
I would want nothing more than
to attend the investigation

874
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,877
and clear my name, but...

875
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,721
The prosecution obtained evidence
that the chairperson of the Daehan Party,

876
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,389
Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong, accepted bribes

877
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,266
in exchange for nominations
on the committee.

878
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,268
The prosecution has launched
an investigation.

879
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,354
There must've been a misunderstanding.

880
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,563
Wait. Hold on.

881
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,150
-Hey, what are you doing? Stop that.
-That way.

882
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,903
No, don't take that.
That's my personal belonging.

883
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:53,988
Sir.

884
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,747
The prosecution announced
that they'll summon the assemblyman

885
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,583
and raid his house and office
with a search and seizure warrant.

886
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,753
No, those are the staff's personal
belongings. You can't take them.

887
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,922
-Check before you take them.
-Ask us first.

888
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,633
-Why would we? Hey, take them.
-You can't take everything here.

889
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,014
-Hey, block him.
-He's coming out now.

890
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,433
-Move back.
-Let us pass through.

891
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,436
-Did you accept bribes?
-Did you promise such favors?

892
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,855
Do you have anything to say
those who were wronged?

893
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:31,067
-Please say something.
-Move back, everyone!

894
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,236
-Hey, don't push!
-Did you really accept bribes?

895
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,281
Assemblyman Jeong Seung-yun,
Assemblyman Park Yeong-beom,

896
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,576
and Assemblyman Son Jeong-yeol of
the Daehan Party who bribed Assemblyman Jo

897
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,911
will be summoned to be investigated, too.

898
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,580
All of the assemblymen involved

899
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,874
were on the committee to investigate
Joojin Chemical's chemical leak.

900
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,669
The National Assembly will have difficulty
to investigate the leak.

901
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,296
-Move back.
-Please give us a comment!

902
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,964
-Say something to the people.
-Make way.

903
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,133
Even if these assemblymen
resigned from their seats,

904
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,801
it will take a long time

905
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,886
to reappoint the chairperson
and bring the situation

906
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,139
-back to normal.
-I would love to testify.

907
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,349
But I can only do that
if there's an investigation.

908
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,226
Jeez, look at that.

909
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,521
I wonder when the investigation
will be held again.

910
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,608
Given the current situation,
the investigation is likely to be delayed.

911
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,320
As it will be difficult
for the people to accept

912
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,031
a half-formed committee without
three members from the ruling party,

913
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,826
the investigation is expected
to be postponed for the time being.

914
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,669
-Yes.
-As a current assemblyman

915
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:35,131
whose duty is to obey the law
and diligently fulfill his given tasks

916
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,841
in good conscience,

917
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,178
how could you cover up evidence of bribery

918
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:44,515
and threaten another assemblyman
in order to fulfill your own interests?

919
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,729
Tae-jun,

920
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,190
you should've known that a war

921
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,859
always sheds blood.

922
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,993
Nicely done, sir.

923
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,541
I must shine a light in the darkness

924
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,045
and fill the cracks with the light.

925
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,054
That should do it.

926
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,529
However, keep in mind

927
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,743
that a bright light is accompanied
by a darker shadow.

928
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,524
What are you trying to do right now?

929
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:20,194
You'd better lie low for the time being
unless your goal is getting crushed.

930
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,529
Things keep getting harder.

931
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,949
If there's no crack, we can make one.
We must make them attack each other.

932
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,243
The National Tax Service is investigating
Joojin Chemical.

933
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,121
A month will be more than enough
for me to bring you down.

934
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,290
Chief Choe, things have changed.

935
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,833
I don't want to hand over

936
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,793
Mr. Lee Chang-jin to
Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

937
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:36,794
Stop it immediately!

938
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,173
This bastard, Tae-jun, set up a trap.

939
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:44,635
Seon-yeong, it's time to pull out
the rotten tree completely.
