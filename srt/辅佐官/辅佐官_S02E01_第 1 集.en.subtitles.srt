SEOBUK MARKET COMMITTEE
AGAINST REDEVELOPMENT

3
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,868
Shells

4
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,622
begin to suffocate what has
already gotten big little by little.

5
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,754
In order to survive,

6
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,381
you must break out of the shell.

7
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,427
You must spread your wet wings and fly.

8
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,951
However, the moment you break out
of the shell that's been protecting you,

9
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,578
you become the prey of your natural enemy.

ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

13
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,029
Mr. Jang, the Minister is coming.

00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,093
MEMORIAL GATE

15
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,476
-Hey.
-Welcome, sir.

16
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,311
Hello, sir. You must be busy.

17
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,396
Hello.

18
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,482
-It's hot today. Thank you.
-Congratulations.

19
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,816
Have you been well?

20
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,152
-It's been a while.
-You must be busy.

21
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,530
He must think he has won
the presidency or something.

22
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,199
He's acting like a big shot.

23
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,034
Yes, indeed.

24
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,994
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

25
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,497
You're here.

26
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,292
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

27
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,133
Mr. Jang, come up here.

28
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,556
Move over.

29
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,062
No need to feel shy.

30
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,564
You must get all the attention
you can get on a day like this.

31
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,611
Let's go.

32
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,423
Before the legislative election
is held this year,

33
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,176
Minister Song Hui-seop, the assemblymen,
and women of the Daehan Party

34
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,971
have visited the Seoul National Cemetery
in Dongjak-gu.

35
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,973
The Daehan Party's members
paid their respects

36
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,100
-at the former President's tomb at 9 a.m.
-Bow.

37
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,685
They are determined to win the election

38
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,937
-by bringing reforms and changes.
-Up.

39
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,236
He's overly protective.

40
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,447
I saw a flowerpot in my office.

41
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,199
You didn't have to send me that.

42
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,163
I never had a chance to congratulate you
on becoming the minister.

43
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,917
The list must be out.

44
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,338
Jo Gap-yeong is going throw a fit again.

45
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,553
Sir.

46
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,097
These are the candidates
for the chief prosecutor.

47
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,602
LIST OF RECOMMENDED CANDIDATES
FOR CHIEF PROSECUTOR

48
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,899
In order to become the minister,

49
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,192
you'll have no choice but to

50
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,611
hand over the floor leader position
to Chairperson Lee.

51
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,112
What will you be offering me?

52
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,031
You know the Minister of Justice
has authority

53
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,158
over the prosecution's
personnel matters, right?

54
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,328
There are way too many positions
to fill the organization with just

55
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,412
the people of my own.

56
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,169
Most of the important positions
at the prosecution

57
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,754
are filled with Mr. Song's people.

58
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,423
This bastard, Song Hui-seop.
He took all the good parts

59
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,217
and gave me only the empty shell.

60
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,636
Mr. Jo. Mr. Song has the control
over the prosecution now,

61
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,596
and Chairperson Lee has become
the floor leader.

62
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,556
At this rate,
the election will be the end of us.

63
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,559
Before the election, we must win over
other members, even if it's just one.

64
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,232
After taking over the prosecution,
he wants to mobilize Lee Sang-guk

65
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,235
and win the legislative election
without lifting a finger. Right?

66
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,778
I cannot let that happen.

67
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,574
Gather all of the members
before the general meeting.

68
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,117
Yes, sir.

69
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,163
I am sure at least you will understand
why I risked everything

70
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,831
in order to get

71
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,626
this mere position of Minister of Justice.

72
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,962
Yes.

73
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,173
You must take control of the prosecution
to run for president.

74
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,801
That's right. In this country,

75
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,429
you must keep a tight rein
on the prosecution.

76
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,640
That way,
no one can dare say anything to you.

77
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,434
Lee Sang-guk will take care of

78
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,186
the legislative election
without a problem.

79
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,480
Now, our focus is on the prosecution.

80
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,441
But Mr. Jo Gap-yeong
is in the Prosecution Reform Committee.

81
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,528
He may use the appointment
as an excuse to mobilize

82
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,530
the members of the committee
and attack you.

83
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,949
That's why I expect
a lot of help from you.

84
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,537
I put your name
on the Prosecution Reform Committee.

85
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,043
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

86
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,964
I'm sure you're aware of how important
a position on that committee is.

87
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,093
I need you to be on the committee
and back me up,

88
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,095
so I could go all the way
to the Blue House.

89
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,183
-I will not forget your kindness.
-Sure.

90
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,446
I love this place.
It gets a lot of sunlight.

91
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,948
It's hard to find a good spot
like this in Seoul.

92
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,783
And it's easy to get here, too.

93
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,078
That must be why all the presidents
want to be buried here.

94
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,960
That spot looks nice. Yes, that one.

95
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,129
What do you think?

96
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,590
I'm talking about my burial site.

97
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,345
Since I have entered politics,

98
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,804
I ought to

99
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,932
be buried in a place like this.
Don't you agree?

100
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,313
This is nice. Isn't it?

101
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,357
MEMORIAL GATE

102
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,859
I will see you at the general meeting
this afternoon.

103
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,393
IN THE DARKNESS

104
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,375
Must you sell your conscience
just for a seat in the National Assembly?

105
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,837
I'll gladly sell my conscience
if I can be elected and gain power.

106
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,218
Do you realize how you look right now?

107
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,554
You look like a corrupt,
backstabbing jerk.

108
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,182
Can you say what you just told me
in front of Assemblyman Lee?

109
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,253
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

110
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,305
TO BE DEMOLISHED

111
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,518
I will rise with a huge weight
on my shoulders for the new Seongjin City.

112
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,938
March toward the new path with me.

113
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,109
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

114
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,196
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

115
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,698
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

116
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,493
ASSEMBLYMAN

117
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,997
JANG TAE-JUN

118
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,843
Go, the chief of staff
of a current assemblywoman,

119
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,764
was found dead on a hill
in Eunpyeong-gu last July.

120
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,392
The case was closed as a suicide
55 days since his body was found.

121
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,686
The prosecution has ordered

122
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,106
the Seoul Seobu Police Station
to end the investigation,

123
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,108
and the police are to wrap up
the investigation

124
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,527
-by today.
-"Suicide"?

125
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,863
SEO HYEONG-CHEOL

126
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,033
As I told you repeatedly,
there's no hard evidence.

127
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,036
The dashcam is gone. And there's no
CCTV footage around the area.

128
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,040
So are you telling me that
you will simply close the case as suicide?

129
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,585
What about the motive for the suicide?
Did you find it?

130
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,046
Go Seok-man often worked late.

131
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,423
He even had to work on weekends.

132
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,176
We suspect that he committed suicide
due to his heavy workload.

133
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,928
There was no suicide note on the scene.

134
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,514
The day before he died,
Mr. Go was on his way

135
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,183
to my house with an important document.

136
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,061
Did you check the text message he sent me?

137
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,405
I HAVE THE DOCUMENT FROM THE FIU
IN HONG KONG. I'M ON MY WAY.

138
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,950
Why would he commit suicide?

139
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,829
-Show me the list of his belongings.
-Here you go.

140
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,294
As you can see,

141
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,671
there was no document
that you speak of on the scene.

142
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,217
Can you show me the investigation report?

143
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,721
I get that you're an assemblywoman,
but I cannot disclose that to you.

144
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,805
And...

145
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,727
I understand that you are interested
in the case as he was your chief of staff.

146
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,563
But I can't let you
constantly barge into my office.

147
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,196
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes.

148
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,034
If this case turns out to be a homicide,

149
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,370
you will have to take responsibility
for your faulty investigation.

150
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,782
GO SEOK-MAN
REST IN PEACE

151
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,786
But do you really want to run for office
even after seeing what I went through?

152
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,624
It's not like you're rich,
and you have no powerful connections.

153
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:05,506
The least you can do as my friend
is support me.

154
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,469
Hey.

155
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,847
Eat that and cheer up.

156
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,599
You're not like me, so you'll make it.

157
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,935
At least one of us
should get to wear that badge.

158
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,604
You can do it, Tae-jun!

159
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,405
GO SEOK-MAN
REST IN PEACE

160
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,955
You should have seen me

161
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,042
become an assemblyman.

162
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,928
I'm sorry for not visiting you more often.

163
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,454
Hye-won.

164
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,330
Yes.

165
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,542
Let's get started.

166
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,546
Okay.

167
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,383
THE DAEHAN PARTY VISITS NATIONAL CEMETERY

168
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,927
Look at Tae-jun. He's right in the front.

169
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,304
What a nice world we live in.

170
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,015
I heard that Mr. Jang will join
the Prosecution Reform Committee.

171
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,351
He's on the Judiciary Committee and
the Prosecution Reform Committee. Gosh.

172
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,812
He's sweeping all the important positions.

173
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,315
Mr. Jang is indeed impressive.

174
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,776
Goodness, do you like him that much?

175
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,652
Do you want to switch to his office?

176
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,529
What? Did you hear him? Send me there.

177
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,573
No, I won't. I should teach you a lesson.

178
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,783
What are you watching?

179
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,077
-Hello.
-What brings you here?

180
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,788
The general meeting is today.
I heard Minister Song will be there.

181
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,250
Look at him, all high and mighty.
He only got his seat

182
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,794
at the expense of Mr. Lee's death.

183
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,216
Jang Tae-jun is here. He's here. Look.

184
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,804
Hello.

185
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,558
Poor you.

186
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,936
You must be utterly heartbroken, Jong-uk.

187
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,813
It sucks to be you.
Hye-won has a higher rank.

188
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,731
Why are you bringing that up?

189
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,025
Hye-won picked the right guy to follow.

190
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,277
Who knew that she'd get
bumped up to Rank Four?

191
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,737
You should have buttered up Tae-jun

192
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,573
instead of lounging around at work.
Why didn't you do that?

193
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,451
How could I have known
that he'd actually get elected?

194
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,037
You're right.
I bet Won-sik feels worse than...

195
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,208
What's the point of serving
under Minister Song for years?

196
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,460
Jang Tae-jun was the one
who got nominated in the end.

197
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,716
A mere badge won't change anything.

198
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,051
It won't change

199
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,720
who you are.

200
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,456
Wait.

201
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,217
Hello, Ms. Kang.

202
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,270
Mr. Han.

203
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,148
-Yes, Ms. Kang.
-I asked you to conduct a poll

204
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,775
about a revised bill
for labor environment. How is that going?

205
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,446
I conducted the poll and will receive
the analysis result this afternoon.

206
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,823
I will inform you
as soon as I get the result, Ms. Kang.

207
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,450
Please do that.

208
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,976
I'll be sure to survive here until the end

209
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,312
so that I can prove

210
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,898
that you were wrong.

211
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,982
Watch out!

212
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,442
-Oh, no!
-No, please.

213
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,737
-Gosh, no.
-Goodness.

214
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,199
-What do we do now?
-Gosh.

215
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,870
-How do you expect me to live now?
-Goodness. What am I going to do?

216
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,214
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

217
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,050
-Hello.
-Hello.

218
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,262
The committee meeting
is scheduled for this afternoon.

219
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,263
Okay.

220
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,475
Mr. Ahn, are you going
to Seongjin City Hall?

221
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,978
Yes, there's a meeting
about a community business.

222
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,145
Tell them we'll cooperate.

223
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,231
It will help increase
Mr. Jang's popularity.

224
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,857
Okay.

225
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,111
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

226
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,946
-Have a good day.
-Mr. Jeong.

227
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,115
Summarize the current progress of
the agendas discussed

228
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,033
last year
by the Prosecution Reform Committee.

229
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,494
-Okay.
-Good morning.

230
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,204
-Ms. Han.
-Yes.

231
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,623
Please print out
the committee's activity report.

232
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,041
Yes, Ms. Yun.

233
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,671
Mr. Park. Please monitor the interviews
by the press and civic groups.

234
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,714
Okay, I will.

235
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,595
Hello. I'm Kim Mi-jin.
I'm the host of Focus of Current Affairs.

236
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,849
A while ago, a first-term
assemblywoman's chief of staff

237
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,559
who was suffering from depression

238
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,728
due to a heavy workload committed suicide.

239
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,647
-What do you think about this?
-Come on. She's unbelievable.

240
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,774
She keeps talking shit about Ms. Kang.

241
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,068
-When will she stop babbling?
-I know.

242
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,945
Unbelievable.

243
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,239
As for first-term assemblymen and women,

244
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,451
they are eager to work,
but they don't have much experience.

245
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,412
So I heard they can't give
clear guidance to their chief of staff.

246
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,497
That's correct. That's why experienced...

247
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,628
Did the FIU in Hong Kong call?

248
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,381
Yes. They said that they couldn't send
the document to our office.

249
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,050
I'll give them a call.

250
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,844
Ms. Kang.

251
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,057
I know it's not the right time to bring
it up, but without a chief of staff,

252
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,600
things are moving very slowly.

253
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,109
I don't think you should leave
the position vacant.

254
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,697
Ms. Lee will be joining us starting today.

255
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,532
Ms. Lee?

256
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,743
Already? Is she ready to work today?

257
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,787
After hearing what happened,
she said she would.

258
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,081
Okay.

259
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,375
We're dead meat.

260
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,920
Hello.

261
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,842
The late chief of staff attended
every event in the region

262
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,887
where the assemblywoman was
trying very hard to get reelected.

263
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,182
And when the chief of staff had stayed up
all night to prepare for the hearing,

264
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,018
the assemblywoman forced him
to participate in a bicycle race.

265
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,896
Assemblywoman K is unbelievable.

266
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,731
The chief of staff
should take her position.

267
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,858
-What is she getting paid for?
-Mr. Jang.

268
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,861
Mr. Song will arrive an hour later
after his meal.

269
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,239
-Okay.
-The press is keeping it hush-hush,

270
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,534
but in fact, everyone
at the National Assembly knows who she is.

271
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,245
This morning, Ms. Kang went
to the Western Prosecutors' Office

272
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,871
regarding Mr. Go's case.

273
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,665
I think she asked them to reinvestigate.

274
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,252
Especially Assemblywoman K
seems to have a lot of problems.

275
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,046
I will deliver the document
as soon as I receive it.

276
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,757
She's in the limelight
as she's an assemblywoman.

277
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,386
I don't understand
why she can't be more careful.

278
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,120
JO GAP-YEONG

279
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,551
JO GAP-YEONG

280
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,369
Why aren't the others here already?

281
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,915
They are otherwise engaged
and have meetings.

282
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,835
Unless it's urgent,
they want to meet some other time.

283
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,378
I think other members of the party

284
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,506
have switched to Mr. Song's side.

285
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,560
Damn it.

286
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,773
Those bastards would knock on my door
when they wanted something from me.

287
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,399
I know.

288
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,405
Well, Mr. Jo. Please take a look at this.

289
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,074
What is this?

290
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,125
-Where did you get this?
-It was in our office mailbox.

291
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,669
Mailbox?

292
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,773
I doubt that I need to
explain this to you.

293
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,775
You're the expert in that area.

294
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,903
Where did you get this?

295
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,115
It doesn't matter where I got this from.
The content is important.

296
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,869
Why are you giving this to me?

297
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,039
If you handle it yourself, you'll receive
much more attention yourself.

298
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,333
Please take it
as a token of our reconciliation.

299
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,419
If you disclose it first, you'll get
the credit. You'd look great if you

300
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,172
take the lead along with
other first-term assemblymen and women.

301
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,884
No one at the National Assembly is trusted
as much as you are by the public.

302
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,678
Don't you think
it'd be nice to be in the limelight?

303
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,684
The election is around the corner.
You must think about getting reelected.

304
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,729
Forget about the past.
And let's focus on our future.

305
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,648
I will be criticized as much
as I receive attention.

306
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,196
So you won't take this because of that?

307
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,198
No. I will do it.

308
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,534
In return, have the Environment
and Labor Committee pass

309
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,244
the revised bill of the labor environment.

310
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,248
Are you talking about the last bill
Mr. Lee Seong-min proposed?

311
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,792
Yes.

312
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,794
I decided to carry on with it.

313
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,130
I will. See you at the general meeting.

314
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,466
And there's one more condition.

315
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,679
I need to take back

316
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,973
my position as the spokesperson.

317
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,103
I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal.

318
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,105
Take it if you don't want to.

319
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,481
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

320
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,194
Fine. I promise.

321
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,864
And as for this,

322
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,785
I will keep it as a token of your promise.

323
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,579
A lot of people tend
to not keep their promises.

324
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,582
But I'm sure you would never do that.

325
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,839
Ms. Kang, you have become
a politician now.

326
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,882
See you at the general meeting.

327
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,695
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

328
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,870
Let's talk.

329
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,886
Mr. Go's case was closed as suicide.

330
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,013
I know. I heard.

331
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:27,974
Is that all?

332
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,019
It's not just anyone. It's Mr. Go.

333
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,021
How could you of all people
not do anything?

334
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,858
He had the copy from the FIU.
And it was gone from the accident site.

335
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,568
If that copy was disclosed to the public,

336
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,987
I doubt that
Mr. Song would have been appointed.

337
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,322
Is that a coincidence?

338
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,532
Do you really believe
that he committed suicide?

339
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,909
Stop here.

340
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,037
If it wasn't suicide,
it might put you in danger, too.

341
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,371
I'll look into it.

342
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,124
Tae-jun.

343
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,002
Are you connected to this case?

344
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,841
If I tell you I'm not,
will you believe me?

345
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,094
No, I won't.

346
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,223
I will get to the bottom of this case.

347
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,516
I cannot let this be buried.

348
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,976
-Seon-yeong.
-If you are

349
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,603
connected to this case

350
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,772
in any way,

351
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,232
I can never forgive you.

352
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,245
-Yes.
-Mr. Jang.

353
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,704
It's time for the general meeting.

354
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,789
And the document?

355
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,168
I saw one of Mr. Jo's staff
take the document.

356
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,462
Okay.

357
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,933
-Mr. Song, hello.
-Hey.

358
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,476
-Hello.
-Hello.

359
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm here. Let's go inside.

360
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,191
Starting with today's general meeting,
the Daehan Party

361
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,610
will begin their preparation
for the legislative election.

362
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,070
The floor leader, Lee Sang-guk,

363
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,031
will announce the Daehan Party's promises
for the election.

364
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,701
And he announced that the party
will prepare for their campaign.

365
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,327
-Gosh.
-As a result, the competition

366
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,330
behind the curtains for the election
is expected to intensify.

367
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,666
I ought to show my support, too.

368
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,460
-Please do a good job with the election.
-Okay.

369
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,629
Take a seat.

370
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,134
-All right then.
-Okay.

371
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,802
-Hi.
-Hey.

372
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,890
Goodness. It's been a while, Mr. Jo.

373
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,727
It's so hard to see you these days.

374
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,437
It's been a while.

375
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:42,191
By the way, did something bad
happen to your family?

376
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,193
You don't seem happy these days.

377
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,530
I was betrayed by someone I trusted.
Naturally, that doesn't make me happy.

378
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,702
Even so, you ought
to take care of your health.

379
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,204
Don't you know that people at our age
could die all of a sudden

380
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,706
if we don't take care of ourselves?

381
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:00,251
You're right. You should enjoy it
to the fullest while it lasts.

382
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,337
It only takes a moment to fall.

383
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,592
Right. Isn't that true?

384
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,012
What the heck is he talking about?

385
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,557
Take a seat. Hey, let's sit down.

386
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,060
My fellow members of the Daehan Party,

387
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,187
the legislative election
is around the corner.

388
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,650
Today, I will share my determination
regarding the legislative election

389
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,652
and the promises of our party.

390
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,030
And I plan to tell you in detail
how I will prepare

391
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,366
for the election
during the remaining time we have.

392
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,952
With the citizens of this country

393
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,662
and the Daehan Party,

394
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,747
-The broadcast started.
-to ensure

395
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,041
everything goes smoothly
at the Assembly...

396
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,376
Hye-won.

397
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,835
Yes.

398
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,629
Let's start.

399
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,798
Okay.

400
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,301
We ought to give back
what we got to be fair.

401
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,221
Who are you going to start with?

402
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,974
Let's start with Mr. Lee Sang-guk.

403
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,435
He has the control of the party
and the right of nomination.

404
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,230
I should make him resign
from the floor leader position.

405
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,482
That will be the first step.

406
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,734
ASSEMBLYMAN

407
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,823
JANG TAE-JUN

408
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:27,213
I WILL BE THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS

409
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,590
And I stand here today before you.

410
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,094
-With my love
-What's this?

411
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,847
for the National Assembly
and our country...

412
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,224
-What's going on?
-The floor leader?

413
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,686
-Did you see that?
-Look into that.

414
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,646
Hey, watch this.

415
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,523
The floor leader of the Daehan Party and

416
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,068
the chairperson of Judiciary Committee,
Assemblyman Lee Sang-guk,

417
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:53,656
is suspected to have received bribes
for quashing an investigation.

418
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,618
The prosecution began
the investigation by tracking

419
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,703
Assemblyman Lee's account

420
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,414
and they are investigating
the cash flow now.

421
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,333
Meanwhile, Assemblyman has met up
with the prosecutor in charge

422
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,378
of the assault case which
his acquaintance's son was involved in.

423
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,506
If you shake a deep-rooted tree,
only its leaves will fall.

424
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,842
We must take out
and cut off the roots one by one

425
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,511
for the whole tree to collapse.

426
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,679
And it's been confirmed

427
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,807
that he accepted bribes from
his acquaintance for doing it,

428
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,309
which is expected to cause a stir.

429
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,395
Moreover, they are said
to be tracing a third party

430
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,814
-who's suspected
-Mr. Lee, we have a problem.

431
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,483
to have bribed Assemblyman Lee.

432
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,651
What is going on?

433
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,488
There's a news report saying
you accepted bribes. Is it true?

434
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,239
Is it true that you asked a special favor?

435
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,200
Who is it that asked a favor of you?

436
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,743
How much money did you get?

437
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,119
Please tell us in detail.

438
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,080
Please say a word about the news.

439
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,624
Is the news report true?

440
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,000
Is it true that you took bribes?

441
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,211
How much money did you receive?

442
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,129
Please tell us about it.

443
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,464
How do you know that person?

444
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,716
-Let us ask one more question.
-Please answer it.

445
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,176
Please say a word.

446
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,511
Is the news true?

447
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,805
Is it true you accepted bribes?

448
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,389
How long has it been?

449
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,724
Please answer it.

450
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,560
-Please tell us if it's true.
-Tell us the truth.

451
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,604
Assemblyman, please answer it.

452
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,398
-Is it true?
-How much did you get?

453
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,692
-Please tell us.
-Assemblyman, is it true?

454
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,152
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE MUST RESIGN

455
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,365
THE DAEHAN PARTY NEEDS
EMERGENCY PLANNING COMMITTEE

456
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,993
I'm Assemblywoman Kang
of the Daehan Party.

457
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,954
We call for an immediate resignation

458
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,998
of Assemblyman Lee
who's undermined the constitutionalism.

459
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,210
Also, in order to show
our commitment to change and innovation,

460
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,254
we demand
the Emergency Planning Committee.

461
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,050
Is there a reason
you call for his resignation?

462
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,263
Mr. Lee once made a strong argument
the Judiciary Committee

463
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,474
which is closely related
to the prosecution shouldn't be

464
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,309
an illegal window for civil complaints.

465
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,563
And yet, he took bribes
from his acquaintance

466
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,898
and asked a prosecutor to cover up a case.

467
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,692
It has failed the people.

468
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,403
Why an Emergency Planning Committee
instead of a new floor leader?

469
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,155
Nothing is more important

470
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,324
than restoring the people's confidence
before the legislative election.

471
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,326
It's urgent to reorganize
the party leadership,

472
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,163
but it costs a lot of time and money
to call a party convention.

473
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,664
It wouldn't get the people's assent.

474
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,334
I believe an Emergency Planning Committee
will be the most reasonable option.

475
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,587
Excuse me. This is it for today.

476
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,133
Assemblywoman Kang,
could you spare me a moment?

477
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,384
Maybe next time.

478
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,475
It seems Assemblywoman Kang has joined
hands with Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong.

479
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,060
I guess it's to pass the bill.

480
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,272
Assemblywoman Kang could be
a variable for your plan.

481
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,358
Why don't you tell her the truth?

482
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,652
No matter what I say,
she wouldn't believe me now.

483
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,070
And...

484
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,157
it's better to move alone
when pulling a trick.

485
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,369
Is that the only reason?

486
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,663
You seem to be afraid

487
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,082
it might be dangerous
for Assemblywoman Kang.

488
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,463
I'm sorry. I'll go and get ready
for your schedule.

489
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,101
Assemblyman Lee, if you have a conscience,

490
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,395
you should step down as floor leader.

491
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,314
There will be
the legislative election soon.

492
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,191
We can't keep the post
of floor leader vacant.

493
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,776
That's why I'm saying this.

494
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,694
We need the Emergency Planning Committee.

495
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,238
It's not even a state of emergency.

496
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,948
Why are you being like this?

497
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,282
-That's absurd.
-Of course it is.

498
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,700
Enough.

499
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,581
Mr. Ahn, you can't
just cover for him like that.

500
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,375
You should have a sense of shame.

501
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,293
If this isn't an emergency, what is?

502
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,462
We can't win
the legislative election like this.

503
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,465
Darn it.

504
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,300
Let's do this right.

505
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,052
All right then.

506
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,846
We need the Emergency Planning Committee.

507
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,599
What did you say?
Is this about the right of nomination?

508
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,559
-Don't be ridiculous.
-What is it then?

509
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,561
How could you say such a thing?

510
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,647
-What is this about then?
-Come on.

511
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,899
-That's just absurd.
-What else can we do?

512
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,985
-It's not even an emergency.
-We shouldn't do this.

513
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,696
Assemblyman Lee is the chairperson
of the Judiciary Committee

514
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,447
who is supposed to manage the organization

515
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,409
and take care of its main issues.

516
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,704
But he met with the prosecutor
in charge of the case

517
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,082
-Minister Song.
-and asked for non-prosecution,

518
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,167
which is construed as political pressure.

519
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,337
It's also been confirmed that he accepted
bribes from an acquaintance

520
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,380
regarding the matter.

521
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,717
-Assemblyman Lee must resign--
-Gosh.

522
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,593
Darn it.

523
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,347
About Lee Sang-guk, is it true?

524
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,935
Yes. The police have already
secured conclusive evidence.

525
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,565
What are you going to do?

526
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,942
Once he resigns the leadership,

527
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,569
Jo Gap-yeong will take it over.

528
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,406
If he becomes the chairperson,
he will exercise the right of nomination.

529
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,658
And everyone will end up

530
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,785
bowing down to him.

531
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,622
This isn't right.
We have to stop it no matter what.

532
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,791
If you try to protect Assemblyman Lee,

533
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,586
they will raise the issue to attack you.

534
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,379
You ought to

535
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,630
give up on him.

536
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,386
If I abandon Lee Sang-guk now,

537
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,514
those who have followed me
will be let down.

538
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,600
It just looks ugly.

539
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,895
The Supreme Council will
decide the chairperson.

540
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,231
I'll meet with the members of the Supreme
Council and try to convince them.

541
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,317
You should just watch this issue

542
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,235
from the distance.

543
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,201
Assemblyman Lee Sang-guk
accused of accepting bribes

544
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,287
announced his intention to resign
the leadership of the Daehan Party.

545
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,997
And now the Daehan Party is showing signs

546
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,500
of forming
the Emergency Planning Committee.

547
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,169
Assemblyman Jo is most likely
to be the chairperson...

548
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,381
Now that I'm joining hands with you,
good things are happening.

549
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,841
I don't know why I've turned against you
for such a long time.

550
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:49,887
Hey.

551
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,850
-Chairperson Jo.
-My gosh.

552
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,644
I was going to have a celebration party,

553
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,772
but they wanted to meet with you first,
so we came by.

554
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,483
-Congratulations, Chairperson Jo.
-Thank you.

555
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,486
-Things are going well now.
-I agree.

556
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,571
My gosh.

557
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,367
Look who's here.

558
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,285
Chairperson Jo, congratulations.

559
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,495
Please have a seat.

560
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,043
Now we can do things right.

561
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,756
This is ridiculous.

562
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,971
Goodbye, sir.

563
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,357
I just dropped him off.

564
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,193
I told the director about Geon on the way.

565
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,486
I might go home early tonight.

566
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,488
Let's tell Mother when it's time.

567
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,283
No, you should feed him
every three hours. It's 130ml.

568
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,911
Yes. I'm almost there. Okay.

569
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,913
I should go. Text me if something happens.

570
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,708
Darn it!

571
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,130
Bye.

572
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,967
"Darn it?"

573
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,359
Behave yourself, okay?

574
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,778
KANG SEON-YEONG

575
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,574
I'm sorry.

576
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,370
It's been a long time.

577
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

578
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,169
You guys must be busy.

579
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,838
-How have you been? You haven't quit yet.
-No, not yet.

580
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,259
It's so nice to see you guys again.

581
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,847
I didn't see him before. Is he new?

582
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,848
Yes.

583
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,683
I'm Han Do-gyeong.

584
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,354
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Ji-eun.

585
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,814
-I appreciate your help.
-You don't have to.

586
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:06,982
Just do your job right.

587
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,863
Congratulations, Ms. Lee.
I heard it's a boy.

588
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,368
You just gave birth.
Is it okay to start working...

589
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,998
We can chat next time.

590
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,126
I need to know how things are going
before Assemblywoman Kang gets here.

591
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,420
Shall we start the meeting?

592
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,924
Okay. Get ready for the meeting.

593
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,184
-Hey.
-Hello.

594
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,771
Hi. Hey, guys.

595
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,733
-What's up?
-Nothing.

596
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,320
The atmosphere is quite distracted.
I was just wondering how you are doing.

597
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,281
You don't have your staff yet?

598
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,325
Minister Song is trying hard
to build a good reputation these days.

599
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,536
He's afraid he'd get blamed
for hiring staff

600
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,871
when he's not so active
in parliamentary politics.

601
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,999
We just have
some administrative assistants.

602
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:10,254
By the way, has Ms. Lee started
working again at Kang Seon-yeong's office?

603
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,301
-Ms. Lee?
-Yes. IU of Yeouido.

604
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,787
Who prepared the materials for
the revised bill for labor environment?

605
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,793
I did.

606
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,799
If it includes articles that require
revision of work environment,

607
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,093
you will need to come up
with measures for the budget.

608
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,137
I asked the Budget Office
for the estimated cost.

609
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,222
I'll report back to you
as soon as it's ready.

610
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,807
About safety management,

611
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,810
it seems to conflict
with the Industrial Safety and Health Act.

612
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,730
I'll make sure to adjust the bill
by specifying it

613
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,482
in order to avoid any conflict.

614
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:18,322
The content of the bill is biased
toward the labor side.

615
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,574
It might spark a backlash from companies.

616
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:24,662
I know. But I believe it is only worthy
as a revised bill

617
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,121
for labor environment this way.

618
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,707
A bill is only worthy when it's passed.

619
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,543
When it's not passed,
it's just a waste of paper.

620
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,718
This is the survey result on the bill.

621
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,058
About 77 percent of those surveyed
support the bill.

622
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:49,144
I believe we have such a public opinion
due to recent industrial accidents

623
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,896
and death cases from overwork.

624
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,940
The bill can be passed.
It's a timely bill.

625
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,401
-We should hurry--
-So

626
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,821
this is about direction, not time.

627
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,864
It's our job to balance

628
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,451
the ideal and the real
and plan a strategy to convince people.

629
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,372
My gosh. I know you tried hard.
You did a good job.

630
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,915
It's cute.

631
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,584
Now that you're the secretary here,

632
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,045
you should learn
to consider practical issues.

633
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,757
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,009
I'll work on it again.

635
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,138
It's not just about working on it again.
It has to be good.

636
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,390
Okay.

637
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,519
Let's move on to the next issue.

638
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,645
-Yes.
-Okay.

639
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:36,191
How are you going to deal
with her continual nagging?

640
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,734
Han Do-gyeong will have a hard time.

641
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,321
Why does he work here, by the way?
He seemed to like Assemblyman Jang.

642
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,367
I don't know. Let's start the meeting.

643
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,410
-Okay.
-Let's start.

644
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,570
-Is it funny? Stop smiling.
-Yes.

645
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,579
You're back.

646
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,915
I'm sorry I'm late.

647
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,543
I'm sorry. Your baby must need his mom.

648
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,506
It's okay. My husband takes
better care of him than I do.

649
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,930
I watched the press conference.

650
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,848
Are you with Assemblyman Jo?

651
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,979
I'd need the power of Environment
and Labor Committee to pass the bill.

652
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,691
Mr. Han Do-gyeong.

653
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,985
What do you think of him?

654
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,950
He's like a feisty adolescent.

655
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,538
He does seem to have guts though.
Kids these days are so weak.

656
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,165
I think I can tell

657
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,334
why you picked him.

658
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,047
You should be nice to him.
Everyone's too exhausted

659
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,466
to take care of a new member.

660
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,053
Is it because of Mr. Go?

661
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,348
I heard roughly about it from Ms. Lee.

662
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,433
You went to the prosecutor’s office
this morning.

663
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,646
I don't think Mr. Go committed suicide.

664
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:42,025
But I still don't want you
to handle it yourself.

665
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,570
It might be seen as political pressure.

666
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,698
I'll look into Mr. Go's case.

667
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,076
You need to focus on
your legislative activity for now.

668
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,621
Let me take care of it.
That's why I'm back.

669
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,042
Thank you for coming.

670
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,877
Thank you for taking me back.

671
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,092
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

672
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,847
Yes. Did you check the thing I asked for?

673
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,851
I'll call you back.

674
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,773
-Hello.
-It's been a long time, Ms. Yun.

675
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,735
I heard you're the chief now.

676
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,112
Congratulations.

677
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,739
Thank you.

678
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,492
All right. It's a good thing.

679
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,329
But you should be careful.
People might gossip

680
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,456
if you get promoted too soon.

681
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,915
Okay.

682
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,042
I'm aware of that.

683
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,044
Take good care of Assemblyman Jang.

684
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,963
Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun.

685
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,632
We will have to wait and see,

686
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,301
but he seems to have changed
from when he was the chief.

687
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,387
And there are rumors going around.
As you might know,

688
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,474
I hate those who give my boss a hard time.

689
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,895
I'm not sure what the rumors are about,

690
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,648
but Assemblyman Jang
hasn't changed at all.

691
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,900
I'm glad to hear that.

692
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,568
And...

693
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,529
I don't like people who give Assembly Jang

694
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,907
a hard time, just so you know.

695
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,846
-Mr. Oh.
-How did it go?

696
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,101
The staff at Kang Seon-yeong's office
don't seem to know anything.

697
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,397
Assembly Kang prepared her statement
and the press release herself.

698
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,443
He asked me for more, so...

699
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,321
-Hey. Hello.
-Hello.

700
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,324
I see you hit the jackpot.

701
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,493
Are you having a party
after causing such a stir?

702
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,452
My gosh.

703
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,372
The legislative election is right ahead.
We can't choose sides.

704
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,793
We just had to do this to earn our living.

705
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,255
How did you get the documents
about Assemblyman Lee?

706
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,841
We will soon be fighting like crazy.

707
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,135
I can't share my secret with you.

708
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,014
Take care. Let's go.

709
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,016
-Bye.
-Bye.

710
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,978
What do you want to eat?
We deserve to eat some meat today.

711
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,146
Meat?

712
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,355
Sounds good.

713
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,442
I can tell he's quite experienced
as a chief.

714
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,403
He got the documents and revealed it

715
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,655
during the general
meeting with perfect timing.

716
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,074
He's just getting by
playing Assembly Jo's slave.

717
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,537
He can't be the one
who came up with all that.

718
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,168
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

719
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,087
My gosh.

720
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,673
Where's everyone?

721
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,634
They are attending the meeting
of the Judiciary Committee.

722
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,261
The Judiciary Committee...

723
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,973
How may I help you?

724
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,688
I have some time to spare,
so I'd like to have some tea with Tae-jun.

725
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,399
He's out to meet with the members
of the Supreme Council.

726
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,443
Okay. I'll wait inside.

727
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,488
Ms. Jang isn't in there. It would be rude.

728
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,492
"Rude"?

729
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,952
Now that you're the chief,
you lost your manners?

730
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,746
You should address him properly first.

731
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,915
Call him Assemblyman Jang,
not by his name.

732
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,088
Tell Assemblyman Jang.

733
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,716
Minister Song is waiting for updates.

734
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,399
"Resignation as floor leader

735
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,735
and quarrels
over the right of nomination"?

736
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,529
It's a total mess.

737
00:51:55,612 --> 00:52:00,075
Assemblymen become nervous wrecks
before an election.

738
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,829
It's been less than a month
since you became one.

739
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,622
Aren't you spreading yourself too thin?

740
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,998
What are you going to do?

741
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,877
For politicians, nomination
is like their lives.

742
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,963
They will struggle for existence soon.

743
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,716
I will make them fight
and tear each other apart.

744
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,346
I guess it takes a lot of nerve
to be an assemblyman.

745
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,224
If Assemblyman Jo
becomes the chairperson like this,

746
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,767
wouldn't it give you a headache?

747
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,020
I need to be paid for what I've set up.

748
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,481
What will you do?

749
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,025
People will take Assemblyman Jo's side.

750
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,947
I guess so. He's the new leader
with the right of nomination.

751
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,907
Now that we have some meat,

752
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,909
we should set a trap with it and wait.

753
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,621
There are a lot of people.
Where should we set a trap?

754
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,127
They've remained neutrality
even before Assemblyman Lee's scandal.

755
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,255
They just visited him for the sake
of formality when the table turned.

756
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,049
They wouldn't overtax their strength
for the right of nomination.

757
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,552
If Assembly Jo doesn't
nominate assemblymen

758
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,345
who get great support in their districts,

759
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,890
it will put more pressure on him.

760
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,768
Once the leading figures in the party
retire from politics,

761
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,772
they will become chairmen of foundations
or non-executive directors.

762
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,445
Those who are in a vulnerable
position within the party...

763
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,655
They'd want to get the districts
where they can win.

764
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,158
They will try to reach
Assembly Jo for sure.

765
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,327
I'll prepare a list.

766
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,593
Isn't this too dangerous?

767
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,844
Are you going to be okay?

768
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,639
You might be in trouble
with too much blood on your hands.

769
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,225
We need to purge what's rotten.

770
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,020
I'm prepared for this.

771
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,530
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR INAUGURATION,
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

772
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,789
If it's not Jo Gap-yeong
nor Kang Seon-yeong,

773
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:14,459
where did the document
about Lee Sang-guk come from?

774
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,921
I'm looking into it.
I'm asking reporters around.

775
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,965
Please wait a little more
until I find out.

776
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,519
Just tell me what this is about.

777
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,065
Assemblyman Jo

778
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,401
is trying to use you.

779
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,695
-If things go wrong--
-I don't care.

780
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,073
I'm just using him as well.

781
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,367
Seon-yeong.

782
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,495
It's funny

783
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,414
that you say that.

784
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,292
I'm just worried about you.

785
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,045
You just try to go higher
no matter what it takes.

786
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,631
That's what you're good at.

787
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,675
Right.

788
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,011
I'm not saying
I always make the right choice.

789
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,471
But even if I could turn back time,

790
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,390
I would make the same choice.

791
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,100
I guess so.

792
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,395
You never regret your choice.

793
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,522
I thought you could understand me.

794
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,982
How could I understand you?

795
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,653
You even used Lee Seong-min's death
to become an assemblyman.

796
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,031
Anyone would've done the same,

797
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,615
and I did.

798
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,119
Then you should've done something.
You should've changed at least one thing.

799
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,496
You're still under
Minister Song Hui-seop's roof.

800
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,165
And you're just like them.

801
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,668
-Nothing's changed.
-That's not true.

802
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,212
You just don't want to admit it.

803
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,134
Don't worry about me.

804
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,822
Aren't you going home?

805
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,158
I still have some work to do.

806
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:16,122
Ms. Lee is a little difficult
to work with,

807
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,541
but you can learn a lot from her.

808
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,126
I know.

809
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,253
I want to start over

810
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,672
and learn from the bottom up.

811
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,175
I want to

812
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,552
show Assemblyman Jang that I'm not wrong.

813
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,057
And I want to show you as well.

814
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,768
I still remember

815
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,561
what you've told me.

816
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,357
Take care.

817
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,735
KANG SEON-YEONG

818
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,428
Hello, Ms. Lee.

819
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,388
You startled me.

820
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,642
Did you not go home?

821
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,144
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

822
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,397
I've finished revising the materials.

823
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,361
Here.

824
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:56,616
I think I told you
it's about directions, not speed.

825
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,331
Well...

826
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,833
This is better than the last one.

827
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,877
Is it okay?

828
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,632
Adjust your clothes and dry your hair.

829
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,842
Okay.

830
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,943
Like you said, I set a trap and it worked.

831
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,988
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

832
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:01,014
The Daehan Party has decided
to form the Emergency Planning Committee

833
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:04,851
and is having a meeting to elect
the chairperson in the Assembly today.

834
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,645
The new chairperson is expected

835
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,106
to have great influence
on the dynamics of the election

836
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,859
including the nomination system.

837
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,989
-Mr. Jo, the meeting is about to begin.
-How is it going?

838
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,825
It is turning in your favor already.

839
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,578
The members of the Supreme Council
have agreed to recommend you

840
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,829
as a chairperson.

841
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,457
That's good.

842
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,425
I'd like to have some tea
with you before the meeting.

843
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,763
Have a seat.

844
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,974
-Go and get ready.
-Yes, sir.

845
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,854
I guess it's true
things are turning in my favor.

846
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,565
I didn't expect to see you here.

847
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,444
-I guess it's too late though.
-I don't think it's too late.

848
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:30,895
My gosh.

849
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,026
You jerk.

850
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,946
What are you doing?

851
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,366
The trunk must've been quite heavy.

852
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,577
The chairperson is supposed to lead
renovation and change.

853
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,454
Do you think people will tolerate selling

854
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,748
-the right of nomination for money?
-What?

855
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,251
Are you saying I took bribes
for nominations?

856
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,919
All you have is just some photos.

857
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,588
We've got the statements from
the assemblymen who offered the money.

858
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,133
Don't even try to make an excuse.
It would just look ugly.

859
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,803
I've set up a press conference
at the press room.

860
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,515
Go ahead and do it. This isn't over.

861
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,766
It shouldn't be over.

862
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,102
You're the one
who will hold the press conference.

863
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,814
What are you talking about?
What press conference?

864
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,816
Your acceptance speech.

865
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,318
What?

866
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,404
Once you pull out your sword,
you should brandish it.

867
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,239
You can't use it as a cane.

868
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,910
I want you to be the chairperson.

869
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,664
What are you talking about?

870
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,500
I will keep the original safe.

871
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,045
Jang Tae-jun.

872
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,174
The news about Lee Sang-guk.

873
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,508
Is it your doing?

874
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,220
-I don't know.
-What are you thinking?

875
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,638
You'll have to wait and see.

876
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,931
Good luck

877
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,349
with your press conference.

878
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,613
That darn jerk is trying to
put me on a leash.

879
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,675
-Hello.
-Hello.

880
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,851
Assemblywoman Kang.

881
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,814
I have something to tell you.

882
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,871
The Daehan Party decided

883
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:57,041
to form the Emergency Planning Committee
for the upcoming legislative election

884
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,668
and has elected Assemblyman Jo

885
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,212
the chairperson during the meeting today.

886
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:06,175
I'm standing here feeling desperate
as if I'm at the end of my rope.

887
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,722
I can't believe the Daehan Party
with a long history and tradition

888
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,809
is going through
such unfortunate circumstances.

889
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,562
I feel utterly devastated...

890
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,105
Where's the remote control?

891
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,566
-Wait, sir.
-In such situations,

892
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:25,444
I feel truly burdened by the major task
I'm taking on

893
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:29,198
as the chairperson
of the Emergency Planning Committee.

894
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,289
The detective who was working
on Go Seok-man's case

895
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,375
confirmed the last person
Mr. Go met before his death.

896
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,442
The last person
Mr. Go met before his death

897
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,321
is Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun.

898
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,917
I can't crouch down and turn my face away.

899
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,967
In order to change the world,
you must break out of the shell.

900
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,219
Where's the remote control?

901
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,055
That darn bastard.

902
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,142
I can't believe I couldn't stop him.

903
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,520
My gosh. Damn it!

904
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,065
-Wait, Minister Song!
-Don't stop me!

905
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,651
-Sir, you'll injure yourself!
-Get out of my way!

906
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,694
Damn it.

907
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,031
Jo Gap-yeong, you idiot.

908
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,909
You son of a bitch.

909
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:59,080
I gave my everything to that damn idiot.

910
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,164
I gave my everything.

911
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,313
Even if I become
the prey of my natural enemy,

912
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,900
I have to

913
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,735
face the dirty world.

914
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,851
What could be Mr. Jang's intentions?

915
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,394
Unless you stop Ms. Kang,

916
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,730
all your plans will go awry.

917
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,524
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because you'll look at me that way.

918
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:11,027
What game is Mr. Jang playing?

919
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,069
You'll find out soon.

920
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,239
Could Jang Tae-jun have other intentions?

921
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,867
That sly prick stabbed me in the back.

922
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,702
You have guests in your office.

923
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,537
Special Investigation Team.

924
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,164
I'm Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol.

925
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,540
What are you going to do now?

926
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,252
Now that my fangs have been revealed,
it's time to tear him to pieces.

927
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,422
