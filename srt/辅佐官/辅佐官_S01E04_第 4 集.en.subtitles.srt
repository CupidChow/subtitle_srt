00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,021
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED

2
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,940
WITH ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,685
I told him to plow the field,

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,438
but that ox has been
planning something else.

5
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,441
Did that idiot forget who his owner is?

6
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,238
Who's your owner, idiot?

7
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,948
It's me. I'm your owner.

8
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,033
I'm your owner, you son of a bitch.

ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP

10
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:22,809
Small mistakes can ruin one's life.

11
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,106
You were enjoying your drink.
What's wrong?

12
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:39,659
There's this stupid ox
who won't listen to its owner.

13
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,082
JANG TAE-JUN

14
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:54,549
Mr. Lee, you know what we do
with an ox that won't do as it's told?

15
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,062
You put a nose ring on the ox
and drag it around.

16
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,273
That way, it won't go astray.

17
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:11,941
Yes.

18
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,613
Hold off Tae-jun's campaign club
for a while.

19
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,366
I can't put a saddle on him
before putting on the bridle.

20
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,118
Isn't that right?

21
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,912
Yes.

22
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,091
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP

23
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,854
One by one,

24
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,983
I built up everything, but it only takes
one moment for it to collapse.

25
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,853
You left your phone on the subway.

26
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,317
-Thank you.
-He must be an acquaintance.

27
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,697
He looks very ill. Are you all right?

28
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,865
It's none of your business.

29
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,617
Please excuse me.

30
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,798
ROOM 803, SHIN J GYEONG

31
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,969
LAUNDRY

32
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,722
A car suddenly falls
into the road by the harbor.

33
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,225
The car was passing by on the overpass
that was 100m above...

34
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,894
What's so interesting?
Why are you staring at me?

35
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,521
Because I'm proud of you.

36
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,025
You've been out studying so late.
You finally came to your senses.

37
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,819
You'll surely pass
this civil service exam.

38
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,947
You've never really
concentrated on your studies.

39
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,326
But I know you're very smart
because you take after me. Right?

40
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,661
Right.

41
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,624
Mom, if I fail the exam again,

42
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,626
I'm thinking of going
into a different field.

43
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,587
Like what?

44
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,466
Well, you know, if I fail. As a plan B.

45
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,638
You know, if you fail,
I'll kill you and kill myself too.

46
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
Stop talking nonsense.

47
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,018
There is no better job
than a civil servant in this day and age.

48
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,603
Next on the news.

49
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,563
-During this year's audit...
-I'm just saying.

50
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,273
Bugang Electronics' unfair dismissal

51
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,734
-became the hot potato.
-I can't believe this nonsense.

52
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,278
They're always fighting
and wasting my tax money.

53
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,698
Darn it. I don't know
how this country is still going strong.

54
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,242
The audit began with a battle
over choosing the witness.

55
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,660
Eat up.

56
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,245
You're eating so well.

57
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,373
Although they chose CEO Lee Chang-jin

58
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,167
of Joojin Chemical,
who illegally transferred the company...

INTERN HAN DO-GYEONG

64
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,706
It's none of your business.

65
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,583
Please excuse me.

SHIN JAE-GYEONG BROUGHT UP
SAFETY ISSUES, YET IGNORED

72
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,990
Yes, it was "Shin Jae-gyeong."

73
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,037
"Yun Hye-won"? "Reporter Yun Hye-won"?

74
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,418
Ms. Yun?

75
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,965
He reacted so emotionally. This is a mess.

76
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,554
You even steal now?

77
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,431
Stealing?

78
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,058
If you had such an important thing,
you should have kept it well.

79
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,394
Mr. Song went home.

80
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,189
Hey, Tae-jun.

81
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,983
It's great that you're diligent,
but don't work too hard.

82
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,903
You and I are
nothing but those old men's servants.

83
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,404
We bite and crawl on their order.

84
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,907
That's how we can get something from them.

85
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,909
-I just feel bad for you.
-What are you doing?

86
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,453
Don't call him until he looks for you.

87
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,081
He's in a foul mood right now.

88
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,587
Go take a good shower
and pull yourself together.

89
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,391
SUAN SAUNA

90
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,774
I'm almost done.

91
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,568
His testimony is rather detailed,

92
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,404
so we could definitely make
a counterattack against Mr. Park.

93
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,240
I'll expose this at the press conference.

94
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,783
Can you delay that a little?

95
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,702
-What's going on?
-I'll tell you in person.

96
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,995
Kim In-gyu is

97
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,331
my final card.

98
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,918
I need him.

99
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay. I'll wait here.

100
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,923
Okay.

101
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,843
This year's
Inspection of State Administration

102
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,179
came to an end
after today's General Inspection.

103
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,682
During the audit
of the Judiciary Committee,

104
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,268
the Minister of Justice was
held responsible for perjury.

105
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,562
Mr. Park attended
the General Inspection and denied

106
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,106
his charges for delaying
the investigation of Bugang Electronics

107
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,483
by giving pressure
to the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

108
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,859
It looks like he is responsible

109
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,487
with the exposure of new evidence
of his regular meetings...

110
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,949
-Mr. Song, one second, please.
-We'll talk later. Where's Mr. An?

111
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,201
-I told him to come to the restaurant.
-Let's go.

112
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,372
Follow me in your car.
You'll see something interesting.

113
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,010
-Where's Seon-yeong?
-She isn't in the office,

114
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,430
and Mr. Go has been avoiding my calls.

115
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,765
Find her.
Find her and tell her to come in now!

116
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,142
Yes, sir.

117
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,445
Why is Mr. An here?

118
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,196
He's the guy

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,616
who handed over
Mr. Song's files to Mr. Jo.

120
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,286
I found the source
of the flash drive that you had.

121
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,289
Go inside.

122
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,421
-It's Jang Tae-jun.
-Come in.

123
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,101
Mr. Song...

124
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,815
Mr. An.

125
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,069
I told you that I'll find you an office
at a proper time. Didn't I?

126
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,489
How dare you go around my back
and talk to Jo Gap-yeong?

127
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,032
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,451
I must have lost my mind.

129
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,120
Well, you better go find it now.

130
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,836
Do you know what I threw away first
when I became an assemblyman?

131
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,505
My sense of shame.

132
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,841
You can be in politics
only after throwing that out.

133
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,079
Who do you think is the most pitiful
type of people in the world?

134
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,332
Penniless ones with good brains.

135
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,378
Despite having anything,

136
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,839
they kid themselves thinking
they achieved everything on their own.

137
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,258
It doesn't matter if you're an ox
or a man.

138
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,094
You'll only come to your senses
when you're starving.

139
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,257
Right.

140
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,720
What happened to the team leader
of Bugang's Finance Team?

141
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,263
Was his name Kim In-gyu?

142
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,265
Yes, we're taking his testimony right now.

143
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,100
I'll deal with him as soon as she's done.

144
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,478
-Did you say Ms. Kang is with him?
-Yes.

145
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,689
Kim In-gyu is the core witness
of Mr. Park's corruption.

146
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,566
We need to use him to destroy a minister.

147
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,359
Are you sure you can leave him with her?

148
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,028
Ms. Kang is trustworthy.

149
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,613
No one is trustworthy around here!

150
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,325
Everyone tries to get ahead of you
whenever they see a weakness, don't they?

151
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,786
Mr. Song.

152
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,623
I kept the flash drive
to find out who wrote the files.

153
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,209
But I should have consulted you first.
I apologize.

154
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,211
I know.

155
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,839
These things can happen while you work.

156
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,092
I doubt you'd stab me
in the back like that.

157
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,094
I trust you.

158
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,557
If I don't trust you,
how can I hand over my position to you?

159
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,601
-Isn't that so?
-Yes.

160
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,438
I need to see Kim In-gyu.

161
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,398
There's no need for you to do that.

162
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,108
I'll take care of...

163
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,110
Where is Kang Seon-yeong?

164
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,577
Great work.

165
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,458
I called the prosecution.
They'll take this into regard.

166
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,253
Thank you.

167
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,716
-What about the press release?
-The secretary is putting it together.

168
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,301
Once this is released,

169
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,720
you'll be recognized
by everyone in no time.

170
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,639
We need to end this well.

171
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,684
KIM HYEONG-DO

172
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,728
I keep getting calls from Mr. Jo's office.
What should I do?

173
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,356
-What about Jungil-gu's budget?
-It went in at 2 p.m.

174
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,525
Once it passes, we'll get a call.

175
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,902
Stall for more time
until the budget proposal is passed.

176
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,905
-I can't let Mr. Jo ruin this.
-Yes.

177
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,949
-Let's wrap up.
-Okay.

178
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,000
MR. OH:
MS. KANG IS WITH MR. KIM

179
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,042
What?

180
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,796
Mr. Jo, I found out where Ms. Kang is.

181
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,382
-Where is she?
-She's at Hotel Chantier.

182
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,176
And she's with Kim In-gyu.

183
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,595
What?

184
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,722
Turn the car around!

185
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,438
That must be Mr. Jang.

186
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,961
What brings you here, Mr. Song?

187
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,631
Is he Kim In-gyu?

188
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,094
-Did you get his testimony?
-Yes.

189
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,139
It'll be a huge blow for Mr. Park

190
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,391
when I disclose this
at the press conference.

191
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,479
You did so much for me,
so I'm worried about you.

192
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,899
If you disclose this yourself,

193
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,318
Jo Gap-yeong will find out
that you helped me out.

194
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,779
Do you think he'll leave you alone?

195
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,198
I'll take that.

196
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,700
I can't let you keep
something this dangerous.

197
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,452
I'll take good care of it.

198
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,287
-Won-sik.
-Yes.

199
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,792
Mr. Song, but we prepared this.

200
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,503
I don't think it's right
for you to take this.

201
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,297
You don't think it's right?

202
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,134
Ms. Kang, I thought you were on my side.

203
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,511
That's what I thought.

204
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,015
I am.

205
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,311
Give it to him.

206
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,816
-I got it.
-Good.

207
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,610
In that case, I need to put a seal on you

208
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,280
that proves you're on my side.

209
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,995
ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG

210
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,916
Yes, Mr. Jo.

211
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,293
I'll call you again.

212
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,297
Mr. Jo, it's this room.

213
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,907
You were plotting against me
in a place like this?

214
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,452
So, you've been digging a pit for me?

215
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,620
You ungrateful brat. I got you here.

216
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,038
Mr. Kim.

217
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,750
How did you find us?

218
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,251
Gosh, you're so slow.

219
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,754
Hey, do you still not get it?

220
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,175
Mr. Oh told us where you were, you fool.

221
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,469
So why did you keep on changing sides?

222
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,807
Ms. Kang is finished.

223
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,142
What will you do now?

224
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,153
Oxen who won't listen to their owner

225
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,032
need to be branded by fire
to make sure they don't run away.

226
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,287
Let me see.

227
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,622
Hey, you're branded.

228
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,708
All right, let's go.

229
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
Mr. Song.

230
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,714
Please let me wrap this up. I'll do it.

231
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,007
It's okay.

232
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,509
I'll manage.

233
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,554
Instead of that, you should
go down to the district office.

234
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,140
-What?
-Things are pretty tough there, right?

235
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,057
Yes.

236
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,476
It's the redevelopment of Seobuk Market.

237
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,311
They can't seem to settle.

238
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,063
Please go take care of that.

239
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,065
It was beyond my capacity.

240
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,318
But the minister nomination is still--

241
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,114
I'll manage that, so don't worry about it.

242
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,491
-Mr. Song.
-It's a troublesome issue.

243
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,535
Who else can manage something like this?

244
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,745
You know
Lee Chang-jin is in charge of that.

245
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,709
You should convince the merchants
so that they don't get offended.

246
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,087
You know, hold their hands and stuff.
And you can use this chance

247
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,090
to take a good look around the district.

248
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,429
Mr. Song.

249
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,308
Stop being so desperate.

250
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,268
This isn't like you.

251
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,499
Ms. Kang.

252
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,628
The budget proposal got rejected.

253
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,484
The door is closing.

254
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,288
-Did you pick up the mail?
-Yes.

255
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,206
Here you go.

256
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,334
Did something happen?

257
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,171
-The reshuffle season has begun.
-The reshuffle season?

258
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,548
Many staff transfers happen
after every annual audit.

259
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,300
If the results aren't good,

260
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,052
assemblymen replace their entire staff.

261
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,055
Then where do those people go?

262
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,766
They're getting kicked out,
so they have nowhere to go.

263
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,184
They'll find something else.

264
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,311
We get discarded
the moment we become useless.

265
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,813
We're like mayflies.

266
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,774
The average length of employment here
is less than five years.

267
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,735
That's how competitive this field is.

268
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,655
Darn it.

269
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,249
Do-gyeong. Log on to the system and print
the document on the administration bill.

270
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,919
Pardon me? "The administration bill"?

271
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,423
-Do you know how to access our intranet?
-No.

272
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,968
But if you teach me, I'll do it.

273
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,804
-Anyone can do it if they're taught.
-Yes, okay.

274
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:48,974
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

275
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,935
Show this guy how to access our intranet.

276
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,105
Make some time to train him.
Who else will do it if you don't?

277
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:59,151
Okay. Mr. Han, come and have a seat here.

278
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,152
Okay.

279
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,033
Hit the control key twice
or right-click on your mouse two times,

280
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,617
and you can log in.

281
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,662
You probably won't get a username
for a while, so use mine for now.

282
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,789
Now, you know how to log in, right?

283
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,919
Yes, hit the control key
or right-click on the mouse twice.

284
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,672
Then would you mind
going back to your desk?

285
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,215
I have a lot to do.

286
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,094
Here, have a seat.

287
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,433
Hello, Seung-u. I went through the e-mail.

288
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,394
Our stance on the whistle-blower
is reflected,

289
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,188
but it doesn't say anything
about the bill.

290
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,983
Yes. It'd be good to allude
to the fact that we may need

291
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,693
to revise the bill.

292
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,696
Yes, thank you. I'll be in touch.

293
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,909
Ms. Yun.

294
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,704
Were you a journalist?

295
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,249
-Sorry?
-I read the article you wrote.

296
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,293
The man at the hospital yesterday...

297
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,796
Isn't he the one who blew the whistle
on Hanjang Constructions?

298
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,255
Shin Jae-gyeong, right?

299
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,717
I read up on some of
the past whistle-blower cases,

300
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,095
and I think there's a way we can help him.

301
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,263
There's a program that provides
financial assistance for

302
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,307
living expenses, medical bills,
and scholarships.

303
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,684
I wanted to see if he's eligible
for the program.

304
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,644
Mr. Han.

305
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,271
Yes.

306
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,149
I told you
that it's none of your business.

307
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,487
Well, I just want to help.

308
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,863
We should look for ways to...

309
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,077
I've already tried looking
for every possible way to help him.

310
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,622
Stop worrying about things like this
and focus on your tasks.

311
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,761
I know you worked so hard all night.
I'm really sorry.

312
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,304
You had no choice.

313
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,226
I would've done the same thing
if I were you.

314
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,899
I guess I underestimated Mr. Song.

315
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,652
I mean, he was a prosecutor,
and this is his fourth term.

316
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,280
I've worked so hard for him.

317
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,323
He doesn't have the minister title yet.

318
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,784
The Blue House still needs to vet
and officially appoint him.

319
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,246
There are many variables,
so he probably still needs you.

320
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,247
He knows that too.

321
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,126
That's why he took the file on Kim In-gyu.

322
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,879
He'll try to strike a deal
with the minister using it.

323
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,840
Look at these dragons
engraved on his nameplate.

324
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,886
I'm here to check out the office
of the Minister of Justice.

325
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,262
When you're house hunting,

326
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,724
you must do a thorough check to make sure
there's nothing wrong with the house.

327
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,933
Since it'll be your home.

328
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,936
You're talking

329
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,898
as if you've already been appointed.

330
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,400
Well, it'll probably happen soon.

331
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,700
Sir.

332
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,162
The statement for the press conference
is ready.

333
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,253
This looks good, but it's missing a word.

334
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,132
Let's see.

335
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,135
Pass me a pen.

336
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,471
Let me borrow your pen.

337
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,307
Okay, thanks.

338
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,559
Right here...

339
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,397
RESIGN

340
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,569
I think...

341
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,197
"Resign."

342
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,618
I think it'll look better with this word.

343
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,120
Enough, Mr. Song.

344
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,414
"Enough"? Look who's talking.

345
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,292
You shouldn't be
in another person's position this long!

346
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,045
The prosecution will make sure
Kim In-gyu doesn't talk,

347
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,713
but who's going to silence me?

348
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,340
Who can dare to do it?

349
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,806
When you're revising your statement,
you should take a look at this as well.

350
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,141
It'll tell you what else you should add

351
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,686
if you wish to avoid further humiliation.

352
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,565
It'll also tell you whom you should be
recommending as your replacement.

353
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,275
If this is troublesome for you,

354
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,611
then shall I go meet
with the Chief Presidential Secretary?

355
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,121
The tea is already cold.

356
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,332
I'll give you a few days.

357
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,669
Take your time and think it over,
Mr. Park.

358
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,426
This table...
Jeez, this doesn't suit my taste.

359
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,972
Oh, boy. This table should be...

360
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,727
The Minister of Justice is
at the forefront of the government reform.

361
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,228
If he is ruined like this,

362
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,814
all the reform bills won't pass.

363
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,859
The Blue House
won't want to take such a risk.

364
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,486
That's why he's trying to cut a deal now.

365
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,905
Then I guess Mr. Song
will get what he wants.

366
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,576
-What about you though?
-If things pan out like this,

367
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,330
I have no idea what to expect.

368
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,501
I suppose Assemblyman Song
got us under his thumb.

369
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,100
The door is closing

370
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
I thought the audit would make him a star,

371
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,524
but that damn sign ruined it all.

372
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,693
Damn. And it's still causing us
such a headache.

373
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,403
Is this office cursed or what?

374
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,280
Every assemblyman here
encounters a mishap.

375
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,492
Shall we work for someone else?

376
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,995
Mr. Lee is a good person though.

377
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,330
What are you saying?

378
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,293
-What brings you by?
-Is Mr. Lee here?

379
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,253
He's visiting the district. What's up?

380
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,881
It's nothing. Have a good day.

381
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,514
Mr. Jang.

382
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,601
This is Mr. Song's schedule
for this week. There are some changes.

383
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,061
Wait.

384
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,771
You can give it to me.

385
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,733
Starting today,
you can submit all your reports to me.

386
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,569
Mr. Jang will work in the district office
for a short while.

387
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,742
I can use your desk
while you're gone, right?

388
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,578
That room is a bit cold
because it doesn't get much sun.

389
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,167
Sure, go ahead.

390
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,922
You should go through these.

391
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,175
They're important events
he needs to attend.

392
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,720
And these reports are awaiting approval.

393
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,389
And...

394
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,684
What? Go on.

395
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,313
The leaflets for the committee are here,

396
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,316
and all the documents for this term
are organized here.

397
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,361
Ms. Yun and Ms. No, prepare the rest of--

398
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,363
Okay, I heard you.

399
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,823
I'll figure out the rest.

400
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,242
You should rush
to attend the briefing at 4 p.m.

401
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,286
I prepared all the materials for you.

402
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,497
All right, then.

403
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,422
You should take him too.

404
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,341
You'll have a lot of work to do,
so I feel bad sending you alone.

405
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,136
-Hey, Do-gyeong.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,847
Go work at the district office
with Mr. Jang.

407
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,557
-You can do that, right?
-Me?

408
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,977
Even just as an intern, you need to learn
how things are done there.

409
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,688
Stay glued to Mr. Jang
and learn as much as you can.

410
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,899
Understood, sir.

411
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,651
If there are any problems,
let me know right away.

412
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,737
Yes, sir.

413
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,000
What's all this stuff? Jeez.

414
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
What's going on?

415
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,464
Why are you going to the district office?

416
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,673
I'll be back soon.

417
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,510
Keep me updated on Mr. Song's situation.

418
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,889
-On what Mr. Oh is up to as well.
-Got it.

419
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,516
I'm ready.

420
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,810
-What are you doing?
-I'll drive, sir.

421
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,437
-Sit on the other side.
-Oh, okay.

422
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,945
See you.

423
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,701
Drive safely.

424
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,711
-Sir, wait.
-What?

425
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,340
You need to tell me what's going on
so that we can be prepared.

426
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,385
What can I do? It's the mayor's order.

427
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,512
Stop following me already.

428
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,430
I have nothing else to tell you.

429
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,557
Sir, please.

430
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,227
Well, the budget
for the lone-parent project is one thing.

431
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,730
But suddenly cut the support fund
for the center?

432
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,732
Sir.

433
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,526
Sir!

434
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,447
Sir, shall I follow you around like this
all day long?

435
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,908
Let me focus, will you?

436
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,827
Jeez, you're too much.

437
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,663
Please help us focus on our work.

438
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,747
Gosh...

439
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,083
Sir.

440
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,543
Goodness.

441
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,925
The Jungil-gu Office had budget cuts,

442
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,219
so they're saying they can't give us
any more support.

443
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,679
If they completely pull support,

444
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,848
we won't even be able to feed the kids.

445
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,392
I'll do everything in my power to help.

446
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,936
Don't worry too much.

447
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:41,482
Ms. Kang, Jungil-gu will continue to
provide support until the end of the year,

448
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,651
but things may change next year.

449
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,070
We'll work on next year's budget.

450
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,823
Thank you for all your hard work.

451
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,366
Thank you.

452
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,912
Tell the reporters not to bother the kids

453
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,955
and to focus more on the facility itself.

454
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,332
Yes, ma'am.

455
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,792
-You all heard that, right?
-Yes.

456
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,587
Thank you so much. My gosh.

457
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,506
We really appreciate it.

458
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,175
BE HEALTHY AND STRONG

459
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,218
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO ME, MY BABY

460
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,137
MY DREAM IS TO GO TO COLLEGE
SHIN SU-MIN

461
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,680
Is this person new?

462
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,808
Yes, her name is Shin Su-min.
She came here a week ago.

463
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,311
I told you not to let anyone in!

464
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,368
She's being extra sensitive,
knowing that the reporters are here.

465
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,536
The mayor of Jungil-gu
visited our center last month.

466
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,164
Su-min's face appeared
on the news that day,

467
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,458
and her family came to see her
because of it.

468
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,585
I had no idea.

469
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,425
Please don't use any of the photos
that you took today.

470
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:50,843
I apologize.

471
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,929
We'll send you a press release.

472
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,597
We're sorry.

473
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,225
Please understand.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

474
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,564
May I go in quickly and meet her?

475
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,859
We should've been more careful.

476
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,820
My apologies.

477
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,502
So, how many weeks?

478
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,129
Just take your pictures and leave.

479
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,422
Stop bothering me.

480
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,465
You don't like that I'm here, right?

481
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,094
Did you think everyone here
would welcome you with a big smile?

482
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,179
You only act as if you care.

483
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,390
You're here to take such photos
so that you can use us.

484
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,684
You're such a hypocrite.

485
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,603
You're right.

486
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,356
I am here to use you, indeed.

487
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,316
Like you said,

488
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,236
I'll tell everyone
that I visited this center today.

489
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,447
And I'll use that to secure funding.

490
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,658
Sure, I suppose it could look fake.

491
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,244
But it's my job.

492
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,413
You can criticize me.

493
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,499
I'm here to listen.

494
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,252
You're pissing me off.

495
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,631
You should use me as well, Su-min.

496
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,926
The things that you want to do
and the challenges that you have.

497
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,345
We can help you with them.

498
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,477
How about we think
that we're helping each other?

499
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,562
I'm not here to kill time.

500
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,230
I'm here because I truly want to help.

501
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,194
I totally mean it.

502
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,657
REDEVELOPMENT OF SEOBUK MARKET

503
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,037
Because of Seobuk Market,

504
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,873
I read up on the past redevelopment cases
of traditional markets.

505
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,959
In many cases, the projects got delayed
because of the conflicts

506
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,670
between the building owners' association
and the vendors.

507
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,714
There's a case like that
in Seongjin City too.

508
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,342
Can we have some silence?

509
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,595
Yes, sir.

510
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,565
The Minister of Justice
hasn't released an official statement yet,

511
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,275
but according to Blue House officials,

512
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,236
they are preparing to appoint
his successor,

513
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,987
and Assemblyman Song Hui-seop,

514
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,157
who made notable contributions
to the audit, is one of the candidates.

515
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,201
Assemblyman Song
worked as a prosecutor for years,

516
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,994
and since the 17th legislative election...

517
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,663
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP'S
DISTRICT OFFICE

518
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,754
-Hello, it's been a while.
-Hello.

519
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,590
How have you been?

520
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,094
Hello. I'm Han Do-gyeong, an intern.

521
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,428
I'm Lee Jin-a.

522
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,019
Where are the materials
for the Seobuk Market briefing?

523
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,230
I put it over there.

524
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,820
REDEVELOPMENT OF SEOBUK MARKET

525
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,618
So...

526
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,121
-Is this all you prepared?
-Yes.

527
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,466
Let's clean first.

528
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,676
Yes, sir.

529
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,430
Then how are we supposed to do business
while the building is going up?

530
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,016
The wait won't be long.

531
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,809
When the new building is completed,

532
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,728
your numbers will go up.

533
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,188
Must you really make all this fuss?

534
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,773
You're saying that
because you own the building.

535
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,193
You'll raise the rent
when the building is completed!

536
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,905
Then we won't be able to afford our rent!
You selfish jerks!

537
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,406
Please calm down!

538
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,491
The permit has already been issued.

539
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,077
You're causing a lot of trouble
for us here.

540
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,247
Someone from Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's
office is coming, so listen to--

541
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,999
Listen to what?

542
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,294
How much did you get paid
to talk such bullshit?

543
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,588
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

544
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,758
Oh, boy. What is happening now?

545
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,552
They won't even listen. It's a hot mess.

546
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,554
They're doing this
to get more compensation.

547
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,639
It's so obvious.

548
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,432
The majority approved of this matter!

549
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,143
-Why do this now...
-That's bullshit!

550
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,312
Mr. Jang.

551
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,565
You know that many local notables
have invested in this project.

552
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,692
We need to start the construction.

553
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,444
Yes, let's get this sorted out together.

554
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,113
Over there!
Assemblyman Song's chief of staff is here.

555
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,949
Let go of him, please.

556
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,742
-Oh, there he is.
-Is it that guy?

557
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,994
That man over there
works in the local office.

558
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,705
That guy leads the vendor association.
He's a handful.

559
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,499
Why isn't Mr. Song here?

560
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,501
What? You're his chief of staff?

561
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,880
He shook our hands and begged us
to vote for him before.

562
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,092
Where's the assemblyman that
promised us to revive traditional markets?

563
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,552
He couldn't make it.
I'm here on his behalf.

564
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,096
I'm his chief of staff, Jang Tae-jun.

565
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,889
So, you're a nobody.

566
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,017
You don't even know what's going on.
How are you going to help us?

567
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,061
Where is Assemblyman Song?

568
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,146
-Bring him!
-Please let go of him.

569
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,691
-Go bring him!
-We're...

570
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,611
We're looking for ways
to compensate all of you properly.

571
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,155
We're looking for a temporary site
where you can continue

572
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,949
with your business
during the construction.

573
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,493
-We can also support--
-Don't lie to my face!

574
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,370
Do you think I'm an idiot?

575
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,331
Even in Seongjin City, all the vendors
ended up getting kicked out!

576
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,583
How are you going to resolve this?

577
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,087
-We want a solution!
-No, don't do this!

578
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,008
Are you all right, sir?

579
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,218
Here, sir.

580
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,979
Here's your wallet.

581
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,897
Thank you.

582
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,025
Cheer up.

583
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,206
Sir, I’ll try my best to deal with
the neighborhood's noise complaints

584
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,293
at the public hearing.

585
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,836
Goodbye, then.

586
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,632
We even have to deal
with noise complaints now?

587
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,886
It's also our job to help the residents
communicate with each other.

588
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,304
Okay, sir.

589
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,934
What are you doing here?

590
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,687
I dropped by on my way
to the district office.

591
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,148
-Hello, Mr. Lee.
-Hey.

592
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,443
You're the thief who stole our file.

593
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,527
Yes.

594
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,198
My name is Han Do-gyeong.
I'm so sorry about what happened.

595
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,702
It's okay.

596
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,538
You have to make mistakes
in order to learn.

597
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,248
He used to be a lot worse than you.

598
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,125
No one had anything good to say about him.

599
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,251
Really? Mr. Jang?

600
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,045
I hired him
when I was a secretary officer.

601
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,130
My gosh, cut it out.

602
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,133
-Go and wait for me in the car.
-Okay.

603
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,051
Bye.

604
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,309
Looking at him reminds me of

605
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,728
back when we used to work so hard

606
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,772
at the district office.

607
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,733
Back then, you were just a kid.

608
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,153
You sound like an old man.
Why do you keep talking about the past?

609
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,448
I heard you agreed to compensate.

610
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,158
I'm sure it'll cost a lot.

611
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,370
-Where will you get all that money?
-I put my house up as collateral.

612
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,206
What? That's the only thing you own.

613
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,542
You should've asked the NFS
to do an investigation.

614
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,627
You didn't even tell Ms. Kang about this,
did you?

615
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,587
My gosh, you are so stubborn.

616
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,797
My goodness.

617
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,591
Why are you taking out
your frustration on me?

618
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,516
Seobuk Market isn't easy, is it?

619
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,060
But don't push ahead with it too much.

620
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,146
The business has been on hold
for three years.

621
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,731
If we don't deal with it fast,
it'll only cause bigger damage.

622
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,858
So what?

623
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,026
You're actually going to proceed with it?

624
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,862
What other choice do we have?

625
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,613
At this rate, both sides will suffer.

626
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,490
Partial damage is inevitable

627
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,868
for the development and benefit
of the district.

628
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,035
Tae-jun.

629
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,123
I know you need to get support
from the local big shots

630
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,169
in order to get nominated
as a candidate for Uigwang City.

631
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,462
But...

632
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,966
it'd be nice if you didn't focus on that
just this once.

633
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,470
You may think it's partial,
but that is everything to them.

634
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,598
People who own a lot don't collapse
just because they lose one thing.

635
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,224
But when it comes to them,

636
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,059
that one thing is equivalent
to everything.

637
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,354
The amount of pressure
is completely different to them.

638
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,564
I know that.

639
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,483
And that shouldn't happen.

640
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,985
But is there a way to satisfy
both parties?

641
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,403
No.

642
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,322
Politics exists
for the good of the people.

643
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,116
If you focus on that,
you'll be able to find a way.

644
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,243
I may not have found the answer,

645
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,287
but I'm sure you'll be able to.

646
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,497
What are you talking about?

647
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,249
Why are you making me do something
you couldn't even do yourself?

648
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,667
I really shouldn't have come.

649
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,253
You did nothing but mess with my head.
I'll be off.

650
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,553
Welcome back.

651
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,971
Thanks.

652
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,147
-Hello?
-I heard the presentation was a mess.

653
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,733
You really should've been better prepared.

654
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,026
Did you read what I sent you?

655
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,569
I'm sure it'll be of help.

656
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,071
What do you want?

657
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,907
You're so cold-hearted.
I called because I was worried.

658
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,659
Mr. Song wanted me to tell you

659
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,953
that you can come back
once you deal with Seobuk Market.

660
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,413
But then again, that could take forever.

661
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,166
Darn it.

662
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,794
Mr. Jang.

663
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,005
What should I do
with the presentation materials?

664
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,590
Throw them out.

665
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,301
-We're going to make new ones.
-Okay.

666
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,972
Organize the opinions of the union members

667
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,182
and the merchants
regarding the reconstruction.

668
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,518
Give him the materials
you’ve gathered until now.

669
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,727
Okay.

670
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,566
Thank you.

671
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,861
Mr. Jang, I noticed
that a lot of the merchants are

672
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,614
constantly uploading complaints
on the official city website.

673
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,241
Should I include them as well?

674
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,578
-Sure, go ahead.
-Okay, sir.

675
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,045
We worked so hard to get this interview.

676
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,922
It's sad that we must
pass it over like this.

677
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,967
We can always schedule another interview.

678
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,302
Well, yes.

679
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,388
But I don't get why you need
to accompany Mr. Song as well.

680
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,725
He has me over a barrel,
so there's nothing I can do.

681
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,104
-Mr. Song.
-My goodness.

682
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,732
That's a very pretty necktie.

683
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,191
It'll come out great on camera.

684
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,569
I should listen to you
since you're the professional.

685
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,781
People should follow what professionals
tell them to do without questioning them.

686
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,575
But for some unknown reason,

687
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,118
they just don't listen.

688
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,290
The interview will proceed
based on the questionnaire.

689
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,418
But it's a live show, so there might be
a few unexpected questions.

690
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,630
Ms. Kim enjoys embarrassing assemblymen
and assemblywomen.

691
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,506
Really? I see.

692
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,469
And here you go, sir.

693
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,889
It's the women's project
I told you about last time.

694
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,516
Jungil-gu is in charge of the project,

695
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,853
but I'm having a hard time
due to a problem with the budget.

696
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,188
Oh, I see.

697
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,940
You're trying to do something good here,
so I should help you out.

698
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,317
You can plan a new budget

699
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,361
by making this a project
of the National Assembly.

700
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,403
I'll help you out,

701
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,864
so try sorting things out
with the budget committee.

702
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,825
Thank you, sir.

703
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,953
-Let's go now.
-Yes, let's go.

704
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,123
-Bye, sir.
-See you.

705
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:32,961
Hello.

706
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,184
How's everything?

707
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,353
Mr. Song went to the broadcasting station

708
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,230
with Ms. Kang to do an interview.

709
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,565
Ms. Kang's helping him build
a public image.

710
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,025
He needs to build a kind image

711
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,111
in order to get nominated as the minister.

712
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,196
What's Mr. Oh up to?

713
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:02,116
He's meeting the chairperson
of the Judiciary Committee.

714
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,202
-Chairperson Lee?
-Yes, Chairperson Lee.

715
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,704
With Mr. Jo out of the picture,

716
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,831
he's the most influential person
in the party.

717
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,167
He's going to make him recommend Mr. Song
with the support of the ruling party.

718
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,753
Then he'll offer Chairperson Lee
the floor leader position.

719
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,296
Floor leader?

720
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,508
Yes, you'd obviously be
the most suitable person for the position

721
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,051
once Mr. Song becomes the minister.

722
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,097
Please don't forget
that I'm the one who recommended you

723
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,348
to Mr. Song.

724
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,933
You scratch my back,

725
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,185
and I'll scratch yours.

726
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,187
Yes, sir.

727
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,357
Mr. Oh is changing everything you planned.

728
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,527
He doesn't even share the contents
of his meetings with Mr. Song.

729
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,195
If things keep going this way,

730
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,448
you and I both won't be
able to do anything.

731
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,368
How are things going with Seobuk Market?

732
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,663
Not easy.

733
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,207
I'll check Mr. Song's schedule
and send you the changes.

734
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,292
Okay.

735
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,960
I'll talk to you later.

736
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,513
During the audit,
you revealed the connection

737
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,141
between the Minister of Justice
and Bugang Electronics.

738
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,477
You were picked as Best Assemblyperson
of the Audit.

739
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,604
And many people will agree
that you stood out.

740
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,897
I'd like to ask if you have

741
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,900
a certain set of principles
regarding how you engage in the audit.

742
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,111
Our people's tax is what pays this job,

743
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,156
so I should do my best to make sure
they don't think I'm a waste of money.

744
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,409
I always try my best to reveal
the unknown truth

745
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,870
and get rid of whatever that's wrong.

746
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,997
That's my mindset
in how I engage in the audit.

747
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,000
But I also recall that you suffered
from some trouble

748
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,878
due to the comment you made
about women during the regular meeting.

749
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,256
You told Assemblywoman Jeong to go home
and raise kids if she doesn't want to work

750
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,969
and that she does nothing
but look in the mirror and fix her makeup.

751
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,429
Do you remember that, sir?

752
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,848
Gosh, that's a strong one.

753
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,183
"Fix her makeup."

754
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,603
Of course, he remembers.

755
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,646
Right.

756
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,981
Have you talked to Ms. Jeong?

757
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,900
Yes, she said she's going to send Mr. Song

758
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,693
to the ethics committee.

759
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,362
Do everything you can

760
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,863
to help her.

761
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,114
Yes, sir.

762
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,536
I'm not dumb enough to let him beat me up.

763
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,668
I'd appreciate it
if you'd look at things more generally

764
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,129
instead of only focusing
on partial things.

765
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,215
But what I said was wrong,

766
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,802
and I was very thoughtless back then.

767
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,846
You already apologized for what happened,

768
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,223
but some people questioned your sincerity.

769
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,058
Yes, of course.

770
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:36,228
When someone apologizes,
it also means they will make sure

771
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,313
not to make the same mistake ever again.

772
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,733
But the assemblymen and women
of our country always apologize

773
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,443
without sincerely meaning it.

774
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:47,155
That's what makes the people so angry.

775
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,950
Therefore, I would like to learn
from my past mistake

776
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,286
and act on my words
instead of just making empty promises.

777
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,872
And I will prove that by making policies
that can benefit people

778
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,332
in their everyday lives.

779
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,502
You just said you'll prove yourself
by making good policies.

780
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,380
Are there any policies regarding women
that you're planning to do?

781
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,300
Yes, of course.

782
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,302
As you already know,

783
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,388
Jungil-gu has the largest ratio of women

784
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,764
in Seoul City.

785
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,517
Therefore, I'm currently
planning a project with Jungil-gu

786
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,479
that can help and support women.

787
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,607
-Ms. Kang.
-Can you be more specific?

788
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,737
First of all, the most urgent issue
is to create a good labor policy.

789
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,073
I am planning to introduce
good quality jobs to women

790
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,118
and increase the employment of women
in that area.

791
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:36,997
And I'm also planning a project
for women who have trouble working

792
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,916
even though there are jobs for them.

793
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,420
A typical example is to increase
the support for single-parent families.

794
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,632
And...

795
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,178
Assemblyman Song Hui-seop
of the Daehan Party promised

796
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,263
to do his best in making policies
for women.

797
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,892
He will increase the support
for single-parent families in Jungil-gu

798
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,187
and said he will aim to make Korea
a country that's free of discriminations.

799
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,190
Jungil-gu has the highest ratio
of single-parent families...

800
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,692
-Hey.
-Can we meet for a second?

801
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,779
-Where are you?
-In front of your office.

802
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,323
What?

803
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,665
Okay, just a second.

804
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,045
You guys can go home now.

805
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,463
You too, Jin-a.

806
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,048
See you tomorrow, sir.

807
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,132
Bye.

808
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,551
See you.

809
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:32,970
Bye.

810
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,684
Mr. Jang, are you in your office?

811
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,601
No, I'm outside.

812
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,353
I'm meeting someone.

813
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,439
What's up?

814
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,149
Is there a problem?

815
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,652
No, it's not a big deal.

816
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,320
I'll call you again.

817
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,613
Okay.

818
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,805
Why did you come all the way here?

819
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,974
Because I'm stressed.

820
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,726
I tend to feel a little better

821
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,478
when I meet you.

822
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,694
The Minister of Justice will make
an announcement tomorrow.

823
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,157
I think he decided to resign.

824
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,534
If Mr. Song gets appointed
as the minister,

825
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,537
I might end up having to stay here.

826
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,039
Just like the past four years.

827
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:46,084
It's not like he's set to become
the next minister.

828
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,629
There's something you're good at.

829
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,008
Turning crisis into an opportunity.

830
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,721
Let me know if you need anything.

831
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,556
I'll always be by your side.

832
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,439
Thank you.

833
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,984
But I can't just stay here
and watch him from afar

834
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,654
when I'm so close to achieving my dream.

835
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,365
What are you planning to do?

836
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,911
I'll do what I'm good at.

837
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,996
Turn a crisis into an opportunity.

838
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,974
I guess he is going to be late.

839
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,563
These are examples of traditional markets
that got redeveloped.

840
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,190
Please give them to Mr. Jang.

841
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,525
Okay, I will.

842
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,402
By the way,

843
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,322
I'm trying to make new materials
for the business presentation.

844
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,824
Is there a reference I can use?

845
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,243
I don't even know the template.

846
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,371
Mr. Jang put you in charge of that?

847
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,289
Well, no.

848
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,209
But I just thought I'd give it a try.

849
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,212
I'd like to be of help in any kind of way.

850
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:17,050
There should be a presentation file
that Mr. Jang once made.

851
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,221
-I'll send it to you via email.
-Oh, really? My gosh.

852
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,431
Thank you so much.

853
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,684
By the way,

854
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,271
why do you work so hard?

855
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,564
Well...

856
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,233
Because I like it.

857
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,734
What?

858
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:39,156
I'm doing this because I like the job.

859
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,910
I thought you just wanted to earn points
at the civil service interview.

860
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,996
Oh, you mean this?

861
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,958
To be honest, my mom can't find out
that I'm doing this.

862
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,419
The civil service exam is
an excuse I use to keep it a secret.

863
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,684
Don't call me so late at night.

864
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,894
My wife will get ideas.

865
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,020
How are things going?

866
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,479
The case regarding Mr. Jo's son

867
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,149
got sent to the prosecution
before we could even get a taste.

868
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,318
They took everything
including the investigation files.

869
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,447
Here are some stuff regarding Mr. Jo.
No one knows about them yet.

870
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,073
So you can use them to find something.

871
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,743
What is all this? Where did you get this?

872
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,453
During the floor leader election period.

873
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,621
REAL ESTATE SALES CONTRACT

874
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,290
My gosh, you prepared everything
so meticulously.

875
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,125
But why are you suddenly targeting Mr. Jo

876
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,835
instead of the Minister of Justice?

877
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,879
You'll soon find out.

878
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,797
-Call me.
-Okay.

879
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,220
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP'S OFFICE

880
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,065
Oh, my goodness!

881
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,901
Gosh.

882
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,861
Hello, sir.

883
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,031
-You spent the night here?
-Yes.

884
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,825
Oh, right. Here you go.

885
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,870
Ms. Yun asked me
to give this to you yesterday.

886
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,622
She dropped by last night.

887
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,082
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

888
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,627
Mr. Jang.

889
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,629
I organized the presentation materials.

890
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,547
Can you please take a look?

891
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,389
Did you do this all by yourself?

892
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,848
Well, yes.

893
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,810
Ms. Yun told me that I should use
your past presentation materials

894
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,645
as reference.

895
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,231
So I used your stuff
to come up with the table of contents.

896
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,733
What do you think?

897
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,278
It's nice.

898
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,365
-Really?
-Keep going with this concept

899
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,158
-by making things more concrete.
-Okay.

900
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,827
I'll have it done before noon.

901
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,706
You can give it to me before dinner.

902
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,583
Do you see the public bath over there?

903
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,169
-Yes, sir.
-Go and take a shower there.

904
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,713
Oh, okay.

905
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,676
I'll be right back.

906
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,642
My gosh.

907
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,937
I caused so much trouble.

908
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,189
I don't know how I'm going to face
the President.

909
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,150
The Blue House
Personnel Committee is trying

910
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,193
to find the right candidate
for your position.

911
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,280
But the President actually wants you
to recommend someone

912
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,033
who can carry on the reformation
that you've started.

913
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,202
Is there anyone you have in mind?

914
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,208
I recommend Assemblyman Song Hui-seop

915
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,128
since he used to be a prosecutor himself.

916
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,089
Assemblyman Song?

917
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,304
I'll relay your message to the President.

918
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,854
Minister.

919
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,648
You need to take a look at this.

920
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,042
Hello, everyone.

921
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,962
As of today, I will be
resigning from my position

922
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,339
as the Minister of Justice.

923
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,549
I would like to apologize
to all the judicial officers,

924
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,302
my fellow colleagues,
and the people close to me

925
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,179
who helped me with the reformation

926
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,890
-of the prosecution.
-Ms. Kang, drink your tea. It'll get cold.

927
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,518
As the Minister of Justice,
I am fully responsible for

928
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,020
the delay of the investigation
on Bugang Electronics. I hope

929
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,772
the investigation will quickly proceed

930
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,733
so that the laborers and the family
of the deceased will finally...

931
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,443
-Sir.
-What's up?

932
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,070
...heal from their scars.

933
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,949
The Blue House accepted Minister
Park's resignation letter. According to

934
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:54,411
a key personnel at the Blue House, they
are in the process of finding a successor.

935
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,997
And they are considering Assemblyman Jo
of the Daehan Party as the candidate.

936
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,582
He is currently the head of...

937
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,418
What kind of bullshit is that?

938
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,295
Minister Park recommended him
to the President.

939
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,756
I might as well just kill that jerk.

940
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,758
Give me Kim In-gyu's file.

941
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,385
That's not going to help, sir.

942
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,346
You need to take a look at this.

943
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,101
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG SECURES TESTIMONY
OF BUGANG'S FINANCE TEAM MANAGER

944
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,354
The press already knows
that we have Kim In-gyu's video clip.

945
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,398
How did they find out?

946
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,608
No one's ever been eliminated
during a hearing...

947
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,987
Mr. Song has everything.
But we don't even have a single card.

948
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,989
Then we just need to make

949
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,116
the other person's cards become useless.

950
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,542
I'll deal with the press.

951
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,337
It doesn't seem like he'll have a problem
with the hearing.

952
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,089
Is Assemblyman Song inside?

953
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,717
Sir, is it true that you've secured
Kim In-gyu's testimony?

954
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,635
-What did he say?
-Please wait.

955
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,846
-Sir, please tell us!
-Will you please stop?

956
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,306
-Stop it!
-Sir, what did he say?

957
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,308
-You can't do this!
-Get out of the way.

958
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,226
-Sir!
-Please leave.

959
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,603
Okay, everyone.

960
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,854
-Wait.
-Please stop.

961
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,898
-Get out of the way!
-Please leave!

962
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,109
Assemblyman Jo may be a member
of the ruling party,

963
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,279
but he is being regarded as someone
who can embrace the opposition party.

964
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,829
Mr. Jo isn't in his office,
and we can't get a hold

965
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,664
of his chief of staff either.

966
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,959
My gosh, the least he can do is
celebrate my win like a gentleman,

967
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,295
but he's trying to ruin the party.

968
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,923
It's not like he got nominated
as the minister already.

969
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,799
Why are you so worried?

970
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,388
You already know who's capable
of dealing with Mr. Jo.

971
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,475
Tae-jun.

972
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,066
Sir, I'll take care of it.

973
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,777
-How?
-Well... I...

974
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,695
What can you do
when you can't even meet him?

975
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,656
I'll do whatever I can to get in touch.

976
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,949
Shut up.

977
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,539
Therefore, it doesn't seem like he'll have
a problem with the hearing.

978
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,208
A source from the Blue House says

979
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,585
they're trying their best
to appoint a new successor

980
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,380
as fast as possible
so that Minister Park's resignation

981
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,382
won't have a severe effect
on the organization.

982
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,758
-Yes, Mr. Song.
-Hey.

983
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,635
I need you back here.

984
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,805
-I'll go after I deal with Seobuk Market.
-That's not important right now!

985
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,682
I'll send Won-sik,
so get over here right now!

986
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,433
Okay, sir. I'll be right there.

987
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:27,063
They're trying their best to appoint
a new minister as fast as possible.

988
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,733
Won-sik, hurry up and go.

989
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,624
Assemblyman Jo's wife caused
as much trouble as his son

990
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,002
starting from false resident registration
and a lot of other stuff.

991
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,628
I sent you an email. You should read it.

992
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:52,797
Thanks.

993
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,841
QUICK DELIVERY SERVICE

994
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,888
ASSEMBLYMAN JO'S WIFE
SUSPECTED OF FALSELY CLAIMING RESIDENCY

995
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,225
ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG

996
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,525
SEND

997
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,610
SENT SUCCESSFULLY

998
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,447
Mr. Jo, I'd like to meet up with you.

999
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,073
I just sent you an email.

1000
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,366
Please give me a call.

1001
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,788
Mr. Jang.

1002
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,667
Where's Mr. Song?

1003
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,585
He's inside.

1004
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,962
Hello, sir.

1005
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,172
Hi, sir.

1006
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,764
Hey, Tae-jun.

1007
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,475
Come over here.

1008
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,477
Did you eat dinner?

1009
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,603
You did? Okay.

1010
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,731
Let me tell you what's going on.

1011
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,741
You should yield
the floor leader position to Mr. Jo.

1012
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,909
What are you talking about?

1013
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,744
Mr. Lee's going to be
the next floor leader.

1014
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,663
You need to deal with what's urgent.

1015
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,539
How's that going to make a difference?

1016
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,709
Sir, we already settled a deal
with Mr. Lee--

1017
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,252
Will you please stay still?

1018
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,381
Mr. Lee can only win over one third

1019
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,216
of the entire ruling party.

1020
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,844
You need Mr. Jo's support in order to pass
the hearing to become the minister anyway.

1021
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,765
Do you think he'll accept the offer?

1022
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,142
I'll try to talk to him in person.

1023
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,811
How are you going to do that?

1024
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,562
We don't even know where he is right now.

1025
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,690
I'm sure he'll call me.

1026
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:35,692
What?

1027
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,489
Is it Jo Gap-yeong?

1028
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,573
ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG

1029
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,745
Yes, sir.

1030
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,540
It's Jang Tae-jun.

1031
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,127
What are you doing?
Did you send me this to threaten

1032
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,795
-me again?
-I only sent that to you

1033
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,839
because I wanted to meet you
but I didn't know how.

1034
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,424
If you accept our offer,

1035
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,050
those files will become useless.

1036
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,594
What? What offer? What do you want?

1037
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,890
I'm just trying to put things back
to where they belong.

1038
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,267
The Minister of Justice.

1039
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,727
The floor leader.

1040
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,438
We both know who should be which.

1041
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,858
I'll send Mr. Kim the location
of where we should meet.

1042
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,001
Hey.

1043
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,795
What did you do?

1044
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:41,340
-What do you think you're doing?
-You planned all this, didn't you?

1045
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,222
I didn't know you thought of me so highly.

1046
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,308
This is what Mr. Song said.

1047
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,768
"I can't stand seeing people

1048
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,770
who should be
behind me hovering in front of me."

1049
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,189
I'm only here
to get rid of that person for him.

1050
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:57,899
Don't get so riled up.

1051
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,904
Will you let go now? I have a lot to do.

1052
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,366
Okay.

1053
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,414
Won-sik.

1054
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,501
Let me give this back to you.

1055
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,796
You look a lot more tired
than me right now.

1056
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,094
SUAN SAUNA

1057
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,640
Damn it. This little jerk.

1058
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,740
Hello, sir.

1059
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,284
Go on inside.

1060
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,248
What are you scheming?

1061
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,375
Why don't you ever answer my questions?

1062
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,385
We may be a divided country
and pointing guns at each other,

1063
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:10,429
but we still hold hands
and try to put on a smile on our faces.

1064
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,267
Have a drink,
and let's put the past behind us.

1065
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,854
It's not very easy to forget
about all the bad blood between us.

1066
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,046
How did it go?

1067
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,091
Nothing in this world is for free.

1068
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,010
I had to soothe and console him.

1069
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,540
I don't mind cooperating with you.

1070
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,584
But there's one thing that bothers me.

1071
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,171
I'd like to catch a sly traitor
that stabbed me in the back.

1072
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,673
-About Kang Seon-yeong...
-Yes, sir.

1073
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,092
Do what you need to get rid of her
at the right timing.

1074
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,095
That's what Jo Gap-yeong wants in return.

1075
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,608
Congratulations.

1076
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,902
You made a fancy comeback.

1077
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:53,824
There is only one way
to stop all your cards

1078
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,284
from falling.

1079
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,421
And you do that by throwing away

1080
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,507
one of your cards.

1081
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,687
How did it go with Mr. Jo?

1082
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,814
He's not the type of man to back down.

1083
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:09,692
Apparently, Assemblymen Song and Jo
had a one-on-one meeting last night.

1084
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,901
They must've struck a deal.

1085
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,778
You could really get hurt.

1086
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:16,323
Go and tell Mr. Song this.
He'll get hurt as much as I do.

1087
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,034
Get rid of Kang Seon-yeong quickly.

1088
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,411
We might not get to see
the Chief Presidential Secretary.

1089
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:24,206
If you keep hesitating, we can't guarantee
what move the assemblyman will make next.

1090
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,916
Do you have to take it this far? Tae-jun!

1091
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,085
I'm a pretty valuable asset, aren't I?

1092
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,503
Please, let's stop.

1093
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,068
