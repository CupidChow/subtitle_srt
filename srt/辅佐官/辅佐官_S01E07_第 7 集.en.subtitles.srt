1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,438
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,982
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,496
That footage won't be disclosed.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,955
Why not?

5
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,918
It'll be hard to determine

6
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,045
the cause of the accident
with the footage alone.

7
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,423
And even if we disclose it now,
it'll end up getting buried.

8
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,259
Mr. Song and Mr. Lee are very close.

9
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,804
Mr. Song will soon be appointed
Minister of Justice.

10
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,599
Then he'll do whatever it takes
to pressure the police and prosecution.

11
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,601
But that accident cost someone's life.

12
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,020
Are you saying
we should turn a blind eye to it?

13
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,647
No, something will be done.

14
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,651
But Mr. Jang made the best choice
he could've made.

15
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,737
Unless the law and the system change,
nothing can be done.

16
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,282
And Mr. Jang is trying to change them.

17
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,624
I don't believe
that you've made the best choice.

18
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,088
What's your point?

19
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,216
I don't know much about politics.

20
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,759
But

21
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,054
I don't think this is right.

22
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,557
How could you change the world

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,433
when you disregard someone's life?

24
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,021
When did it start going south?

25
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,192
Don't trust Mr. Song and Mr. Lee too much.

26
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,361
They'll ditch you when you become useless.

27
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,654
I know.

28
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
And I'm just using them as well.

29
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,161
Take a good look at yourself now.

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,454
Who is the one that's being used?

31
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
If you're planning to help
Assemblyman Lee, just give up.

32
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,834
What if I stop you?

33
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,296
What will you do then?

34
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,593
Mutual interests formed
by misunderstandings and conflicts.

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,806
Life is entangled
like a messy skein of thread.

36
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
Tae-jun.

37
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,437
Don't get intoxicated
with what Mr. Lee has to offer.

38
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,206
A tangled skein of thread.

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,832
If you're going to fight with someone,

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,752
you must win at all costs.

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,673
I'll help you. Let's fight together.

42
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,846
Are you really going to keep fighting
till the end?

43
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,141
-Are you?
-I need to see the fight through.

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,435
When Mr. Song is appointed
Minister of Justice,

45
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,355
he'll gain authority to command
the entire prosecution service.

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,148
That won't happen.

47
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,779
Mr. Song...

48
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,199
won't be appointed as a minister.

49
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,287
Independent assemblyman,
Mr. Lee Seong-min,

50
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,414
is joining
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

51
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,626
Assemblyman Jang Yong-gi
resigned from the committee,

52
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,671
and Assemblyman Lee, who is now
on the Environment and Labor Committee,

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,839
will be taking his seat.

54
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,761
The more you try to untangle
the knotted skein of thread,

55
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,933
you won't be able to find the knot,
and it'll get tangled up even more.

56
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,560
In the end, the skein will be messier.

57
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,406
EPISODE 7

58
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,041
What's wrong with this?

59
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,630
Damn it. What's wrong now?

60
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,173
Where did I put the scissors?

61
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,259
Where are my scissors?

62
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,389
Did I see that right?

63
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,687
KIM MYEONG-SU

64
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,565
I searched this place upside down
for this. Why is this here?

65
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,817
Unbelievable.

66
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,785
Gosh, where's my pass?

67
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,330
This is driving me crazy.

68
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,127
-What are you looking for?
-What?

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,005
It's nothing.

70
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,423
What is it?

71
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,553
You wore this suit, didn't you?

72
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,392
Well, Mom. Let me explain.

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,772
Remember Dong-su?
I had to wear it to Dong-su's wedding.

74
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,398
-To the wedding?
-Yes.

75
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,608
Is that so?

76
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,109
Wait, Mom.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,194
Hands off.

78
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,820
Let go!

79
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,827
HAN DO-GYEONG

80
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,333
What are you up to these days?

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,043
Mom, it's...

82
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,004
It's been a month since
you stopped going to your classes.

83
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,881
I called your school.

84
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,468
What on earth are you doing these days?

85
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,929
Explain this. What is this?

86
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,517
Well, I've been going
to the National Assembly.

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,143
What? National Assembly?

88
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,686
Why would you go there?

89
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,065
I've been working at an assemblyman's
office to become a chief of staff.

90
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,733
Chief of staff?

91
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,861
You brat.
I supported you to be a civil servant.

92
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,781
-How could you pull a stunt like this?
-Wait, wait.

93
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,325
They are civil servants too.

94
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,702
-They are?
-Yes.

95
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,579
Look.

96
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,374
It says so here. Can you see?

97
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,127
So are you telling me
that you're a civil servant?

98
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,713
No, I'm just an intern now.

99
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,298
But if I keep working, I'll become one.

100
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,384
If I do, it'll be
a privileged government position.

101
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,885
What's that?

102
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,929
Well...

103
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,807
It's a special position.

104
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,767
A special position?

105
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,270
Is it some kind of specialized position?

106
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,400
Well, I guess you can say that.
It is special.

107
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,074
Mom, I'm late.

108
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,951
I'll tell you in detail tonight.

109
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,744
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,580
Hey, Do-gyeong.

111
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,209
Lee Chang-jin,
the CEO of Joojin Constructions,

112
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,836
visited the family of Mr. Yu Jin-su,

113
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,964
who lost his life in the conveyor belt
accident at the cement factory,

114
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,049
and apologized on his knees.

115
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,595
He stated that he'd cooperate
with the police investigation...

116
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,138
I don't know much about politics.

117
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,639
But

118
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,226
I don't think this is right.

119
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,729
How could you change the world

120
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,772
when you disregard someone's life?

121
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,736
Why did I do that? It's not like
I know anything about politics.

122
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,283
MR. OH

123
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,369
Yes, Mr. Oh.

124
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,332
Goodness.

125
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,751
Come in.

126
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,922
It's the schedule for the hearing.

127
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,134
HEARING SCHEDULE

128
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,220
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

129
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,107
How could they replace the panel
when the hearing is around the corner?

130
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,485
Even if Chairperson Lee approved,
this isn't appropriate.

131
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,947
Mr. Song, you should go to Chairperson Lee
and make a complaint.

132
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,366
I'll round up the members
of our party and their staff.

133
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,493
If you meet with him now,

134
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,578
it might seem as if
you are exerting pressure.

135
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,081
That will only attract attention
to your hearing.

136
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,919
I doubt that this plan was concocted
from small fry like him.

137
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,462
Is it Kang Seon-yeong again?

138
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,506
Goodness.

139
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,716
I shouldn't have stirred up
a hornet's nest.

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,427
-Seriously. You're of no use.
-Sir...

141
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,387
Damn it.

142
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,479
CHIEF PRESIDENTIAL SECRETARY

143
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,900
There's never a quiet day
in our office, is there?

144
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,612
Goodness.

145
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,452
You didn't plot this
with Ms. Kang again, did you?

146
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,040
I asked just in case.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,376
Look at how your face changed.

148
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,045
Goodness.

149
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,631
-Mr. Han isn't here yet?
-No.

150
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,508
How could an intern be late?

151
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,927
I sent him on an errand for something.

152
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,224
What? I can't send an intern on an errand?

153
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,061
You're all glaring at me.

154
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,607
Let's go.

155
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,858
-Yes, sir.
-Have a good day.

156
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,775
Have a good day, sir.

157
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,280
-Jong-uk.
-Yes?

158
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,827
Give me the list of members
of our party in Seongjin City.

159
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,038
Seongjin City? Hold on.

160
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,336
LIST OF PARTY MEMBERS IN SEONGJIN

161
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,588
Why do you need the list?

162
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,465
Because I'm grateful to them.

163
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,597
JANG CHUN-BAE
DAEHAN PARTY

164
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,406
The doors are closing.

165
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,372
Ms. Kang, I'd like
to offer my advice to you.

166
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,210
If you switch sides whenever
you get a chance, you won't survive here.

167
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,005
You must make your move
after securing your spot.

168
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,466
You only play with fire
when you don't know any better.

169
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,468
Thank you for your advice.

170
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,804
But it's too late.

171
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,264
I plan to play with a bigger fire now.

172
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,694
You're joining the Judiciary Committee
at a crucial moment.

173
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,279
-How does it feel?
-I'm a bit dazed.

174
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,073
As a newly appointed member
of the committee,

175
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,535
I must do my due diligence
not to harm the other assembly members.

176
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,371
What will you be focusing on
at Assemblyman Song's hearing?

177
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,914
The Minister of Justice

178
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,750
must impartially establish law and order.

179
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,877
The Minister's role
is very important in our society

180
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,588
as he must uphold the human rights
and supervise the prosecution.

181
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,258
Therefore, this position
demands higher standards

182
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,845
in terms of obeying the law and ethics
compared to other Cabinet Members.

183
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,643
I plan to verify and weigh
if the nominee, Assemblyman Song,

184
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,353
indeed carries such traits

185
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,856
from the perspectives of the people.

186
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,943
Things are bustling here.

187
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,904
Yes, it should be
for a happy occasion like today.

188
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,156
You have a point,

189
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,491
but it's too soon to tell

190
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,744
if this will be a happy occasion
or a tragic one.

191
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,288
Prepare for your happy occasion well.

192
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,582
I want to enjoy it too.

193
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,087
Hey, Ms. Kang.

194
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,842
Are you heading to Jungil-gu?

195
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,927
-Yes.
-Do your best.

196
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,180
You must maintain
a good relationship with the mayor.

197
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,806
That will help you gain more votes.

198
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,729
By the way, don't forget to add my name
to your lone-parent support project.

199
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,190
Okay, I will.

200
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,743
Don't you think you're being
too generous with Ms. Kang?

201
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,162
You never know when she's going
to stab us in the back again.

202
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,791
She's more than capable of doing so.

203
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,584
Put a tail on her.

204
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,002
Yes, sir.

205
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,880
We must keep a stronger grip on her
when she's trapped,

206
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,340
so she doesn't try to resist.

207
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,139
The committee seems to be going through
a rough patch. Will that affect you?

208
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,685
As you know, there are always arguments
and biting remarks at hearings like this.

209
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,979
If the hearing progress report
isn't approved,

210
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,190
it'll impose a great deal
of pressure on the Blue House.

211
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,484
As the former minister stepped down,

212
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,404
the President is even considering
to withdraw the minister appointment.

213
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,951
Please make sure the President
doesn't have to make that choice.

214
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,497
Please don't worry.
That should never happen.

215
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,375
Of course. Please have your tea.

216
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,751
Have your tea.

217
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,554
-I'll see you soon.
-Goodbye.

218
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,522
Damn it. That troublemaker, Lee Seong-min.

219
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,900
He has nothing to lose,
but he can be such a hassle.

220
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,820
Call up Lee Seong-min
and invite him out for a meal.

221
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,323
What do you plan on doing?

222
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492
He doesn't have ambition,

223
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,327
so I'll make him ambitious.

224
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,497
Goodness.

225
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,212
CONFERENCE ROOM

226
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,007
I'd like your support
for the lone-parent support project,

227
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,425
so it runs smoothly.

228
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,760
Of course.
I'm looking forward to working with you.

229
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,055
Let's go back in.

230
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,602
Did the meeting go well?

231
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,189
Yes, his staff will contact you
regarding the project.

232
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,358
-Please proceed with it.
-Yes, ma'am.

233
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,612
How is the hearing
for the Minister of Justice going?

234
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,032
It looks like Mr. Lee will go all out
against Mr. Song at the hearing.

235
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,868
I heard he's focusing on
Mr. Song and Lee Chang-jin's relationship.

236
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,704
Ms. Kang, if I may ask,

237
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,123
are you planning
on helping Mr. Lee Seong-min?

238
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,335
It will be too much for him
to prepare for the hearing alone.

239
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,462
I'm just a bit concerned.

240
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,007
I understand his circumstances,
but this seems a bit risky.

241
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,261
I feel as if you're walking a thin line
between Mr. Song and Mr. Jo.

242
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,763
I know.

243
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,265
That's why I need your help,

244
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,892
so I don't fall from it, Mr. Go.

245
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,771
I don't know how I can be of help to you,
but I will do my best.

246
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
Please buy me a meal.

247
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,559
Did anything happen?

248
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,688
No.

249
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,608
I don't think you came to me
only for a meal.

250
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,068
You can tell me.

251
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,660
Give me a call if you need help.

252
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,626
Please lend me some money.

253
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,587
What is it for?

254
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,631
Don't ask me that.
Just lend me some money.

255
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,843
Out of everyone I know,
you're probably the richest lady.

256
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,097
How much do you need?

257
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,433
I need one million won.

258
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,562
Why? Do you not have that much?

259
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,605
By any chance,

260
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,525
are you considering

261
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,028
getting an abortion?

262
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,781
Does the assistant administrator
know that you've come to meet me?

263
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,118
Forget it if you don't want to.

264
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,955
Su-min.

265
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,558
Isn't she Su-min
from the lone-parent center?

266
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,185
Why did she come to see you?

267
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,564
It looks like she left the center.

268
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,109
Could you look into it?

269
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,694
Sure.

270
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,952
ONE HEART PRINTING SERVICE

271
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,792
Excuse me.

272
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,921
Hello.

273
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,674
-What brings you here?
-Mr. Oh Won-sik sent me on an errand here.

274
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,386
Mr. Oh sent you here? Hold on.

275
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,771
Tell him that I'd appreciate
his help next time too.

276
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,566
-Thank you. Have a good day.
-Sure.

277
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,913
We've been working in politics for long.

278
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,290
And our districts are placed
right next to each other's.

279
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,460
But we've been so distant to one another
for all this time.

280
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,671
Please make this brief.

281
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,966
I don't think we're close enough
to have a meal together.

282
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,010
You're right. I'll get to the point.

283
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,764
Seeing the path you've taken
as an assemblyman,

284
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,725
there is a great number of things
I could learn from you.

285
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,644
If everyone could work as hard as you do,

286
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,480
our dear country
will be a much better one.

287
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,608
But for you to handle all of your tasks,

288
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,696
don't you think
that you'd need more than four years?

289
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,282
Your term will mature next year.

290
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,325
You must get reelected

291
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,452
and continue to serve the country.

292
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,122
What are you trying to say?

293
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,415
At the last general election,

294
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,875
the candidate of our party

295
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,043
was disqualified
due to the corruption scandal,

296
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,879
and you got lucky
and became an assemblyman.

297
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,215
But I'm not sure if you'll have
such luck next year again.

298
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,718
You're an independent assemblyman
without any support.

299
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,012
The public support
continues to drop in your district.

300
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,472
Given your situation,
do you think you can be reelected?

301
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,601
So if you join our party...

302
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,645
I wasn't aware that you were
concerned about my reelection.

303
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,191
Mr. Lee, to serve a greater purpose
in our society,

304
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,067
a little bit of compromise is necessary.

305
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,986
"I'm getting into politics

306
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,614
because I want to empower the powerless."

307
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,407
That was

308
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,243
one of your campaign promises
in the last general election.

309
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,411
If you give up now,

310
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,497
who is going to protect
all those people that voted for you?

311
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,958
Or are you going to tell me

312
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,252
that you were just bluffing
to win more votes?

313
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,299
You see,
even water lilies are rooted in mud.

314
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,884
A little bit of mud

315
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,012
cannot mar
the graceful beauty of water lilies.

316
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,514
The flower must bloom again next year,
you know.

317
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,146
I won't bother trying to get reelected
if I must soil my hands and feet with mud.

318
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,399
And by the same token,
I can't support you.

319
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,861
I should get going.

320
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,203
An assemblyman like him really exists?

321
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,080
My goodness.

322
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,707
I came to coax him, not to be insulted.

323
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,461
That arrogant prick.
Look at him acting all upright and honest.

324
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,880
I'll meet with Assemblyman Lee one-on-one.

325
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,548
No, don't bother.

326
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,884
Let Won-sik handle him.

327
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,804
He won't lower his head.
Let's hit him in the neck

328
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,807
to show him how cutthroat
those in politics can be.

329
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,524
This is Yun Hye-won
from Mr. Song's office.

330
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,778
Right, I'll resend the missing documents
for the hearing.

331
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,571
-Da-jeong, did you check your e-mail?
-Okay.

332
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,781
Yes, I did.

333
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,117
Why are there
so many pre-hearing questionnaires?

334
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,577
-I can't even take a break.
-Pass me those reports, Mr. Kim.

335
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,705
I'm back.

336
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,208
Did Mr. Oh step out or something?

337
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,794
He's visiting the district office.

338
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,546
Where have you been?

339
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,424
I picked up the printed samples
of our policy handbook.

340
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,267
Come over here and organize these reports
for each office.

341
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,435
Sure.

342
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,525
ONE HEART PRINTING SERVICE

343
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,030
SEONGJIN CITY
DAEHAN PARTY COMMITTEE

344
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,781
Sir!

345
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,992
How have you been?

346
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,082
I haven't seen you at all lately.

347
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,001
What brings you here?

348
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,340
This pleasant breeze made me think of you,
Mr. Assemblyman. Here.

349
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,925
Assemblyman, my foot.
I took off my badge years ago.

350
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,554
Losing the election once doesn't mean
you can never wear the badge again.

351
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,848
What's this random blabbering about?

352
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,309
I was told to oversee this district
because I lost.

353
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,602
Assemblyman Song is ruthless.

354
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,354
Giving you this position

355
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,939
was his thoughtful decision
for next year's election.

356
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,363
Sir, you should crush Lee Seong-min

357
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,864
and make a comeback.

358
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,241
Look at Seongjin City.

359
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,370
It's become a hot mess
since that man got elected.

360
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,414
He's even trying to cancel
the projects that you were working on.

361
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,707
You need to get reelected

362
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,794
to represent the city next year
and take good care of it.

363
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,171
Let's be honest. Did he beat you last time

364
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,881
because he's more competent than you are?

365
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,758
He was just lucky.

366
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,760
Why did the prosecution
investigate me right then?

367
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,929
Who doesn't spend money during campaigns?

368
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,180
Exactly.

369
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,394
So? What are you trying to suggest?

370
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,561
Listen.

371
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,111
But if I step in, it won't look good.

372
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,571
Of course,
you shouldn't get directly involved.

373
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,948
FOR THE ORDINARY PEOPLE

374
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,950
I was going through the list
of party members

375
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,744
and found the right man for this.

376
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,288
Do you remember that man
who helped you during your campaign?

377
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,832
He was a CAO of a township.

378
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,127
He's still a committed member
of our party.

379
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,338
-He'd be perfect for the job.
-Yes.

380
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,298
Give him any position,
and he'll do a great job.

381
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,177
Will it really be okay though?
You know who he is.

382
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,429
I sure do.

383
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,599
And that's why he's perfect for the job.

384
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,936
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP'S OFFICE

385
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,313
Ms. Yun, we're heading out to eat.
Do you want to come?

386
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,691
I'll eat in a bit. You guys go ahead.

387
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,777
All right, then.

388
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,864
What shall we eat?

389
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,199
Whatever you like.

390
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,077
I know of a great place.

391
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,417
Ms. Yun, I'm stepping out for some food.

392
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,420
Okay. Just a second, Da-jeong.

393
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,756
-Yes?
-About our policy handbook...

394
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,468
Did we send the print job
to One Heart Printing Service?

395
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,514
-No, we use a different print shop.
-What about the district office's?

396
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,058
Mr. Oh takes care
of all the print materials for them.

397
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,395
Can I see the report Mr. Oh requested?

398
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,523
The one on policy research
and development service.

399
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,609
Sure.

400
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,281
RESEARCH ON SEOBUK MARKET
AND REDEVELOPMENT PLANS

401
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,881
Hello, this is One Heart Printing Service.

402
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,008
Hello, this is Assemblyman Song's office.

403
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,594
Right, yes.

404
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,017
Mr. Oh wants to place a bookbinding order
for our policy handbook.

405
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,188
Would 200 be enough, as usual?

406
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,567
Sure. I'll send you the file via e-mail.

407
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,736
Okay, great. Thank you.

408
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,283
EXPENDITURE DETAILS

409
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,619
2,000 COPIES

410
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,226
Mr. Jang.

411
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,779
The doors are opening.

412
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,747
Mr. Jang.

413
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,542
Well...

414
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,796
I'm really sorry about yesterday.
I didn't know any better.

415
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,257
I'll work harder from now on
and try to learn from you.

416
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,050
You don't need to apologize.

417
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,595
Everything you said is right.

418
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,639
You want to be a chief of staff?

419
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,266
Even so, you don't need to copy me.

420
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,101
If you want to survive here,

421
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,186
just act on your beliefs.

422
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,110
I'll work hard.

423
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,660
Did you gather
all the requested documents?

424
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,537
No, not yet.

425
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,998
Everyone on the committee
requested basic stuff,

426
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,417
except for Mr. Lee Seong-min
who sent a lengthy list.

427
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,711
He even contacted the prosecution
for case files

428
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,713
from when Mr. Song was a prosecutor.

429
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,051
He even requested those files?

430
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,512
It looks like the prosecution
has already sent him a few things.

431
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,642
Lee Seong-min can't analyze
the case reports on his own.

432
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,894
I bet Kang Seon-yeong will help him.

433
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,024
I guess she really plans
to play with a bigger fire.

434
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,075
He requested all of that?

435
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,787
I'll do my best to make sure
the sensitive stuff won't be disclosed.

436
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,956
Just send everything over.

437
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,917
He won't have time to read them anyway.

438
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,752
What do you mean?

439
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,672
Assemblyman Lee won't be able
to prepare for the hearing.

440
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,216
With all that's going on,

441
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,926
he won't even care about the hearing.

442
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,976
I asked our party members in Seongjin City
for help.

443
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,604
Hey, if Lee Seong-min finds out about it,

444
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,815
-he won't let it slide.
-Gosh.

445
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,525
Don't worry, sir.

446
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,568
I hired someone

447
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,238
whom even Lee Seong-min can't ignore.

448
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,076
When Mr. Song was a prosecutor,

449
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,954
he worked on five cases
related to Lee Chang-jin.

450
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,957
Then shouldn't we bring him in
as a witness?

451
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,835
Both the ruling and opposition parties
will have to agree on it,

452
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,421
including Mr. No of the opposition party,
Mr. Ahn of our party,

453
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,423
and the chairperson
of the Judiciary Committee.

454
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,841
They all support Mr. Song.

455
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,347
Let's request additional documents
to strengthen our case.

456
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,975
-Okay.
-Where is Assemblyman Lee Seong-min?

457
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,560
-Where is he hiding?
-Where is he?

458
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,687
-Can I help you?
-Move! You're not him.

459
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,980
You can't go in.

460
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,315
Step aside.
I told you that I have to meet him.

461
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,400
-Please wait--
-Move!

462
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,277
What? We've been waiting all this time!

463
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,362
-Stop bullshitting us.
-Tell him to come out!

464
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,613
-Come out!
-You can't...

465
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,117
The redevelopment was decided long ago.

466
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,785
How could you try to stop it now?

467
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,038
-It's ridiculous.
-Hundreds of people agreed on it, okay?

468
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,082
I voted for you because of my son.

469
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,542
What the hell is this about?

470
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,836
Sir, please calm down.

471
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,173
Please wait until we sort things out
with the merchants.

472
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,425
They have nowhere to go.
They're struggling, you know.

473
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,969
Are you saying we, the landlords,
aren't struggling?

474
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,513
-That's right!
-After being renters for years,

475
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,307
we saved up and bought our properties.

476
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,100
-Yes!
-Exactly!

477
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,644
If a small piece of land
and a home are all we own,

478
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,105
-we're also considered the working class.
-Yes, absolutely!

479
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,399
-Cut it out!
-Please hear me out first.

480
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,151
We don't need to hear your bullshit!

481
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,403
We won't even take a step
out of this place

482
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,864
until the construction resumes,
so consider yourself informed.

483
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,240
-Yes!
-We won't even budge.

484
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,742
-Everyone, sit down!
-Okay.

485
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,827
-Let's all sit down!
-Sit.

486
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,038
-Goodness.
-You can't do this here.

487
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,248
Sir, you can't be doing this here.

488
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,171
-Oh, my goodness.
-There are cameras here.

489
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,381
-My gosh...
-Oh, no!

490
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,760
-Everyone, leave.
-No photos, please.

491
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,054
-My gosh.
-Are you all right?

492
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,472
-Please leave.
-Goodness.

493
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,516
-How could an assemblyman...
-Is he a thug or what?

494
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,769
-Assemblyman Lee Seong-min hit me!
-Gosh.

495
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,229
-Call security.
-Call them.

496
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,481
-In an assemblyman's office...
-This is crazy.

497
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,691
-We're here to submit a complaint.
-Look.

498
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,069
-I won't even budge.
-We need a solution.

499
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,279
-You saw he hit me.
-My gosh.

500
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,406
-Oh, boy. My goodness...
-Excuse me.

501
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,033
Ouch, my back.

502
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,368
Make way for him.

503
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,829
Dad!

504
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,002
I got injured in Assemblyman Lee's office.

505
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,964
Your father is one feisty man.

506
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,468
"Father"?

507
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,722
That's his father?

508
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,980
Oh, boy. My back still hurts.

509
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,899
I should get an X-ray done tomorrow.

510
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,028
Were you promised a position
in return for this?

511
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:05,989
By some sly bastard?

512
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,118
Hey, if the redevelopment commences
because of me,

513
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,744
I certainly deserve a position.

514
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,582
So what?
Are you going to run for election again?

515
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,125
Why can't I?

516
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,628
That prick, Lee Seong-min...

517
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,756
As an assemblyman, it is his duty
to make sure his district prospers.

518
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,551
How could he halt the project
because of a few merchants?

519
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,595
I heard your boss
will benefit from the project

520
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,138
once the construction commences.

521
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,309
I'll see this through,
so just leave it to me.

522
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,977
Stop.

523
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,730
Please.

524
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,858
-Don't be like this.
-You have no idea what's going on.

525
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,235
Don't get involved
when you don't even have a clue.

526
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,487
You see, this is like a battlefield.

527
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,450
Some will die tomorrow,
and some will live.

528
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,952
Will you be that foolish
for the rest of your life?

529
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,830
-What did you say?
-You're not a man of power.

530
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,875
So know your place and don't
cause trouble if you want to help me.

531
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,168
You little...

532
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,629
How dare you say that to your father?

533
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,713
Do me a favor.

534
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,506
Please.

535
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,799
I've told you that this is...

536
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,302
I mean...

537
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,723
This is my life, so don't meddle in it.

538
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,683
Okay, fine.

539
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,020
I won't meddle in your life,
so you should mind your own business too!

540
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,839
Is this also Oh Won-sik's doing?

541
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,593
-Yes.
-Your father--

542
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,886
Let's not talk about that.

543
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,472
And stop helping Assemblyman Lee.

544
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,100
The prosecution will deny
all his requests for the case files.

545
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,644
He can't prove the links
between Lee Chang-jin and my boss.

546
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,981
It won't be easy since you must have
prepared thoroughly.

547
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,609
No one wants him to be appointed
Minister of Justice more than you do.

548
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,947
If Assemblyman Song
does become the Minister of Justice,

549
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,157
will he really hand his district
over to you?

550
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,996
Uigwang City has been his district
for 16 long years.

551
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,872
Will he really give it to you that easily?

552
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,041
As much as you don't trust him,

553
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,876
I'm sure
he doesn't fully trust you either.

554
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,587
Had he fully trusted you,
he would've already told you everything,

555
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,548
including all his flaws and corrupt deeds.

556
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,633
Is there anything you know though?

557
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,012
He told you nothing
about rigging the floor leader election.

558
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,392
I know why you joined Samil Association.

559
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,144
What if things work against them?

560
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,604
Have you thought about
who will be their first scapegoat?

561
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,231
You, whom they can discard easily.

562
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,233
I am prepared for that.

563
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,277
I'm willing to take that much risk.

564
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,196
Must I give up when I've come this far?
Don't you feel the same way?

565
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,158
Yes, I know that
neither you nor I can really give up.

566
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,911
-But I want you to--
-What the heck do you want me to do?

567
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,539
We started at very different places.

568
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,917
You know how I got this far
from the bottom of the barrel.

569
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,713
I just need to take one more step forward.

570
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,381
Just one more step.

571
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,470
Don't worry.

572
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,897
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP'S OFFICE

573
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,361
Mr. Jang.

574
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,199
Mr. Oh

575
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,826
has been embezzling
our research and development funds.

576
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,913
A part of it was spent
on printing our policy handbook,

577
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,414
but he submitted fake receipts.

578
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,751
And his reports are basically collections
of excerpts from other reports.

579
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,211
How many times has he done this?

580
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,215
Twelve in total, including
his recent report on Seobuk Market.

581
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,926
So far, he's received over 50 million won
for these things.

582
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,429
Some of it went out as research expenses,

583
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,723
and the rest was spent
on covering the printing costs.

584
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,434
As for the Seobuk Market report,
2,000 copies should've been printed,

585
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,187
but he only ordered 200 copies.

586
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,357
I think the print shop is returning
the rest of the money to him.

587
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,567
Who did the research?

588
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,946
It was done by our interns.

589
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,116
Mr. Han's name is on the list as well.

590
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,331
RESEARCH BY HAN DO-GYEONG

591
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,586
How's it going? Are you liking the job?

592
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,338
Yes, sir. I'm doing my best.

593
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,801
-Do you know him?
-Mr. Oh recommended me for this job.

594
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,063
All right, it's time to watch the news.

595
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,940
Let's see.

596
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,194
People who want the redevelopment
in Seongjin City to commence

597
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,905
visited Assemblyman Lee Seong-min
and made complaints.

598
00:35:59,115 --> 00:35:59,949
He's doing great.

599
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,034
Assemblyman Lee's staff
tussled with the protesters,

600
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,995
-which left one of them injured.
-My goodness.

601
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,664
Whoever wrote that article
did a great job.

602
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,541
The injured person is preparing
to take legal action.

603
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,627
Da-jeong, I need some caffeine.
Could you make me a cup of coffee?

604
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,714
-Sure.
-Sixty percent of the residents

605
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,884
granted their consent
for the redevelopment,

606
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,635
but the project has been put on hold

607
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,305
-because of those who are against it.
-Hey, Do-gyeong.

608
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,348
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

609
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,894
Did you pick up the samples?

610
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,815
Here you go.

611
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,984
Thanks.

612
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,571
What are you doing?

613
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,823
Hey, you little...
Give it back, you prick!

614
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,992
You son of a bitch.

615
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,133
You piece of...

616
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,312
I'll return everything I've received
to the secretariat.

617
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,316
It was made for internal purposes,

618
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,609
so no one will find out--

619
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,822
-You bastard, how dare you.
-Sir!

620
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,327
You son of a...

621
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,415
You prick...

622
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,592
Lie low until I call you.

623
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,512
Yes, sir!

624
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,349
Get home safely, sir.

625
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,254
Jang Tae-jun, that piece of shit.

626
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,146
Mr. Oh told me that it's something
that's done customarily.

627
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,565
I didn't know it'd cause such a big issue.

628
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,275
I'm so sorry.

629
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,110
Do you think that's a good enough excuse?

630
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,447
You should at least be able to tell
what's right from wrong.

631
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,824
Are you saying it's okay
to do whatever you're told?

632
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,079
I want you to leave.

633
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,541
-Mr. Jang.
-Do you think you deserve to be here?

634
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,628
Get out of here right now!

635
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,571
HAN DO-GYEONG

636
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,804
SUWON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE,
PRESS RELEASE

637
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,154
Ms. Kang, aren't you
going to get off work?

638
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,533
Yes, I should.

639
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,994
You can go home first.

640
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,873
I'll be off then.

641
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,340
NON-PROSECUTION CASES

642
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,059
Yes, this is Kang Seon-yeong.

643
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,529
We called you because
she had your business card.

644
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,782
-What happened?
-She took unprescribed abortion pills

645
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,201
in order to get rid of the baby.

646
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,827
She needs to receive surgery right now.

647
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,579
But we need her family's consent.

648
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,790
Do you have any of their numbers
by any chance?

649
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,475
My goodness, Tae-jun.

650
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,686
-Hello.
-It's been so long.

651
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,271
You haven't even called lately.

652
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,814
-You're so mean.
-I'm sorry.

653
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,899
-Come inside.
-I brought you something.

654
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,484
It's green plum tea, your favorite.

655
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,487
My goodness, this really wasn't necessary.

656
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,364
Please come inside.

657
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,075
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

658
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,118
LABOR STANDARDS ACT

659
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,721
Is Hyo-jin doing well?

660
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,389
Yes, of course.

661
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,891
She always goes on
about how much she misses you.

662
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,395
My goodness, look at this.

663
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,897
He must have never used this.

664
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,234
No, he hasn't.
He says he prefers ballpoint pens.

665
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,821
He picks it up every now and then
when he comes home drunk.

666
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,782
But to be honest, he isn't using it
because he doesn't want it to wear out.

667
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,285
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING ELECTED
JANG TAE-JUN

668
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,496
Sit down and have some of this.

669
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,748
Okay.

670
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,875
We don't have much to serve.

671
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,460
Gosh, don't say that.

672
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,462
When you used to work with my husband,

673
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,214
you'd always drop by our place after work.

674
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,507
You've been too distant lately.

675
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,343
I'm sorry.

676
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,097
Honey, you're home.

677
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,057
Hey.

678
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,738
Don't worry about what your father did.

679
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,741
I'm sorry.

680
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,202
I'll make sure he doesn't file a lawsuit.

681
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,703
So don't worry.

682
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,538
You came here to tell me that?

683
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,833
No, I just came

684
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,543
because I felt frustrated.

685
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,172
Let's drink.

686
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,392
Back in the old days,
we'd always reconcile

687
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,561
over a couple of drinks
after we had a fight.

688
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,272
But now, it's only making me feel
more concerned.

689
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,402
I know you're worried about me.

690
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,405
But right now,
you should be worried about yourself,

691
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,116
not me.

692
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,831
Let's not do anything

693
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,208
that we'll end up regretting.

694
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,585
I've already walked down that path,

695
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,838
so I know it will make you feel uneasy.

696
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,382
I never regret anything.

697
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,260
Everyone regrets a thing or two
as they live their lives.

698
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,596
You and I aren't as great
as we'd hoped to be.

699
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,223
Tae-jun.

700
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,018
Listen to me, just this once.

701
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,229
If you go too far,
you won't be able to come back.

702
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,190
What about you?
Why don't you ever listen to me?

703
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,735
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

704
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,988
Mr. Song won't let you off the hook.

705
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,197
I know.

706
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,160
But I still need to do
what needs to be done.

707
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,276
Okay, fine.

708
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,198
Fight until the very end.

709
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,452
Instead,

710
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,830
I'm also going to do my best to stop you

711
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,125
and keep my place.

712
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,672
You understand that, right?

713
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,178
Right?

714
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,690
Darn it.

715
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,405
After we drink this,

716
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,492
let's not see each other for a while.

717
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,069
There's no time to agonize
over a tangled knot.

718
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,283
Right now, it is time to cut the knot

719
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,452
and think about what to do next.

720
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,715
Where are the answers
to Ms. Oh's questions?

721
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,800
-I just finished writing it.
-Okay.

722
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,929
Mr. Kim's office just sent us
an additional questionnaire.

723
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,265
We have so much work to do.

724
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,059
Mr. Han.

725
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,645
Please give me the 2017 hearing report
of the Minister of Justice.

726
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,659
SECRETARY
HAN DO-GYEONG

727
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,293
-Here.
-Thanks.

728
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,713
Here.

729
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,095
REPORT OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS

730
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,849
ACT ON THE COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS
FOR EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

731
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,194
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG
REPORT OF PROPERTY

732
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,405
QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ASSEMBLYMAN SONG

733
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,621
I can't find anything on him.

734
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,081
There's not a single issue.

735
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,457
Is this even possible?

736
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,876
Mr. Song is even planning
to run for the presidency

737
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,753
after his time as the Minister of Justice.

738
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,755
He would have made sure
not to leave a trace.

739
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,466
Mr. Jang wouldn't have overlooked it
if he had found anything suspicious.

740
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,593
How about we approach it
from another angle?

741
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,846
Let's look into the people
who gave money to Mr. Song.

742
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,645
It's Youngil Group's slush fund case.

743
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,397
Mr. Song was in charge
of the investigation.

744
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,649
Sung Yeong-gi is the honorary chairman
of Youngil Group.

745
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,360
He's no longer in office.

746
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,196
But he still exerts his influence
over politicians and businessmen

747
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,407
through Samil Association.

748
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,743
Where do you think Samil Association
gets their money

749
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,327
that makes them so powerful?

750
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,623
The association is a social gathering
among former and current assemblymen,

751
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,835
but it's a known fact that they still
intervene in many social issues.

752
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,837
Mr. Song joined the association

753
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,297
right after he took on this case.

754
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,508
He definitely would have
turned a blind eye on the case.

755
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,470
But they didn't give us the case materials

756
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,680
saying there were no records
since it happened long ago.

757
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,016
After Mr. Sung became
the honorary chairman,

758
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,809
there was an issue
with his inheritance tax.

759
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,813
And that's when the FSS checked
all his borrowed-name bank accounts.

760
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,025
Mr. Song definitely would've
received some money from him.

761
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,611
Mr. Song can stop the prosecution
from handing over any materials,

762
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,654
but not the FSS.

763
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,782
We'll need help

764
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,452
from other assembly members
to dig into something this big.

765
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,705
But they're all very cautious
because Mr. Song is currently in office.

766
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,123
If we raise suspicions,

767
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,626
they won't be able to stand still.

768
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,878
Let's start out with the press.

769
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,176
Are we done with
the opposition party's questionnaires?

770
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,304
We're only left with additional
questionnaires from Mr. Jang and Mr. Lee.

771
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,681
Give me Mr. Lee's questionnaire.

772
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,767
Here.

773
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,398
Have some coffee, everyone.

774
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,526
I really needed some coffee.

775
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,030
Thanks.

776
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,159
Mr. Jang.

777
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,994
Take a short break.

778
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,746
-Thanks.
-Sure.

779
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,125
This is so nice.

780
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,919
My gosh, it's nice and refreshing.

781
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,629
Next on the news.

782
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,214
The hearing for the nominee

783
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,924
for the Minister of Justice
is in two days.

784
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,094
And suspicions regarding Assemblyman Song
have started to arise.

785
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,139
Assemblyman Lee requested the FSS
for files regarding the Youngil Group case

786
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,642
saying Assemblyman Song might've been
lenient with the company

787
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,645
back when he was in charge
of the company's slush fund case.

788
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,606
The opposition party has decided
to start an investigation into it,

789
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,776
and this could cause some trouble
during the upcoming hearing.

790
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,194
Call the FSS and get the files.

791
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,238
-Okay.
-Okay.

792
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,793
Is there anything I should know
about Youngil Group?

793
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,504
No, you don't need to worry
about anything.

794
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,340
They're causing a fuss over something
that happened so long ago.

795
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,050
They're now trying to put me in trouble

796
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,469
because they couldn't find anything
I did wrong.

797
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,763
Sir, I need to know
in order to prepare for the hearing.

798
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,891
How far were you involved in the case?

799
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,058
I told you not to worry!

800
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,686
You don't need to worry
about anything else.

801
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,605
Just focus on preparing for the hearing.

802
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,994
See you later, sir.

803
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,418
Did you call the FSS?

804
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,047
They already sent the files
to Mr. Lee's office.

805
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,882
They agreed to send us the files as well.

806
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,967
But those files are the results
of the investigation

807
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,261
into Youngil Group's
borrowed-name accounts.

808
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,223
If there's any evidence that shows
that Mr. Song received money from them,

809
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,766
it'll give him a fatal blow.

810
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,112
COURIER SERVICE

811
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,118
Hey, it's me.

812
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,496
I have a favor to ask.

813
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,500
If they trace Youngil Group's money,

814
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,002
they'll find out where Samil Association
gets the funding.

815
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,505
Sir, do you have any way to stop this?

816
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,674
Everyone has a right to speak,

817
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,261
so I can't stop Mr. Lee Seong-min from
talking just because I'm the chairperson.

818
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,804
Darn it.

819
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,724
I'm more than glad to have our member
become the Minister of Justice,

820
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,393
but this is way too risky.

821
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,606
We'll end up losing a lot more

822
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,025
than what we gain.

823
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,907
If Youngil Group becomes a public issue,

824
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,660
Chairman Sung won't stand still.

825
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,333
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

826
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,293
Goodbye, sir.

827
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,712
Goodbye, sir.

828
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,054
Chairman Sung is currently abroad.

829
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,265
I'm not sure
if I should report to him about this.

830
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,100
This is quite a tough situation.

831
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,937
I'll take care of it.

832
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,272
So just stay quiet.

833
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,816
Do you have a good idea?

834
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,033
Are you thinking about using Jang Tae-jun?

835
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,915
My goodness.
It's going to be a waste to lose him,

836
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,168
but at least it'll help us
get out of trouble.

837
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,670
Did you purposely make him
take care of all your mess until now

838
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,213
so you could use him like this?

839
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,676
My goodness.
You're a very scary man, Mr. Song.

840
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,013
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

841
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,100
By any chance,
does Tae-jun have anything on you?

842
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,188
Well, I wouldn't exactly put it like that.

843
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,899
But I found out

844
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,235
that he's a very ambitious man.

845
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,454
I'm sure you didn't come empty-handed
to settle a deal.

846
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,747
So tell me.

847
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,749
Let's hear what you have to say.

848
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,542
In order to become the minister,

849
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,919
you'll have no choice

850
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,380
but to hand over the floor leader position
to Chairperson Lee.

851
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,131
What will you be offering me?

852
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,385
You know
the Minister of Justice has authority

853
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,387
over the prosecution's
personnel matters, right?

854
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,847
There are way too many positions
to fill the organization

855
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,183
with just my people alone.

856
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,856
Are you sure there will be
a position for me?

857
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,109
You can turn down the offer
if you don't like it.

858
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,988
But you see, you need

859
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,492
to become the Minister of Justice first
in order for this deal to be valid.

860
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,537
How are you going to deal with the issue
regarding Youngil Group?

861
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,580
They're doing everything
they can to hurt me,

862
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:02,001
so I'll have to let them
bite off my arm if that's necessary.

863
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:11,886
Are you okay with losing someone
that's so good at his job?

864
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,305
What's the use of keeping a cow
that's done doing its job?

865
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,433
It'll only cost me money to feed it.

866
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,144
Now, it's time to butcher and eat the cow.

My goodness.

869
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,426
I was just getting ready to close.

870
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,429
Are you here to have it dry-cleaned?

871
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,394
-Mom, is it this one?
-I told you there's one that's washed.

872
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,854
Why did you bring out a new one?

873
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:06,816
Ms. Yun.

874
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,581
You forgot to take these,
so I brought them.

875
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,458
Thank you.

What are you planning to do?

00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:37,931
I'm going to study

879
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,391
for the civil service exam again.

880
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,980
Didn't you say you wanted
to become a chief of staff?

881
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,698
You once asked me

882
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,703
why I started working here.

BUT WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED

888
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,686
Hye-won, wait.

889
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,106
You told me
you won't disclose Mr. Shin's identity.

890
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,774
How could you disclose his name?

891
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,360
You promised to protect his identity.

892
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,195
That gives us no public confidence.

893
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,072
We had to reveal his identity
for the article.

894
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,407
Then what about Mr. Shin?

895
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,658
He had faith in me!

896
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,036
What's important is the article,
not the whistleblower!

897
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,796
What happened?

898
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,339
Next on the news.

899
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,093
Mr. Shin, the whistleblower
of Hanjang Constructions' blueprint edits,

900
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,178
tried to commit suicide.

901
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,181
He was taken to the hospital
after having tried to commit suicide

902
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,184
by burning charcoal in his car
early this morning.

903
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,520
And he is currently
lying in the hospital unconscious.

904
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,106
Mr. Shin, who used to work
at Hanjang Constructions,

905
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,775
found out about the company's irregularity
and reported it

906
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,319
to the press for the public good.

907
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,280
However, once his identity got revealed,
he was pressured by the company,

908
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,281
and his colleagues...

909
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,907
I thought I'd be able

910
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,118
to become the eyes and ears of the weak

911
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,829
once I became a reporter.

912
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,665
But

913
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,752
there was absolutely nothing I could do.

914
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,589
I couldn't even protect the person
who trusted me

915
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,507
and told me everything.

916
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,136
So I felt helpless.

917
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,098
I may not be able to protect anyone,

918
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,852
but I felt like I should at least try
to make the world a better place

919
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,438
where people don't need such protection.

920
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,440
That's why I started doing this job.

921
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,318
Don't give up.

922
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,819
Mr. Han,

923
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,366
you must work in this field
for the sake of Yu Jin-su's grandmother.

924
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:05,078
And it doesn't have
to be at Mr. Song's office.

925
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,456
As long as you stick to your beliefs,

926
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,085
I'm sure you'll find a place to work.

927
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,348
I'll be off now.

928
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,826
Mr. Jang, aren't you tired?

929
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,244
My gosh.

930
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,037
Good work.

931
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,164
Thank you. You too, sir.

932
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,170
Mr. Jang.

933
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,928
What do you mean?

934
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,056
You've done enough.

935
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,476
I want you to stop
helping Mr. Lee Seong-min.

936
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,229
I thought you were also against

937
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,149
Mr. Song becoming the Minister of Justice.

938
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,736
When the game changes,
I should change the way I think.

939
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:24,282
Joojin Chemical's CEO will be
attending Assemblyman Song's hearing today

940
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,452
as a witness regarding Assemblyman Song's
candidacy for the Minister of Justice.

941
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,538
Both the ruling and opposition party
have come to an agreement

942
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:34,333
and picked the witness to resolve
the suspicions regarding Assemblyman Song.

943
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,627
Ms. Kang.

944
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,716
Did you hear that Lee Chang-jin will be
attending the hearing as a witness?

945
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,761
-Yes.
-Things aren't going the way we planned.

946
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,262
Take a look at this.

947
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,740
-He's here.
-Come on!

948
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,950
-Sir!
-This is your first confirmation hearing.

949
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,827
-Tell us how you feel.
-How do you feel?

950
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,746
-Did both parties agree on...
-Sir.

951
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,456
-Tell us how you feel.
-How do you feel?

952
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,333
-Are you prepared?
-You're smiling.

953
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,586
-Sir, please give us a word.
-Please tell us how you feel.

954
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,422
-Sir, how do you feel?
-Please tell us how you feel.

955
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,299
-Sir!
-Sir, please!

956
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,884
Please tell us how you feel.

957
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,929
Mr. Song, how did Lee Chang-jin end up
getting chosen as a witness?

958
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:31,307
The opposition party and Lee Seong-min
kept causing a fuss,

959
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,767
so I had no choice.

960
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,061
It's actually for the better.

961
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,772
I can use this chance
to resolve all the suspicions.

962
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,482
-It won't be that bad.
-But sir...

963
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,692
Is that the answer sheet?

964
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,569
Yes, sir.

965
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,242
Don't worry.
He won't say anything unnecessary.

966
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,302
What is it?

967
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,679
I don't have time to chat.

968
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,473
Tae-jun, how far are you involved
with Mr. Lee Chang-jin?

969
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,018
Let's talk about this next time.

970
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,520
We need to talk now.

971
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,107
Tell me what kind of deal
you had with him.

972
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,945
There's a copy of the CCTV footage.

973
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,530
Where is the copy?

974
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,698
I have it.

975
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,783
I'll give it to you

976
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,036
when I join the National Assembly.

977
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,250
I've already told you everything.

978
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,048
It's the questionnaire
from Mr. Ahn's office.

979
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,967
Read what's written on it.

980
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,844
MR. SONG, ARE YOU AWARE

981
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,096
MR. JANG USED YOUR AUTHORITY
TO THREATEN MR. LEE CHANG-JIN?

982
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,183
Mr. Ahn is one of Mr. Song's closest men.

983
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,478
He wouldn't have added this question
without discussing it with Mr. Song.

984
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,439
Your name is being mentioned here.

985
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,774
It's weird enough
that Mr. Lee got picked as a witness.

986
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,777
They're trying to blame you
for all the suspicions regarding Mr. Song.

987
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:11,115
They're going to make it
look like it was all your doing.

988
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,577
We will now begin

989
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,787
the hearing for the nominee
for the Minister of Justice

990
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:21,042
based on Article 65, Clause 2
of the National Assembly Act and Article 4

991
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,586
of the Personnel Hearing Act.

992
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:25,588
CABINET MEMBER NOMINEE

993
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,758
During my 20 years as a prosecutor,

994
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,134
I felt rewarded that I was able

995
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,261
to fight against injustice

996
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,513
and take care of people who had to suffer.

997
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,974
And during the past 10 years
as an assemblyman,

998
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,435
I stuck by my belief and worked very hard

999
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:43,230
to protect liberal democracy
and bring order and righteousness

1000
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,566
to our national law.

1001
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,234
If this question gets asked,

1002
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,779
Mr. Song will only be left
with one choice.

1003
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,405
He'll discard me.

1004
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,909
The people of our country
have constantly been disappointed

1005
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,912
because of the Ministry of Justice
and the prosecution.

1006
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,457
And I'm very well aware
that they're seeking for a reformation

1007
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,710
within the Ministry of Justice
and the prosecution.

1008
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,171
Thus, I believe the Ministry of Justice
and the prosecution

1009
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:10,758
-must look back on their faults
-What a smooth talker.

1010
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,804
and be determined to change
and start anew.

1011
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,932
If I become the Minister of Justice,

1012
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:22,853
I will make sure the Ministry of Justice
becomes an organization that is just.

1013
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:27,566
If I'm given the opportunity
to serve as the Minister of Justice,

1014
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,736
I will work hard to serve my country
and its people

1015
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,197
in the best way that I can.

1016
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,199
Thank you.

1017
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,527
Even a tiger eats its own cub
if it's cornered.

1018
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,903
He's trying to put all the blame on me.

1019
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,656
He was planning
to pin everything on Tae-jun.

1020
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,867
The authority has put out an APB
on Mr. Jang.

1021
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,785
We won't be able to save Tae-jun.

1022
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,163
Let's stop here.
He's too big of a fish for us to catch.

1023
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,999
-Let's start with this.
-Let's try everything we can.

1024
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,668
Find Jang Tae-jun
and bring him to me right now!

1025
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,587
Will Mr. Song let you?

1026
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,923
I'll show you what happens

1027
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,300
when you treat me with arrogance.

1028
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,053
I'll bite off the tiger's neck
if I have to.

1029
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,202
