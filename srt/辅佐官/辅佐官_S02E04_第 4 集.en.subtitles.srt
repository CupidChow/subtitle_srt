1
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,272
Stop!

2
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,024
-Let go!
-What are you doing?

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,902
If the process wasn't right,
the result won't be right either.

4
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,695
Do you have to win by all means?

5
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,531
Is that so important?
It's more important to win.

6
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,492
You said you wanted to change the world.

7
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,952
You must win to be able to do anything.

8
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,459
Watch out!

9
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,463
Remember the people before the law!

10
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,758
You stopped seeing those people
because you're blinded by political games!

11
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,969
If Assemblyman Song is appointed minister
and supports those bastards,

12
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,305
more people will lose their lives.

13
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,682
Is that the kind of world
you wish to create?

14
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,312
Do you think revealing the truth
will change anything?

15
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,148
-What?
-Whining and complaining

16
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,817
won't change anything.

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,820
Right. That's why we must fight.

18
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,489
Yes! We must fight! We must fight and win!

19
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,494
If you want to win, you shouldn't engage
in a fight you're bound to lose.

20
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,829
You couldn't even stop me.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,914
You're an independent
first-term assemblyman.

22
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,250
How are you going to fight against them?

23
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,919
ENFORCEMENT

24
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,174
You bastard, you gathered all of us here!

25
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,176
What kind of ruse is this?

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,596
Do you even know
what we've been through to get this far?

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,848
Let go!

28
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,892
Let's hurry to the market!

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,147
You said you were on our side.
How could you do this?

30
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,274
We're not going to back down!

31
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,775
Mr. Jang.

32
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,197
Mr. Jang.

33
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,723
I've never given in to
any humiliation or pain so far.

34
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,685
A world where everyone
gets equal opportunities.

35
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,021
A world where we can all stand tall.

36
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,358
A world where we can make
our dreams come true if we work hard.

37
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,111
A world, which we can pass down
to our future generations

38
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,571
without feeling ashamed.

39
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,032
I will create such a world.

40
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,493
I, Jang Tae-jun, will create
a world like that with all of you.

41
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,245
My goals have been clear.

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,456
-My faith has been unshakable.
-Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun

43
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,459
of the Daehan Party has violated
the Public Official Election Act.

44
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,962
The Election Committee found out
that Assemblyman Jang's father accepted

45
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,924
donations which were actually bribes

46
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,218
in exchange for favors
during the by-election campaign

47
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,055
and requested the Seoul Central
Prosecutors' Office to investigate.

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,515
According to our source
from the Committee,

49
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,975
-Assemblyman Jang's father
-Yet...

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,061
took bribes from his friends
on several occasions.

51
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,357
...a part of my past I've been neglecting
has eventually caught up with me.

52
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:01,491
EPISODE 4 ACHILLES TENDON

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,876
No evidence was found?

54
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,461
Okay. Thanks.

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,591
I know you specialize in
legal issues concerning the environment.

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,263
Many have fallen victim
including ones from seven years ago.

57
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,515
Okay.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,308
Yes.

59
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,187
I'll send over some information.
Please look through it.

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,563
Thank you.

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,026
I've been sharing information
about the Joojin Chemical incident

62
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,112
with some civic groups that offered help.

63
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,738
How was your visit?

64
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,699
I can't say anything for sure,

65
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,536
but it seems like the whole village
has been contaminated with the chemicals.

66
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,039
Mr. Han is interviewing the residents.

67
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,834
By the way, I got a call
from the police station.

68
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,547
They say it'll be hard
to track down who broke into your place.

69
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,758
They also can't question
Mr. Lee right now.

70
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,429
As expected.

71
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,514
First floor.

72
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,019
-Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun's office.
-Like I said, it's not true.

73
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,854
-It's not true.
-Okay.

74
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,272
-Just a second.
-All right.

75
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,440
Please hold.

76
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,400
-I'll call you back.
-Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun's office.

77
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,193
Yes. Okay.

78
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,418
FATHER

79
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,463
How could you publicize
unconfirmed information like that?

80
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,173
-Hello?
-Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun's office.

81
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,091
We don't know the whole story yet.

82
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,385
-We're looking into it now. Okay.
-Yes.

83
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,304
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office?

84
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,515
We should do something
about these articles first.

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,225
I see. Thank you.

86
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,770
Please call again later.

87
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,106
AUNT

88
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,320
Aunt.

89
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,617
Okay. How's Father?

90
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,038
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

91
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,001
Okay.

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
I'll come visit soon.

93
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,347
Mr. Jang,
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

94
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,557
will search and seize your father's home.

95
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,442
If Mr. Lee had to go this far,

96
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,571
couldn't it be possible
that he's the one behind Mr. Go's death?

97
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,452
But that doesn't mean that I think
Mr. Jang is unrelated to Mr. Go's death.

98
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,163
In any case, Mr. Jang is

99
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,041
one of the people
who benefited from Mr. Go's death.

100
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,794
I know.

101
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,963
I have to ask you this.

102
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,382
Do you intend to continue
working with Mr. Jang?

103
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,558
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because you'll look at me that way.

104
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,104
-What?
-You think I killed Seok-man.

105
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,027
Let's wait and see
what Mr. Jang does next.

106
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,449
-Mr. Jang, please come out!
-Please say something!

107
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,452
-Did your father accept bribes?
-Did you know about it?

108
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,328
Tell us what kind of favors were asked.

109
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,164
I'm still figuring out the facts myself.

110
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,291
I'll cooperate with
any necessary investigations.

111
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,003
If the allegations turn out to be true,
I'll take full responsibility for it.

112
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,129
How much did he receive?

113
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,548
-Were you aware of it?
-What were the special favors?

114
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,258
-Say something!
-How much did he receive?

115
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,677
-Mr. Jang!
-Please answer my question!

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
-Please!
-How big were the bribes?

117
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,680
-Mr. Jang!
-Mr. Jang!

118
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,849
-Mr. Jang!
-Say something!

119
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,447
Did Minister Song do this?

120
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,324
I bet.

121
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,451
How's it going in Seongjin?

122
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,704
Mr. Ahn has made some progress
in persuading the residents.

123
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,623
I want him and Mr. Jeong in Seoul
by tomorrow.

124
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,666
The explanatory materials
for the prosecution too.

125
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,210
Mr. Jang.

126
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,838
If the prosecution concludes
the Election Act was violated,

127
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,007
you might lose your seat in the Assembly.

128
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,846
How about we put off dealing with
the Joojin Chemical issue for now?

129
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
Hye-won.

130
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,977
I don't want to do anything

131
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,980
I'll regret later again.

132
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,491
Regarding the alleged violation
of the Election Act,

133
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,784
Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun...

134
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,411
Things aren't going well for Mr. Jang.

135
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,164
-...allegations of bribery...
-Wouldn't this

136
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,958
hinder our investigation
on Joojin Chemical?

137
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,502
Let's focus on what we can do.

138
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,464
Please bring me the list
of the organizations that offered help.

139
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,050
-Yes, ma'am.
-Assemblyman Jang's father is alleged

140
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,178
to have accepted bribes,
which goes against

141
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,846
the Public Official Election Act.

142
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,866
Why didn't you answer the phone
if you were home?

143
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,454
The prosecutors wouldn't stop calling me,
so I turned off the phone.

144
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,964
So what did you do?

145
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,009
Tell me. How much did you receive,
and from whom?

146
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,554
-Nothing like that ever happened.
-Tell me!

147
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,763
I said, it didn't happen!

148
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,977
Do you think I'd do anything
that'd stain your reputation?

149
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,020
Father!

150
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,192
The village head and some neighbors
did come over

151
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,778
and ask a few small favors
a couple of times.

152
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,740
It was after you won the election,

153
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,991
so I couldn't ignore them.

154
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,578
They all voted for you
and even helped out with the campaign.

155
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,414
So?

156
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,917
-So what?
-Did you take the money?

157
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,711
I didn't take any money!

158
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,297
Why would I risk ruining my son's future
for chump change?

159
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,507
If you don't trust me, ask the neighbors!

160
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,968
How can you not trust your own father?

161
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,976
Then again,
you've never had any trust in me.

162
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,690
The prosecution will do
a search and seizure.

163
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,903
I can take care of it.
You have to stay silent.

164
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,821
Be my guest!

165
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,283
I'm not afraid of anything!
I didn't do anything wrong!

166
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,035
They can search and seize all they want!

167
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,957
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

168
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,461
Please cooperate.

169
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

170
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,026
Thank you for your answers.
I'll be in touch.

171
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,444
Thank you.

172
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,283
Hello, Ms. Lee.

173
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,370
All the residents I've talked to
are in similar situations.

174
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,205
The severity may vary,

175
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,375
but most of them are suffering from
respiratory diseases and skin rashes.

176
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,504
Some were not home,
so I left my phone number.

177
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,257
I'll e-mail you
the answers I've received so far.

178
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,093
Hello? Is anybody home?

179
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,813
I'm looking into Joojin Chemical's
chemical exposure incident.

180
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,024
I'd love to talk with you. Please call me.

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,409
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG SUSPECTED OF
VIOLATING THE ELECTION ACT

182
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,666
INTERROGATION REPORT

183
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,007
SEOUL CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

184
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,093
The seized material
is being reviewed right now.

185
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,928
Anything in his bank accounts?

186
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,055
Nothing noteworthy, as of now.

187
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,057
Have you found out
who reported to the Committee?

188
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,476
-Yes.
-Who was it?

189
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,561
It was Oh Won-sik.

190
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,648
Minister Song's chief of staff?

191
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,444
Yes. He even submitted testimonies
of the people who offered Mr. Jang money

192
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,154
to the Election Committee.

193
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,240
Summon Mr. Oh as a testifier.

194
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,993
He works for the minister.
Shouldn't we tread carefully...

195
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,874
-He's abroad anyway.
-What do you mean?

196
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,501
He left for the Philippines yesterday

197
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,252
after informing the Committee.

198
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,550
Bring the material
that he gave the Committee to my office.

199
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,260
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,069
JANG SUSPECTED OF VIOLATING ELECTION ACT

201
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,499
Seung-u.

202
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,669
Can you tell me who covers
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office?

203
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,215
Yes. I need some information
about an investigation.

204
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,759
Thanks.

205
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,644
I'm back.

206
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,565
Did you meet the couple
Ms. Park Hee-jin's father talked about?

207
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,985
No. There was no one home,
so I just left a note.

208
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,239
-Let me know when they call.
-Sure.

209
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,576
Ms. Yun.

210
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,798
I saw the article about Mr. Jang.

211
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,842
If it turns out to be true,

212
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,262
he might have to step down, right?

213
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,683
It's not true, so don't worry.

214
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,274
How can you trust him so completely?

215
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,655
I know your opinion about him.

216
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,200
But there's more than meets the eye.

217
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,125
I'm not so sure what he's really like.

218
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,545
After driving out
the Seobuk Market vendors,

219
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,007
he now stands up to Minister Song?

220
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,178
I don't understand.

221
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,273
You need power to be able to fight.

222
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,110
That's why Mr. Jang has been trying
to gain power.

223
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,366
He does feel bad
about what happened to Seobuk Market.

224
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,371
He's aware that it can't be undone.

225
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,125
I think he deserves a chance
to feel less guilty about what he did.

226
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,260
If you want to understand him better,
visit Seobuk Market.

227
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,687
If he turns out to have violated
the Public Official Election Act,

228
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,647
his election will be declared invalid

229
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,607
and he'll lose his seat
in the Assembly, right?

230
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,695
After all he's been through,
I doubt he'll go down so easily.

231
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,947
I guess you're right.

232
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,824
Have you found out anything
about Ms. Kang?

233
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,911
Yes. She's been working on
the Occupational Health and Safety Bill,

234
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,665
and Mr. Ahn submitted
the exact same bill today.

235
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,083
Mr. Ahn?

236
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,503
Yes. With Mr. Lee involved,

237
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,131
Mr. Song seems to be paying
special attention.

238
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,259
Also, rumor has it
that Ms. Kang is setting up

239
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,594
an investigation committee
on the Joojin Chemical incident.

240
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,850
Busy time for Mr. Song.

241
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,812
Going after Jang Tae-jun
and cleaning up after Lee Chang-jin.

242
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,148
Exactly.

243
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,819
Minister Song would like to see you
when you get back.

244
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,362
All right.

245
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,203
Someone's getting anxious.

246
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,205
The fox has started crying.

247
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,710
This is getting interesting.

248
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,424
You didn't have to prepare all this.

249
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,260
A simple drink would've been fine for me.

250
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,555
You're dealing with important matters.
This is the least I can do for you.

251
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,224
Please.

252
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,151
By the way, shouldn't Jang Tae-jun
be arrested and investigated?

253
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,903
What's the hurry?

254
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,447
He's a rat in a trap now.

255
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,827
Jang Tae-jun and Kang Seon-yeong are
digging into Joojin Chemical,

256
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,579
and it's making me uneasy.

257
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,664
If they find anything on us,

258
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,209
Jang Tae-jun will take advantage of it
to save his ass.

259
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,796
You should strike while the iron is hot

260
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,631
and search and seize his office.

261
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,592
While you're at it, take away
all the data about my company too.

262
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,353
It's not what I think.

263
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,524
It looks like it's been bothering
Chairman Sung a little.

264
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,947
What is this?

265
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,492
Chief Choe sure doesn't know
how to get things done!

266
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,245
He should've taken care of these matters

267
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,163
before it ended up in your hands.

268
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,709
I sure have heard a thing or two
about Chief Choe.

269
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,545
But no way.

270
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,715
You're the Minister of Justice,
with the prosecution under your command.

271
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,218
He'll have to listen to you, won't he?

272
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,722
Things will settle down soon.

273
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,559
Give my regards to Chairman Sung.

274
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:09,189
Sure. Then I'll consider it settled.

275
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,943
Well, cheers.

276
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,904
All right.

277
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,702
-Come take a look!
-Try it!

278
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,704
-It's tasty, take some!
-Come here!

279
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,372
Have a seat here.

280
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,790
Move over a bit.

281
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,626
-Are you eating something without me?
-My goodness.

282
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,212
I can't believe you guys.

283
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,715
-That's not it.
-Hey!

284
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,509
Try these rice cakes.

285
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,178
-Hello.
-Oh, my.

286
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,096
-Hello.
-It's been a while.

287
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,182
-Have you been well?
-Yes. Oh, my.

288
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,892
-Where's Ok-ja?
-Over there.

289
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,809
She's over there.

290
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,145
-Thanks.
-Ok-ja!

291
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,938
Ok-ja, try these rice cakes.

292
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,149
-I'm fine.
-You can have them.

293
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,734
-Thanks.
-Enjoy.

294
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,277
-Ok-ja.
-Oh, my.

295
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,446
Look who's here.

296
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,656
I'm sorry it took me so long.
Have you been well?

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,283
Of course.

298
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,495
It's so nice to see you.
It looks like you're doing well.

299
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,290
-You look like you're doing well too.
-I do?

300
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,753
I've been very worried,
but everyone seems to be doing fine.

301
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,379
When our market got torn down,

302
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,382
we were all worried about our future.

303
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,677
But now that we can sell things here,
everyone's happy.

304
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,512
It's a huge relief.

305
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,265
In the old days,
we'd get kicked out and that'd be it.

306
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,895
It's so nice to see you.

307
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,910
I heard about your father.

308
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,206
What are you going to do?

309
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,625
Submit explanatory materials
to the prosecution.

310
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,586
Focus on solving your problem for now.

311
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,880
I can deal with Joojin Chemical alone.

312
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,257
I'll find a way

313
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,884
to solve my problem.

314
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,596
The Joojin Chemical case
can't be put off any longer.

315
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:05,889
Tae-jun.

316
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,559
Not even Mr. Song
could stand up to the Assembly alone.

317
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,604
We need the Assembly's help.

318
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,859
You want to launch a National Assembly
Audit on Joojin Chemical?

319
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,078
The members of the Assembly are hesitating
even to join the investigation committee.

320
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,414
To start an audit,

321
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,416
we need their consent.

322
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,377
This will attract
much more publicity than the committee.

323
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,129
I'm sure there are members who want to be

324
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,839
noticed before the legislative election.

325
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,551
Let's start with
the opposition party members.

326
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,804
They wouldn't say no
to putting pressure on the government.

327
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,350
I'll start meeting with them.

328
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,019
We need help from the press too.

329
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,563
That'll help us get
the Assembly members' consent.

330
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,232
I'll gather information on the victims

331
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,402
and prepare a press release
and a press conference.

332
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,869
Are you okay?

333
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,542
I gave up everything to get here.

334
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,672
I can't let this bring me down.

335
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,238
SUNG YEONG-GI, LEE CHANG-JIN,
SONG HUI-SEOP

336
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,339
CHOE GYEONG-CHEOL

337
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,471
CHOE GYEONG-CHEOL
CHIEF OF SEOUL CENTRAL PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

338
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,405
Mr. Jeong.

339
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,033
Are these all the articles
about the allegation so far?

340
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,411
Yes. Reporters have been calling
and asking if it's true.

341
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,163
Tell them we still don't know.

342
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,916
Reporters might find something
before we do,

343
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,001
-so keep an eye out for more articles.
-Yes, ma'am.

344
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,837
-Mr. Ahn.
-Yes.

345
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,257
Seongjin City promised to send over
all the complaints about Joojin Chemical.

346
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,342
-Has it arrived?
-Yes, here it is.

347
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,343
Thank you.

348
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,179
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

349
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,764
Ms. Yun.

350
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,890
Yes.

351
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,190
These are the complaints
about Joojin Chemical.

352
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,236
The victim was asleep
when the fire started...

353
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,530
Contact Seongjin City's
Environmental Policy Department

354
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,699
-and ask how these are being handled.
-Yes.

355
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,284
...about 50 residents...

356
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,451
The prosecution?

357
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,495
They're done interviewing your father
as a witness.

358
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,789
And it seems like they want to

359
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,041
arrest him as a suspect.

360
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,045
Next. Minister Song Hui-seop is visiting

361
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,423
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office
this morning

362
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,757
for the first time

363
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,093
since Choe Gyeong-cheol took charge.

364
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,763
According to the Ministry of Justice,
they'll be discussing

365
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,640
the organization of a prosecution team

366
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,518
dedicated to investigating
high-ranking officials.

367
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,021
Since his inauguration, Minister Song

368
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,107
has been urging strict investigations
of high-ranking officials

369
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,525
-in order to
-Welcome.

370
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,570
regain the public trust
in the prosecution.

371
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,654
They're chief prosecutors.

372
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,616
Chief Choe agrees on the need
for a thorough investigation

373
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,994
into the corruption
among high-ranking officials.

374
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,372
At this rate, you'll be summoned
as a witness too.

375
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,499
I doubt it'll end there.

376
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,336
What Mr. Song wants is
the data we have about Joojin Chemical.

377
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,714
If a search and seizure is conducted‚
all our plans will fall through.

378
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,011
Ms. Kang and I will try to
have the Assembly investigate.

379
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,679
Share all the information.

380
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,600
-Do we have enough time for that?
-We'll see what we can do.

381
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,894
Tell Mr. Yang to come see me.

382
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,356
Mr. Jang, we don't know
what kind of person he is--

383
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,484
Don't worry. I know.

384
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,111
Okay. I'll call him.

385
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,616
Let's do our best, everyone.

386
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,618
MINISTER SONG AND CHIEF CHOE'S
FIRST MEETING

387
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,078
Let's go in.

388
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:53,051
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

389
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,430
CHIEF CHOE GYEONG-CHEOL

390
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,685
How's the investigation
of Jang Tae-jun going?

391
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,104
We're comparing
the Election Committee's material

392
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,439
with Jang Chun-bae's testimony.

393
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,776
Jang Chun-bae's testimony
is not very credible,

394
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,278
so we're considering arrest...

395
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,493
I didn't ask about Jang Chun-bae.
I asked about Jang Tae-jun!

396
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,664
If we find anything suspicious
while investigating Jang Chun-bae,

397
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,000
we'll interview Assemblyman Jang
and his staff

398
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,751
as witnesses.

399
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,462
If we move forward
based on circumstantial evidence,

400
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,798
we'll be dragged into political issues.

401
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,969
Goodness.
Look, you're investigating a politician.

402
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,762
Of course it's a political issue.

403
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,681
Political reform

404
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,517
and eradication of corruption
among high-ranking officials.

405
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,938
To accomplish these tasks,
we need to make political moves too.

406
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,524
I'm

407
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,069
a prosecutor, not a politician.

408
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,197
So what?

409
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,535
Look.

410
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,415
When I put food in your mouth,
chew it carefully and swallow it.

411
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,500
Don't spit it back out.

412
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,465
If you want to
keep your position, that is.

413
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,219
But spoiled food gives you
an upset stomach.

414
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,139
Better safe than sorry.

415
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,730
Then I'll continue with the investigation
of Mr. Jang.

416
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,750
What a handful.

417
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,336
Where can I take you?

418
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,963
Hello, Mr. No. It's me.

419
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,802
Get in touch with some opposition party
members who are easy to talk to.

420
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,762
Yes. Okay.

421
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,727
-Why are we still here?
-I'm sorry.

422
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,354
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir.

423
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,899
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir.

424
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,663
-You can go ahead.
-Yes.

425
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,374
What's this?

426
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,876
It's from Seongjin City's
Public Service Center.

427
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,629
Residents in the vicinity of
Joojin Chemical

428
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,549
have been complaining
about their pains for years.

429
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,509
By interviewing them first,

430
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,052
we'll get the information faster.

431
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,055
Okay.

432
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,432
And...

433
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,606
-Hello.
-Hello.

434
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,826
He's Yang Jong-yeol, right?

435
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,164
Yes. He's been appointed a chief of staff.

436
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,957
Do you know him?

437
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,168
A little bit.

438
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,045
Are you aware he was the secretary
of Lee Jong-jin

439
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,839
of the Kookmin Party,
in the last Assembly?

440
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,676
Yes, I'm aware he participated
in the by-election campaign.

441
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,471
He was to be promoted to chief of staff
if Mr. Lee won.

442
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,306
He disappeared after Mr. Lee lost.

443
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,974
And look where he showed up now.

444
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,935
Keep an eye out.

445
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,813
He can be pretty sly.

446
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,774
He's ambitious too.

447
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,238
Hello.

448
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,449
-Ms. No, is everything okay?
-Yes.

449
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,286
Mr. Park, did you eat?

450
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,038
Yes.

451
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,168
Nice to meet you. I'm Yang Jong-yeol.
I look forward to working with you.

452
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,878
Nice to meet you too.

453
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,004
Mr. Yang.

454
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,842
Yes.

455
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,220
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

456
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,429
Come in.

457
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,266
Hello, Mr. Jang.

458
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,477
You called me earlier than I'd expected.

459
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,522
Did I surprise you?

460
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,941
I apologize. Have a seat.

461
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,359
Please don't apologize.

462
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,612
I'm just glad I can help you.

463
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,911
You were on the Judiciary Committee
in the last Assembly, correct?

464
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,287
Yes, I covered the Ministry of Justice,

465
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,039
Supreme Prosecutors' Office,
and Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

466
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,375
Do you know anyone
at Seoul District Prosecutors' Office?

467
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,630
Many of the prosecutors I know
have been transferred,

468
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,757
but I still know most
of the investigators there.

469
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,344
Is this about your father?

470
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,891
I actually did some digging.

471
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,769
It turns out to be
Mr. Song's chief of staff

472
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,856
that handed over the material
to the Election Committee.

473
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,402
Mr. Oh?

474
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:06,531
Yes. He doesn't seem to be
in the country at the moment.

475
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,117
He's somewhere abroad.

476
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,577
By the way,

477
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,372
the prosecution tracked
your father's bank accounts,

478
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,875
but no campaign fund was found.

479
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,835
That means

480
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,505
this whole thing
just might be Mr. Oh's craft,

481
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,257
in my opinion.

482
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,636
-Did you take the money?
-I didn't take any money!

483
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,222
Why would I risk ruining my son's future
for chump change?

484
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,433
If you don't trust me, ask the neighbors!

485
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,894
How can you not trust your own father?

486
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:42,191
I want to know more about the material
submitted to the Election Committee.

487
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,029
-Would that be possible?
-Of course.

488
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,242
All right.

489
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,954
-Thank you in advance.
-Don't mention it.

490
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,082
You're the man I serve now.
It's the least I can do.

491
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,545
-What about the meeting?
-We're ready, sir.

492
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,173
Call Assemblywoman Kang's office.

493
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,217
I'll get back to you
as soon as I have the file.

494
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,428
Sure, I'll be waiting.

495
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,063
Here.

496
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,900
The longer this takes,
the harder it'll be to request an audit.

497
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,694
We must gather how much damage
Joojin Chemical caused the residents

498
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,488
as fast as possible.

499
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,449
-Mr. Han, can you check for us again?
-Yes, ma'am.

500
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,575
We must also verify

501
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,702
soil, dust, streams,
and groundwater contamination.

502
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,163
Ms. Yun, you and Mr. Han.
Please collect samples

503
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,123
-and have them tested.
-Yes, sir.

504
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,917
Any word from Seongjin City?

505
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,086
This whole ordeal
is making them uncomfortable.

506
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,546
Its Chief of Environment keeps saying

507
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,923
that they couldn't ask everyone.

508
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:50,551
Then tell him that more trouble will ensue
if he doesn't cooperate.

509
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,887
He'll be called to the audit as a witness.

510
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,348
If he has something to say,
he should say it now.

511
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,018
-Mr. Park, you back him up on this.
-Yes, sir.

512
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,062
What about the civic groups?

513
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,481
Five places will support us.

514
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,191
We'll have a joint press conference.

515
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,444
They agree upon requesting an audit,

516
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,698
but we seem to be clashing
on some of the details.

517
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,782
We still need to mediate.

518
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,785
Attorney Heo Ji-su offered to help too.

519
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,538
-Did you call her?
-We'll meet her this afternoon.

520
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,166
Ms. Heo solved
the Changseok Refinery case last year.

521
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,918
She's a veteran of this field.

522
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,380
Ask what kind of resistance
she was met with

523
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,009
and what kinds of legal disputes
could arise in Seongjin City's case.

524
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,302
Make a checklist of what
we should prepare for.

525
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,263
Let's begin.

526
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,639
-Sure thing.
-Got it.

527
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,065
There were financial problems
in running another temporary site

528
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,400
for Seobuk Market.

529
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,987
Mr. Jang is the one
who solved that problem.

530
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,616
Mr. Jang.

531
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,333
It's nothing. Thank you for today.

532
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,258
How many assemblymen
are in favor of the audit?

533
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,011
A total of 61 agreed to attend,

534
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,929
but we still need 14 more.

535
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,058
There aren't any left
in the Kookmin Party to persuade,

536
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,685
and even with the entire count
of nonpartisans,

537
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,854
we'll still be eight short.

538
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,357
-We need Mr. Jo's help.
-Where is he?

539
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,277
He's back from a business trip,
but he's not in his office.

540
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,820
He's avoiding my calls too.

541
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,324
He knows that he holds the leverage.

542
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,951
I doubt he'd pass up
on a chance like this.

543
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,955
I'll try and persuade him myself.

544
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,624
How?

545
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,627
I'll give him what he wants.

546
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,096
I will wait at your office.

547
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,058
JANG TAE-JUN

548
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,191
It looks as though
you received some bad news.

549
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,944
News is never always good, right?

550
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,114
Why did you want to see me?

551
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,160
Assemblywoman Kang has been
causing a ruckus within the office

552
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,246
with the case of Joojin Chemical.

553
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,082
The nation isn't fully stable.

554
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,293
Wouldn't the National Assembly
do better without all this commotion?

555
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,337
But commotion is what we're made for.

556
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,465
Besides, she must be digging
because it's a serious matter.

557
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
Well,

558
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:41,264
can't the Environment and Labor Committee
quietly solve the issue?

559
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,605
You have quite a lot of unpaid bills
on my ledger.

560
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,234
Shouldn't you pay up first
and then ask for another favor?

561
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,905
I'm sure you're aware

562
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,949
that the prosecutor general's term
will soon end.

563
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,243
Yes, of course.

564
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,704
That's why you're holding

565
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:08,124
such a deep control over
the prosecutors' office.

566
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:15,339
I will appoint whomever you want
as the next prosecutor general.

567
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,341
Isn't that

568
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,219
more than enough to pay off my tab?

569
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,643
It's not safe to accept
even a promissory note.

570
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,896
A dishonored bill
is nothing but worthless.

571
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,816
Next time, instead of a promissory note,

572
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,943
bring me a leash.

573
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,113
Then I'll rethink your proposal.

574
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,076
Tae-jun will be dealt with within the day.

575
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,999
I'll bring you your leash once I'm done.

576
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,014
Send the file as soon as it's done.

577
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,307
Sure, you should get going.

578
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,976
- We'll get going, ma'am.
- Do well.

579
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,940
Mr. Lee, can you check

580
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,943
the schedules of the nonpartisan
and opposition party members?

581
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,944
Yes, ma'am.

582
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,468
Where should we go first?

583
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,181
There's a livestock farm
by the stream near Joojin Chemical.

584
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,518
That's where the most number of complaints
came from, so we'll go there first.

585
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,529
One or two kept dying each year
and now there are all I have left.

586
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,490
Now I don't have the money
to pay back my loan

587
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,076
and I'm sick and tired of burying them.

588
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,203
When did this all start?

589
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,415
It all began
when that chemical plant went up.

590
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,502
My cattle were fine before that, even
foot-and-mouth disease didn't affect them.

591
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,338
What good does
making formal complaints do?

592
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,425
All the city does is spray disinfectants.

593
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,176
Do you use groundwater?

594
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,304
Yes, it's the same for everyone here.

595
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,223
The stream provides water for the fields.

596
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,601
Could we collect soil and water samples
from near the farm?

597
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,389
-No, I'll do it.
-It's fine.

598
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,865
Watch your step.

599
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,294
Hello?

600
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,465
Yes, I'm Han Do-gyeong
from Assemblywoman Kang's office.

601
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,302
Yes, I'm in the neighborhood.
I'll be right there.

602
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,804
Sure.

603
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,099
It's the couple that we couldn't reach.

604
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,476
They're at home right now.

605
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,236
Our neighbor told us.

606
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,613
He said there's another reason

607
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,158
why Hee-jin and his wife is sick.

608
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,785
Is that true?

609
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,247
We're not 100 percent sure,
but that's what we suspect.

610
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,625
We're currently investigating the case.

611
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,335
Is Joojin Chemical at fault?

612
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,965
It said on the memo that
you're investigating them.

613
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,883
Everything's still a presumption,

614
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,679
but their symptoms match those
of Joojin Chemical's other victims.

615
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,266
We think it was the same cause.

616
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,526
I miscarried four times.

617
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,613
Everyone told me to give up,

618
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,740
but I couldn't.

619
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,914
I thought I was the problem but...

620
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,166
The doctor delivered
the diagnosis yesterday.

621
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,752
She has blood cancer.

622
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,638
-Sir, you're back.
-Is he here?

623
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,181
Yes.

624
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,480
You're late, sir.

625
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,029
You want me to agree to the audit?

626
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,364
Yes.

627
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,159
Assemblywoman Kang
will submit a request for an audit.

628
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,996
You have enough power as the head
of the Emergency Planning Committee.

629
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,250
I guess I do.

630
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,920
However, didn't I tell you that
you can't swerve the ship any way you want

631
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,506
just because you're holding the helm?

632
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,841
Threatening me

633
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,885
won't do any good for you.

634
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,679
Read the situation properly.

635
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,098
Who can possibly help you survive this?

636
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,768
Are you offering to vote against
the motion to arrest?

637
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:49,024
Well, that depends on
what you choose to do.

638
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,778
You're running out of time though.

639
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,990
You know Minister Song
isn't the type to just wait around.

640
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,578
You have no idea, do you?

641
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,080
What's happening in the press room?

642
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,796
I am No Seung-jin of the Kookmin Party.

643
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,007
Even though the circumstances indicate

644
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,426
that Assemblyman Jang
has violated the election law,

645
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,886
the prosecution has yet
to begin an investigation.

646
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,473
Mr. Jang was the Minister of Justice's

647
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,100
former chief of staff.

648
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,518
If Minister Song ordered

649
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,895
a delay in the investigation
because of their relationship,

650
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,608
it is a clear collusion between
the National Assembly and the prosecution.

651
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,444
It is a serious case
of disloyalty in regards to the public

652
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,446
and a violation of constitutionalism.

653
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,742
That is why I firmly request
Assemblyman Jang

654
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,245
to step down from his position
and hand in his badge.

655
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,291
Why was the investigation delayed?

656
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,834
Did you purposely order a delay?

657
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,503
Is it because Mr. Jang
was your chief of staff?

658
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,011
This morning,
I met with the Chief Prosecutor

659
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,222
and talked about the investigation

660
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,683
into Assemblyman Jang.

661
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,811
I'm sure you have many doubts

662
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,981
because Assemblyman Jang
was my chief of staff.

663
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,359
I urged him

664
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,778
to do his due diligence,
so that no one questions

665
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,279
the outcome of the investigation.

666
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,990
The Chief Prosecutor gave me his word.

667
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,660
I apologize to the public

668
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,827
for causing such doubt.

669
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,038
I kindly ask for your patience.

670
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,291
MINISTER SONG ORDERS
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION ON JANG TAE-JUN

671
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,211
Song Hui-seop asked
the opposition party for help

672
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,712
to catch a viper.

673
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,091
I guess he must be scared of you.

674
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,847
Mr. Jang, I'll be the one
to save your neck this time,

675
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,600
so hand over everything you have.

676
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,103
Make this audit happen

677
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,814
and I'll hand over
everything I have on you.

678
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,649
Once the audit begins,

679
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,609
Minister Song will not escape unscathed.

680
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,820
Isn't that what you want too?

681
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,201
Still, I can't do you a favor
while you have me on a leash.

682
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,454
Strangle a dog by the neck

683
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,790
and even it will bite its owner.

684
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,042
Then I'll get you a new owner.

685
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,881
I'll hand over your leash
to Minister Song.

686
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,926
Once he has it,
he won't let you keep your position

687
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,886
as head of
the Emergency Planning Committee.

688
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,522
Isn't that the same for you too?

689
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,067
You won't survive
in the lion's den either.

690
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,946
Not to mention the prosecution getting
what you have on me in the investigation.

691
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,614
You see,

692
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,702
going from a mere testifier to a suspect
can happen instantly.

693
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,289
I can handle myself.

694
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:57,963
Fine.

695
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,799
I'll accept your offer.

696
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,344
We'll talk again after you survive
the prosecution's questioning.

697
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,264
Good.

698
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,683
Make the audit happen

699
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,853
and I will return your leash back to you.

700
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,987
Just what the hell is he all about?

701
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,698
I just don't get him.

702
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,286
Sir, what should we do?

703
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,830
CHIEF CHOE GYEONG-CHEOL

704
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,843
The Chief Prosecutor is handling
Assemblyman Jang's case personally,

705
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,929
so it's difficult to track the progress.

706
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,224
Prosecutor Yun
might know something though.

707
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,476
He's not fond of me.

708
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,728
Then give him a gift.

709
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,982
MINISTER SONG ORDERS
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION ON JANG TAE-JUN

710
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,276
Isn't it over for Jang Tae-jun now?

711
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,529
I doubt this new gig of yours
will pan out,

712
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,365
so get on Prosecutor Yun's good side

713
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,741
and work for the prosecution.

714
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,118
What's promising about
being a chief of staff anyway?

715
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,372
You're right.
I'll lose another job at this rate.

716
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,415
This is my first day at work, too.

717
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,026
Mr. Yun.

718
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,656
I'm Yang Jong-yeol,
a former member of Lee Jong-jin's office.

719
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,409
-It's been a while.
-Sure. Whatever.

720
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,412
Mr. Yun,

721
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,957
I'm now working for another assemblyman.

722
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,917
Like I care.

723
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,754
It's Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun.

724
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,143
Yes, Ms. No. I just got back.

725
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,065
Sure. I'm on my way up.

726
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,614
MINISTER SONG ORDERS
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION ON JANG

727
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,201
MINISTER SONG ORDERS
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION ON JANG

728
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,878
How long will it take
to finalize the audit request?

729
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,468
Additional material is needed
before we can announce it.

730
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,803
We also need a report
on the contamination level.

731
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,389
The prosecution will soon serve a warrant

732
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,099
and seize everything I have.

733
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,186
That will include the files
I'm collecting for the audit.

734
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,237
I will hand over all my documents.
You can take it from here.

735
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,492
What do you plan on doing?

736
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,287
I'm going to enter the lion's den.

737
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,791
This is the only way to persuade

738
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,001
Assemblyman Jo.

739
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,338
This is as far as I can go,

740
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,423
so take care of the rest.

741
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,386
This audit must happen no matter what.

742
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,975
Sir, are you heading
to the prosecutors' office?

743
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,602
-Yes.
-If you do,

744
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,939
Minister Song will do everything he can
to keep you locked up.

745
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,608
I can't take another step
before my name is cleared.

746
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,277
-I must make the first move.
-But sir...

747
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,655
Send them the bank records
and explanatory materials.

748
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,741
Then help Ms. Kang finalize the request

749
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,535
for an audit.

750
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,955
And when it's time, do as I told you.

751
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,589
Sir...

752
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,341
CHOE GYEONG-CHEOL

753
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,970
Jang Tae-jun of the Daehan Party
who is being accused

754
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,680
of accepting campaign contributions,

755
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,058
voluntarily appeared at
the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

756
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,768
If all accusations
are revealed to be true,

757
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,062
Assemblyman Jang could lose his position

758
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,355
which is why...

759
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,649
He voluntarily walked into his grave.

760
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,944
I wonder what tricks he'll pull
to get out of this mess.

761
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,196
-Any comments, sir?
-Assemblyman Jang!

762
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,948
-Over here!
-Please tell us...

763
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:38,118
We were just about to pick you up,
but you came first.

764
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,996
We're busy as it is,
so I thought I'd save some time.

765
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,583
Can I meet my father
before the questioning?

766
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,168
Sure.

767
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,307
Are you all right?

768
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,478
I don't have a reason not to be.

769
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,856
Why did you come here?

770
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,275
Your ride is waiting out front.

771
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,487
You can stay at your sister's
for the time being.

772
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,821
What?

773
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,575
Am I allowed to leave?

774
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,285
Yes.

775
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,662
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

776
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,705
Go on.

777
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,720
Father,

778
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,269
I believed in you from the very beginning.

779
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,482
I'm sorry for putting you
through this ordeal.

780
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,572
Nonsense!

781
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,746
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

782
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,337
Shall we begin then?

783
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,810
How many victims do we know about so far?

784
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,021
Here you go.

785
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,648
We have logged 37 residents

786
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,776
that are sick
or showing any kind of symptoms.

787
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,321
And 61 families are suffering from
bad crops and livestock casualties.

788
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,450
Ms. Lee, can you call Attorney Heo

789
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,369
and report what we know
regarding the damages?

790
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,746
-Please ask for guidance.
-Got it.

791
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,748
What did the trace analysis show?

792
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,667
We had three separate labs run the test.

793
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,253
Traces of dichloromethane
and formaldehyde was found

794
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,922
which normally cause problems
in the respiratory system.

795
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,258
In severe cases,
they can lead to heart damage and cancer.

796
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,176
The picture is getting
clearer by the second.

797
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,139
Can you collect everything we discussed
into one file?

798
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,307
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

799
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,393
When you're making the file,
be sure to include...

800
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,104
Check if anything is missing.

801
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,656
You keep giving me the same answer.

802
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,576
Well, you keep asking the same question.

803
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,495
You seem very confident.

804
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,708
Anyway, I read the files you sent over.

805
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,919
They were sorted out neatly.

806
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,170
I should reconsider

807
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,381
serving the search and seizure warrant.

808
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,092
If I'm at fault, go ahead and arrest me.

809
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,303
I wave my right to not be arrested.

810
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,141
I'm sure you already know

811
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,687
that this battle isn't between you and me.

812
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,231
It's between me and Minister Song.

813
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,108
Right.

814
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,446
That's why I feel so shitty.

815
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,492
Do you know why Minister Song is after me?

816
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,327
I don't want to know.

817
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,955
Like I said,
I'm not interested in politics.

818
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,876
A man investigating politicians
has no interest in politics?

819
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,878
That's hilarious.

820
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,217
You are well trusted
within the prosecutors' office.

821
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,843
You're known

822
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,471
as a solid rock
who'd never give in to pressure.

823
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,474
It's odd

824
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,685
how a man like that
became Minister Song's lapdog.

825
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,688
Mr. Jang.

826
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,024
That's a punch to your pride, isn't it?

827
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,277
Let me offer you a chance.

828
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,155
A chance for you to keep your honor.

829
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,513
Let me be the one to offer you a chance.

830
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:12,267
Admit to all the charges
and I'll be as lenient as I can.

831
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,935
I already gave my statement.

832
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,150
There's a file missing
from those you send over.

833
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,738
The record of your safety-deposit box.

834
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,746
Hurry.

835
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,058
What are you hiding in that safe of yours?

836
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,815
People like you

837
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,153
take everything you want for yourselves

838
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,322
but pretend to be righteous on the outside

839
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,908
saying gibberish
like everyone deserves a fair chance

840
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,994
even though you can't keep that promise.

841
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,579
Like I said before,

842
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,874
I'm putting trash in the trashcan.

843
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:28,009
I worked under Minister Song
for four years.

844
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,805
There is a lot I learned.

845
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,393
You're a prosecutor
who is known to be by the book,

846
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,397
so I wondered why you've been
pushing this groundless investigation.

847
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,067
You're trying to clear your name

848
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,486
as a political prosecutor.

849
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,656
Aren't I right?

850
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,910
What are you getting at?

851
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,622
Go ahead and check
what's in my safety-deposit box.

852
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,469
Open what's inside.

853
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:18,059
PROSECUTOR: SONG HUI-SEOP

854
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,522
SUNG YEONG-GI OF YOUNGIL GROUP
CLEARED FROM SUSPICION

855
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,191
Proof of Mr. Song's connection
to Chairman Sung of Youngil Group,

856
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,318
the latter's slush fund,

857
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,486
corruption by Lee Chang-jin

858
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,613
and Ahn Hyeon-min, Lee Sang-guk
of the Daehan Party,

859
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,199
and No Seung-jin of the Kookmin Party
are in that envelope.

860
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,660
Shortly, the news will report

861
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,621
that the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
received those files.

862
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,499
And when it's time, do as I told you.

863
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,342
-Hurry.
-Got it.

864
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,894
THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT

865
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,777
The search and seizure
has been carried out.

866
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,494
I'm sending you an email right now.

867
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,995
Can you write up an article?

868
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,123
Right.

869
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,337
If you continue to investigate me

870
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,714
when there's proof
of Minister Song's corruption,

871
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,841
what will the people think?

872
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,928
Your nickname for being

873
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,555
a political prosecutor

874
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,058
won't go away any time soon.

875
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:45,396
Why are you handing me these files?

876
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,317
The world you want
isn't that different from the one I want.

877
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,404
Trash belongs in the trashcan.

878
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,032
The choice is yours.

879
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,409
Either choose your honor as a prosecutor

880
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,745
or live as a lapdog of the man in power.

881
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,889
"IF THE NATION IS RIGHTEOUS,
THE WILL OF GOD FAVORS IT

882
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,183
IF THE GOVERNMENT IS RIGHTEOUS,
ITS PEOPLE ARE AT PEACE"

883
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,063
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

884
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,899
-Did you admit to the charges?
-What did you discuss?

885
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,318
Is there a reason
for this long duration of questioning?

886
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,696
How do you feel right now?
Could you say a few words?

887
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,864
I answered the questions truthfully.

888
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,410
If the prosecution
doesn't falter from outside pressure

889
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,704
and carry out a thorough
and truthful investigation,

890
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,456
the truth will be revealed faster
than you think.

891
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,876
I urge the office
to look under every rock.

892
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:53,715
Show the public that power and money
can't buy the prosecution.

893
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:58,219
I ask the prosecution to be a force

894
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:02,056
that meets the expectation of the public.

895
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,183
Thank you.

896
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,977
Did you admit to the charges then?

897
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,521
Assemblyman Jang of the Daehan Party

898
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,107
who is being accused
of violating the election law

899
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,901
left the prosecutors' office
after four hours of questioning.

900
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:17,697
Mr. Jang stated that
a solid and honest investigation

901
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,408
by the prosecutors' office
will soon reveal

902
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,827
-the actual truth.
-Choe Gyeong-cheol, you bastard.

903
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,622
What the fuck have you done?

904
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,540
A thorough investigation...

905
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,293
You're talented, I give you that.

906
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,253
You actually survived the questioning.

907
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,466
Meanwhile, Assemblyman Jang's father

908
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,843
also left the prosecutors' office
after being questioned.

909
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,596
A request for an audit.

910
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,806
I am Kang Seon-yeong of the Daehan Party.

911
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,975
I urge an audit to be held

912
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,187
in order to seek the truth
regarding the chemical spill

913
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,730
authorized by Joojin Chemical

914
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,982
and help their victims.

915
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,777
This audit must happen

916
01:00:55,902 --> 01:01:00,156
for them to stop ignoring
the pain and suffering of their victims.

917
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,368
We must not wait any longer.

918
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,037
We must conduct this audit

919
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,624
to figure out the truth
behind the chemical spill.

920
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,502
-Over here!
-A word, sir.

921
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,463
-Sir, any words?
-Sir!

922
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,964
Please say something.

923
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,050
-Sir!
-Over here.

924
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,719
What was the reason for this questioning?

925
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:29,060
A fatal shot
that pierced through an Achilles' heel.

926
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,572
The tables have turned,

927
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,662
and the once sturdy wall
is slowly seeing cracks.

928
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,946
A storm is imminent.
You should brace yourself.

929
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,532
I've set up the dance floor,
so put on a show.

930
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,452
I'll teach you
what a Minister of Justice is capable of.

931
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,246
I must get my hands
on Jo Gap-yeong's leash.

932
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,665
We must end this before
Lee Chang-jin destroys the evidence.

933
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,252
I guess I should make sure
you understand me then.

934
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,421
I think Minister Song is up to something.

935
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,423
Ms. Lee!

936
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,967
Tae-jun, you should've known

937
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,803
that a war always sheds blood.

938
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,514
