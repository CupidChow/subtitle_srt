A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,354
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

3
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,982
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

4
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,132
One ice flake, please.

5
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,431
Here is your ice flake.

6
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,858
-It's good.
-Is it?

7
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,069
Try some, Tae-jun.

8
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,783
It is good.

9
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,578
We had ice flakes on our first date too.

10
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,623
-Do you remember?
-Yes, you were wearing a sky blue blouse.

11
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,294
You dropped condensed milk on it

12
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,298
-because you were nervous to be with me.
-My gosh.

13
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,968
-What are you saying?
-Don't you remember?

14
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,095
You got so nervous and spilled everything.

15
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,264
-You're completely mistaken.
-No, I'm not.

16
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,557
You were the nervous one.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,393
You were so nervous to see me
that you kept on gulping.

18
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,770
Goodness.

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,981
Back then,

20
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,402
it was great how we could just hang out
without having to worry.

21
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,239
-What about now?
-Now?

22
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,365
It's still fun.

23
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,617
It's not that bad.

24
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,751
Why are you shaking?

25
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,797
Look at this. You're shaking.

26
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,340
Do you still like me that much?

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,388
Assemblywoman Jeong Eun-hui was appointed
as Daehan Party's new spokesperson.

28
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,348
She shared her determination to report

29
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,602
the opinions of her party to the people
with honesty before anything.

30
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,063
She also said that she will do her best
as the spokesperson

31
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,649
-for the party supported by people.
-Are you okay?

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,944
-She will tune into people's opinions
-It is what it is.

33
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,446
and liaise more with the press.

34
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,115
At least you saved my bill.

35
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,452
It's all for the better.

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,537
There was too much to do
as a spokesperson.

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,874
I'll focus on Jungil-gu now.

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,671
Is the preparation
for the hearing going well?

39
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,008
Yes, so far.

40
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,094
Once the hearing begins,

41
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,182
every single thing that Mr. Song has done
will be brought up.

42
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,558
Even Samil Association.

43
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,811
You're right.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,731
Samil Association might end up
dragging you down.

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,067
I know.

46
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,655
I'm aware of that, so don't worry.

47
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,503
We've raced to this day restlessly,

48
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,922
but we still have

49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,716
a long way to go.

50
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,723
Everyone is running toward
their own light.

51
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,562
But...

52
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,316
when you get closer to the light,
it becomes difficult to see.

53
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,238
And you won't even be able to see
the darkness under your feet.

54
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,013
EPISODE 6

55
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,434
The Minister of Justice nominee
will be undergoing

56
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,811
a confirmation hearing
by the National Assembly

57
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,229
in the coming week.

58
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,190
The ruling party is mostly welcoming

59
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,944
the nomination of Mr. Song, the current
floor leader of the Daehan Party,

60
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,323
but we expect to see
a harsh attack from the opposition party.

61
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,117
A harsh attack, my ass.

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,577
They're assemblymen too.

63
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,538
There's no need to stop an assemblyman
from becoming a minister.

64
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,333
They wouldn't stop me
even if they didn't want to.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,877
There will be reporters there.

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,837
I put together a simple greeting.

67
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll hold a press conference
to announce your policy.

68
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,050
Go ahead.

69
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,928
Oh, and I'm meeting Lee Chang-jin later.

70
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,722
He wants to buy me food to celebrate.

71
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,932
-Come with me.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,314
The weather is very nice today.

73
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,780
What's your name again?

74
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,782
It's Kim Myeong-su.

75
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,159
Kim Myeong-su...

76
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,869
Where did it go?

77
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,621
I remember leaving it here.

78
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,333
One second, please. Do-gyeong?

79
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,502
Is he still asleep?

80
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,212
How much did he drink yesterday?

81
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,761
Do-gyeong! Wake up.

82
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,305
Goodness, wake up!

83
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,934
-What?
-Did you organize last year's suits?

84
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,812
What? Suits?

85
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,651
-A customer came by, but I can't find it.
-My gosh.

86
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,114
Why did he suddenly come to pick it up?

87
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,033
He had forgotten about it,
but remembered it before moving.

88
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,369
-Have you seen it?
-How would I know?

89
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,620
I'll try looking for it.

90
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,207
Go tell him that
we'll find it and send it to him.

91
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,585
Okay, we should do that.
He's busy packing for his move.

92
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,463
Do-gyeong.

93
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,090
Yes, what?

94
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,466
Studying must be stressful.

95
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,219
But still, don't drink too much.

96
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,763
You need to maintain your condition.
Your exam is soon.

97
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,307
-Keep it up!
-Okay, fine.

98
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,111
I'm late.

99
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,582
I'm sorry.
I'm sure we'll be able to find...

100
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,709
-Where are you going?
-To study.

101
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,128
We'll have your suit cleaned
and send it over.

102
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,921
-Don't worry.
-What about breakfast?

103
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,881
I'll eat there.

104
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,322
What brings you here?

106
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,949
I'm an intern at Mr. Song's office,

107
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,367
but I forgot my pass.

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,995
-Are you sure you work here?
-Yes.

109
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,080
-What about your ID?
-My ID?

110
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,374
-Hello.
-Hello.

111
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
He is our intern.

112
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,630
Thank you.

113
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,840
-Thank you.
-Access granted.

114
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,728
Why did you quit working as a reporter
to do this job?

115
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,650
Your articles looked great.

116
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,279
I didn't want to write articles anymore.

117
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,200
The man you saw at the hospital,

118
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,451
Mr. Shin Jae-gyeong.

119
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,746
He ended up like that
because of my article.

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,843
-Hello.
-Good morning.

121
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,847
You're here.

122
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,809
What? You're all fine?

123
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,687
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

124
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,272
Ms. No.

125
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,406
Ms. No, can you get me some coffee?
With three spoons of sugar.

126
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,367
Sure.

127
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,204
This is Yun Hye-won of Mr. Song's office.

128
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,375
The nominee's pre-questionnaire
and documents for the hearing?

129
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,003
Yes, we'll fill them out and turn them in.

130
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,462
Yes, all right.

131
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,633
The pre-questionnaires from assemblymen
will start coming in soon.

132
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,678
Why can't we ever catch a break?

133
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,019
What a crowd.

134
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,023
I guess it's great to have
a lot of people here on a day like this.

135
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,740
There he is.

136
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,413
Congratulations on your nomination.

137
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,248
Please tell us how you feel.

138
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,877
This is an important position, so I am
burdened with a sense of responsibility.

139
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,171
I'll listen closely to people's opinions

140
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,215
and communicate closely
with the Blue House.

141
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,718
What is your position
on the prosecution reformation?

142
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,094
Prosecution reformation is

143
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,765
something that we cannot avoid
to protect the democracy

144
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,600
and constitutionalism of our nation.

145
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,062
I will continue to contemplate on
what the prosecution should look like,

146
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,189
receive opinions from various circles,

147
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,192
and approach this matter with discretion.

148
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,486
Many think that it'd be hard
to proceed with it

149
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,322
if the Minister of Justice was
formerly with the prosecution.

150
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,241
I may have been
with the prosecution in the past, but...

151
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,493
You're still here?

152
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,954
I should congratulate Mr. Song
before I leave.

153
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,248
I'd like to express
my determination for it.

154
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,918
I would like all of your support
rather than concerns.

155
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,212
Thank you. I look forward to your support.

156
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,171
Thank you.

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,638
Prosecution reformation is

158
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,684
something that we cannot avoid to protect
the democracy and constitutionalism

159
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,268
of our nation.

160
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,354
Mr. Song met with Lee Sang-guk last night,

161
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,481
the chairperson
of the Judiciary Committee.

162
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,528
So Mr. Song wants to pull out
after getting what he needs.

163
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,615
I'm sure Ms. Kang was the one
that persuaded Chairperson Lee.

164
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,158
Will you let her go on?

165
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,994
A women's organization will award her
because of that bill.

166
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,996
-Leave her be.
-Really?

167
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,416
If you don't do anything,
it'll be hard for you

168
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,042
to be appointed floor leader.

169
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,293
Hey.

170
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,463
That's only if Mr. Song
passes the confirmation hearing.

171
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,217
The Judiciary Committee heads the hearing
for the Minister of Justice.

172
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,303
If you step in and do something,
it'll cause a lot of problems.

173
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,473
It won't be me.
Kang Seon-yeong will do it.

174
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,975
-What?
-Ms. Kang?

175
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,143
Yes.

176
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,229
Let her enjoy her victory until then.

177
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,985
This person has contributed greatly
to improving women's rights

178
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,239
as a proud woman of our society.
Therefore, we give you this award.

179
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,453
Congratulations.

JUNGIL-GU WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION
AWARDS CEREMONY

181
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,546
Thank you.

182
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,216
Here's the seating chart
of the members of the hearing committee.

183
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,093
Jo Nam-hyeon, Baek Seung-hwan,

184
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,345
and Kim Sang-jun,
who were on Mr. Jo's side,

185
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,805
will not cause any trouble.

186
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,141
They probably know
that the situation has changed.

187
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,560
-What about the opposition party?
-It is fine,

188
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,812
but Mr. Jang is still on Mr. Jo's side.

189
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,191
Jang Yong-gi? He made a scene
during the last audit, didn't he?

190
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,359
-Mr. Song!
-Quiet!

191
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,113
If you do not bring Mr. Lee as a witness,
you cannot continue with the inspection!

192
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,073
But do not worry too much.

193
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,160
Mr. Jang is involved in a lawsuit
for driving under the influence.

194
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,663
-I could get him for sure.
-Okay, then.

195
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,416
What about Mun Sang-hyeon
of the Kookmin Party?

196
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,709
Mun Sang-hyeon?

197
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,879
-Is it because Mr. Lee has a special
-Enough!

198
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,882
-relationship with Mr. Song?
-The witness list was finalized.

199
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,512
Well, he is like a leech,
sucking on blood here and there.

200
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,558
He might be trouble
if we don't give him anything.

201
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,935
Where is his district?

202
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,813
It's Jungil-gu.

203
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,899
Jungil-gu?

204
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,693
Ms. Kang has been
working hard in the area.

205
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,993
SEATING CHART FOR
SONG HUI-SEOP'S HEARING

206
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,957
Ms. Kang stepped down
as the spokesperson of her party.

207
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,292
If she is more pressured,
she may take action.

208
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,002
That's why I brought her up.

209
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,381
We don't know what she will do,
so we should do something about her now.

210
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,800
Mr. Song, it looked like
Mr. Mun considered

211
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,636
leaving his party
because of next year's nomination.

212
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,056
If he comes to our party now,
don't you think he could be of support?

213
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,779
-Go and sound him out.
-Yes, sir.

214
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,461
Won-sik.

215
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,423
A word, please.

216
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,134
Why do you want to go somewhere else?
Talk to me here.

217
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,349
He has so many secrets.

218
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,811
If Mr. Jang asks for me to come,
I have no choice.

219
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,854
Take this.

220
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,734
Goodbye.

221
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,363
What's going on? Do you know anything?

222
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,407
No.

223
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,036
It feels like walking on thin ice.

224
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,330
Congratulations, Ms. Kang.

225
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,833
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

226
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,669
Of course.
Do not forget all of my hard work.

227
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
I won't.

228
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,382
Didn't you drink a lot yesterday?
Are you okay?

229
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,135
I'll go for some hangover soup
when I get back.

230
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,848
Have you heard from the Jungil-gu mayor
yet?

231
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,518
No. He wants to be a part
of the lone-parent support project,

232
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,647
but he seems to be concerned
about what Mr. Jo would think.

233
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,533
I told you to stay still
if you want to keep what you have.

234
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,537
You should stay still
if you want anything at all.

235
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,792
-What?
-How was the movie last night?

236
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,585
It was pretty boring for me.

237
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,631
What are you talking about?

238
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,261
The head chief of staff
with an incumbent assemblywoman.

239
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,431
Right? Getting it on.

240
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,309
You must have had a wild night.
You look worn out.

241
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,481
What do you think Mr. Song will say

242
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,025
if he finds out about
your relationship with Ms. Kang?

243
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,611
Leave the hearing to me from now on.

244
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,698
Then settle the district's problem
and hand it over to me too.

245
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,324
That's the only way

246
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,077
you will keep my mouth shut.

247
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,298
Mr. Jang, Mr. Song just left
to the restaurant.

248
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,969
-Hye-won.
-Yes?

249
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,721
Let's get rid of Oh Won-sik

250
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,222
before Mr. Song's hearing.

251
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,350
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,278
AUDITORIUM

253
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,116
-You can go back to the office.
-Yes, ma'am.

JUNGIL-GU WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION
AWARDS CEREMONY

255
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,912
JANG TAE-JUN

256
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,623
Are you congratulating me?

257
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,377
Mr. Song is going to offer Mr. Mun
to join our party.

258
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
Mr. Mun Sang-hyeon?

259
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,134
-We'll be looking forward to your support.
-Sure.

260
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,722
-Will he be offered to be nominated?
-Yes.

261
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,017
That's not good news
on a day for celebration.

262
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,811
-Was this your idea?
-Won-sik...

263
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,314
knows about us.

264
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,320
As you said,
we really have a long way to go.

265
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,239
Okay. I'll call you later.

266
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,754
Lee's Joojin Constructions
will be carrying out their business

267
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,091
in Seobuk Market of Uigwang City
and Yeongjin-gu.

268
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,760
There will be a forced execution
there very soon.

269
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,386
We must stop them before then.

270
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,932
Mr. Lee, I'm sorry to tell you this,

271
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,268
but local residents are opposing
the reexamining of a project

272
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,603
that was already approved.

273
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,356
We've started to receive
complaint calls as well.

274
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,112
But we should keep doing what we must do.

275
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,072
Mr. Lee.

276
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,457
With a little bit of exaggeration,
this liquor was made

277
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,335
with 100-year-old wild ginseng.

278
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,087
Try some.

279
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,718
Wow.

280
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,805
I'll live long now.

281
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,434
You must live long and stay healthy,
of course.

282
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,105
That way, we can keep our relationship
for a long time.

283
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,819
Mr. Jang, thank you for the great work.

284
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,945
Have a drink.

285
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,450
Goodness.

286
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,372
Yes, what is it?

287
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,915
What?

288
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,880
How could you let this happen?

289
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,089
Answer me!

290
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,383
Do whatever you can to stop them!

291
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,935
Bad things tend to happen during a party.
It's a tough day for us.

292
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,645
Why? What's wrong?

293
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,690
There's an issue
at the factory in Seongjin City.

294
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,613
The level of fine dust hit 95 micrograms
this morning,

295
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,865
which is classified as very bad
according to...

296
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,950
If Ms. No sees you,
she'll be mad.

297
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,869
What's the big deal?
It's only one drink.

298
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,205
The floor leader's office is the best.

299
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,792
Did Tae-jun go somewhere?
I came to eat with him.

300
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,003
He left to eat with Mr. Song.

301
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,965
He eats with assemblymen now?
He's practically an assemblyman now.

302
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,266
Hello, Ms. No.

303
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,060
Do you want one as well?

304
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,193
If you keep doing this,
I'm going to tell Mr. Song.

305
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,445
My gosh, don't be so mean like that.

306
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,281
Another industrial accident

307
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,075
-recently occurred
-Yes, Ms. Kang.

308
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,119
which has upset many people.

309
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,830
-A man in his twenties who was
-Did something happen again?

310
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,541
an employee of a cement factory
in Seongjin City died

311
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,418
because he got stuck
in a conveyor belt.

312
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,837
Mr. Yu, who just turned 20 this year,

313
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,965
was sent to the ER after the accident

314
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,259
but ended up dying
due to excessive bleeding.

315
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,679
The police are currently investigating
the details of the accident

316
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,014
and have announced that they will check

317
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,517
-if there were any safety issues.
-It's the old lady.

318
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,520
Mr. Yu lived with his grandmother...

319
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,563
-I want files from the past--
-Mr. Lee.

320
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,734
There was an accident
at a factory in Seongjin City.

321
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,280
Look.

322
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,284
A man in his twenties, who worked
in a cement factory in Seongjin City,

323
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,371
ended up dying because his body got stuck
in a conveyor belt.

324
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,790
Mr. Yu was sent to the ER right after

325
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,750
-the accident happened...
-Which factory?

326
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,128
A cement factory
owned by Joojin Constructions.

327
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:40,215
The police are currently thoroughly
investigating to find out if there

328
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,009
were any safety issues...

329
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,635
Things were quiet for some time.

330
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,722
Mr. Lee is going to
create a big fuss over this.

331
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
Don't be bothered by that.

332
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,934
Accidents occur in factories all the time.

333
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:55,147
-It'll be over once you pay a fine.
-That's not the issue here.

334
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,941
Joojin Constructions,
Uigwang City, and Seongjin City

335
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,360
are currently proceeding
with the redevelopment.

336
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,989
Assemblyman Lee is already trying
hard to stop the redevelopment.

337
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,576
If he stops the factory
to carry out an investigation,

338
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,037
the redevelopment might go haywire.

339
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,247
Mr. Song.

340
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,583
You will need

341
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,419
to help me out with this.

342
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,549
I'm not sure.

343
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,137
I don't think it's right
for me to get involved--

344
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,263
Mr. Song.

345
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,682
If the redevelopment is canceled,

346
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,143
I won't be the only one affected.

347
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,188
Goodness.

348
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,690
Why is it so hard to run a business?

349
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,651
I'm worried about how I'm going to prepare

350
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,405
the money to help you both
go a long way in your careers.

351
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,992
I think I should go now.

352
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,787
You guys can finish without me.

353
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,669
That arrogant jerk.

354
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,505
Now that we're in the same boat,

355
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,757
he even wants me to deal
with the dirty stuff.

356
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,093
Find out what happened.

357
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,388
If you get involved with private matters,

358
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,139
things might get out of hand.

359
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,474
Your hearing is coming up.

360
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,477
You think I don't know that?

361
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,565
If Mr. Lee gets in trouble,
it'll quickly affect us as well.

362
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,152
As much as I hate to do this,
I have to take care of it for him.

363
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,740
Okay, sir.

364
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,453
Assemblyman Mun?

365
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,665
That guy's such an opportunist.
He already switched parties once.

366
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,292
What will we do?
If Assemblyman Mun joins our party,

367
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,545
he'll be nominated
to represent Jungil-gu.

368
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,839
Mr. Jo will support him as well.

369
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,344
-Yes, I know.
-Did Tae-jun come up with this idea?

370
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,012
No.

371
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,974
Mr. Oh did.

372
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,520
Mr. Song really wants you
to join our party.

373
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,688
If you join us...

374
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,857
We need to stop him
from joining our party.

375
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,692
How can Mr. Song do this to you?

376
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,694
We let him take the credit for our bill.

377
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,195
But he went behind our backs.

378
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,907
I get that politics can be a mess,
but this is just too much.

379
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,246
He attacked us from behind,
so we'll take the bull by the horns.

380
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,124
The Jungil-gu mayor wishes
to get reelected.

381
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,917
We should give him the right weapon

382
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,087
so that he can get reelected
without having to tiptoe around Mr. Jo.

383
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,507
-What's your plan?
-The lone-parent project.

384
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,262
Let's pass it over to the mayor
and put him in charge.

385
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,221
What?

386
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,223
We didn't receive any credit for the bill.

387
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,726
If you hand it over,
we'll have nothing.

388
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,436
If we fail to convince the mayor,

389
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,897
we won't be able to carry out
any projects there.

390
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,232
-Yes, but--
-We need to give up what we have

391
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,984
in order to gain something bigger.

392
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,362
Please make a date with the mayor.

393
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,323
Okay.

394
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,660
Mr. Yu, who died,

395
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,497
wasn't a full-time employee.
He was a dispatched worker.

396
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,248
He was in charge of maintenance.

397
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,585
The accident happened because
he was checking an operating conveyor belt

398
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,961
while intoxicated.

399
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,547
So it was his mistake?

400
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,050
That's what Joojin Constructions claims.

401
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,803
-The police haven't confirmed anything.
-The accident happened at 2 a.m.

402
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,889
Why was he taken
to the hospital at 5 a.m.?

403
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,642
Mr. Yu was the only person
working at the factory.

404
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,060
Another employee found him

405
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,187
when he came for his shift
and called it in.

406
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,649
I think Joojin Constructions
is trying to conceal what happened.

407
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,652
According to the reporters,
the CCTV broke down

408
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,945
and deleted all footage.

409
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,614
Also, it seems like they made sure
the workers don't talk.

410
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,325
They didn't even report it
to the Ministry of Labor.

411
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,536
Get me the list of stockholders
who took part

412
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,037
-in the redevelopment.
-Okay.

413
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,998
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
YU JIN-SU

414
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,875
Where is the body being kept?

415
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,585
A general hospital in Uigwang City.

416
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,795
Mr. Han is there now.

417
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,132
-Do-gyeong?
-Mr. Yu has a grandmother,

418
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,425
and he said he knew her.

419
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,349
UIGWANG GENERAL HOSPITAL

420
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,775
Ma'am.

421
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,822
How did you come?

422
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,326
I saw the news. What happened?

423
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,913
I should've been the one to die.

424
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:26,334
Why did my grandson have to die before me?

425
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,590
They say my grandson made a mistake
because he was drunk.

426
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,967
But he can't drink at all.

427
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,554
He would never work in a drunken state.

428
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,563
Ma'am, let me take you home.

429
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,483
No, it's okay.
I can't just leave him here.

430
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,320
He's lying in the cold all by himself.

431
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,197
He doesn't even have any parents.

432
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,700
So at least I should stay by his side.

433
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,789
Jin-su, my baby. Jin-su...

434
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,298
AGREEMENT

435
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,633
Ma'am, what's this?

436
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,343
A COMPENSATION OF 10 MILLION WON

437
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,678
I don't know.

438
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,806
Some guys in suits came by earlier

439
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,602
and asked me to sign it.

440
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,819
I'll look into it.

441
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,989
If they come again,
don't sign anything they give you.

442
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,991
Okay, I won't.

443
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,243
Just a second.

444
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,715
Ma'am... Ma'am!

445
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,467
Ma'am...

446
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,428
Help!

447
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,596
Ma'am.

448
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,811
Ma'am. Ma'am, wake up.

449
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,481
When can we check out the scene?

450
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,067
The police are still investigating,
so not yet.

451
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,944
They won't give us
any information.

452
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,571
I think Joojin Constructions' Legal Team
is on the move.

453
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,035
Who made the report?

454
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,538
-Mr. Kim Sang-cheol?
-Yes?

455
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,624
Yes... Yes, I made the report.

456
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,085
What kind of condition was Mr. Yu in?

457
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,213
His body was tied to the conveyor belt,
and he was unconscious.

458
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,048
So I called 911.

459
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,968
Was the emergency stop switch turned on?

460
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,887
He had a few drinks before working,
so he must've forgotten.

461
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,056
How much did Mr. Yu drink?

462
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,476
Our team went for dinner,
so I think he had

463
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,980
-one and a half bottle of soju.
-I thought Mr. Yu couldn't drink.

464
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,940
Where are you from?

465
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,406
I'm from Assemblyman Song's office.
According to Mr. Yu's grandmother,

466
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,742
he couldn't drink a drop of alcohol.

467
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,244
He normally doesn't drink that much.

468
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,247
But he did drink occasionally
when our team went for dinner.

469
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,584
You just told them that you called 911.

470
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,211
Why was he taken to a designated hospital?

471
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,172
Then why take him
to a different hospital?

472
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,299
He couldn't get the surgery
he needed there,

473
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,633
so he was brought here.

474
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,261
What time did he arrive?
Was he conscious up until then?

475
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,182
For further investigation,
call this number.

476
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,475
JOOJIN CHEMICAL

477
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,059
Wait.

478
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,690
It's mandatory to report
major accidents to the Ministry of Labor.

479
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,650
But I noticed
that no one filed a report.

480
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,652
Are you concealing an industrial accident?

481
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,113
You're wrong.
We're not trying to conceal anything.

482
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,991
We just forgot to make a report
because things were so hectic.

483
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,534
You say things were very hectic,

484
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,828
but you had time to ask
his grandma to sign this,

485
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,998
when she didn't even know
what happened?

486
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,583
You're from Mr. Song's office?

487
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,461
-What's your name?
-Han Do-gyeong.

488
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,963
Please call us if you have any questions.

489
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,548
We'll do our best to answer them.

490
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,931
Don't meet anyone, and don't say anything.

491
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,599
We'll take care of this.

492
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,602
-Yes, of course. You heard that, right?
-Yes.

493
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,329
Is she okay?

494
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,123
She passed out.

495
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,460
She's been crying all day
and hasn't had anything to eat.

496
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,630
Are there other family members?

497
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,382
No.

498
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,176
It was just her and her grandson.

499
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,184
I've noticed earlier

500
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,687
that you know a lot
about industrial accidents.

501
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,315
My father passed away
due to an industrial accident.

502
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,860
That's when I studied a lot about it.

503
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,865
My goodness, it must've been very hard.

504
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,953
It wasn't so hard
because someone helped us back then.

505
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,105
Ms. Kang.

506
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,358
I got a call from the mayor's office.

507
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,610
He wants to meet today.

508
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,449
LONE-PARENT PROJECT PROPOSAL FOR JUNGIL-GU

509
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,621
What are you planning to do?

510
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,582
I should look thoroughly into
how the accident occurred.

511
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,335
A man just died,
and they asked her to sign an agreement.

512
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,588
I'll do everything I can to make them
beg for forgiveness.

513
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,714
Just drop it.

514
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,717
The accident happened in your district,

515
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,762
but they're residents of our district.
I'll take care of it.

516
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,308
What will you do?

517
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,061
I’ll make sure the funeral procedure
and the compensation--

518
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,812
I can't believe you're saying that!

519
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,316
I also feel sorry about what happened.

520
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,234
Are you here to console his family

521
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,986
or because of Lee Chang-jin?

522
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,327
My gosh.

523
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,417
If you're here because of the latter,
you shouldn't get involved

524
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,086
before I get disappointed in you.

525
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,848
Tae-jun.

526
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,356
Don't get intoxicated
with what Mr. Lee has to offer.

527
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,998
MR. LEE CHANG-JIN

528
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,296
Hi, this is Jang Tae-jun.

529
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,969
Mr. Jang, didn't I ask you
to take care of the situation?

530
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,805
Why is an intern
from your office going around

531
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,640
asking unnecessary questions?

532
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,726
You should keep an eye on
your subordinates.

533
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,437
Do I really need to call you
regarding stuff like this?

534
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,109
-I'm sorry.
-Please take better care of the situation.

535
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
Think carefully about who it is

536
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,781
that's going to make you
an assemblyman before you do anything.

537
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,005
MR. LEE CHANG-JIN

538
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,074
-I heard you know her.
-I do.

539
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,952
I met her while I was promoting
the public hearing at the market.

540
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,579
She was at the hearing, too.

541
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,581
-She was there?
-Yes.

542
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,836
She used to sell things at the market
with her grandson.

543
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,756
But they got kicked out
due to the redevelopment.

544
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,551
I heard that's why her grandson
began working at the factory.

545
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,396
I heard that you are a competent man.

546
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,818
Please help me so that
I can keep doing business at the market

547
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,361
with my grandson.

548
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,197
I ask of you, sir.

549
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,533
Please help us out.

550
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,410
I ask of you. Please.

551
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,347
LONE-PARENT PROJECT PROPOSAL FOR JUNGIL-GU

552
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,774
I'm not sure if it's okay for me
to take this.

553
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,985
All you need to do is make a decision.

554
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,112
Yes, I know.

555
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,532
But it's not something
I can decide on my own.

556
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,809
What brings you here?

557
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,769
We haven't been on great terms recently.

558
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,688
So I came to see you.

559
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,148
How about a drink?

560
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,525
We're not close enough
to have drinks together.

561
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,278
I'll be off now.

562
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,740
Are you just going to give up on
Jungil-gu like this?

563
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,868
Why do you keep choosing the hard way?

564
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,582
You can't just give away
what you've been working so hard on.

565
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,797
I want you to be in charge.
The mayor will help you out.

566
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,966
You've been working for me
for a long time.

567
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,301
I don't want to stop you.

568
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,639
I'm sure you're not doing me a favor
with no strings attached.

569
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,350
-What do you want?
-There's only one thing I want.

570
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,518
Jang Tae-jun.

571
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,030
We should've dealt with him
from the start.

572
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,865
The reason Mr. Song
has come this far

573
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,202
and the reason our relationship
became so bad is all because of him.

574
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,728
How's his grandmother?

575
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,317
She was just out of energy.
Everything else is fine.

576
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,568
I'm relieved.

577
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,787
You're here to tell me something,
aren't you?

578
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,998
Jin-su...

579
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,625
Jin-su was a good guy.

580
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,877
He always said he's going to save up

581
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,130
to open a store for his grandmother.

582
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,766
It's the CCTV footage of the accident.

583
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,020
I copied the footage
before the company deleted it.

584
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,783
Here’s the list of the stockholders.

585
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,286
Three construction firms are
in the redevelopment

586
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,788
along with over 20 subcontractors.

587
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,167
The subcontractors are unlisted,
so I couldn't see their stockholders.

588
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,794
But I found something peculiar
while looking into this.

589
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,840
-What did you find?
-This is a list of all the subcontractors.

590
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,636
The subcontractors of Joojin Constructions

591
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,806
are all located in districts
that are run by people you know.

592
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,683
UIGWANG CITY, SEONGJIN CITY REDEVELOPMENT
SUBCONTRACTORS

593
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,519
Jungbu City, Chairperson Lee.

594
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,898
Gwanghyeon City, Mr. Ahn.

595
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,233
Jingyeong City, Mr. No.

596
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,737
Mr. Song, if the redevelopment
is canceled,

597
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,405
I won't be the only one affected.

598
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,451
If things don't go well,

599
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,745
you might also end up getting in trouble.

600
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,456
Mr. Jang.

601
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,793
You need to see this.

602
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,529
Mr. Yu wasn't intoxicated.

603
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,364
He turned on
the emergency stop switch.

604
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,242
The conveyor belt was the problem.

605
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,204
And Mr. Kim Sang-cheol called 911
as soon as he came to the factory

606
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,455
and saw what happened.

607
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,501
But the manager called 911 again
and said he's fine.

608
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,754
He sent back the ambulance and took
Mr. Yu to the designated hospital.

609
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,592
Designated hospitals can hide
industrial accidents.

610
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,847
That place is an hour away
from the general hospital in Uigwang City.

611
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,433
He could've lived if he was taken there.

612
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,518
They practically killed him!

613
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,110
Is there anyone else who knows

614
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,530
that you have this flash drive?

615
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,325
No, I came to see you
as soon as I received it.

616
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,434
Are you here to console
his family or

617
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,768
because of Lee Chang-jin?

618
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,359
If Mr. Lee gets in trouble,

619
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,361
it'll quickly affect us as well.

620
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,198
Though I don't want to,
I have to take care of it for him.

621
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,293
If you're here because of the latter,
don't get involved

622
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,961
before I get disappointed in you.

623
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,888
I'll help you to the best of my ability
so that you can wear

624
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,057
the assemblyman badge on your chest soon.

625
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,996
Are you just going to give up on

626
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,540
Jungil-gu like this?

627
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,753
There's only one thing I want.

628
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,004
Jang Tae-jun.

629
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,442
-You should come visit.
-Sure, I will.

630
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,861
You must still be contemplating.

631
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,240
Don't consider the seller
when you buy something.

632
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,326
If it's good enough, you should buy it
even if you don't like them.

633
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,954
My goodness, look who's here.

634
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,622
-Mr. Mun.
-Yes, sir.

635
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,250
My gosh, it's been so long.
My goodness, look at you.

636
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,877
If you keep hesitating,
you'll lose it to someone else.

637
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,969
Yes, of course.

638
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,054
Great.

639
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,374
Are you okay?

640
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,294
Did you stay here all night?

641
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,171
Sleeping here like this will ruin you.

642
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,714
You should go home.

643
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,341
I'm okay.

644
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,968
I have really good stamina.

645
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,477
Ma'am, don't worry too much.

646
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,104
Our chief of staff will help you
resolve everything

647
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,065
regarding what happened to your grandson.

648
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,332
Mr. Lee.

649
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,677
Mr. Jang, what brings you here
so early in the morning?

650
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,137
I came to give you something.

651
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,893
It's the CCTV footage of the accident.

652
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,732
I guess the new attorneys I hired
are very incompetent.

653
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,280
This shouldn't exist.

654
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,910
Mr. Jang, you really are amazing.

655
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,787
How did you manage to find this?

656
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,882
Anyway, thank you.

657
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,883
Since you're here,

658
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,845
you should join me for breakfast
if you haven't eaten yet.

659
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,264
I didn't even get to
pour you a drink last time.

660
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,807
Come on in.

661
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,315
There's only one thing I want.

662
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,692
Jang Tae-jun.

663
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,034
Ms. Kang.

664
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,121
You're here.

665
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,833
Nothing's been decided yet.

666
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,710
Is the mayor demanding more?

667
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,254
No, I'm the one who hasn't decided

668
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,339
what to do yet.

669
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,344
-What's that?
-Right.

670
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,889
I forgot to give you this yesterday.

671
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,017
There's been an accident
at a factory in Seongjin City.

672
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,810
CONVEYOR BELT ACCIDENT

673
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,937
-It's a conveyor belt accident.
-Yes.

674
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,857
It happened in a cement factory
owned by Joojin Constructions.

675
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,234
Joojin Constructions?
Isn't Mr. Lee the owner?

676
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,738
Yes, that's right. I think they're
trying to conceal the accident.

677
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,615
So Mr. Lee is planning to form a team

678
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,784
to investigate what really happened.

679
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,244
And we were requested to join the team.

680
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,666
Okay, I'll meet him in person
to talk about this.

681
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,251
Will that be okay?

682
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,463
You know Mr. Song
and Mr. Lee aren't on good terms.

683
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,298
You're already in a pickle.

684
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,927
If we get involved in this,
Mr. Song won't stand still.

685
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,262
We should still do what we can.

686
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,307
Can you get me the files
regarding the accident?

687

00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,945
CEO OF
JOOJIN CHEMICAL/JOOJIN CONSTRUCTIONS

689
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,369
Mr. Lee, everything's ready
for the press conference.

690
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,288
Mr. Jang.

691
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,332
Assemblyman Lee's office

692
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,836
is going to hold a press conference
to demand the truth behind the accident.

693
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,297
Where's Mr. Song?

694
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,590
He's in his office.

695
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,514
Mr. Lee formed a team to
investigate the truth behind the accident

696
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,267
that happened at the factory
in Seongjin City.

697
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,102
This is quite an interesting thing.

698
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,021
Yes. He asked us to participate
in the investigation.

699
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,231
How should I respond?

700
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,316
He's doing something good,
so we should help.

701
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,654
This is going to be a huge headache
for Song Hui-seop.

702
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,576
Mr. Lee's asking assemblymen

703
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,203
to sign a petition
and join his investigation team.

704
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,914
If he holds this press conference,

705
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,916
it'll have an effect on your hearing.

706
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,626
We need to stop him no matter what.

707
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,461
How are we going to do that?

708
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,465
I think we could...

709
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,010
Yes.

710
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,011
Hey.

711
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,430
Hey.

712
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,850
What were you doing until now?
How did things get this bad?

713
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,065
I think Mr. Jo is up to something as well.

714
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,026
With a press conference and the media's--

715
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,360
Be quiet.

716
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,202
You'd better silence

717
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,663
Lee Seong-min at all costs.

718
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,875
You can only join the Assembly
if that prick keeps his lips sealed.

719
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,835
Do you realize that?

720
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,213
Yes, sir. I'm aware.

721
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,177
The press conference

722
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,013
won't be held.

723
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,602
What do you mean?

724
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,155
Have you come up with a new solution?

725
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,157
Are you here to meet the victim's family?

726
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,034
Please make a comment, sir.

727
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,620
All right, let's go.

728
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,710
Let's see.
Where would be a good place to take you?

729
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,420
I'll tell you where we're going.

730
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,589
Do you know a good place?

731
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,341
General hospital in Uigwang City.

732
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,761
-What do you mean?
-Go to the hospital,

733
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,597
get on your knees,
and sincerely apologize to the bereaved.

734
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,265
Cooperate with the police.

735
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,353
Mr. Jang Tae-jun.

736
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,230
What the heck are you saying?

737
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,567
Are you here to apologize to the bereaved?

738
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,737
Do you think Joojin Constructions
is responsible for what happened?

739
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,490
Will there be a press...

740
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,741
-Do you need help?
-Yes.

741
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,664
-What's going on?
-What is happening?

742
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,379
What's happening?

743
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,423
I'm sorry.

744
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,094
The company will take care of everything.

745
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,346
I give you my word, ma'am.

746
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,734
For this, I think it'd be better
to go with what we discussed...

747
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,818
Sir!

748
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,782
Mr. Lee Chang-jin,

749
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,327
the CEO of Joojin Constructions,
visited the family of Mr. Yu Jin-su,

750
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,706
who lost his life in the conveyor belt
accident at the cement factory

751
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,583
and apologized on his knees.

752
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,544
He expressed his sincere condolences
on the death of Mr. Yu,

753
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,756
which was caused
by an unfortunate accident.

754
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,759
-Ma'am, on the news...
-He apologized to the bereaved and public

755
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,844
and stated that
he will proactively cooperate

756
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,930
with the investigation to help
determine the cause of the accident.

757
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,684
He also promised to implement thorough
inspection procedures to prevent...

758
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,061
Now that this has happened,

759
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,064
Assemblyman Lee's press conference
will be pointless.

760
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,525
He emphasized that he will be sure
to develop preventive measures

761
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,571
that tackle the root causes of the issue
and create a safe working environment.

762
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,200
Great timing.

763
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,954
I express my condolences
on the passing of Mr. Yu,

764
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,999
and I'd also like to extend
my deepest sympathies to the bereaved,

765
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,710
who must be utterly devastated
by their loss.

766
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,380
Joojin Constructions

767
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:38,220
-will come up with a realistic solution...
-How did you persuade that arrogant prick?

768
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,097
...to ensure a safe workplace,

769
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,475
-and will cooperate with the police...
-I just told him how to fix it.

770
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:47,646
...and do our best to develop strategies
to prevent such accidents.

771
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,981
Gosh, that prick.

772
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,029
Oh, boy.

773
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,823
That serves him right.

774
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,122
There's a copy of the CCTV footage.

775
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,583
Must you get cheeky with me
at this early hour?

776
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,001
Where is the copy?

777
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,211
I have it.

778
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,255
I'll give it to you

779
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,423
when I join the Assembly.

780
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,221
Don't be delusional.

781
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,849
Do you actually think you'll be able

782
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,685
to join the National Assembly
without my help?

783
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:30,939
Even Mr. Song wouldn't be
where he is today if it weren't for me.

784
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,899
You sound like the delusional one here.

785
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,818
You're not helping me.

786
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm the one who's helping you.

787
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:41,366
Do some thinking and decide
what would be a wise move to make.

788
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,963
Don't get sidetracked.

789
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,091
Even if the darkness beneath me
holds me back,

790
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,468
and even if I lose my sight,

791
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,223
I must keep running toward the light.

792
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,268
Joojin Constructions

793
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,271
-will come up with...
-Call the reporters.

794
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,441
We'll send out a press release first.

795
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:19,237
Sir, no one will accept it after this.

796
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,908
...and we will cooperate with the police

797
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,204
and do our best to develop strategies

798
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,290
to prevent such accidents.

799
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,301
Mr. Lee is right.

800
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,803
Even if you distribute a press release,

801
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,182
it won't receive any attention because
of Lee Chang-jin's apology.

802
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,099
Tell me.

803
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,686
What did you do?

804
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,064
I persuaded him to do what you wanted.

805
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,483
You wanted him to get on his knees
and apologize.

806
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:03,782
It's obviously just for show. Does it look
like a genuine apology to you?

807
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,620
Do you realize how obnoxious
and underhanded your method is?

808
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,457
I made the best choice I could make.

809
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,296
Ms. Kang, please give him a moment.

810
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,589
At the moment, he is...

811
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,342
Someone died, for God's sake!

812
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,057
A man lost his life.
And you'll bury it like this?

813
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,476
I'll make sure he cooperates
with the police.

814
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,103
You expect me to believe that?

815
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,564
If Mr. Song is appointed minister
and supports those bastards,

816
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,984
more people will lose their lives.

817
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,278
Is that the kind of world
you wish to create?

818
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,947
Do you think revealing the truth

819
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,907
will change anything?

820
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,827
-What?
-The labor subcontracting system

821
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,537
and outsourcing dangerous tasks.

822
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,330
Talking won't solve anything.

823
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,334
Whining and complaining
won't change anything.

824
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,337
Right. That's why we must fight.

825
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,797
Yes! We must fight!

826
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,590
We must fight and win!

827
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,261
The thing is though,
do you really think you can handle them?

828
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,805
Will forming a team achieve any results?

829
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,143
If you want to win, don't engage
in a fight you're bound to lose.

830
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,728
You couldn't even stop me.

831
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,063
You're an independent
first-term assemblyman.

832
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,815
How are you going to fight them?

833
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:20,942
Tae-jun.

834
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,574
Let's not turn away from the truth
just because we're afraid of losing.

835
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,992
I never did!

836
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,292
And I won't lose this fight.

837
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,527
Mr. Jang.

838
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,329
Spare me a moment, please.

839
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,584
Do you really have to do all this
because of Mr. Lee?

840
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,253
You're well aware
of why I have to do all this.

841
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,338
Yes, I am aware.

842
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,924
I also know that you need
Samil Association.

843
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,551
But do you really have to do
things like this?

844
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:32,138
Don't trust Mr. Song and Mr. Lee too much.

845
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,265
They'll ditch you when you become useless.

846
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,600
I know.

847
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,352
And I'm just using them as well.

848
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,731
Take a good look at yourself now.

849
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,609
Who is really being used?

850
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,028
If you're planning to help
Mr. Lee, just give up.

851
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,614
As for Mr. Mun,
I'll stop him at all costs.

852
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,034
You need to give up.

853
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,123
What if I stop you?

854
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,127
What will you do then?

855
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,007
What's going to happen now?

856
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,760
Is that man who was here earlier

857
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,263
my grandson's boss?

858
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,850
Yes, his name is Lee Chang-jin.
He's very high up in the company.

859
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,685
He apologized to you in person.

860
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,354
He'll make sure
Jin-su isn't wrongfully blamed.

861
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,480
My gosh.

862
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,109
That chief of staff must've gone
out of his way to persuade him.

863
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,569
I'm so grateful.

864
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,656
Make sure you tell him
that I'm truly grateful

865
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,700
for all of his help.

866
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,742
Yes, I will.

867
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,245
Don't worry too much.
Please get some rest now.

868
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,496
I'll be back tomorrow.

869
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,539
Okay.

870
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,207
Shall I help you lie down?

871
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,378
I'm back.

872
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,506
I'm so happy about what happened.

873
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,177
I knew Mr. Jang would turn things around.

874
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,054
The CEO came to apologize and

875
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,599
the victim's grandmother
is very grateful for his help.

876
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,309
It's not over yet.

877
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:03,354
Mr. Lee apologized just to calm down
the public opinion for the time being.

878
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,731
What?

879
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,735
But earlier, he said he'd proactively
cooperate with the police investigation.

880
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,153
And there's the CCTV footage.

881
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,447
-Mr. Jang--
-That footage won't be disclosed.

882
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,240
Why not?

883
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,663
It'll be hard to determine

884
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,957
the exact cause with just the footage.

885
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,792
And even if we disclose it now,

886
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,086
it'll end up getting buried.

887
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,508
Mr. Song and Mr. Lee are very close.

888
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,052
Mr. Song will soon be appointed
Minister of Justice.

889
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,472
Then he'll do whatever it takes
to pressure the police and prosecution

890
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,640
to stop it.

891
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,059
But that accident cost someone's life.

892
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,353
Are you saying
we should turn a blind eye to it?

893
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,230
No, something will be done.

894
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:49,067
But Mr. Jang made the best choice
he could've made.

895
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,070
Rather than focusing
on helping the powerless,

896
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:55,406
we should build a system that can ensure
there will be no more victims.

897
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,700
But...

898
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,079
-Still--
-Mr. Jang is under the most stress now.

899
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,830
Don't be emotional.

900
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,832
That's what this place is like.

901
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,877
I hope you realize this now.

902
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,632
I'll be off, then.

903
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,995
Is there anyone else who knows

904
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,540
that you have this flash drive?

905
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,377
No, I came to see you
as soon as I received it.

906
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,196
Can you pour me a glass too?

907
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,871
Could we get another glass, please?

908
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:25,913
Sure.

909
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,181
Rumor has it that Mr. Mun
might join the Daehan Party.

910
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,515
Is it true?

911
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,517
Yes.

912
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,479
This is just too much.

913
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,773
Do they think politics
is a joke or something?

914
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,275
These days,

915
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,111
I wonder why I bothered joining
the Assembly at all.

916
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,405
Everything Tae-jun said is right.

917
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,909
There's nothing more pathetic
than an assemblyman who has no power.

918
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,036
I don't agree with that.

919
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:09,123
You're stronger than anybody else I know.

920
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,794
Thanks for saying that.

921
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,671
I'm not just saying it.

922
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,756
I really mean it.

923
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,763
So, what will you do now?

924
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,473
I will continue to fight.

925
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,185
I was elected to fight for the people,
so I must repay my voters.

926
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:33,314
Tae-jun wasn't entirely wrong
about everything.

927
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,234
If you're going to fight with someone,

928
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,320
you must win at all costs.

929
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,075
I'll help you. Let's fight together.

930
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,707
Gosh, I have to say...

931
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:56,379
I apologize for putting my foot
in my mouth in front of you earlier today.

932
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,423
Because I took your advice,

933
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,216
everything went so smoothly.

934
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,884
Forgive me for my foolishness.

935
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,597
I wanted to apologize to you,
so I arranged this

936
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,391
without Mr. Song.

937
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,518
If I was out of line earlier today,

938
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,228
I apologize too.

939
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:16,190
All right.
Now that we're back on good terms.

940
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,443
Allow me to pour you a glass.

941
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:19,902
Here.

942
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,453
Tae-jun.

943
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,164
Don't get intoxicated
with what Mr. Lee has to offer.

944
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,235
All equipment will be inspected
as of today...

945
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,278
Come in.

946
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,907
Ms. Kang is here, sir.

947
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,074
What?

948
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,829
Look who's here.

949
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,581
Hey, you should join us.

950
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,672
I guess you finally decided
to make the purchase.

951
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,591
No. Not right away, sir.

952
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,927
No matter how good the product is,

953
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,845
a buyer must negotiate.

954
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:31,808
Right.

955
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,603
-So what's your proposition?
-Mr. Jang.

956
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,355
Can you persuade him?

957
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,443
Assemblyman Jang Yong-gi?

958
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,695
Yes, sir.

959
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,614
Mr. Jang.

960
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,825
Assemblyman Lee's office

961
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,619
is looking into
Joojin Constructions' subcontractors.

962
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,039
I think they want to find out

963
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:58,084
if any of his relatives
are on the list of shareholders.

964
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,300
Hold this for me.

965
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,643
What's up?

966
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,061
Hey.

967
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,320
What the heck do you think you're doing?

968
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,364
-Come out.
-It's okay.

969
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:29,907
Leave him be.

970
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,379
What is it now?

971
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,716
Are you really going to keep fighting
till the end?

972
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,511
-Are you?
-I need to see through the fight.

973
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,763
When Mr. Song is appointed
Minister of Justice,

974
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,808
he'll gain authority to command
the entire prosecution service.

975
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,519
-If that happens, you will--
-That won't happen.

976
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,859
Mr. Song...

977
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,778
won't be appointed minister.

978
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,159
Mr. Jang. Can you persuade him?

979
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,493
Assemblyman Jang Yong-gi?

980
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,705
He'll be in the Minister of Justice
confirmation hearing.

981
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:23,294
Are you suggesting we use Mr. Jang
to launch an attack on Mr. Song?

982
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,671
No. Mr. Jang Tae-jun

983
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,925
will shut him up using his DUI case.

984
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,511
Such a dull knife won't even leave
the slightest mark on Mr. Song.

985
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,890
-Then what are you suggesting?
-Persuade Mr. Jang to resign

986
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,141
and use another knife.

987
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,687
Someone who isn't afraid of what
others think and won't back down easily.

988
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:46,025
Someone who can make
Mr. Song feel threatened.

989
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,027
Who might that be?

990
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,866
Assemblyman Lee.

991
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,456
Independent assemblyman,
Mr. Lee Seong-min,

992
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,583
will join the Judiciary Committee.

993
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,795
Assemblyman Jang Yong-gi
resigned from the committee,

994
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,839
and Mr. Lee, who is now
on the Environment and Labor Committee,

995
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,425
will be taking his seat.

996
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,844
As a member of the committee,
Mr. Lee will join

997
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,180
-next week's confirmation hearing
-What?

998
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,391
for the Minister of Justice nominee.

999
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,102
Formerly engaged in NGO activities,
Assemblyman Lee joined

1000
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,480
the National Assembly upon being elected
to represent Seongjin City

1001
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,148
in the last legislative election.

1002
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,193
-How clever.
-Since then, he has been garnering

1003
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:32,238
attention with his policies
supporting low-income individuals.

1004
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:36,367
He is known as someone who has been
working hard to support and empower

1005
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,452
the powerless
in various social struggles.

1006
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,789
He recently proposed a bill to improve
occupational health and safety

1007
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,542
while being actively involved
in various other activities.

1008
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,864
This is my life.

1009
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,240
So stop meddling!

1010
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:18,367
It's hard coming back if you go too far.

1011
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,785
Listen to me, just this once.

1012
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,663
Mr. Lee is really putting up a fight
with Mr. Song this time.

1013
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,749
A man who has nothing to lose

1014
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,417
can be such a hassle.

1015
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,878
Use this chance to destroy him
and make a comeback.

1016
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,838
I know the right man for this.

1017
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,339
How are you related to him?

1018
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,258
If this gets disclosed Mr. Song will...

1019
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,594
Are you OK losing
someone that's good at his job?

1020
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,846
It's the right time to destroy him.
