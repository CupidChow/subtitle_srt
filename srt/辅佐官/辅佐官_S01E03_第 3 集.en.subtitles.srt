1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,480
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,982
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,073
What time is it?

4
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,368
It's still early.

5
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,245
You should get more sleep.

6
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,471
Why did you wake up so early?

7
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,223
You didn't get much sleep yesterday.

8
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,892
Don't overwork yourself.

9
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,270
My situation is a little different
from yours, Ms. Assemblywoman.

10
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,396
Here's the next story.

11
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,941
Some are suspecting
that Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong is being

12
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,819
unreasonably lenient toward
Bugang Electronics during the audit.

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,279
Assemblyman Jo denied the speculations,

14
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,864
but the Environment and Labor Committee

15
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,783
is discussing whether Assemblyman Jo...

16
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,660
When do you think
the hearing can be resumed?

17
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,328
I think the audit will end like this.

18
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,748
Unlike someone, I don't have the ability
to salvage such a mess.

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,084
What about you?

20
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,628
I just need to tackle KLAC
and the Ministry of Justice now.

21
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,713
The latter will be the highlight.

22
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,263
People call the Minister of Justice
a weasel.

23
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,889
He's good at weaseling out of things.

24
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,766
Can you catch him?

25
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,061
Tae-jun, I can't stand seeing people

26
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,148
who should be behind me
hovering in front of me.

27
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,649
To give you my position,

28
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,777
I have to clean up the mess
in front of me. Am I wrong?

29
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,988
I have to catch him.

30
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,948
Just be careful.

31
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,743
The Minister of Justice oversees all
the prosecutors in this country after all.

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,120
It won't be easy.

33
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,747
Even Assemblyman Song
was taught a lesson, you know.

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,418
-He even got ousted--
-Weasels have sharp teeth indeed.

35
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,171
Who knows what can happen to me
if I'm not careful?

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,172
That's why
I must take him down in one blow

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,968
and make sure he can't fight back.

38
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,805
I've come this far, so I can't give up.

39
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,725
If there is something blocking my way,
I must jump over it.

40
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,478
In order to make sure
you can jump over it,

41
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,648
I'll lend you my shoulder.

42
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,379
Hello.

43
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,849
Everyone has a different starting point
and their own reasons for their choices.

44
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,851
HAN DO-GYEONG

45
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,733
However, everyone is taking a step forward

46
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,778
to find their own place in the world.

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,530
This stop is National Assembly.

48
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,283
The doors are on your left.

49
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,373
The doors are opening.

50
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,299
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT

51
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,135
Hello.

52
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,982
Sir.

53
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,405
Hello there, Ms. Kang.

54
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,573
-Let's go in.
-Everyone's position may be different,

55
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,369
but we're all here on our own journeys.

56
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,005
EPISODE 3

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,007
Tae-jun.

58
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,550
Did you see the news?

59
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,261
The sign from Assemblyman Lee's
district office fell on a passerby,

60
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,054
resulting in a severe injury.

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,223
The victim of the accident,
a woman in her 40s,

62
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,183
was sent to a hospital nearby and is now

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,227
-undergoing her second surgery.
-It's your fault!

64
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,604
The police are investigating if the sign

65
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,190
violated any of the regulations
for signs and advertising devices.

66
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,525
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min

67
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,610
expressed his regret
and visited the victim,

68
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,196
but the victim's family
refused to meet him.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,782
-How much are you willing to pay...
-Say a few words.

70
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,076
-Please make a comment.
-Do you admit it?

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,662
-I'll look into it.
-Sir, let us interview you.

72
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,671
Hello.

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,634
Which one is a latte?

74
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,720
Oh, the latte is for the chief of staff.

75
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,138
Mr. Jang doesn't drink latte.

76
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,723
No, the other one.

77
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,058
"The other one"?

78
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,350
Who?

79
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,854
The sign from Assemblyman Lee's
district office fell on a passerby,

80
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,856
resulting in a severe injury.

81
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,610
Mr. Oh Won-sik is here
from the district office.

82
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,403
The victim of the accident,
who is a woman in her 40s,

83
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,906
was sent to a hospital nearby
and is now undergoing her second surgery.

84
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,823
You see,

85
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,701
because he keeps going on about labor laws
and regulations,

86
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,370
it's practically impossible
to run a business here in Seongjin.

87
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,581
When he asked me to come here for drinks,

88
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,917
I knew something was up.

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,126
That must be it.

90
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,253
I'll talk to Mr. Lee Seong-min.

91
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,839
No, it's okay. I'll take care of it.

92
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,925
The police are investigating
if the sign violated

93
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,551
-any of the regulations for signs
-Hey.

94
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,677
and advertising devices.

95
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,262
-You're here.
-Assemblyman Lee expressed

96
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,516
his regret and visited the victim,
but the victim's family refused...

97
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,936
Oh, boy. I hope her injury
isn't too serious. This is terrible.

98
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,273
The lack of attention to safety
in this country is a serious problem.

99
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,400
Here's your latte, sir.

100
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,780
-Mr. Oh.
-My gosh! How have you been?

101
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,743
Not well, obviously.
I've been so bored without you, sir.

102
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,869
Right, I bet.

103
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,539
So how's it going? Are you liking the job?

104
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,874
Yes, sir. I'm doing my best.

105
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,920
-Do you know him?
-Mr. Oh recommended me for this job.

106
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,090
He did? I didn't know.

107
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,008
Oh, here you go.

108
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,344
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

109
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,141
What brings you by?

110
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,352
Mr. Song wants to see me.

111
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,068
Hey, yes. Hang on a second.

112
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,113
Are there any sticky notes lying around?

113
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,086
Yes. Song Jin-seok.

114
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,046
SONG JIN-SEOK

115
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,924
Wonseong Bio. Okay.

116
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,177
All right, I'll call you.

117
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,804
Then I should...

118
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,223
Oh, sit down.

119
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,602
-Let's go for a smoke.
-Sounds good.

120
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,770
Do-gyeong, do you want to come?

121
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,522
I don't smoke.

122
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,107
All right, then.

123
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,194
-Ms. Yun, how have you been?
-Hello.

124
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,946
Jeez, you're making it so obvious
that you hate me.

125
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,364
Smile a little, please.

126
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,450
-Hello.
-Hi, long time no see.

127
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,414
My, it's so nice to be back in Seoul
after such a long time.

128
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,126
Yes, it's important to wear this
here in Seoul.

129
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,337
There. Nice one.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,802
-Who is he?
-It's Mr. Go Seok-man.

131
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,639
-Hello!
-Oh, hello.

132
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,726
Jeez.

133
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,812
-Any updates?
-I spoke to those at the local precinct.

134
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,397
It does look like someone

135
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,566
touched the connecting bracket,

136
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,276
but it could've been for a repair job,

137
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,155
or someone could've tampered with it.
They're not sure yet.

138
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,865
Was anyone caught on the security footage?

139
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,408
It's an old building

140
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,703
so there are no security cameras.

141
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,872
The rooftop is always open,

142
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,749
so anyone can get in.

143
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,793
We'll close it
as a negligent maintenance case,

144
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,420
but I heard the victim is preparing
to sue Assemblyman Lee.

145
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,548
-I just sent you some photos.
-Okay.

146
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,680
LEE SEONG-MIN

147
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,147
I guess you have time to enjoy cycling.

148
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,607
Don't even get me started.

149
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,901
My boss won't take it easy
even if the audit is halted.

150
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,778
From a meeting and a public hearing

151
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,031
to this local cycling event,
I already made three stops.

152
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,535
-Jungil-gu?
-Yes, Ms. Kang was born in that area.

153
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,913
She needs to build support
in the district for the upcoming election.

154
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,374
She doesn't have a super supportive one,
unlike your boss.

155
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,585
She only has a ten-percent chance
of getting reelected.

156
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,296
-We'll do anything at this point.
-So you participated in the race?

157
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,422
Of course.

158
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,965
As her chief of staff,

159
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,926
it is my duty to run and sweat
to meet and listen to the people.

160
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,846
Look at you always dressed in a full suit.

161
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,764
You won't get anything done.

162
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,434
You pretentious jerk,
you only care about looking good.

163
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,813
By the way, I saw Mr. Oh earlier.

164
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,274
Right.

165
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,277
What?
What's up with that nonchalant answer?

166
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,113
He was shunted off because of you.

167
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,698
He won't just sit still.

168
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,160
If you're not careful,
he'll end up reaping

169
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,120
all the rewards of your hard work.

170
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,080
-Don't worry about me.
-Hey.

171
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,417
Just continue to run

172
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,252
as hard as you can for your boss, okay?

173
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,005
That prick. Jeez, what a jerk.

174
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,426
No, that's not right.

175
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,595
Those things must be discussed in person.

176
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,805
-Hey, you see--
-Then I'll...

177
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,140
-Won-sik.
-Yes.

178
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,850
Spare me a second.

179
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,269
Why are you here?

180
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,522
I told you that Mr. Song summoned me.
Are you deaf or what?

181
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,026
How did you hurt your hand?

182
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,320
My hand? Oh, this?

183
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,531
-While doing something.
-What time did you get here?

184
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,870
Hey, Jang Tae-jun.
Are you interrogating me or what?

185
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,499
Do you still think you're a cop
like ten years ago?

186
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
How dare you act like one?

187
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,754
Were you behind the incident
regarding Mr. Lee?

188
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,341
You have so many questions.

189
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,843
Do you like me or something?
But I don't like you.

190
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,140
Just focus on your work. Don't poke
your nose into others' business.

191
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,352
Also, why are you trying to lay eggs
in someone else's nest?

192
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,770
Are you a cuckoo or what?

193
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,689
Don't cross the line, Tae-jun.
You might get hurt.

194
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,650
Got it?

195
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,118
That prick.

196
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,622
I'm back.

197
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,958
Thanks for doing that.

198
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,169
You finished the race today,
so you may be in the top tier next time.

199
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,089
Don't even go there. I can't do it again.

200
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,844
Here, take this.

201
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,808
Are you giving me this
to make me work even harder?

202
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,144
I might die at this rate.
I have no energy these days.

203
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,687
That's why I got this for you.

204
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,860
I hope it energizes you.
We're only starting now.

205
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,450
Have you arranged the meeting
with the mayor of Jungil-gu?

206
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,201
He keeps avoiding me.

207
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,953
And he hasn't commented on the proposal.

208
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,873
Many low-income earners live in Jungil-gu

209
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,958
and the percentage
of lone-parent families is high.

210
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,128
Also, the district's child poverty rate
is 69.4 percent.

211
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,963
It is crucial for the election as well,

212
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,298
but we absolutely have to

213
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,425
pull this project off.

214
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,470
That's why I mentioned it to those
in Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong's office,

215
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,512
but will he help us out?

216
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,099
We'll have to make him help us.

217
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,186
-Is the weekly briefing note ready?
-Yes.

218
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,272
I just need to revise it.

219
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,733
I'll take care of it.
After I finish revising this,

220
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,319
please send it to Assemblyman Jo
and other top-tier members.

221
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,321
Sure.

222
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,115
I got the list,

223
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,952
but why haven't you sent
the supplementary materials yet?

224
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,955
The Ministry of Justice is refusing
to send the materials.

225
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,832
This is Jang Tae-jun.

226
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,083
We requested them a week ago.

227
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,086
How could they not be ready yet?
Send them by this afternoon,

228
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,379
or I'll send someone there.

229
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,843
Cuckoo, cuckoo, the cuckoo

230
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,014
Cries in the woods

231
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,016
Why did you guys leave the door open?

232
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,686
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir! I'm here.

233
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,105
Hey, Won-sik!
Thanks for coming all the way here.

234
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,774
-Come on in.
-Sure.

235
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,115
Hey, he wants to have the meeting now.

236
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,659
Got it, sir!

237
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,539
Hey, what are you doing?
Aren't you coming?

238
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,875
I'm still just an intern, sir.

239
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,336
Interns should sit in these meetings
and learn.

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,879
Come on in. Join us.

241
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,261
Come join us.

242
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,680
Yes, sir.

243
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,475
INTERN
HAN DO-GYEONG

244
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,396
We'll bring the Bugang Electronics case
to the table at the MOJ hearing

245
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,313
during the audit

246
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,148
and pressure the Minister of Justice.

247
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,109
We'll interrogate him
about the investigation

248
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,111
being delayed
and if he was involved in the--

249
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,947
Don't you think we need
something stronger?

250
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,912
We don't have firm evidence
to prove his involvement.

251
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,122
Oh, boy.

252
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,416
What do you think?

253
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,046
What do I know? But I agree
that it doesn't sound impactful enough.

254
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,717
Don't worry too much though.
The MOJ hearing is tomorrow,

255
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,303
so I'm sure Tae-jun has a plan. Right?

256
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,017
Shall we go arrange the documents?

257
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,562
This sounds like...

258
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,063
What does this mean?

259
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,484
Got it, sir.

260
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,373
That prick, Park Jong-gil,

261
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,043
must have buried his shit
deep in the ground.

262
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,377
He left no trace.

263
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,464
-Then we should dig even deeper.
-Got any leads?

264
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,180
-Cha Dong-ho?
-He's the whistleblower

265
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,223
that reported Bugang's slush fund
four years ago.

266
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,851
He disclosed Bugang's slush fund
of over ten billion won,

267
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,145
but the prosecution
investigated him for defamation

268
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,647
and spreading false information,

269
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,900
and Bugang was acquitted
for lack of evidence.

270
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,818
The investigation
was overseen by the deputy--

271
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,613
The current Minister of Justice,
Park Jong-gil.

272
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes.

273
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,661
That's right.

274
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,663
MINISTER OF JUSTICE
HOLDS PROSECUTION LIABLE

275
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,582
It's about time the flower fell.

276
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,877
The floor leader and the chief
of the central prosecutors' office.

277
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,713
The Minister of Justice
is the only one left now.

278
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,924
Sir, you promised me

279
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,509
that you'll nominate me

280
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,302
if you're appointed Minister of Justice.

281
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,972
Please keep that promise.

282
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,181
When the tables turn,

283
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,558
I shall certainly take care
of my most loyal aide first.

284
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
Come on. It's a given.

285
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,978
Then what about Mr. Oh?

286
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,563
Gosh, no. Don't worry about Won-sik.

287
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,399
I summoned him for a task, that's all.

288
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,401
Don't worry about anything else.

289
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,444
Just focus on Park Jong-gil for now.

290
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,364
If I manage to get him ousted
and make that title mine,

291
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,200
who do you think will get my district?
You know what I mean?

292
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,412
If we can't get him ousted this time,

293
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,039
and if he manages
to reform the prosecution,

294
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,124
it'll get even harder.

295
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,460
This is our last chance,
both for you and me.

296
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,381
I promise I'll make you
the next Minister of Justice, sir.

297
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,264
Sir, the hearing
for KLAC is about to begin.

298
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,683
Jeez, what a hassle. Oh, dear.

299
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,231
Gosh. Darn it.

300
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,066
Goodness.

301
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,401
You have a lunch meeting

302
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,029
with the Judiciary Committee
and the Minister of Justice at noon.

303
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,198
What? Why do they want
to have lunch together during the audit?

304
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,201
How dare he summon me for just a meal?

305
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,494
-Let's go, sir.
-Okay.

306
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,707
See you later.
Look into the Cha Dong-ho case closely.

307
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,875
I will, sir.

308
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,341
-About this...
-Hello, Ms. Kang.

309
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,218
Now may not be the best time.

310
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,428
Are you doing your job?

311
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,472
What's with these ridiculous articles?

312
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,723
Do your job better!

313
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,309
I made sure to explain everything
to the reporters.

314
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,644
Jeez, they never listen. I apologize, sir.

315
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,398
Yes, come in.

316
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,610
Find out who sent that document
to Lee Seong-min.

317
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,153
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,698
CAREER OF JO GAP-YEONG'S SON
PAVED WITH FAVORS

319
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,167
How's it going
with the issue about your son?

320
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,669
Gosh, I'm backed into a corner
because of it.

321
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,924
I wonder how Lee Seong-min
obtained that information.

322
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,593
Is it that prick, Jang Tae-jun, again?

323
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,053
Any guesses?

324
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,388
I'm not sure.

325
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,183
Maybe it was done by the opposition.

326
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,269
We'll soon find out who did it.

327
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,314
Please don't hesitate to let me know
if you need anything.

328
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,024
I'll help.

329
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,279
I read the briefing note
of the weekly meeting,

330
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,031
but there's nothing about me.

331
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,284
I was told to refrain from bringing up
the issues involving you.

332
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,789
I know everyone in politics
is exploitative and cutthroat,

333
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,582
but isn't this too harsh?

334
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,127
The party should be helping me
at a time like this.

335
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,299
I heard you're doing a project
with the mayor of Jungil-gu.

336
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,844
Was it for supporting lone parents?

337
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,554
Yes, sir.

338
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,224
-It's not easy though.
-He's my friend!

339
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,559
I'll put in a good word for you.

340
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,770
I read the proposal,
and it's for such a good cause.

341
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,856
It needs to be done.

342
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,774
Thank you, sir.

343
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,487
At the briefing, I'll do my best
to explain your situation.

344
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,365
-That's the least I can do for you.
-I'd appreciate that.

345
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,160
It should be explained
at such an official occasion,

346
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,080
and I'd love it to be done by you,
our spokesperson.

347
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,790
Right.

348
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,502
MINISTER OF JUSTICE PARK JONG-GIL

349
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,879
Excuse me for a second.

350
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,756
Yes, sir.

351
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,135
Prosecutor Seo
at the Western Prosecutors' Office

352
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,555
is investigating Jang Tae-jun
and Assemblyman Song at the moment.

353
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,432
If you give him some support,

354
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,893
he'll take care of the issue with Bugang.

355
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,977
Yes. Understood, sir.

356
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,312
Oh, and...

357
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,982
-You may leave now.
-Okay.

358
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,491
And before you go...

359
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,787
Mr. Jang, who's Cha Dong-ho?

360
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,832
He’s a whistleblower who exposed
Bugang Electronics' irregularities.

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,084
Oh, I remember him.

362
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,463
But that case already ended.
What more would there be?

363
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,590
Mr. Kim, you should go talk
to Mr. Cha Dong-ho.

364
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,634
Pardon? Me?

365
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,720
But I need to attend the hearing
for KLAC later.

366
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:22,846
I'll go.

367
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,437
I'm okay. I can be in control of this.

368
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,398
I know how much you need
Cha Dong-ho right now.

369
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,483
And the same goes for me.

370
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,779
You know why I started
working here in the first place.

371
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,324
Mr. Cha is still suffering
due to the compensation trial

372
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,575
that Bugang started.

373
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,453
I want to help him.
Please let me go meet him.

374
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,298
It's the list of evidence he had
during the prosecution investigation.

375
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,384
There may be material
that hasn't been revealed.

376
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,636
-Any story will be of value to us.
-Yes, sir.

377
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
-Mr. Han.
-Yes?

378
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
I want you to go meet Mr. Cha
with Ms. Yun.

379
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,271
Okay, sir.

380
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,023
Ask the central prosecutors' office
for the investigation materials.

381
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,192
-I'll go fetch them myself.
-Okay, sir.

382
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,778
I'll see you when I get back. Let's go.

383
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,655
See you later, sir.

384
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,830
JEONGGIL GARDEN

385
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,132
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

386
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,678
My goodness.

387
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,055
-Enjoy your meal, sir.
-Okay, thanks.

388
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,271
My gosh, the weather is amazing.

389
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,193
LUNCH WITH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

390
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,656
My gosh, take some rest.

391
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,325
Aren't you tired of driving at that age?

392
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,202
Of course, I'm tired.

393
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,414
I'm doing this
because I need to earn a living.

394
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,708
You should've learned a skill or two
when you were young.

395
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,295
My gosh, he's living such a tiring life.

396
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,882
JEONGGIL GARDEN

397
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,471
Enjoy your meal, sir.

398
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,228
Long time no see.

399
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,231
I thought you got ousted by Tae-jun
and were shunted off.

400
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,818
What are you talking about?
I was just there to get some fresh air.

401
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,738
You must not be getting ready
for the audit.

402
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,032
You look way too comfortable.

403
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,450
Are you kidding me?

404
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,995
My team is going through so much shit
because of Jang Tae-jun.

405
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,623
He talks for two hours over the phone
asking them for one material.

406
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,084
My gosh, no wonder they call him a viper.
He's so persistent.

407
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,337
-He's so harsh to the same ruling party.
-He's known to be hardheaded.

408
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,965
Tell me what you guys are preparing.

409
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,093
Let's help each other out.

410
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,137
How can I tell you when I know nothing?

411
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,644
Should we go for a smoke?

412
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,027
I'm sorry

413
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,072
that short rib soup is the best
I can treat you to at the moment.

414
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,034
But it's made with premium beef,
so it'll taste very nice.

415
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,247
But I'm not sure
if it'll suit your palate, Mr. Song.

416
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,542
Mr. Song used to be a butcher,

417
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,335
so he knows meat like no other.

418
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,965
If you all help me pass the reform bill
regarding the prosecution,

419
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,592
I'll treat you all to some beef next time.

420
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,180
Minister, I've seen a lot of people
get their jaws dislocated

421
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,643
while trying to butcher a cow
because they didn't do it right.

422
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,520
So be careful.

423
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,444
This is nice. Let's eat, everyone.

424
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,451
Eat up.

425
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,332
129-16 JEHYEON-RO

426
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,928
Is anyone here?

427
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,648
Dad, someone's here.

428
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,503
This is the list of evidence you handed in
during the investigation.

429
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,673
Can you please check
if there's anything missing?

430
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,885
We'll make sure this doesn't harm you.

431
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,472
We'll do everything we can
to make sure your courage

432
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,599
doesn't go to waste.

433
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,274
This is the bill
we're preparing to submit.

434
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,527
We're going to amend the current bill
so that whistleblowers like you

435
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,029
won't have to suffer from damage.

436
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,239
If this works out well,

437
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,202
you and other victims
will start getting protected by the law.

438
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,497
Is someone here?

439
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,042
Hello, I'm Yun Hye-won.

440
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,419
-I work for Assemblyman Song Hui-seop.
-I'm Han Do-gyeong.

441
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,131
Please leave.

442
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,342
We don't want to meet anyone

443
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,761
whether that person is
an assemblyman or the President.

444
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,013
We can set things straight this time.

445
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,683
-If you help us...
-You want us to help?

446
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,310
How can you say that
after seeing how we're living?

447
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,565
You're just here to use us
to your advantage!

448
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,485
Don't ever come here again.

449
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,654
We don't need stuff like this!

450
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,031
So please leave.

451
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,783
Get out!

452
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,827
Get out of here right now!

453
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,879
129-16 JEHYEON-RO

454
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,550
How did Mr. Cha end up living like this?

455
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,553
The company found out
that he exposed their slush fund.

456
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,972
This is what always happens
to whistleblowers.

457
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,726
Once their identity gets revealed,
their lives become miserable.

458
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,069
Mr. Cha Dong-ho, the man who exposed
Bugang Electronics' slush fund,

459
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,697
attempted suicide last night
and ended up in a critical condition.

460
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,158
He was feeling tormented
due to his personnel appointment

461
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,909
after he had reported his company.

462
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,663
It turns out he ended up
overdosing on tranquilizers.

463
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,375
Excuse me.

464
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,214
Is this Mr. Cha Dong-ho's place?

465
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,425
Yes, who is it?

466
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,844
We're from Seoul District Court.

467
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,138
You've failed to compensate
Mr. Kim In-gyu,

468
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,349
so we'll be carrying out
a provisional seizure.

469
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,516
What are you talking about?

470
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,603
From what I know,
we still have some time left.

471
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,647
If there's a problem,
you can file an objection in court.

472
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,943
Let's get it done.

473
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,447
But this is... Wait.

474
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,075
Wait!

475
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,266
Ms. Kang.

476
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,104
The mayor of Jungil-gu

477
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,855
wants to meet with you tonight.

478
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,358
He's willing to use their budget
to proceed with the project.

479
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,652
He even sent a budget proposal
to meet the cost.

480
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,487
How did you manage to do this?

481
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,156
It's all because you wrote
an amazing proposal.

482
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,033
I guess he just didn't want
to lose his chance.

483
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,869
Make the dinner reservation,

484
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,288
and send the additional proposal
to the mayor.

485
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,248
Okay.

486
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,708
Hello?

487
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,294
Okay.

488
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,298
Ms. Kang, the reporters have gathered
in the press room.

489
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,717
You should go first.
I left something in my office.

490
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,011
Okay.

491
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,725
Where are you coming from?

492
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,685
The doors are closing.

493
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,895
The central prosecutors' office.
Because of the audit.

494
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,525
I tried calling Mr. Lee,
but he won't even answer.

495
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,943
I can't reach him either.

496
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,281
If you do get a hold of him,
tell him that I'm willing to help.

497
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,117
Tell him I can help him
with the legal stuff.

498
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,119
Okay, I'll let him know.

499
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,166
Do you know Prosecutor Seo
at the Western Prosecutors' Office?

500
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,502
Prosecutor Seo Hyeong-cheol?

501
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,628
May I help you?

502
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,881
I'm here to meet Prosecutor Seo.

503
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,592
He and Mr. Jo are from the same college.

504
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,510
He issued the search
and seizure warrant on me.

505
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,346
The Minister of Justice
is going to use Prosecutor Seo

506
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,099
to investigate both you and Mr. Song.

507
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,476
You need to hurry up.

508
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,270
You'll be in trouble if you fail
to bring down Mr. Park at the audit.

509
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,190
Mr. Song won't protect you either.

510
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,735
Hey, how did it go?

511
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,197
Okay.

512
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,200
-What is it?
-I think the Ministry of Justice

513
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,367
is already on the move.

514
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,661
I'll call you later.

515
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,916
Mr. Jang, it's weird
that they seized Mr. Cha's house

516
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,043
when there's still some time left
until the due date.

517
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,045
-Who's the creditor?
-Kim In-gyu.

518
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,005
He was Mr. Cha's colleague at Bugang.

519
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,674
He lent Mr. Cha money when
Mr. Cha started having financial trouble.

520
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,303
Kim In-gyu became the team leader
of Bugang Electronics' finance team.

521
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,889
The Ministry of Justice did this
to prevent Mr. Cha from talking.

522
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,114
-What's all this?
-They're from the Ministry of Justice.

523
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,075
They mixed everything up.

524
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,868
It'll take a few days to organize these.

525
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,664
But the audit is tomorrow.
They're totally trying to screw us over.

526
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,708
How did the Ministry of Justice find out
that we were going to meet Mr. Cha?

527
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,962
Where's Mr. Cha's investigation file?

528
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,093
All his statements are censored.

529
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,304
I don't think it's going to help.

530
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,312
The opposition parties
including Kookmin Party

531
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,314
were busy badmouthing each other

532
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,400
-which caused eyebrows to raise.
-Sir.

533
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,609
What is it?

534
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,362
I asked the guys
at Mr. Lee Seong-min's office.

535
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,656
They didn't come up
with the questions that Mr. Lee asked.

536
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,907
But right before the audit,

537
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,661
Ms. Kang and Mr. Lee apparently met up
for a very short while.

538
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,747
We promise we will diligently carry out
the rest of the audit.

539
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,959
-About Assemblyman Jo's son...
-She is unbelievably cunning.

540
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,628
Look at her smiling
after having stabbed me in the back.

541
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,755
After all I did
to put her in that position.

542
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,549
What will you do, sir?

543
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,762
I'm going to wipe that smile off her face.

544
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,348
Please refrain from
writing any speculative articles.

545
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,270
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Kim In-gyu?

546
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,147
Yes, that's me.

547
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,649
I'm Jang Tae-jun
from Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office.

548
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,778
Can you please just leave me alone?

549
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,405
I'm already having a hard time.

550
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,032
Mr. Cha's going through a lot worse.

551
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,326
The court even seized his house.

552
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,037
There was nothing I could do
to help Dong-ho.

553
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,582
So please leave,
and I hope we never meet again.

554
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,752
You're really putting me in a pickle
by coming here like this.

555
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,883
The prosecution is carrying out
a reinvestigation into Bugang Electronics.

556
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,385
If you just stay still,
you might end up getting hurt too.

557
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,386
Let me go.

558
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,015
Mr. Kim!

559
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,981
-Here.
-Thank you.

560
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,279
Did Mr. Cha pick up?

561
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,157
No.

562
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,456
I got a call from Mr. Oh
saying he's going to get off work

563
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,500
-along with Mr. Song.
-Okay.

564
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,544
And I think I also need to go home.

565
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,506
Okay, you should go.

566
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,050
-Okay. Bye, everyone.
-Go home safely.

567
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,428
I knew she was going to go home soon.

568
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,891
Bring me the budget and settlement
of the Ministry of Justice.

569
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,895
Everything?

570
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,814
Got it.

571
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,900
I'll go bring them.

572
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,987
Yes. I know that.

573
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,279
Yes, I know.

574
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,160
Ms. Kang, the mayor of Jungil-gu

575
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,955
can't come because
he has another appointment.

576
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,999
What appointment?

577
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,334
Well, he apparently needs
to meet with Mr. Jo Gap-yeong.

578
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,212
And he put a hold on the budget proposal.

579
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:30,216
I think Mr. Jo found out
that you gave those materials to Mr. Lee.

580
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,968
I guess I took things a bit too far.

581
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,761
After all, he got elected three times,

582
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,180
and he's on the same side
as the Minister of Justice.

583
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,267
He was never an easy mark.

584
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,898
What a waste.

585
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,775
Let's eat before we leave.

586
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,710
Excuse me. Mr. Jang.

587
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,296
I don't think organizing these materials
is going to help us.

588
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,465
They're mostly insignificant receipts.

589
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,175
And I need to go to the audit tomorrow.

590
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,429
Okay, fine.

591
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,975
-You can go home.
-Okay.

592
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,023
Why are you guys still here?
Aren't you going home?

593
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,817
I'll go a little later. You can go first.

594
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,738
-What about you, Do-gyeong?
-I'll go later as well.

595
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,739
Okay, then.

596
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,910
Don't spend too much time
on those receipts. You won't get anything.

597
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,496
It's okay. I'm enjoying it.

598
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,791
"Everything starts with something small."

599
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,005
It's what Mr. Jang once said
in an interview.

600
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,466
I should do my best
even if it seems petty.

601
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,885
Okay, then. Do your best.

602
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,638
See you.

603
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,556
Bye, sir.

604
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,313
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION SYSTEM

605
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,775
Ms. Yun.

606
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,151
Yes?

607
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,571
Can I also take a look at the files
you organized

608
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,823
regarding the whistleblowers?

609
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,746
I'd like to know how a bill gets prepared.

610
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,501
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION SYSTEM

611
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,796
HOW TO PROTECT WHISTLEBLOWERS

612
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,592
Sure.

613
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,929
Thank you.

614
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,297
Why are you here? I'm sure you're busy.

615
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,299
How's the patient?

616
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,675
Fortunately, she's better now.

617
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,720
Then why are you still here?
You should just go home.

618
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,388
I should be here when she wakes up.

619
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,184
I heard someone tampered with your sign.

620
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,768
You should request an investigation.

621
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,313
Don't try to take the blame
for everything again.

622
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,149
Ms. Kang also offered to help,
so you should talk to her.

623
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,567
How nice of her.

624
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,571
But I should focus on the patient for now.
I'll think about the rest later.

625
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,156
Don't worry.

626
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,992
By the way,

627
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,328
is there something wrong?

628
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,537
What do you mean?

629
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,498
You always come to me to nag
every time something doesn't work out.

630
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,168
You put on that nasty frown
like a mother-in-law who didn't eat.

631
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,129
What are you talking about?

632
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,048
I came because I was worried.

633
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,849
Aren't you sick of living like this?

634
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,270
Of course, I'm sick of it.
But I need to bear with it.

635
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,064
I worked so hard to get here.

636
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,900
A personal assistant, secretary,
and now the chief of staff.

637
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,194
I put up with taking care
of the old men for ten years.

638
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,112
So how can I stop now?

639
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,822
I need to climb up the ladder.

640
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,407
Yes, you deserve to climb that ladder.

641
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,910
You worked harder than anyone
and are smart.

642
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,119
But

643
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,039
don't climb up too high.

644
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,209
The higher you go, the harsher it gets.

645
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,730
Make sure you don't skip your meals.

646
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,162
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG

647
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,497
How about we get some fresh air?

648
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,889
Ms. Yun.

649
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,726
You don't need to feel sorry.

650
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,060
You can go home now.

651
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,024
-No, never mind. It's okay.
-You're making me feel uncomfortable.

652
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,025
You should go home.

653
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,864
Well, I do need to catch the last train.

654
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,866
I'll be off now.

655
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,035
Bye, Ms. Yun.

656
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,301
This is what I'm talking about.
It's nice to be here after so long.

657
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,846
You really like this place.

658
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,225
I get to sit here absentmindedly
without having to deal with anyone.

659
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,770
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes, it is nice.

660
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,731
What are you going to do with Mr. Jo?

661
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,608
We had our good days,

662
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,319
so I should at least give him
a proper farewell.

663
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,654
There's no such thing
as a beautiful farewell anyway.

664
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,454
You're the one who seems exhausted.

665
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,747
You're right.

666
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,666
This is all quite tiring.

667
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,129
Don't worry. No one can beat you.

668
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,923
Apart from me, that is.

669
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,930
So don't go around
looking like you lost already.

670
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,348
It doesn't suit you.

671
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,309
Let's do everything we can
to bring down the Minister of Justice.

672
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,560
I'll help.

673
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,653
Thanks. Let me rely on you.

You just got home?

677
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,717
Yes, Mom. You're still awake?

678
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,429
-Why are you always so late?
-Well...

679
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,930
The civil service exam is coming up.

680
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,267
Goodnight.

681
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,401

00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,532
Okay.

688
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,660
No, there's no need to come.

689
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,415
Hey.

690
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,336
He's trying to show that it's his turf.

691
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,254
-Sir.
-Hello.

692
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,548
-Sir.
-I hope things go well.

693
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,632
Hello, sir.

694
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,426
-Have you found anything?
-No, not yet.

695
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,097
Question the relations between Bugang
and the central prosecutors' office.

696
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,766
-Meanwhile, I'll try to find something.
-Okay.

697
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,269
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

698
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,147
Do a better job.

699
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,494
Let's go.

700
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,290
How did Won-sik end up coming here
with Mr. Song?

701
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,417
They drank together all night last night

702
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,043
and slept at a dry sauna.

703
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,461
Don't be too bothered by him.

704
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,838
He's heading back today.

705
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,631
But I feel like he's up to something.

706
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,757
Mr. Oh met up

707
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,552
with the Minister of Justice's
chief of staff yesterday.

708
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,763
But don't say anything to him.

709
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,654
Ms. Yun

710
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,782
has been organizing all these materials
regarding the bill herself.

711
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:39,992
These are about

712
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,786
how to improve the current
whistleblower protection system.

713
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,497
I thought it might help
if at least one person read it,

714
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,790
so I brought it back.

715
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,504
129-16 JEHYEON-RO

716
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,934
Mr. Han.

717
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,940
The Minister of Justice will read
the oath out loud as the representative

718
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,778
and hand it in to the chairperson himself.

719
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:18,906
"I solemnly swear

720
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,992
that I, the Minister of Justice,
will sincerely receive the 2019 audit

721
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,827
regarding all the duties that fall under

722
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,955
the Ministry of Justice's jurisdiction
based on Article 61 of the Constitution,

723
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,667
-Good luck.
-Article 127 of the National Assembly Act,

724
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,585
and Article 10
of the Act on the Inspection

725
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,171
and Investigation of State Administration.

726
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,882
And in testimony as a witness,

727
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,176
I will speak truthfully
based on Article Seven of

728
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,096
-the Act on Testimony and Appraisal
-Send me the video of his testimony.

729
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,473
-before the National Assembly.
-Okay.

730
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,184
And if there is a lie in my statement
or written answer,

731
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,978
I swear that I will be punished
for perjury."

732
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,563
Hey.

733
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,899
Mr. Cha?

734
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,986
How did you find out?

735
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,325
-Who?
-Mr. Han...

736
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,997
This might be a little different,

737
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:13,335
but my dad also had to go through
a rough time.

738
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,504
No one even bothered to listen to him

739
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,673
including the police
and the company he worked for.

740
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,636
But there was one person
who stood by his side and supported him.

741
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,406
Thanks to him,

742
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,783
my dad was able to fight until the end.

743
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,549
Ms. Yun and I

744
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,968
will do everything in our power
to help people like you

745
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,470
who are fighting a hard battle.

746
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,638
We're trying our best to be of help.

747
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,975
We're not trying to use you, sir.

748
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,770
I know you're suffering,

749
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,274
but I came because I wanted to tell you
that there are people

750
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,026
who support your courage

751
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,112
and wish to help you out.

752
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:33,040
ANALYSIS ON THE IDEAL AND THE REAL
THAT WHISTLEBLOWERS GO THROUGH

753
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,421
Mr. Jang, this is Han Do-gyeong speaking.

754
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,799
We should find the transaction details
of the corporate credit card.

755
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,927
The CEO of Bugang, the chief prosecutor,

756
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,262
and the Minister of Justice
met up every month.

757
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,515
They used Bugang's corporate card
to pay for everything.

758
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,892
-Paid by whom?
-Kim In-gyu.

759
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,143
Send me the recording file.

760
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,354
Mr. Han, good work.

761
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,524
Thank you, sir.

762
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,578
INTERVIEW WITH MR. CHA

763
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,705
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG

764
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,296
Hey, I just sent you an audio file. I need
Bugang's credit card transaction details

765
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,132
and the testimony of Kim In-gyu.
Can you do it?

766
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,717
The news department of KTN is covering

767
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,220
the relations of the police
and Bugang Electronics.

768
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,973
I think they'll be interested
in the audio file.

769
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,058
I'll call the head of the news department.

770
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,059
Okay.

771
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,229
CONFERENCE HALL
AUDIT IN PROGESS

772
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,109
I think Tae-jun found something.

773
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,610
I couldn't hear it specifically,

774
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,363
but he mentioned something
about credit card transaction details.

775
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,701
Credit card?

776
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,335
If you stop Jang Tae-jun,

777
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,713
Mr. Park will help you
with your son's issue.

778
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,464
Just help us get through the audit.

779
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,216
Darn it.

780
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,177
He always orders me around
when he does nothing for me.

781
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,680
Mr. Kim!

782
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,098
Come in.

783
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,189
What brings you here?

784
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,775
I wanted to resolve
a misunderstanding between us.

785
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,987
-What misunderstanding?
-You seemed to be cautious of me.

786
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,573
You know Mr. Park was in charge
of Bugang's slush fund case

787
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,992
when he was
the deputy chief prosecutor, right?

788
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,370
Mr. Jang Tae-jun has been
looking into that case.

789
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,998
-I know that.
-Then do you also know

790
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,916
what Mr. Jang is up to?

791
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,210
What? Do you know anything?

792
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,546
-Yes.
-What is it?

793
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,589
What is he up to now?

794
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,798
Before I tell you,

795
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,427
please do make a call.

796
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,387
A call?

797
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,726
All right. Making a call

798
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,645
isn't hard to do.

799
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,691
Hey, Mr. Lee.

800
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,234
It's me.

801
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,988
If the personnel information
gets disclosed,

802
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,531
it may disrupt the duty of...

803
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,284
The police have begun
the search and seizure on Bugang.

804
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,953
-Reporters are there too.
-How dare you whisper to each other?

805
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,540
-Come on, Mr. Park.
-Call the Western Prosecutors' Office.

806
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,710
Mr. Park, you need to be aware
that the Ministry of Justice

807
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,712
isn't just any executive branch.

808
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,394
Let's go.

809
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,358
-Who are you?
-What did you say?

810
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,151
Darn it.

811
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,445
From now, the Western Prosecutors' Office
will conduct

812
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,699
the search and seizure on Bugang.

813
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,033
Let's go.

814
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,168
Like you said,
the prosecution made a move.

815
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,670
It's because you helped me out.

816
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,965
But the prosecution will take
all the documents. Is that okay?

817
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,718
The police would have
taken those away anyway.

818
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,594
I need to get something better.

819
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,597
Anyway, thanks. I want
to give you a present. Do you have time?

820
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,850
A present? What is it?

821
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,935
It'd not be fun if I told you already.

822
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,687
It'll be a surprise.

823
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,273
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

824
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,191
FINANCIAL TEAM LEADER
KIM IN-GYU

825
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,865
-Hello?
-This is Jang Tae-jun.

826
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,242
The prosecution will come
with a search and seizure warrant

827
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,453
for the finance team
as well as one for your arrest.

828
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,829
An arrest warrant?

829
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,789
-What are you talking about?
-How can I help you?

830
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,417
I'm Prosecutor Seo Hyeong-cheol.
Where is Mr. Kim In-gyu?

831
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,420
I'll tell you how you can survive.
Come to the parking lot right now.

832
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,797
-Begin the search.
-What is this?

833
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,257
You don't need to know.

834
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,341
Hey, start searching.

835
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,274
We will adjourn the session for dinner

836
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,318
and continue at 9:00 p.m.

837
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,656
-Sir.
-Yes?

838
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,116
Have you heard from Tae-jun?

839
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,453
No. I think he's doing this and that,
but I haven't heard from him.

840
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,704
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

841
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,333
How can I eat in this situation?

842
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,128
Jang Tae-jun, that idiot.
What in the world is he up to?

843
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,009
They found the documents,
but they lost Kim In-gyu.

844
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,055
-They lost him?
-They checked the CCTV footage,

845
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,558
and he got on Mr. Jang's car to escape.

846
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,605
-Get him on the wanted list and find him.
-Yes, sir.

847
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,417
Have you ever visited Mr. Cha?

848
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,254
His limbs are paralyzed
because of brain damage.

849
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,840
He used up all of his money
on the hospital bill and the lawsuit.

850
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,716
Are you trying to make me feel bad for him

851
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,009
and bear witness?

852
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,886
Don't be delusional.

853
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,514
If men like you had had any conscience,

854
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,558
this wouldn't have happened.

855
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,725
I'm letting you know

856
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,354
that you will end up
like Mr. Cha very soon.

857
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,814
That won't happen.

858
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,817
Do you think the Minister of Justice
will help you?

859
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,445
He's the one who approved
of the arrest warrant for you.

860
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,993
Did you plan this with Bugang in advance

861
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,161
to make Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office

862
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,831
delay their investigation?

863
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,332
That did not happen.

864
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,294
I'm aware of the seriousness
of the Bugang case, so I ordered

865
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,170
the Western Prosecutors' Office

866
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,673
to investigate Bugang's financial team
and related persons.

867
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,300
If Bugang and I have any connections,

868
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,052
I will resign from my office.
Stop asking that question now.

869
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,389
"Stop asking"? I continue to ask you

870
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,057
because of your half-hearted answers.

871
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,934
What should I do now?

872
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,519
You should stay in hiding for a while.

873
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,856
Hotel Chantier, Room 1813.

874
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:18,069
-Until when?
-That depends on what you can tell me.

875
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,913
All the documents that could be
used as evidence were destroyed.

876
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,457
I heard Mr. Park, Mr. Choe,

877
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,627
and the CEO of Bugang
have a meeting periodically.

878
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,670
They used to meet in Gwacheon,

879
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,422
but after what happened to Dong-ho,

880
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,175
I heard they meet at a restaurant
in Samcheong-dong.

881
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,676
Where is that?

882
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,636
No idea.

883
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,429
They travel by taxi, and they

884
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,973
use the corporate credit cards
of Bugang's subsidiaries,

885
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,433
so there is no way I can find out.

886
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,268
When do they have that meeting?

887
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,103
Once a month,

888
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,773
on the last Friday.

889
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,235
Who's that?

890
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,279
Someone who will protect you.

891
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,161
This is a huge surprise present.

892
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,996
He's on the wanted list.

893
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,415
That's why I said it's a surprise.

894
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,920
He's more like a bomb, not a present.

895
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,130
Let's keep our eyes on him

896
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,840
and see if he'll be a bomb or a firework.

897
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,925
Please take care of him.

898
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,101
-Yes, sir.
-Check Mr. Park's schedule

899
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,520
for last Friday of each month.

900
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,021
Get me a list of restaurants

901
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,690
-near Samcheong-dong.
-Yes, sir.

902
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,109
Mr. Han, Ms. No. I need your help.

903
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,402
-Sure.
-Okay.

904
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,778
Is this Cheongwon Prison?

905
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,030
I'm Secretary Yun Hye-won
from Assemblyman Song's office.

906
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,491
I called to check the schedule
of the Minister of Justice.

907
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,618
On March 29th, 2019,

908
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,495
it says he stopped by to visit.

909
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,413
Is this true?

910
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,289
Thank you.

911
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,423
Mr. Park canceled everything
that was scheduled on Friday afternoons.

912
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,758
The Ministry of Justice refused to say
where he went

913
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,844
on Friday afternoons
because that's his private life.

914
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,013
-Ms. No.
-Yes?

915
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,058
I listed up the restaurants
that high-ranking officials usually go to.

916
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,811
There are 32 restaurants
with private rooms.

917
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,108
I think we can narrow it down.

918
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,819
I organized the receipts
of his corporate card on last Fridays.

919
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,362
I found receipts for taxi rides.

920
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,532
The time he got on and off
and the distance are all similar.

921
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,869
It was last used the next day
after the audit ended.

922
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:34,372
Mr. Park's office is 26km away
from Samcheong-dong.

923
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,791
Check the distances between his office

924
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,334
-and those restaurants.
-Yes, sir.

925
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,087
-And Mr. Han...
-Should I call the taxi companies

926
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,214
and find out where Mr. Park got off?

927
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,302
-That's a good idea. Do that.
-Yes, I will.

928
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,221
Can we get all this done before midnight?

929
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,348
We have to try.
Call me if you find anything.

930
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,059
-Yes, sir.
-See you.

931
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,771
Why midnight?

932
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,940
According to the National Assembly Law,
the audit must end before midnight.

933
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,442
If it must continue after midnight,

934
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,152
the assemblymen must come to an agreement.

935
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,945
If they don't, the audit will be over.

936
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,988
Over?

937
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,325
It'll be the end of this year's audit
for the Ministry of Justice.

938
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,586
Is this Wooseong Taxi?

939
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,088
-He doesn't pick up, does he?
-No.

940
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,005
Darn it.

941
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,590
Thanks.

942
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,259
-What are you doing here?
-I was just...

943
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,220
Where's Tae-jun? Come here.

944
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,097
-Sir, please...
-Come here. Attention!

945
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,475
-Darn you.
-Sir, let's go.

946
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,018
-I'm sorry!
-Call Tae-jun.

947
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,853
Darn it.

948
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,984
Mr. Jang, where are you?

949
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,237
-Mr. Song is looking for you.
-I'll be there shortly.

950
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,154
Call me if they agree

951
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,281
-to continue the audit after midnight.
-Mr. Jang!

952
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,326
-Yes?
-Mr. Jang, we found the restaurant.

953
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,620
It's 47-1 Samcheong-dong.

954
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,413
DETECTIVE LEE

955
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,548
The audit will resume now.

956
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,092
Everyone, please be seated.

957
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,886
-Where's Tae-jun?
-He'll be here soon.

958
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,055
That punk said that he'd find something.

959
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,183
Where in the world is he?
Tell him to come quickly!

960
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,394
Yes, sir.

961
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:20,854
Goodness.

962
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,690
Everyone, please come inside.

963
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,279
Hello.

964
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,991
I don't think Tae-jun found anything.

965
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,910
-Really?
-I mean, he hasn't shown up.

966
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,205
You remember what I asked you
this afternoon, right?

967
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,584
If the audit ends smoothly,
I'll take good care of it.

968
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,968
Mr. Jang.

969
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,428
-Hey.
-Hello.

970
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,890
Excuse me.

971
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,935
Do you have a reservation?

972
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,063
Hello.

973
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,441
I'm a detective.

974
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,860
-Can you cooperate with...
-This is our business hour.

975
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,029
I know, but it'll only take a second.

976
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,366
We received a tip-off,
so I just need to ask a few questions.

977
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,369
RESERVATIONS

978
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,460
NAME: BUGANG, CENTRAL, JUSTICE

979
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,588
NAME: BUGANG, CENTRAL, JUSTICE

980
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,330
They're discussing whether
to continue the audit past midnight.

981
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,842
Yes, get me Mr. Song.

982
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:16,761
It's an emergency.

983
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,181
Darn it.

984
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,351
Assemblyman Song,
won't you ask any questions?

985
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,436
Mr. Park apologized to you already.

986
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,188
That wasn't a proper apology.

987
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,233
He just said a few excuses
that didn't even make sense.

988
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,026
How can I ask him any questions?

989
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,112
Mr. Song.

990
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,533
-Where are you?
-Mr. Song,

991
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,952
you should end the audit
for the Ministry of Justice now.

992
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,998
Okay. Hang up, you jerk.

993
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,753
Assemblyman Song,
do you have any questions?

994
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,882
Assemblyman Song, any questions?

995
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,848
I have none.

996
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,434
All the assemblymen
have asked their questions.

997
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,853
Is there anyone
who wants to ask additional questions?

998
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,480
If you do not have any objections,

999
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,857
we will not continue the audit.

1000
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,194
That will be the end of the 2019 audit
for the Ministry of Justice.

1001
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,572
I announce the end of the audit.

1002
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,684
Look how happy he is.

1003
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,062
He looks like a victorious general.

1004
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,022
The fight isn't over yet.

1005
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,857
He can't be a victorious general.

1006
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,151
You returned empty-handed.
Stop spewing nonsense.

1007
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,882
Mr. Song, you should end the audit
for the Ministry of Justice now.

1008
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,095
The audit for the Ministry of Justice
has just ended.

1009
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,264
But Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office
found the evidence of a false witness

1010
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,643
among Minister Park Jong-gil statements,
and they plan on taking legal actions.

1011
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,854
Minister Park denied the charge
that he periodically met the CEO of Bugang

1012
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,190
and the chief prosecutor
to delay the investigation.

1013
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,485
However, he had regular meetings
with them every month.

1014
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,987
And it's been confirmed that
some young women accompanied them.

1015
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,448
-Please move aside.
-Did you lie?

1016
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,743
-Did you just bear false witness?
-Tell us something!

1017
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,120
You're right.

1018
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:51,666
We'll charge the Minister of Justice
for perjury tomorrow morning.

1019
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,418
I will send you the press release soon.

1020
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,419
Breaking news.

1021
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,130
Minister Park is being accused
of delaying the investigation

1022
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,257
regarding the unfair dismissal
of Bugang employees

1023
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,926
after meeting the CEO of Bugang
and the chief prosecutor.

1024
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,596
This is why you told me
to finish the audit.

1025
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,183
Bearing false witness during an audit

1026
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,311
will get him at least a year,
up to ten years in prison.

1027
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,605
When a general loses in a fight,

1028
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,357
he must give up his life.

1029
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,360
Shouldn't we twist his neck even more

1030
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,070
so that he can't fight back?

1031
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,698
Ms. Kang is working on it already.

1032
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,707
Minister Park will face at least a year...

1033
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,588
I already told you everything that I know.

1034
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,923
You might remember more.

1035
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,219
Then

1036
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,555
shall we start again?

1037
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,030
PROUD FLESH OINTMENT

1038
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,410
You can use this.

1039
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,083
Thank you.

1040
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,461
Ms. Yun, wait for me.

1041
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:33,059
This stop is Dangsan.

1042
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,686
The doors are on your left.

1043
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,693
The doors are opening.

1044
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,195
Great work today.

1045
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,530
See you tomorrow.

1046
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,864
Great work.

1047
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,199
See you tomorrow.

1048
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,207
-The doors are closing.
-Ms. Yun!

1049
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,417
-Yes, of course.
-Great work.

1050
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,337
Mr. Lee, thanks for waiting.

1051
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,713
Thank you.

1052
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,632
Tae-jun, let's eat lunch tomorrow.

1053
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,093
-Yes, sir.
-Good. Let's go.

1054
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,594
Goodness.

1055
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,933
Where's Mr. Oh?

1056
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,727
He went back to the district office
after saying goodbye to Mr. Song.

1057
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,023
Yes, Mr. Oh?

1058
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,317
The passcode for our office?

1059
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,652
It's 57983.

1060
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:25,653
Sure.

1061
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,030
-Was that Mr. Oh?
-Yes.

1062
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,907
He said he left something in the office.

1063
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,659
Are there any sticky notes lying around?

1064
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,997
You should take a taxi.

1065
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,223
ROOM 803, SHIN J GYEONG

1066
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,571
I checked the contents,

1067
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,115
and those were the files
that Mr. Jo's office had kept.

1068
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,994
What about Mr. Jo's materials on me?

1069
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,412
They have been destroyed.

1070
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,331
I told him to plow the field,

1071
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:03,626
but that ox has been
planning something else.

1072
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,337
Did that idiot forget who his owner is?

1073
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,841
Who's your owner, idiot?

1074
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,094
It's me. I'm your owner.

1075
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,887
I'm your owner, you son of a bitch!

1076
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,973
There's this stupid ox
who won't listen to its owner.

1077
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,641
You even steal now?

1078
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,477
If you had such an important thing,
you should have kept it well.

1079
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,354
You should go down to the district office.

1080
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,689
Mr. Song wanted me to tell you

1081
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,899
that you can come back
once you deal with Seobuk Market.

1082
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,943
We need to end this well.

1083
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,695
Where is Kang Seon-yeong?

1084
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,072
You were plotting against me
in a place like this?

1085
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,199
So, you've been digging a pit for me?

1086
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,411
Mr. Oh told us where you were, you fool.

1087
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,371
I suppose Mr. Song got us under his thumb.

1088
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,915
Kim In-gyu is my final card.
