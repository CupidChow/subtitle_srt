1
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,398
The hearing is over.

2
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,150
I'm on my way to the office.

3
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,527
Check Mr. Jo's schedule.

4
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,199
Yes, sir. By the way, the information
about Assemblyman Lee's campaign fund

5
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,577
probably leaked out from the prosecution.
An internal investigation is going on.

6
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,079
Who is in charge of the case?

7
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,872
Mr. Jang.

8
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,963
Chief Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol
of Special Investigation Team.

9
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,758
You really impressed me at the hearing.

10
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,551
I'm Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol.

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,516
Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol
is well known to be a prosecutor

12
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,437
who focuses on investigation without
getting swayed by political pressure.

13
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,773
With the personnel changes,

14
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,360
we will make sure to faithfully
reform the prosecution

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,111
and eradicate

16
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,072
corruption of high-ranking officials...

17
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,990
There's no way back.

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,617
We will align the organization...

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,452
I forsook the way back

20
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,831
because I have a way to go on.

21
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,332
Mr. Jang.

22
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,045
I know people like you

23
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,464
very well.

24
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,176
I know how you climbed all the way up here
from the bottom.

25
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,474
You dress yourself in fancy clothes,
but the stink of the gutter remains.

26
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,653
Politics? I'm not interested in it at all.

27
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,115
My job is to put trash in its place.

28
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,925
See you around.

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,435
I must never stop.

30
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,772
Even if muddy darkness drags me down.

31
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,531
The second I stop,

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,784
I will sink into a deep swamp.

33
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:31,085
EPISODE 3 SWAMP

34
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,006
Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol is known
to be specialized in corruption cases.

35
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,258
He worked
in the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,594
and served as the chief
of Special Investigation Team.

37
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,765
He has an excellent investigatory power
and tremendous drive.

38
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,517
He's also known
to be meticulous and tenacious.

39
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,271
Mungwang Group, Guhong Group, and
Hose Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering.

40
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,398
He's been in charge
of those conglomerate cases.

41
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,777
He holds fast to his principle and never
gets swayed by political pressure,

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,362
so he has a good reputation.

43
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,949
The predominant view is that
Minister Song chose someone

44
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,452
whom the politicians and even
the prosecution can't object to.

45
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,954
The deputy chief prosecutors

46
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,414
of Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
are his seniors.

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,001
Some prosecutors would
submit their resignation.

48
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,338
Some would say a generational change
has been accomplished soon.

49
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,801
And the approval rating
for Minister Song would rise.

50
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,636
That's what they are going for.

51
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,180
He can't appoint one from his people
or the opponents,

52
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,267
so he's decided to start afresh.

53
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,644
PERSONNEL CARD

54
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,817
I had no idea
that a rat had been eating up

55
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,318
all the food in the barn.

56
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,447
If it weren't for you,
we would've been in big trouble.

57
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,907
They say

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,994
a man should hold his tongue

59
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,787
-and act succinctly.
-I agree.

60
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,874
Prosecutor Choe will take care of Tae-jun.

61
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,587
I failed to fathom
your intentions earlier.

62
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,881
I'm sorry about
what happened the other day.

63
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,510
It's all water under the bridge.

64
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,306
We're in the same boat already.
We should work together now.

65
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,852
Please let me meet
with Prosecutor Choe sometime.

66
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,855
I'll make sure to serve you right.

67
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,440
Okay.

68
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,570
Well, about Kang Seon-yeong...

69
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,779
Minister Song.

70
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,283
I do have a sense of shame.

71
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,370
I've already taken care of it.

72
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,541
You have?

73
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,918
Now she won't be

74
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,379
running her mouth anymore.

75
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,675
I scared her a little.

76
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,347
Please eat.

77
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,686
Please show us
the entrance of Building 106.

78
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,191
ENTRANCE OF BUILDING 106

79
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,860
Zoom in on the elevator number three.

80
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,614
ELEVATOR 3 OF BUILDING 106

81
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,259
The suspect covered his face
and had some tools.

82
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,512
It seems to be a premeditated crime.

83
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,139
He was wearing gloves,
so we can't take his fingerprints.

84
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,851
We will check the CCTV footage
and dash cams in the vicinity

85
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,603
and call you back once we find any clues.

86
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,897
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

87
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,774
Let's go if you're done.

88
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,704
Assemblywoman Kang.

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,124
I'm sorry

90
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,583
you had to come.

91
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,918
It's okay.

92
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,338
Are you all right? Aren't you hurt?

93
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,923
I'm fine.

94
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,595
Was Mr. Lee Chang-jin here?

95
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,182
I guess he's trying to warn me.

96
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,726
I must be a thorn in his side.

97
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,563
Ms. Kang.

98
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,399
Be careful.

99
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,736
It's not a good idea to be out so late
without even a personal secretary.

100
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,157
It's a dangerous world.

101
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,332
Just leave it there. I'll clean this up.

102
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,210
Assemblywoman Kang.

103
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,133
I called him.

104
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,594
You should take her to a hotel.

105
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,053
Okay.

106
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,182
You should stay at a hotel
for the time being.

107
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,767
I'll stay here.

108
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,727
Ms. Kang.

109
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,730
If I stay at a hotel,

110
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,939
Mr. Lee

111
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,400
would think I'm intimidated.

112
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,862
Mr. Han.

113
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:09,947
Will you help me?

114
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes, ma'am.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

116
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,315
Hello, sir.

117
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,822
Look into Jang Tae-jun's connections
with the police.

118
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,159
Detective Lee Hyeong-bae
is still waiting to be assigned.

119
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,786
Not the detective.

120
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,623
He even got involved
in the reinvestigation of Lee Chang-jin.

121
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,708
It must be someone in a higher position.

122
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,128
I have to find out who it is.

123
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,422
Yes, sir.

124
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,594
-Where did he go?
-What? He's not in there?

125
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,014
-Please wait inside.
-Okay.

126
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,977
Hey, Lee Gwi-dong.

127
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,272
How would I get such money
all of a sudden?

128
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,107
Of course I want to take care of it.

129
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,527
I'm still working on it.
Just tell them to wait.

130
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,197
Gosh, I can take care of it.

131
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,701
What are you doing there?
Minister Song is here.

132
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,160
Just hang on. I'll call you back.

133
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,957
What were you doing?

134
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,793
-Are you deaf or what?
-I'm sorry, sir.

135
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,504
I kept calling for you. Gosh.

136
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,881
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

137
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,177
Gosh, he's unbelievable.

138
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,471
I'm sorry, sir.

139
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,908
What about the confiscation warrant
for Lee Chang-jin?

140
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,953
I don't think
we can get it issued for now.

141
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,831
The prosecutors are saying
they don't have enough evidence.

142
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,585
They want the evidence
that Lee Chang-jin was involved.

143
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,756
Don't contact me for the time being.

144
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,383
Minister Song will try
to look into my connections

145
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,885
with the police.

146
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,472
You don't have to worry about me.

147
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,973
I'm good at hiding.

148
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
Just hang in there.

149
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,313
I've come all the way here
counting on you.

150
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,191
You can't back off like that.
That doesn't sound like Jang Tae-jun.

00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,719
is to take over his official duties

-Thank you.
-Prosecutor Choe will

158
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,098
-Nice to meet you.
-have a brief meeting

159

with other prosecutors and employees

without an inauguration ceremony.

161
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,359
-Please tell us how you are feeling.
-I believe the true role of prosecutors

162
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,444
is a proper investigation.

I'll try to restore public trust

164
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,198
by focusing on the investigation.

165
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,284
I know there will be plenty of challenges.

166
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,995
I will appreciate your help.

167
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,789
Is there an investigation
you're planning on?

168
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,876
Doubts has been expressed about
corruption of high-ranking officials.

169
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,170
Since public disappointment is
rising regarding the issue,

170
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,589
we will soon launch an investigation.

171
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,259
Prosecutor Choe vowed to restore
public trust in the prosecution

172
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,679
by focusing on the investigation.

173
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,015
-Yes. Come in.
-He also announced

174
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,975
that he will focus on the investigation

175
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,478
of the corruption
of high-ranking officials.

176
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,314
This is the data for Chief Choe's
internal investigation of Tae-jun.

177
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,400
My goodness.

178
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,694
He's being unbelievably meticulous.

179
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,739
The only problem with him
is that he's too slow.

180
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,535
Are you sure you handed
all the data over to him?

181
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,704
Yes. I gave him all the data we have.

182
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,373
Then why is he taking so long?

183
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,752
I heard Prosecutor Choe is very cautious.

184
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,546
He never requests a warrant
without clear evidence.

185
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,383
I already set a table for him.
Does he want me to feed him now?

186
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,927
That fool.

187
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,386
Tell him

188
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,222
I want to meet with him.

189
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,475
I should treat him well
so he can do things right.

190
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,644
Yes, sir.

191
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,940
But Jang Tae-jun
is an incumbent assemblyman.

192
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,818
If we investigate him without evidence,
we might face public criticism.

193
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,446
And Tae-jun has his history
with Lee Chang-jin.

194
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,534
If something goes wrong,
you might be affected.

195
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,747
What's going on

196
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,500
with the redevelopment issue
in Jang Tae-jun's district now?

197
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,752
Apparently, it's still pending.

198
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,462
Everything's ready.

199
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,632
Why is it still pending?
They say time is money.

200
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,474
Hello, Mr. Lee Chang-jin.

201
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,602
Yes, it's me.

202
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,118
I heard

203
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,413
Prosecutor Choe is reinvestigating
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min's case.

204
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,455
Are you okay with that?

205
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
I'm fine.

206
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,834
What about you?

207
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,043
Don't worry about me.

208
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,755
My answer never changes no matter
how many times they question me.

209
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,758
You'll soon be reinstated.

210
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,510
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,722
You don't have to apologize to me.

212
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,433
Here.

213
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,898
There were three CCTVs from the place
where Go Seok-man last met with you

214
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,608
to the place he died.

215
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,613
But the CCTV footage
for about an hour has been deleted.

216
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,656
What I gave you is all we have left.

217
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,953
Find the cars in the footage
and check their dashcams.

218
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,580
There must be something.

219
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,833
I don't think Seok-man drove
to the place he died.

220
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,001
Okay.

221
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,171
It's hard to identify the plate numbers,
so it will take a while.

222
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

223
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,010
I owe you a lot.

224
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,891
And it seems like someone
is digging into your affairs.

225
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,643
Is it from the prosecution?

226
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,520
No. I don't think
it's a prosecutor or a cop.

227
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,230
I didn't find out who it is,

228
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,150
but he asked around about your past
at the police station.

229
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,528
They're putting a tail on me.

230
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,448
Okay. You should be careful.

231
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,200
Okay.

232
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,341
HE WILL FOCUS ON INVESTIGATION
TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST

233
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,346
PERSONNEL CARD

234
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,854
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN
OF THE DAEHAN PARTY AT THE HEARING

235
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,815
HE DID NOT ADMIT HIS FAULT

236
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,275
Darn it.

237
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,213
I was told the witnesses
would be questioned again.

238
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,175
Thank you. I'll call you back.

239
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,892
First floor.

240
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,028
You look tired.

241
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,158
I am tired. I couldn't sleep
because of someone.

242
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,289
Are you sure Assemblyman Jang
can catch Minister Song?

243
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,125
What do you mean?

244
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,129
Assemblywoman Kang is helping you
because of what he said.

245
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,381
Then he should do things right.

246
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,093
If he wants to catch him,
he should do it right.

247
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,513
If he messes things up,
we are the ones who will be suffering.

248
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,018
What are you talking about?

249
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,978
Assemblywoman Kang doesn't know

250
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,314
that I don't believe in Assemblyman Jang.

251
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,734
I guess he's just using her.

252
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,696
We're working together,
but he seems to be hiding something.

253
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,531
Assemblyman Jang

254
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,575
is taking a lot of risks

255
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,243
to stand against Minister Song.

256
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,580
Please don't misunderstand his sincerity.

257
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,583
Is he?

258
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,086
But why does it feel like
something's wrong?

259
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,256
Tell Assemblyman Jang
to get things done the right way.

260
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,550
Before I misunderstand him even more.

261
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,226
-You're here.
-What about Assemblywoman Kang?

262
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,394
She's in her office.

263
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,647
Gosh, she's so stubborn.

264
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,111
-Hello.
-Did something happen yesterday?

265
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,326
PERSONNEL CARD

266
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,170
The bill will be announced within today.

267
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,924
You never give me a break.

268
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,260
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,930
We should prepare additional materials
and the written consent--

270
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,641
I already got the written consent
of assemblymen.

271
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,729
Schedule a press conference.

272
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,690
I will.

273
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,779
You're back.

274
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,157
-Is Assemblyman Jang in his office?
-Yes.

275
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,743
Yes?

276
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,620
Assemblyman Jang.

277
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:30,377
Prosecutor Choe is going to question
the staff of Assemblyman Lee's campaign.

278
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,843
The staff don't know anything
about the case.

279
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,553
He won't find out anything.

280
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm not sure about other staff,

281
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,932
but if the accounting officer
in charge of the campaign fund

282
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,436
gives false testimony against you,
things might change.

283
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,481
Was it Secretary Lee Mi-jeong?
You should call her first.

284
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,649
I can't reach her.

285
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,068
I lost touch with her
after the investigation

286
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,778
of Assemblyman Lee's case was resumed.

287
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,239
That's why she wasn't questioned
as a testifier back then.

288
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,576
We're looking for her,
but no one knows where she is.

289
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,036
Fortunately,

290
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,955
the prosecutors also
don't know her whereabouts.

291
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,499
I'll look into it.

292
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,465
You have a lot of work to do. Is it okay?

293
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,177
Yes. Please let me take care of this.

294
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,437
LEE MI-JEONG

295
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,525
Secretary Lee Mi-jeong's parents
are in Samcheok.

296
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,195
You should look into it.

297
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,157
Things will get easier
once we hire another chief of staff.

298
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,201
Hang in there until then.

299
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,579
Yes, sir.

300
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,750
Mr. Jang.

301
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,924
I heard Assemblywoman Kang is in trouble.

302
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,433
-Is it Mr. Lee Chang-jin?
-Yes.

303
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,937
I heard Mr. Lee Chang-jin
went to her place.

304
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,490
Mr. Jang, Mr. Ahn just called.

305
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,659
You should hurry to Seongjin now.

306
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,371
There was an accident
in Redevelopment District 4 of Seongjin.

307
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,342
-Tell Mr. Ahn I'm on my way to Seongjin.
-Yes, sir.

308
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,845
Call the development director
and find out what happened.

309
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,221
Okay.

310
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,811
A clash broke out

311
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,273
between residents and demolition workers
during the process of demolition.

312
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,734
There have been reports of injuries,

313
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,278
and some local residents were
rushed to a hospital

314
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,823
with severe wounds such as broken arms.

315
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,702
According to the officials,
this morning, the demolition workers...

316
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,204
Choe Gyeong-cheol and Lee Chang-jin.

317
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,249
Tae-jun must be troubled with all that.

318
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,545
What about Kang Seon-yeong?
She's running wild with the bill.

319
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,548
Don't worry about it. I already called
Assemblyman Ahn Hyeon-min's office.

320
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,635
Now you're finally worth your salt.

321
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,639
Good.

322
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,979
I'd do anything for you.

323
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,731
You can count on me.

324
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,026
I'll take Tae-jun's place
and lead you to the Blue House.

325
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,448
-Let's go.
-Please.

326
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,824
All right.

327
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,286
My goodness. What do we do?

328
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,372
Honey, wake up.

329
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,417
Honey! Please wake up.

330
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,960
Honey...

331
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,547
Honey...

332
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,351
WE OPPOSE REDEVELOPMENT

333
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,731
Why are you being like this? You promised.

334
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,567
-My goodness.
-How could you do this?

335
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,237
You can't use force like this.

336
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,863
I can't believe this.

337
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,699
This is ridiculous.

338
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,868
I can't believe what's happening.

339
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,579
-This isn't right.
-Are you all right?

340
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,500
-What happened?
-Look at my face.

341
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,127
My goodness.

342
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,420
Do they want us to die or what?

343
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,798
Gosh, what happened to you?

344
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,343
This isn't just fair.

345
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,720
What happened?

346
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,014
We have some time left before demolition.

347
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,142
They just barged in
and proceeded with demolition.

348
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,395
They just withdrew for now
due to the resistance of local residents.

349
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,856
-What about the development director?
-He's just arrived.

350
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,940
Sir.

351
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,526
Yes.

352
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,571
Stop the demolition work immediately.

353
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,574
We still have a month left
before the day we agreed on.

354
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,703
The thing is, all the administrative
procedure is finished.

355
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,330
We have no reason
to stop the demolition work.

356
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,125
A lot of residents are still
living in the neighborhood.

357
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,961
The house owners as well as tenants
get only little compensation

358
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,754
because the land area is too small.

359
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,134
You know they can't move back in
even if the redevelopment is complete.

360
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,886
I know. That's true,

361
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,014
but like I said, all the administrative
procedure is finished.

362
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,808
There's nothing the city can do about it.

363
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,310
Move over.

364
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,479
Assemblyman Jang,
why is all this happening?

365
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,566
You said you'd let us live here longer.

366
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,359
Assemblyman, my ass.

367
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,153
What is happening?

368
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,113
You paid lip service during the election.

369
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,032
But you're just bulldozing us out
after you won.

370
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,117
Is your election pledge a joke?

371
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,702
Were you just saying that for fun?

372
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,372
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
to stop the demolition work.

373
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,542
Do you actually expect me to believe that?

374
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,752
What are you doing?

375
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,713
-How could I believe you?
-Please stop it.

376
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,841
-Stop him.
-How dare you...

377
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:14,179
-Let go of him.
-Please stop.

378
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,226
WE OPPOSE REDEVELOPMENT

379
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,645
I appreciate your hard work, Mr. Jang.

380
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,522
I clearly told you the other day.

381
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,900
I asked you to postpone it
until the day we agreed on.

382
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,694
"Agreed"?

383
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,490
I don't think that's for you to say
after stabbing me in the back.

384
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,784
You're one scary man.

385
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,038
I had no idea
you'd change your mind like this.

386
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,790
Do you have to go this far?

387
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,209
What do you think?

388
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,920
This is just the beginning.

389
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,258
Will you stop pretending
to be so righteous?

390
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,552
You just got the badge with my money.

391
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,014
Just because you buy
an easy life with money,

392
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,433
do you think others would do the same?

393
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,938
If you do, you're
totally mistaken about me.

394
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,565
I'll show you who I am.

395
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,319
Everything from what happened today
to what you did last night...

396
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,032
I'll make you regret this. By all means.

397
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,210
Lee Chang-jin will start
the redevelopment of District Four.

398
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,254
Mr. Ahn can't cover
the whole city of Seongjin.

399
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,672
Send Mr. Jeong.

400
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,259
Get me the list of subcontractors
and suppliers for the redevelopment,

401
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,803
and the Ministry of Environment
materials. I'll be back soon.

402
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,221
Okay.

403
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,766
Mr. Jeong.

404
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,561
You should go to Seongjin
and help Mr. Ahn.

405
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,563
-There are complaints from the residents.
-Okay.

406
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,567
Da-jeong, get me the list of
subcontractors for the redevelopment.

407
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,236
-I'm going to the Ministry of Environment.
-Okay.

408
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,780
Hello. Hey.

409
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,453
Hello. Hi, guys.

410
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,831
Everyone's busy.

411
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,208
What brings you here?
Are you spying on us?

412
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,837
Gosh, what are you talking about?
We are colleagues.

413
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,050
I heard you are hiring a chief of staff.

414
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,177
I read the notice. Did you find one?

415
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,095
Not yet.

416
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,349
Really?

417
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,730
Are you here to ask that?

418
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:33,068
No. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

419
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,862
They have pork cutlets today.
Do you want to come?

420
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,280
I don't like pork cutlets.

421
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,116
Enjoy your lunch.

422
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,993
All right then.

423
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,456
I'm thirsty.
Do you have anything to drink?

424
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,167
Just give me anything.

425
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,962
Hang on.

426
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,482
Here.

427
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,560
Your face looks nice and bright.
You'll look good on the screen.

428
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,021
-What about the conference?
-Mr. Han is getting ready

429
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,523
at the press room.

430
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,528
Let's go.

431
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,703
Hello, Assemblywoman Kang.

432
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,831
Are you going to announce a bill?

433
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,919
I didn't know
you were interested in my bill.

434
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,504
I'm not the only one.

435
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,923
A lot of people are
interested in your bill.

436
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,511
I guess Minister Song and Mr. Lee
care a lot about this.

437
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,599
Tell them I appreciate their interest.

438
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,730
I heard you're back. You are looking fine.

439
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,732
Is your work going well?

440
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,779
You just gave birth.
You shouldn't work too hard yet.

441
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,239
I'm afraid something unfortunate

442
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,202
would happen to her after overworking.

443
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,166
Minister Song wants to tell you this.

444
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,835
If you rush into things blindly like that,

445
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,587
you might fall down and break your nose.

446
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,509
Good luck with the conference.

447
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,648
Oh, right. I heard you had a son.
Congratulations.

448
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,316
I'll see you around.

449
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,449
Watch your step.
You might break your nose.

450
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,412
Darn it.

451
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,168
Assemblywoman Kang.

452
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,715
Assemblyman Ahn Hyeon-min is having
a press conference at the press room now.

453
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,425
Here.

454
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,928
And the subject is...

455
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,158
I'm Assemblywoman Ahn of the Daehan Party.

456
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,579
The occupational health
and safety law I'm proposing today

457
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,748
is to improve the working conditions
of workers exposed to danger

458
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,084
and strengthen safety management
of business owners.

459
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,712
The bill requires
the government's management

460
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,506
and an increase of penalties.

461
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,757
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

462
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:29,178
It is a bill proposed by Assemblyman Lee
Seong-min before he sadly passed away.

463
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,308
Since it has Assemblyman Lee's
sincerity for the people,

464
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,061
-I hope a lot of people...
-It's the same as our bill.

465
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,272
will support the bill.

466
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,458
What brings you here?

467
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,128
-Is Assemblyman Jo in his office?
-No, he's not.

468
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,007
Where is he?

469
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,885
He went to Busan to attend
an environment seminar.

470
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,638
You didn't know that.

471
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,892
-Did Mr. Kim go with him?
-Sure.

472
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,813
-When is he coming back?
-He has some work to do there.

473
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,148
He will be back in two days.

474
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,361
ASSEMBLYMAN AHN HYEON-MIN

475
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,159
Did you not announce it
to the assemblymen?

476
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:36,037
I did. This is strange.

477
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,834
I guess he can't answer the phone
as he's inspecting the nuclear plant.

478
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,587
Tell him that

479
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,839
I want to meet with him
once he comes back.

480
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,925
Okay.

481
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,308
Look at her glaring like that.

482
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,939
Mr. Jang. I checked
the redevelopment schedule.

483
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,983
District Five will be
demolished within this month.

484
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,361
They are running it at the same time
so I can't stop them.

485
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,364
We need to review all the data
about the redevelopment.

486
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,366
We are collecting the data.
It will be ready soon.

487
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,579
Assemblyman Ahn of the Daehan Party
had a press conference

488
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,291
at the press room about his bill
for occupational health and safety.

489
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,879
It is to improve the working conditions
of workers exposed to danger

490
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,465
and strengthen safety management
of business owners.

491
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,301
The bill demands improvement
of working conditions.

492
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,014
-Since the bill is for workers...
-What is happening now?

493
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,100
Two same bills are proposed
at the same time.

494
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,020
So the standing committee will discuss it.

495
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,522
They will suggest scrapping
both of the bills

496
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,150
and changing it to an alternative bill
by the committee.

497
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,902
They'll delay the process,
saying that it must be discussed.

498
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,488
And meanwhile, the session
at the Assembly will be over.

499
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,700
-This is so frustrating.
-She startled me.

500
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,993
Damn it.

501
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,386
Where's Mr. Jo?

502
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:18,973
He's in Busan.

503
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,976
He's at an environment seminar.

504
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,104
If the bill

505
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,441
doesn't get passed during the session,

506
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,943
I must wait for the next session.

507
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,865
I might have to start from scratch.

508
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,117
It will be too late by then.

509
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,871
If we don't make it work now,
it will never happen.

510
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,126
I heard that Lee Chang-jin
paid you a visit.

511
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,170
Are you okay?

512
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,842
I can't be okay with it.

513
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,347
I will show Minister Song
that he messed with the wrong person.

514
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,892
Seeing how Lee Chang-jin took charge,

515
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,979
it proves that this matter
is just as crucial.

516
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,484
We must keep putting pressure
on the chemical leakage incident.

517
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,780
Do you plan on forming
a fact-finding committee for the incident?

518
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,199
In order to form the committee,

519
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,952
We need more definite proof
of chemical exposures.

520
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,496
Fine.

521
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,749
Let's try that.

522
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,467
Going up.

523
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,206
The doors are opening.

524
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,355
This is the material on the bill
from Mr. Ahn.

525
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,028
They copied everything
including the main phrases.

526
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,657
Damn it. Those bastards.

527
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,248
Did you get in touch with the victim
who worked at Joojin Chemical?

528
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,167
I can't get in touch with Park Hee-jin.

529
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,670
So I'm trying to obtain her family's
contact details through her colleagues.

530
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,589
We'll form a fact-finding committee.

531
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,841
We really need her testimony.

532
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,677
And meet with the victims
and former employees of Joojin Chemical

533
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,512
and ask for their cooperation again.

534
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,223
Okay.

535
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,434
-Ms. Lee.
-I will inform the civic group of this

536
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,269
and prepare to form the committee.

537
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,940
I'll be back.

538
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,903
Mr. Lee. Mr. Kim.
Please help Ms. Lee with her task.

539
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,488
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

540
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,118
All right. To the conference room.

541
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,662
-Okay.
-Okay.

542
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,292
-Bring me the document you gathered.
-Yes, sir.

543
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,757
I'm going after Joojin Chemical.

544
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,801
You'll form
a fact-finding committee, right?

545
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,843
Yes.

546
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,720
I got it from the Ministry of Environment.

547
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,643
The landfills for the redevelopment
are completely filled up.

548
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,479
Yes, the Ministry of Environment
gave out an administrative order

549
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,857
to acquire more lots two months ago
to continue the construction.

550
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,487
The redevelopment in Uigwang City
is currently underway.

551
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,865
Redeveloping District 4 and 5
in Seongjin City now makes no sense.

552
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,200
This is ludicrous.

553
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,495
SEONGJIN CITY REDEVELOPMENT PLAN

554
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,372
It means he is buying the lots illegally.

555
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,253
Look into every purchase of land
under Mr. Lee Chang-jin's name.

556
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,046
I'll look into it.

557
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,424
And it's about Ms. Lee Mi-jeong.

558
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,301
She sold her house in her hometown.

559
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,885
I think she moved to somewhere else.

560
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,014
-Keep checking.
-Yes.

561
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,025
Excuse me, sir. Hello.

562
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,320
By any chance, have you seen this lady?

563
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,822
I don't recognize her at all.

564
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,157
Is that so?

565
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,535
By any chance, have you seen this lady?

566
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,705
Go down straight and make a right turn.
You'll see a restaurant.

567
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,831
Okay.

568
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,209
SAMCHEOK

569
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,800
You don't recognize her, right?

570
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,680
You can go down that way.
Go straight down. That's the restaurant.

571
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,890
-It's that way.
-Really?

572
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,099
-Her?
-Yes.

573
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,481
JOOJIN CHEMICAL

574
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,362
Just because you buy
an easy life with money,

575
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,822
do you think others would do the same?

576
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,243
If you do, you're
totally mistaken about me.

577
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,913
I'll show you who I am.

578
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,625
Everything from what happened today
to what you did last night...

579
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,129
I'll make you regret this. By all means.

580
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,595
Look into the money Jang Tae-jun got.
Check where he spent the money on.

581
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,763
Yes, sir.

582
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,807
And Ms. Kang Seon-yeong is trying to

583
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,059
get in touch with the victims of
the chemical leakage.

584
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,772
I guess she didn't take
my warning seriously.

585
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,441
Pay them to be silent.

586
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,277
Shove some money down their throats
so they won't speak a word.

587
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,071
Yes, sir.

588
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,298
I'm Choe Gyeong-cheol.

589
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,387
All right. Welcome.

590
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,597
Let's take a seat.

591
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,144
You can talk to me casually, sir.

592
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,229
-Shall I?
-Yes.

593
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,525
I never had a chance to pour you

594
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,235
a celebratory drink
after your appointment.

595
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,154
So I called you when I know you're busy.

596
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,322
Okay. Have a drink.

597
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,909
I am sorry, but I have some work left.

598
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,911
My apologies.

599
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,206
-Okay.
-Please allow me to pour you a drink.

600
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,625
What? Okay. Sure.

601
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,839
You must have a lot of work.

602
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,507
Right.

603
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,760
You must be busy with your investigation
on the first day of your appointment.

604
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,679
Yes.

605
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,853
So...

606
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,648
You're doing an internal investigation
into Mr. Jang?

607
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,526
How is that going?

608
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,070
I'm following the protocol
to lead my investigation.

609
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,617
Well, about the case...

610
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,121
You should wrap up the case,
have a press conference,

611
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,915
and get a warrant issued.

612
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,376
He's fit to be your first prey
to celebrate your appointment, isn't he?

613
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,962
The Ministry of Justice has your back.
Don't hesitate.

614
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,964
Thank you, sir.

615
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,302
I will do so once the suspicions
are confirmed and I have evidence.

616
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,355
I'm sure you must have gotten
the materials for the case.

617
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,400
Did you send me the materials

618
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,402
regarding Jang Tae-jun's case?

619
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,363
I thought
it might help your investigation.

620
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,407
With that, you could easily get
him indicted and take care of him.

621
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,579
I am truly grateful for appointing me
for the seat of the chief prosecutor.

622
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,581
However,

623
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,292
I will lead this investigation.

624
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,964
I know that. Who else will lead it then?

625
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,633
Goodness.

626
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,469
I apologize for my tardiness.

627
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,597
It's nice to meet you.

628
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,891
My name is Lee Chang-jin.
I'm the CEO of Joojin Chemical.

629
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,231
I don't believe I belong here.

630
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,358
Please excuse me.

631
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,238
I will request a warrant
after I have enough evidence

632
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,323
to indict him based on the protocol.

633
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,253
We ended up getting a tiger involved
to catch the viper.

634
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,016
Have you secured Ms. Lee Mi-jeong?

635
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,687
Okay.

636
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,918
Thank you.

637
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,796
Ms. Lee Mi-jeong.

638
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,730
INJECTION ROOM,
NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT CENTER

639
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,066
Excuse me. Which way is to Room 907?

640
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,275
It's that way.

641
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:14,818
Thank you.

642
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,435
Hello.

643
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,536
Yes.

644
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,123
The Legal Team of Joojin Chemical
beat us to it.

645
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,041
He asked me to delete all the footage

646
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,210
of his testimony.

647
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,629
I also talked to another victim
on the phone.

648
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,298
It seems they already made a deal
with the Legal Team.

649
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,425
Okay.

650
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,676
Okay.

651
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,600
Ms. Kang.

652
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,186
Joojin Chemical's Legal Team
is on the move.

653
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,481
They are making deals with the victims.

654
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,405
What should we do?

655
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,826
These are the lots
Joojin Chemical recently purchased.

656
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,413
They've been buying land, forest,
and fields in the town near their factory.

657
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,416
I think they might be burying waste
illegally in those places.

658
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,751
We'll know once we check.

659
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,255
Sir, you have a visitor.

660
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,259
He has information on Ms. Lee Mi-jeong.

661
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,866
So you know where Ms. Lee Mi-jeong is?

662
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,576
Yes.

663
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,870
Where is she now?

664
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,123
I just dropped her off
at the prosecutor's office.

665
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,043
Please don't worry.

666
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,047
She won't be able to say anything
about you to the prosecutor.

667
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,965
I made sure she stayed silent.

668
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,388
During Mr. Lee Seong-min's campaign,

669
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,934
did Mr. Jang Tae-jun accept
an illegal fund?

670
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,144
Will you keep saying you know nothing?

671
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,021
Ms. Lee.

672
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,690
Ms. Lee.

673
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:04,655
Ms. Lee was pocketing the fund
during the campaign.

674
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,698
She owed a lot of gambling debt.

675
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,951
And she went off the grid
after Mr. Lee's incident

676
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,452
because of that.

677
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,332
The related documents from the campaign

678
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,502
and Ms. Lee's receipts
for the gambling debt are all in here.

679
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,505
I thought you would appreciate these,

680
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,342
so I went to great lengths
and got them for you.

681
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,304
LEE MI-JEONG

682
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,729
APRIL, 2015
SURVEY, MEETING, CONFERENCE

683
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,989
What is it that you want?

684
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,994
I want to work with you.

685
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,248
I heard that there is a vacant seat
on your staff.

686
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,258
RESUME

687
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,926
My name is Yang Jong-yeol.

688
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,479
RESUME: YANG JONG-YEOL

689
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,274
WORK EXPERIENCE

690
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,120
Nice to meet you.

691
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,669
-I hope we can get along.
-Okay.

692
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,674
Da-jeong, who is he?

693
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,468
I don't know.

694
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,101
Let him handle the district matters
with Mr. Ahn for now.

695
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,436
Won't that be risky?

696
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,688
You should hire him
after looking into him.

697
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,233
We must keep him closer
as he may pose as a threat.

698
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,694
Keep an eye on him.

699
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,252
When should I start working?

700
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,686
LEE CHANG-JIN

701
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,482
Did you look into what I asked you?

702
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:50,320
I looked into it, but I could not confirm
that he used it for his campaign.

703
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,495
Then, where did that money go?

704
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,832
After we demolished the market,
the merchants moved to a temporary market.

705
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,292
-What about it?
-They couldn't run the temporary market

706
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,545
as they didn't get
enough monetary compensation.

707
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,923
Uigwang City was trying to raise the fund
for the merchants.

708
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,967
-And?
-There was

709
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,136
an anonymous donor.

710
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,762
As it so happens,

711
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,765
the amount of donation matches
the amount you gave to Jang Tae-jun.

712
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,768
And the temporary market
is still being operated with the donation.

713
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,411
TEMPORARY SEOBUK MARKET

714
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,835
Bye. Come again next time.

715
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,506
-Hey, it's the rice cake shop!
-Come over here.

716
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,175
-Have some of this.
-Try this.

717
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,719
Don't skip your meals when you work.

718
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,053
Goodness.

719
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,723
-Gosh.
-You should eat.

720
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,516
-It's okay.
-You must be hungry.

721
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,604
I heard that you were
a very competent chief of staff.

722
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,189
Please help me

723
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,608
run a stall at the market

724
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,568
with my grandson again.

725
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,446
Please. I ask for your help, sir.

726
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,740
Please help us.

727
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,200
Please.

728
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,826
Please.

729
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,204
You bastard,

730
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,956
you gathered all of us here!
What kind of ruse is this?

731
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,919
Do you even know
what we've been through to get this far?

732
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,963
Let go!

733
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,298
Let's hurry to the market!

734
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,841
You said you were on our side.

735
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,011
How could you do this?

736
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,348
I wish we could keep running
the market here.

737
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,850
Right. Who knew
that we would get a lucky break?

738
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,978
You didn't see this coming,
so you were screaming at him.

739
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,730
"You can't do this!"

740
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,149
Anyway, I guess Jang Tae-jun
is really competent.

741
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,984
-Right. Did you just figure that out?
-Yes!

742
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,997
Do you know why these people
live in such cramped conditions?

743
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,210
Because they feel anxious
unless they live as a group.

744
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,671
They needed to learn how to survive

745
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,549
and live through harsh times together.

746
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,759
Because they don't know
when they will get kicked out.

747
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,262
Do you have to

748
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,849
split them up and make the lights

749
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,309
in the market go out?

750
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,898
The lights in the market are going out.

751
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,526
It's very hard
to light them up again one by one.

752
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,946
We need to make this into a place
where the lights will never go out.

753
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,368
-It's only 1,000 won.
-Just take this.

754
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,288
It's 2,500 won. It's a steal!

755
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,665
That's a cheap price! It's 2,500 won.

756
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,709
My goodness. You should take it.

757
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,638
This is Jang Tae-jun speaking.

758
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:12,814
Damn it. Things are getting complicated.

759
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,735
Sir, have you heard?

760
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,447
-What?
-That bastard, Jang Tae-jun,

761
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,075
took the money from me
and used all of it for Seobuk Market.

762
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,672
Sir, this isn't the time
to laugh about this.

763
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,092
I thought he threw everything away,
but I guess he didn't.

764
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,219
Pardon?

765
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,348
Tae-jun.

766
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,810
If you want to climb up to the top,
you must throw away everything.

767
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,854
How could you go up with such
a heavy heart?

768
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,816
If you want this, throw away everything.

769
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,076
If you have a heavy heart,
you won't be as sharp.

770
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:12,499
I expected him to be better than this,
but I guess this is it for him.

771
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,882
This actually all worked out.
If you were somehow connected to it,

772
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,510
it would have been harder
to put pressure on the investigation.

773
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,512
That stupid fool.

774
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,682
He might just end up following
Lee Seong-min all the way to death.

775
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,558
Then,

776
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,686
will you just leave him be?

777
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,479
Of course not.

778
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,651
The viper shed his skin
and became a monster serpent.

779
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,572
Bring me

780
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,825
Tae-jun's skin.

781
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,123
Okay. I'm on it.

782
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,931
Oh, my. Look at the time. I apologize
for asking to meet at such a late hour.

783
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,976
Please get to the point.

784
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,980
You know Ms. Lee Mi-jeong, don't you?

785
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,066
She was in charge of the campaign fund
for Mr. Lee Seong-Min.

786
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,986
You know the answer to that.

787
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,530
I interrogated her today
to get a statement.

788
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,033
I was hoping that I would find something.

789
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,493
It made me wonder
if she really has no idea about you

790
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,288
or someone made it
so that she doesn't know.

791
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,957
You're in charge of the investigation.
It's up to you to find out.

792
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,420
How much of this
do you think you can hide?

793
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,297
As long as I'm the chief prosecutor,

794
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,465
you won't be

795
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,384
able to survive in the National Assembly.

796
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,511
Are you going to kill me?

797
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,182
That's too bad

798
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,184
because I prefer to live.

799
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,936
I still have a lot of work to do.

800
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,773
It won't be easy.

801
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:02,776
As you have thoroughly investigated me,
I'm sure you know

802
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,613
how I'm going to survive this mess.

803
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,906
Are you

804
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,409
telling me that you will interfere
with my investigation?

805
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,119
Did it sound like that?

806
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,166
I'll be just focusing on my job.

807
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,137
Some of the civic organizations
decided to help us

808
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,555
after reading about a few victims.

809
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,016
However, we won't be able
to run the committee

810
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,227
unless the victims
don't take charge of this case.

811
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,937
It's the same for assemblymen and women.

812
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,440
They are interested in this case,
but they feel uncomfortable joining us.

813
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,653
FATHER

814
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,740
How many victims
haven't settled with Joojin Chemical?

815
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,618
There are three, but they quit
their jobs a long time ago.

816
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:56,746
It might be hard to prove
that they were affected by the leak.

817
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,173
Why don't we take a break?

818
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,926
-Okay.
-Okay.

819
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,310
FATHER

820
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,271
Is there something wrong?

821
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,857
No, it's nothing.

822
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,155
-Hey.
-Tell him to come over.

823
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,825
-My gosh. I'm glad you could make it.
-Gosh.

824
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,036
-Come here.
-Goodness.

825
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,830
-All right.
-Chun-bae.

826
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,457
When is the assemblyman coming?

827
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,750
I guess his meeting is running long.

828
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,878
He was supposed to come by ages ago.

829
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,254
Come on, people are waiting.

830
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,965
He's coming, man. Just wait a bit longer.

831
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,885
He was begging us to vote for him,
but now we hardly get to see him.

832
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,595
Even so, he's the pride of our town.

833
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,096
-Just wait.
-Hello.

834
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,348
-Hello.
-My gosh.

835
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,516
Who is he?

836
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,188
You work for Mr. Song, don't you?

837
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,773
Yes. When he heard
about the party in Mr. Jang's town,

838
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,109
the Minister sent this basket for you.

839
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,446
My gosh. Goodness.

840
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:16,367
Are you talking about Mr. Song Hui-seop?
The Minister of Justice?

841
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,370
-Yes.
-Let's give him a round of applause.

842
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,625
My gosh.

843
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:27,629
I will never forget that you came
all the way to this rural town for this.

844
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,381
Please don't mention it.
Of course, I ought to come.

845
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:34,844
The Minister wanted to come here himself,
but something had come up.

846
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:39,474
The Minister is taking
such good care of Mr. Jang.

847
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:43,102
Oh, my. Tae-jun is
indeed impressive, isn't he?

848
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,064
The Minister is taking care
of a first-term assemblyman!

849
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,900
The Minister sent this flower basket.

850
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,151
Could we shake hands?

851
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,905
Hey, put this basket
where everyone can see.

852
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,115
-It's from the Minister!
-Sure.

853
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,451
-This way.
-Please take a seat. Sit down.

854
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,619
My gosh.

855
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,828
Goodness.

856
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,706
-The air is fresh, isn't it?
-Thank you.

857
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,042
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

858
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,295
Please have some food.

859
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,173
Sir. I just need a moment
of your time. Just a moment.

860
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,474
-The guy from Mr. Song's office is here.
-Just come.

861
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,017
I just need to talk to you.

862
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,811
We can talk while having some food.

863
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,063
Sir. Please. I'm begging.

864
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,565
Think how desperate I must be to--

865
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,316
Are you trying to ruin his career?

866
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,070
Wait. Hold on. I've lived my life
and don't have any ambitions.

867
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,282
But I can't just let my son
waste his life away.

868
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,992
I don't expect a lot from him, anyway.

869
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,786
Please ask your son for a position.

870
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,415
Do you think an assemblyman's duty
is to look for jobs?

871
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,750
-I know you did other people favors.
-No. Unbelievable.

872
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,752
-It's a token of my gratitude.
-Stop it.

873
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,337
-It's all right. Take it.
-No.

874
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,548
-It's not much.
-What are you doing?

875
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,508
You can take it.

876
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,302
VILLAGE HALL

877
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,022
Yes, hello?

878
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,693
Yes. That's right.
Is this the father of Ms. Park Hee-jin?

879
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,946
Would it be possible to talk to her?

880
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,459
I was just on the phone
with Ms. Park Hee-jin's father.

881
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,252
Can she testify for us?

882
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,796
No, Ms. Park Hee-jin

883
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,342
passed away three months ago.

884
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,764
But her mother is very sick, too.

885
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,724
Her symptoms exactly match Ms. Park's.

886
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,728
Did her mother also work
at Joojin Chemical?

887
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,106
-No.
-Ms. Park's mother is residing

888
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,692
in the town that
Joojin Chemical has been buying lots from.

889
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:58,279
It's located less than two kilometers away
from Joojin Chemical's factory.

890
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,541
I thought she was sick

891
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,919
from the shock of losing our daughter
so suddenly.

892
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,130
It's been a month
since she could neither eat nor walk.

893
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,675
She's been in her bed ever since then.

894
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,183
I found out after reading the news article

895
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,060
that she had the same disease
as my daughter.

896
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,313
What did the doctors say?

897
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,943
They just kept running tests
and didn't tell me anything.

898
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,778
Which hospital did you go to?

899
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,030
The affiliated hospital
of my daughter's company

900
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,282
was helping us for free.

901
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,578
Is the news article true?

902
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,997
Did she get sick
because of the chemical substances?

903
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,543
We must run an investigation,
but it's highly likely that she did.

904
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:59,215
A young couple is living in the house
behind ours.

905
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,593
They miscarried four times.

906
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,989
More than 30 families
live in the vicinity.

907
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,618
The number will go up if we include towns
near Joojin Chemical's factory.

908
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,954
Joojin Chemical started
to purchase more lots

909
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,707
after you had disclosed
the incident seven years ago.

910
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,879
They are trying to cover up
that this area has been contaminated.

911
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,903
Sir.

912
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,072
I found Jang Tae-jun's skin.

913
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,283
-May I?
-Okay.

914
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,787
-It looks like Tae-jun's father...
-Okay.

915
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,498
accepted bribes in exchange for favors.

916
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,710
Should I tell
the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office?

917
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,172
The prosecutor's being picky.

918
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,674
If we just hand over this information,
he will delay it again.

919
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,427
This time, I should just spoon-feed him.

920
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,179
What do you mean?

921
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,140
If a spoon is shoved down your throat,
how could you not swallow?

922
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,562
Right. So he'll open up right away. I see.

923
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,981
All right. Let's go.

924
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,235
We must look into the victims first.

925
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,736
I'll take care of that.

926
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,281
I'll have a private organization
examine the soil and water.

927
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,660
If it's a governmental agency, Mr. Song
and Mr. Lee Chang-jin will find out.

928
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,468
Mr. Jang.

929
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,060
Sir.

930
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,815
This is a request of investigation
from the Election Committee.

931
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,779
It is suspected
that Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun

932
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,866
of the Daehan Party has violated
the Public Official Election Act.

933
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,952
The Election Committee found out
that Assemblyman Jang's father accepted

934
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:36,163
donations which were actually bribes

935
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:39,250
in exchange for favors
during the by-election campaign

936
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,628
and requested the Seoul Central
Prosecutors' Office to investigate.

937
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,672
According to our source
from the Committee,

938
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,173
they received several tips

939
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:49,677
that Assemblyman Jang's father took bribes
from his friends on several occasions.

940
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,055
They demanded a thorough investigation

941
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:57,685
of whether or not Assemblyman Jang
had directly been involved in the bribery.

942
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:01,814
As it is a serious matter, the Committee
announced that the assemblyman may

943
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,734
or may not be indicted after a follow-up
investigation by the prosecution.

944
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,987
The more I flounder,
the deeper I'm dragged into the pit.

945
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,282
Many of them helped Assemblyman Jang's
campaign and sent flowers...

946
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,783
Once I fall into a swamp,

947
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:17,830
the more I struggle to get out,
the deeper I fall into the swamp.

948
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,402
Is it true
that your father accepted bribes?

949
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,529
What the heck are you up to?

950
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,822
I didn't accept any money!

951
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,033
Do you think
Mr. Jang could lose his position

952
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,451
when the election is nullified?

953
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,745
One thing is missing from the files
you submitted.

954
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:58,913
The safe deposit box.

955
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,916
Be careful.
Yang Jong-yeol can be a bit sly.

956
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:02,833
And he's ambitious.

957
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,877
I'm working
at another assemblyman's office.

958
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,963
It's Mr. Jang Tae-jun's.

959
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,464
I will accept your proposal

960
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:11,634
as long as you walk out
of the prosecutor's office as a free man.

961
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,219
I don't want to leave

962
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,805
any more regrets.

963
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,599
