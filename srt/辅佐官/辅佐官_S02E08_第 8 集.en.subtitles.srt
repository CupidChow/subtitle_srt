1
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,979
Tae-jun.

2
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,273
If you dig a little deeper,

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:10,111
you might end up burying
Kang Seon-yeong in that pit, not me.

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,329
TRANSACTION HISTORY, JEONG YU-MI

5
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,543
PRIVATE ACCOUNTS OF JEONG YU-MI
SAMYEONG BANK

6
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,754
"Samyeong Bank"?

7
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,215
What about it?

8
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,677
The president of Samyeong Bank

9
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,307
is her father.

10
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,527
Truth buried deep beneath the lies.

11
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,740
That appalling truth
now has risen to the surface.

12
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,618
Did you think that fox became
an assemblywoman

13
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,370
only through proper means?

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,331
If you take this a step further,

15
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,708
you will not be taking me down.

16
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,670
You will be taking Kang Seon-yeong down.

17
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,008
An opponent with his back against the wall
does not hesitate

18
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,094
when he sees a chance to retaliate.

19
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,861
However,

20
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,864
I can't let him eat us alive like this.

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,376
There will only be one outcome.

22
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:02,390
EPISODE 8 HUNT

23
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,603
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,856
I thought you were never
going to talk to me again.

25
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,191
That's what I thought too.

26
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,572
It seems like you had a rough time.

27
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,826
PRESIDENT OF SAMYEONG BANK,
KANG SEONG-YEOP

28
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,334
Are you involved in these bank accounts
under borrowed names?

29
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,048
-Is this what you came here to ask?
-Answer me.

30
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,967
Must you hear me say it?

31
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,427
Do you know

32
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,387
where that money

33
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,514
came from?

34
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,477
Dad?

35
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,938
I know.

36
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,445
Then do you also know
what that money was used for?

37
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,863
Is that important?

38
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,823
You helped launder money for a slush fund.

39
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,367
I don't care who it was from.

40
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,036
That money is the reason
this bank is still up and running.

41
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,331
It also helped me raise you
and put food on our table

42
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,625
Save the excuses.

43
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,585
The money was for yourself.

44
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,673
Mom and I managed perfectly
without your help.

45
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,304
Do you really believe

46
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,015
you became assemblywoman
of the Daehan Party by yourself?

47
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,062
-What are you saying?
-I said what I said.

48
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,401
Why do you think those people
nominated you for the spot?

49
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,910
Even if Kang Seon-yeong
were a hot-shot lawyer

50
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,454
and the host of a current affairs TV show,

51
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,957
did you seriously think
she could have made it

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,918
into the National Assembly
with no backup at all?

53
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,256
Her father's power and influence
got her the spot.

54
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,469
Both your father and hers

55
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,264
do have a knack in
getting in their children's way.

56
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,225
My goodness.

57
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,069
KANG SEON-YEONG

58
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,622
JANG TAE-JUN

59
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,681
-Where's Won-sik?
-He was spotted at

60
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,932
the airport parking lot,

61
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,435
but it seems
he left the car and fled the scene.

62
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,604
After calling his family
in the Philippines,

63
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,314
he turned off his phone too.

64
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,494
Find Won-sik and bring him to me.

65
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,703
Make sure he's alive.

66
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,954
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,344
YUN HYE-WON

68
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,348
-Yes?
-Oh Won-sik is in the wind.

69
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,600
Ask Mr. Yang to check
the prosecution's movements.

70
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,686
We must find him
before Song Hui-seop does.

71
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,271
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN'S OFFICE

72
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,691
Mr. Han.

73
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,779
Are you done
looking into the bank accounts?

74
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,243
Does Mr. Jang's office know?

75
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,745
No, not yet.

76
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,540
Don't tell anyone. If word gets out,

77
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,251
Ms. Kang might have to resign.

78
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,712
I'll talk to her myself.

79
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,425
Mr. Han?

80
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,307
No, Ms. Kang is still looking into them.

81
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,685
Please let me know
once you know something.

82
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,854
Yes, of course.

83
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,620
Ms. Kang.

84
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,170
Seung-u, it's me.

85
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,756
We're still looking into
the bank accounts.

86
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,884
We need more time.

87
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,637
-Good morning.
-Sir, good morning.

88
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,223
Yes.

89
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,143
I'll send a press release
as soon as I know more.

90
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,898
The prosecution doesn't have
an all-points bulletin out on Mr. Oh yet.

91
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,984
They know that an open investigation
will hurt Minister Song too.

92
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,030
Is Mr. Oh avoiding your calls as well?

93
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,907
His phone has been turned off.

94
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,243
It seems he's gone into hiding.

95
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,497
Minister Song will have
a hard time tracking him down then.

96
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,957
That applies to us too.

97
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,585
It seems like there is only one way left

98
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,295
to find Oh Won-sik now.

99
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,132
We must expose the bank accounts.

100
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,010
Ms. Kang's office will soon
send over the files.

101
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,933
The bank that authorized them

102
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,268
is Samyeong Bank.

103
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,443
Samyeong Bank?

104
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,073
Then Ms. Kang...

105
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,623
No wonder Mr. Han kept the truth from me.

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,000
The National Tax Service
sent files to Ms. Kang

107
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,920
on accounts that they suspected
of being in borrowed names.

108
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,381
However, Mr. Han didn't mention it.

109
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,511
The files regarding the bank accounts
must be in Ms. Kang's possession.

110
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,097
If Ms. Kang turns against us,

111
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,892
the files that prove the accounts exist
could be destroyed.

112
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,613
If your father is involved,
it's sure to wreak havoc on the case.

113
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,532
I'm aware of that.

114
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,789
I don't know what I should say
to Assemblyman Jang.

115
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,875
Don't say anything

116
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,962
and let me take care of it.

117
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,132
I'll meet with your father
and deal with the bank accounts.

118
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,303
I can't bury this.

119
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm not saying that you should.

120
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,724
It's election season soon.

121
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,643
You can reveal this
after you're reelected.

122
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,896
It doesn't matter
that you had nothing to do with it.

123
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,190
You know how it will look for the press.

124
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,193
If they question your initial nomination,

125
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,738
everything, including the election, fails.

126
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,159
Ms. Kang.

127
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,582
I searched everywhere for Mr. Oh,
but he is still in the wind.

128
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,669
-Even his old family home?
-Yes.

129
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,840
Then check everything again
from the beginning.

130
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,552
Also, tell him this
as soon as you hear from him.

131
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,097
Tell him to come home and stop
making things harder on himself.

132
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,557
Yes, sir.

133
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,728
Imbecile.

134
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,607
Shit.

135
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,112
Mr. Lee.

136
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,031
Oh, hey.

137
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,200
Did Mr. Oh cause some sort of trouble?

138
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,246
I'm not sure. It's not like
I should know everything.

139
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,873
What did Minister Song say?

140
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,001
I'm supposed to find
even the smallest trace.

141
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,755
How can I locate someone
who's off the grid?

142
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,632
Anyway, I'll get going. Take care.

143
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,759
Sure. Carry on.

144
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,183
HOTEL ROO

145
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,102
Based on witness statements,
the fire department

146
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,478
has begun its investigation

147
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,314
by focusing on
where the fire originated from.

148
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,276
Yesterday around 9:50 p.m.,
near the East Yeongcheon Interchange,

149
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,154
a tow-truck crashed into a median strip.

150
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,658
The injured driver
who was transported to the hospital

151
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,701
didn't suffer any fatal injuries.

152
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,330
The police are investigating the accident
based on the driver's statement...

153
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,832
PHILIPPINES HOME

154
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,376
...that it was caused
due to one of the rear tires falling off.

155
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,422
Three months into the movement
of boycotting Japanese goods

156
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,674
has led to a new trend in workplaces.

157
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,008
Over ten years...

158
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,898
Ms. Yun.

159
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,249
Can we talk?

160
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,595
Ms. Lee asked me

161
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,639
not to reveal the document.

162
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,392
Of course.

163
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,188
I would've asked the same thing
if I were her.

164
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,442
I'm not sure if this is what's best

165
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,111
for Ms. Kang.

166
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,575
She believes that a formal investigation
into Minister Song and Youngil Group

167
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,577
must be conducted.

168
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,455
So not revealing this information

169
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,499
isn't what she'd want.

170
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,960
Keeping one's integrity
and upholding justice.

171
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,713
I've seen too many
who crumbled while trying to do so.

172
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,009
You know someone
who fits that description too.

173
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,347
It's sad, you know.

174
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,891
If only he compromised just a little bit.

175
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,434
It's also upsetting

176
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,606
how you can't survive
unless you join hands

177
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,525
with someone with greater power.

178
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:45,658
Do you think that she shouldn't
reveal the truth about the bank accounts?

179
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,579
That choice is yours.

180
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:56,001
Her secretary is you, not me.

181
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,590
Just think about what our role is.

182
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,760
Protect Ms. Kang in your own way.

183
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,013
That is our job.

184
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,235
Tae-jun, I'm sorry

185
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,153
for not calling sooner.

186
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,242
Did you meet your father?

187
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,744
You know about it?

188
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,957
Why didn't you say anything?

189
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,294
What if I had destroyed the evidence?

190
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,963
I trust you'll make the right decision.

191
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,757
You're different from me.

192
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
Why did I never connect the dots?

193
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,227
I always thought

194
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,939
I got here on my own.

195
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,192
I am Kang Seon-yeong of the Daehan Party.

196
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,445
We'll begin the press conference
calling for Floor Leader

197
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,654
Song Hui-seop's resignation.

198
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,616
This person has contributed greatly
in improving women's rights

199
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,951
-as a proud woman of our society.
-Thank you.

200
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,620
We call for an immediate resignation

201
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,623
of Assemblyman Lee
who's undermined the constitutionalism.

202
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,374
We must not wait any longer.

203
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,501
We must conduct this audit

204
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,504
to figure out the truth
behind the chemical spill.

205
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,261
You did get here on your own.

206
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,472
Don't ever deny that.

207
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,142
Without my father's reputation,

208
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,728
it wouldn't have been so easy.

209
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,660
I will start all over from square one

210
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,456
solely on my own.

211
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,355
What are you doing here now?

212
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,441
I thought I'd at least say goodbye.

213
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,861
Must you be so stubborn?

214
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,239
What's done is done.

215
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,783
Nothing good will come from
digging up the past.

216
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,536
That's not true.

217
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,123
Many will learn that whoever abuses
power and status to maintain power

218
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,166
will be punished.

219
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,752
However small and old
their wrongdoings may be,

220
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,754
it is impossible to erase them.

221
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,132
People will learn that.

222
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,926
Someone else would've done it
even if I had chosen not to.

223
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,388
Companies grew because of it,
and new jobs were created.

224
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,225
You call that an excuse?

225
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,520
You'll be in trouble
once this is revealed too.

226
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,313
It's election season soon.

227
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,442
You could end up
losing your position in office.

228
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,403
And why does that scare you?

229
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,780
What?

230
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,075
You were never afraid
when Mom and I left you,

231
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,078
so why are you worried
about me losing my position?

232
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,122
Seon-yeong.

233
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,417
I thought I had escaped you,

234
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,836
but I was still living under your shadow.

235
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,798
I refuse to walk on the path
you cleared for me.

236
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,925
Even if I trip and get mud all over me,

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,429
I will go my own way however I see fit.

238
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,069
PRESS ROOM

239
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,366
Here's your speech.

240
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,826
Good job.

241
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,704
Send out the press release once I'm done.

242
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,164
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,797
You'll be all right.

244
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,840
You've been through worse, right?

245
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,052
Thank you for saying that.

246
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,726
I am Assemblywoman Kang
of the Daehan Party.

247
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,939
Minister Song Hui-seop's chief of staff,
Mr. Oh Won-sik,

248
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,149
has been found
to have received illegal funds

249
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,401
through a borrowed-name bank account.

250
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,196
Mr. Oh was found to possess a slush fund

251
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,617
of 2.7 billion won that currently sits
in a bank account under his wife's name.

252
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,993
The true owner of the account

253
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,704
seems to be Minister Song.

254
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,087
Since the current
Minister of Justice is involved,

255
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,923
a thorough investigation
must be conducted.

256
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,759
The source of this money should
also be revealed as soon as possible.

257
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,222
I will start all over from square one

258
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,934
solely on my own.

259
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm talking to the press tomorrow.

260
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,818
You'll be under the media's scrutiny too.

261
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,653
I'm ready for that.

262
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
Your job now

263
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,411
is to find Oh Won-sik.

264
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,133
-Ms. Kang!
-There she is.

265
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,385
Do you have proof
that the account is Minister Song's?

266
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,054
Oh Won-sik served as
Minister Song's chief of staff

267
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,515
for the past ten years.

268
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,477
Meanwhile, Mr. Oh's wife hasn't earned
a single penny since their marriage.

269
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,439
The amount of money found in the account
couldn't have been reached

270
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,857
with a chief of staff's salary.

271
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,153
There's reason to believe that the account
is Minister Song's instead.

272
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,614
In your opinion,
how should the investigation be conducted?

273
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,741
Whether Minister Song truly owns the money

274
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,201
as well as the source of the money,

275
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,994
and what favors and privileges
were exchanged

276
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,287
should be brought to light.

277
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,540
That being said,
since Minister Song is a prime suspect,

278
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,085
I am worried about the prosecution
conducting a fair investigation.

279
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,463
Samyeong Bank is on the list you provided.

280
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,633
Isn't the president of Samyeong Bank,
Kang Seong-yeop, your father?

281
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,057
Yes, he is.

282
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,059
Ma'am, we should go.

283
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,936
-He's your father?
-Coming through.

284
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,813
-Is your father involved?
-A press release will be sent out.

285
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,316
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am, wait.

286
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,443
Ma'am, hold on.

287
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,904
Minister Song will make his move.
Send out the press release.

288
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,448
-Yes, sir.
-Ma'am, hold on.

289
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,408
Assemblywoman Kang of the Daehan Party

290
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,577
raised suspicion in regards to

291
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,956
Minister Song's chief of staff Oh Won-sik
receiving illegal funds.

292
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,749
According to Ms. Kang,

293
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,210
a slush fund of 2.7 billion won

294
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,089
was found in a bank account
under Mr. Oh's wife's name.

295
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,424
She asked an investigation to be held

296
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,885
-to prove Minister Song's ownership
-She dug her own grave.

297
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,637
and to find the source of the fund.

298
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,139
Meanwhile, many of the accounts

299
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,475
-were opened at Samyeong Bank...
-Have my car ready.

300
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,477
Sir!

301
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,854
There are reporters outside.

302
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,692
Sir, what do you know
about these accounts?

303
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,779
-Is this a result of bribery?
-How long have you worked with Mr. Oh?

304
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,616
I apologize to the public
for even being named

305
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,118
in an unfortunate scandal.

306
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,829
I was aware of the bank accounts,

307
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,498
and an internal investigation
was being conducted.

308
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,667
Mr. Oh Won-sik

309
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,211
went into hiding during our investigation.

310
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,715
He is currently on our most wanted list.

311
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,883
I had no idea what was happening,

312
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,220
but since my chief of staff is involved,

313
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,847
I am at fault too.

314
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,598
Even though he is my chief of staff,

315
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,227
I will make sure that a serious
and thorough investigation is conducted.

316
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,129
JANG TAE-JUN

317
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,343
Mr. Song banned you
from leaving the country.

318
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,053
If you want to live, call me.

319
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,309
-Sir!
-Just one more thing.

320
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,727
-Wait.
-Sir, please.

321
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,563
We will soon send over a press release.

322
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,773
-Wait.
-Sir!

323
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,608
-Please.
-Any more words?

324
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,320
Jang Tae-jun, you bastard.
How dare you set my house on fire

325
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,447
just so that you could find my stray dog?

326
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
Jong-uk.

327
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,539
Feed Kang Seon-yeong and her father
to the press.

328
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,041
Yes, sir.

329
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,003
Those sons of bitches.

330
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,259
CHAIRMAN SUNG

331
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,475
With suspicions raised regarding

332
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,186
illegal funds received
by Oh Won-sik, his chief of staff,

333
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,813
Minister Song...

334
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,856
-Tae-jun,
-issued an all-points bulletin...

335
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,942
help me.

336
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,778
-The immediate search...
-Where are you?

337
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,157
Tell me if you wish to live.
Where are you?

338
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,546
Yes?

339
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,549
No, Ms. Kang isn't involved.

340
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,634
-Yes?
-Mr. Mun, yes.

341
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,760
-That's right.
-You'll be

342
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,054
the first to receive our press release.

343
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,098
-Thank you.
-Ms. Lee?

344
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,142
Wait, are you good to be here?

345
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,309
Of course not.

346
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,687
But how can I sit around
in a time of crisis?

347
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,940
-Is that the press release?
-Would you look over it?

348
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,489
Who organized the press conference?

349
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,991
-Was it you?
-No, ma'am.

350
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,285
It was Mr. Han.

351
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,672
Get over here.

352
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,600
You kept the press conference from me.

353
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,476
Ms. Kang said

354
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,021
that you'd be against it.

355
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,023
Still, you should've told me.

356
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,524
You knew of the risk it entails.

357
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,861
-I did.
-Then you should've stopped her!

358
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,321
I know what you're worried about,

359
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,908
but following Ms. Kang's lead
and encouraging her choices

360
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,577
are what we're supposed to do.

361
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,704
You know very well

362
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,873
how hard she worked for this matter.

363
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,208
I didn't think it was right

364
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,293
to give up on this chance.

365
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,629
There would've been
another time to reveal the truth!

366
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,796
No.

367
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,094
This moment
was our only window of opportunity.

368
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,889
If we don't reveal the truth now,

369
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,475
-we'll never be able to bring them down.
-Ma'am--

370
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,851
Minister Song

371
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,103
was aware of my weakness.

372
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,065
He knew, but he kept it to himself.

373
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,775
I was never a threat to him.

374
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,653
He knew he could get rid of me
at any given time.

375
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,907
He also now knows
that I will never be his puppet

376
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,575
which means he won't nominate me.

377
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,662
As Minister of Justice,
he will control the prosecution

378
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,747
and intimidate those of high power.

379
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,582
I won't even be able to run for election.

380
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,752
This is our last chance.

381
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,344
Minister Song

382
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,430
will try to have the press
focus on you and your father.

383
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,809
We must highlight just how serious

384
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,103
Minister Song's scandal is.

385
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,231
I'll rewrite the press release.

386
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,441
Thank you.

387
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,911
I'm on my way to meet Mr. Oh.
It'll take about an hour.

388
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,996
ROOM 422, CHEONGMOK MOTEL,

389
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,539
Will Mr. Oh talk easily?

390
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,873
I'll have to make him talk.

391
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,960
-I'll stay in touch.
-Yes, sir.

392
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,847
The scandal involving my chief of staff
will soon subside.

393
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,390
We should eat.

394
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,227
Feeding him to the wolves
won't be enough to bury this scandal.

395
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,147
I know, sir. Considering what it implies,

396
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,481
I'll have to at least

397
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,485
bring in the president of Samyeong Bank
for questioning.

398
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,571
It will take some time,
but it'll be solved--

399
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,782
Is it really necessary
to get him involved?

400
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,870
I'll choose a scapegoat of a lower rank,

401
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,081
so let the case end with him.

402
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,167
But sir,

403
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,627
without questioning the president,
the public--

404
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,300
Then you should've taken care of things
before it got this far.

405
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,554
You're the Minister of Justice,
aren't you?

406
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,806
My apologies, sir.

407
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,936
It seems like old age

408
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,356
has taken away the cleverness

409
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,858
you once had when you were young.

410
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,492
Hey!

411
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,123
This beef tastes like a dead old cow.

412
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,835
How dare you serve this for me to eat?

413
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,630
My apologies, sir.
I'll have them make another one.

414
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,757
-Dismissed.
-I'm sorry, sir.

415
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,390
Minister Song,

416
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:08,061
you can always set another table
if you hate the meal you're served.

417
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,857
I really hope that won't be
the case between us.

418
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,485
Yes, sir.

419
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,420
It's me.

420
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,273
Mr. Song can't do this to me.

421
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,692
The number of dirty things
I did for him...

422
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,610
I didn't question him
when he nominated you.

423
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,195
You know that.

424
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,823
I'm not here to hear you whine.

425
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,701
You said you'd help me.

426
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,995
Then start talking.

427
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,876
Save me first.

428
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,670
Get me on a boat to China or Vietnam.

429
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,883
Then before I set sail,
I'll tell you everything I know.

430
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,843
You have about 20 minutes.

431
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,636
To do what?

432
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,638
I gave the prosecution this address.

433
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,641
-What?
-Wake up, will you?

434
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,772
Know that I'm the only one
who can help you out of his mess.

435
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,064
Now, sit.

436
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,567
I'll get you a lawyer.

437
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,571
It's me.

438
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,573
One second.

439
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,535
Go ahead.

440
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,456
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

441
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,083
This is Kang Seon-yeong.

442
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,720
Who financed Minister Song's slush fund

443
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,389
and how was it laundered?
I want to know everything.

444
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,403
Begin.

445
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,366
Minister Song...

446
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,119
took bearer bonds in exchange for stopping

447
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,621
the Youngil Group
slush fund investigation.

448
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,832
The bearer bonds were then

449
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,835
split into smaller bonds to buy
real estate via offshore trust companies.

450
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,419
Some were cashed in and put into

451
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,504
borrowed-name accounts.

452
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,631
That cash

453
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,885
was then used to fund Samil Association
by Minister Song and Chairman Sung.

454
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,720
How much are we talking about?

455
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,597
I don't know the exact amount,

456
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,016
but I know there are other
borrowed-name accounts than mine.

457
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,060
The total amount

458
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,729
should be around 32 billion won.

459
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,486
How was the money transferred?

460
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,029
The money was delivered

461
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,906
upon request in 50,000 won notes.

462
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,242
-Is there proof?
-No.

463
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,413
I made the delivery myself.

464
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,500
If there's no proof
that Minister Song received the money,

465
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,210
it'll just be taken as
Mr. Oh's sole claim.

466
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,217
Then we must find proof that Minister Song
and Chairman Sung are connected.

467
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,721
I'll call you back once I wrap things up.

468
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,472
All right.

469
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,185
Tae-jun.

470
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,731
What will happen to me
if you can't find proof?

471
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,651
You'll take the fall
for all the illegal money

472
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,695
stashed by those two.

473
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,413
They will be there in five minutes.

474
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,007
What is it?

475
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,972
Run now and you will never
see your family again!

476
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,767
Then what am I supposed to do?

477
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,063
You must help us get Minister Song.

478
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:30,949
What happened?

479
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,201
The prosecution just arrested him.

480
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,079
Will Chairman Sung make the move
you're anticipating?

481
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,374
I'll have to force him to.

482
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,686
Minister Song, they found Mr. Oh.

483
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,812
Where is he?

484
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,356
Prosecutor Seo is bringing him
to the Ministry.

485
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,574
YUN HYE-WON

486
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,493
-Have you found out?
-Yes,

487
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,620
Mr. Sung is attending
the Global Business Forum

488
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,330
held at Sevita Hotel.

489
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,124
Okay.

490
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,879
Hello, Chairman Sung.

491
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,632
Hi.

492
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,427
Chairman Sung.

493
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,887
THE 5TH GLOBAL BUSINESS FORUM

494
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,101
Well, if it isn't Assemblyman Jang.

495
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,437
What brings you here?

496
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,564
May I have a word with you?

497
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,652
I don't believe
we have anything to talk about.

498
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,947
Please make an appointment next time.

499
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,162
You'll want to hear this

500
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,665
if you want to know
what Minister Song's plan is.

501
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,449
Why did you disappear?

502
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,826
Well...

503
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,246
I just...

504
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,624
Did you think I'd kill you?

505
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,768
I'm sorry, Minister Song.

506
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,149
-Won-sik.
-Yes, Minister Song.

507
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,986
Confess to the prosecution
that the money in the bank accounts

508
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,197
belongs to Mr. Sung.

509
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,368
Don't worry about your wife and daughter.

510
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,120
I'll look after them.

511
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,122
Minister Song.

512
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,998
How long have you been working for me?

513
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,793
I've served you for ten years now.

514
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,755
Ten years is a long time.

515
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,134
I'd say it's time for you
to grab some power yourself.

516
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,220
Pardon?

517
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,389
You'll probably serve two to three years.

518
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,809
Consider it a little vacation.

519
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,937
By the time you're back,

520
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,524
I'll be the president of this country.

521
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
Of course.

522
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,572
You can be
the Chief Presidential Secretary,

523
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,575
the director of the foundation,
you just name it.

524
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,996
What will happen to Mr. Sung then?

525
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,418
-It's Prosecutor Seo.
-Come in.

526
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,552
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

527
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,848
Request an arrest warrant for Mr. Sung.

528
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,058
Yes, sir.

529
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,651
Goodness.

530
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,914
JANG TAE-JUN

531
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,666
JANG TAE-JUN

532
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,549
I'll leave my past behind

533
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,260
and enter the Blue House as a new person.

534
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,307
All you have to do

535
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,101
is mention Mr. Sung's name
to the prosecution.

536
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,272
I'll take care of
everything else from there.

537
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,483
Yes, sir.

538
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,862
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

539
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,656
OH WON-SIK

540
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,538
He's biting the hand that's fed him

541
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,290
all these years.

542
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,379
Why did you come to me?

543
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,756
I'm here to get the information
on the political funds

544
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,300
I failed to get from Mr. Lee.

545
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,345
Why should I

546
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,807
give it to you?

547
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,102
Isn't what you just heard reason enough?

548
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,816
Minister Song is holding
all the material on Mr. Lee

549
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,151
that Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
was investigating.

550
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,988
Now that Minister Song
has ordered you arrested,

551
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,324
you'll probably spend
the rest of your life in prison.

552
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,787
Let me think about it.

553
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,253
It's been revealed that Kang Seong-yeop,

554
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,213
the president of Samyeong Bank,
was involved

555
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,300
in the management
of Oh Won-sik's illegal funds.

556
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,012
Mr. Kang is the father of Assemblywoman
Kang Seon-yeong of the Daehan Party

557
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,055
and is suspected of playing a part

558
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,141
in Assemblywoman Kang's nomination

559
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,019
for the last legislative election.

560
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,105
While the Election Committee requested
the prosecution for an investigation,

561
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,690
if the allegations turn out to be true,

562
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,026
Assemblywoman Kang
will most likely have to face

563
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,777
legal processes.

564
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,529
If she ends up

565
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,157
being sentenced to prison
or fined more than a million won,

566
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,242
her election will be annulled.

567
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,580
They make it sound as if
you handed out bribes to be nominated.

568
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,498
It sure makes a nice story.

569
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,417
It's easier to grab people's attention

570
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,045
when things are up in the air.

571
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,590
Would there be a way
to turn the public opinion around?

572
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,093
The illegal funds should be
at the center of attention.

573
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,429
Let's use the public against them.

574
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,099
Please schedule an interview.

575
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,642
Will you be all right?

576
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,811
I know what people want to hear.

577
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,105
I want them to hear it from me.

578
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,568
There is much speculation
about whether Assemblywoman Kang

579
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,988
was involved in Mr. Kang Seong-yeop's
illegal funds deal.

580
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,325
The information about the accounts, sir.
The rest has been destroyed,

581
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,036
and the traces left in the database
are being deleted at the moment.

582
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,246
Okay. You may leave.

583
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,666
If the allegations prove to be true,
Assemblywoman Kang will be

584
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,418
sentenced to prison or fined

585
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,546
more than a million won for violating
the Public Official Election Act.

586
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,715
This might lead to Assemblywoman Kang's

587
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,135
losing her seat in the National Assembly.

588
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,678
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG SEON-YEONG'S OFFICE

589
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
Ms. Lee, you got out of the hospital?

590
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,682
How are you doing?

591
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,267
Not very well at all.

592
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,396
But Ms. Kang's situation seemed
much worse than mine,

593
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,147
so I couldn't lie still.

594
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,817
-Don't strain yourself.
-I won't.

595
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,569
Where's Mr. Jang?

596
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,738
He's meeting with Mr. Sung.

597
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,200
He better sort it out quickly,

598
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,036
or Ms. Kang will get hurt first.

599
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,581
How's Ms. Kang holding up?

600
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,877
She asked for an interview.
She wants to come to the front.

601
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,548
It might be better than letting
all kinds of rumors spread.

602
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,591
We'll monitor the situation too.

603
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,385
Tell me when the interview is scheduled.

604
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,178
Will do.

605
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,223
If anything happens to Ms. Kang
because of this,

606
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,309
I'll hold Jang Tae-jun responsible
whether he's an assemblyman or not.

607
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,727
Make sure he sorts it out.

608
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,444
Going down.

609
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,446
"Jang Tae-jun"?

610
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,242
While most of
the borrowed-name bank accounts

611
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,536
held by Oh, the chief of staff
of the Minister of Justice,

612
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,164
turned out to have been opened
at Samyeong Bank,

613
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,540
its president Kang Seong-yeop

614
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,002
was found to be father to Assemblywoman
Kang Seon-yeong of the Daehan Party.

615
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,795
-Come in.
-Mr. Kang's

616
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,715
involvement in the management
of Mr. Oh's illegal funds

617
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,967
-was followed by...
-This is Mr. Oh's cell phone.

618
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,635
It seems like he was on the phone

619
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,846
with Jang Tae-jun
when he was here earlier.

620
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,350
CALL HISTORY

621
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,605
JANG TAE-JUN

622
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,109
What will happen to Mr. Sung then?

623
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,196
Request an arrest warrant for Mr. Sung.

624
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,037
CHAIRMAN SUNG

625
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,340
Chairman Sung has summoned
the Prosecutor General

626
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,842
and the chief prosecutors
at the Anti-Corruption Unit.

627
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,386
-Find out where they meet.
-Yes, sir.

628
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,788
Okay. Oh, is that right?

629
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,665
Did Dad really say that?

630
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,042
My goodness.

631
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,794
English is important,

632
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,464
but Korean should be a priority
for Koreans, don't you think?

633
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,050
Right.

634
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,637
Seung-a, sweetie, you must be big by now.

635
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,433
All right. I'll give the phone
to your dad now.

636
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,188
-Won-sik.
-Yes?

637
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,650
Seung-a doesn't like her English friends.

638
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,028
She wants to come back to Korea.
Talk to her.

639
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,120
Hi, Seung-a.

640
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,665
Daddy was busy working
and couldn't call you.

641
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,282
-Won-sik.
-Yes, sir.

642
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,576
I even offered to help out
while you're in prison.

643
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,411
How could you stab me in the back?

644
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,164
-How could you?
-Minister Song.

645
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,667
I can see to it that Seung-a and your wife
can never set foot in Korea again.

646
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,884
Minister Song, I'm sorry.

647
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,470
I made a terrible mistake.
Please forgive me.

648
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,514
How much

649
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,892
does Jang Tae-jun know?

650
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,022
Well...

651
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,278
Tae-jun.

652
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,864
Let's go get something to eat.

653
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,704
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

654
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,334
I haven't eaten anything all day
because of you.

655
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,127
I'm starving.

656
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,088
Let's eat.

657
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,512
I feel sorry for Won-sik.
You should leave him alone.

658
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,641
I don't want to go
to his funeral just yet.

659
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,560
You're the one who's sacrificing him

660
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,772
after having him at your beck and call
for ten years.

661
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,401
Who's sacrificing who?

662
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,444
He's just paying for what he's done.

663
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,781
What Oh Won-sik got is just the crumbs

664
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,409
while you pocketed
a whopping 32 billion won.

665
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,536
You should both pay for what you've done.

666
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,081
A "whopping" 32 billion won? You think?

667
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,127
Hey, I wouldn't be satisfied
with 320 billion won.

668
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,131
Hadn't I handed out that money
to everyone,

669
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,299
I wouldn't have made it here.

670
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,469
You did a good job as the mother bird.

671
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,348
So are you proud of being alive
after you've corrupted the political world

672
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,308
to such extents?

673
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,227
Look, Tae-jun.

674
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,480
You used to be in my nest too.

675
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,816
When you begged me for nomination,

676
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,734
you were like a baby bird

677
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,864
desperately waiting for food
with your mouth wide open.

678
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:45,159
Now that you're wearing that gold badge,
have you forgotten that all?

679
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,037
If there's something
I should pay for, I will.

680
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,622
But still,

681
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,624
I must change the world.

682
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,337
You want to see it through?

683
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:58,881
Yes.

684
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,841
I cannot let someone like you

685
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,635
influence the world anymore.

686
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,317
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

687
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,902
DAD

688
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,786
What's the matter?

689
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,624
Can we meet? I have something to tell you.

690
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,710
All right.

691
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,428
Hello, Mr. Seo.
Where's Chairman Sung right now?

692
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,805
Okay.

693
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,559
-Turn the car around.
-Yes, sir.

694
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,108
Song Hui-seop
is the current Minister of Justice.

695
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,946
Investigating him might backfire on us.

696
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,782
He still has many prosecutors on his side.

697
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,205
If you don't want any risks,

698
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,166
you could stick to catching
guppies in a small stream.

699
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,628
But shouldn't
men in your positions aim higher

700
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,631
and catch a boatful of fish
to make your time worthwhile?

701
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,387
By investigating Minister Song,
we'll lose some,

702
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,431
but we'll win even more.

703
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,352
The Prosecutor General who dug into

704
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,854
the corruption
of the running Minister of Justice.

705
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,443
Wouldn't that title give you an edge
in the next legislative election?

706
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,075
If being an assemblyman is not your thing,

707
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,704
how about the Minster of Justice?

708
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:08,302
I thought you left me out
because the food was too humble,

709
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,305
but apparently, you were enjoying
a feast without me.

710
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,183
Will you excuse us?

711
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,395
I have something to discuss
with Chairman Sung in private.

712
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,025
Chairman Sung is under investigation.

713
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,194
Would you like to accompany him to the
interrogation room with your badges on?

714
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,030
Leave now.

715
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,085
Chairman Sung.

716
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,254
The two of us going after each other

717
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,548
isn't going to make anyone happy.

718
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,928
So why couldn't you make sure everything--

719
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,138
That bullshit again.

720
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,186
Are you out of your mind?

721
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,522
You're the one
who made things complicated!

722
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,524
You seem to keep forgetting,

723
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,152
but the man sitting in front of you

724
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,613
is the Minister of Justice
of this country.

725
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,907
You've completely lost your mind.

726
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,325
Without me,

727
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,204
how are you going to get away with
ordering their murders?

728
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,499
Choe Yong-hyeon, Go Seok-man,

729
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,292
and Lee Chang-jin.

730
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,796
They were all killed
to clean up the mess you made.

731
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,341
You need me as the Minister of Justice

732
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,678
if you want a chance
at being released on bail, paroled,

733
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,263
or given a special pardon.

734
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,975
There's no statute of limitations
for murder by proxy.

735
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,113
Complaining is useless.

736
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,490
Don't you dare think about starting over.

737
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,326
Just take whatever you have left
and enjoy them.

738
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,040
The president of Samyeong Bank
will be arrested.

739
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,001
You'll be investigated too.

740
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,089
Wait quietly for my men tomorrow.

741
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,632
Got it?

742
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,291
Song Hui-seop seems to know everything.

743
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,626
He might even have evidence.

744
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,421
What do you want me to do?

745
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,593
I'll leave my past behind

746
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,345
and enter the Blue House as a new person.

747
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,892
All you have to do

748
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,895
is mention Mr. Sung's name
to the prosecution.

749
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,690
I'll take care of
everything else from there.

750
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,615
I've been giving my cow
only the best fodder I could find,

751
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,161
but it just won't listen to its master.

752
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,500
That leaves me no choice

753
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,377
but to handle it my way.

754
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,100
Have you heard back from Chairman Sung?

755
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,063
He's swayed, but I'm
still waiting for his answer.

756
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,565
What if he refuses
to hand over the information?

757
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,235
Even so, a crack has started.

758
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,278
Everything will crumble away soon.

759
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,780
How's Ms. Kang?

760
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,448
Things aren't going well.

761
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,409
The Election Committee will
start looking into her nomination process.

762
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,624
CHAIRMAN SUNG YEONG-GI

763
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,002
Hello. Are you done thinking?

764
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,382
I know where it is. I'll be right there.

765
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,302
I'll call you as soon as I have it.

766
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,887
Okay.

767
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:39,823
Have a seat.

768
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,868
It'd been such a long time,
and we ended up fighting.

769
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,911
Let's eat together.

770
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,538
You'll have to eat alone.

771
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,125
I wouldn't have come
if I knew this was in store.

772
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,335
Your mom.

773
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,463
I hear you visit her often.

774
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,217
And I could tell.

775
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,303
You went to visit her?

776
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,054
Yes.

777
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,140
Why'd you wait
until she was dead to do that?

778
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,563
There are many things
you don't know about.

779
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,982
I'm not interested.

780
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,984
Nothing you tell me today

781
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,028
could ever change the fact

782
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,155
that you abandoned me and Mom.

783
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,699
But...

784
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,546
Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

785
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,467
Come with us quietly.

786
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,471
I hope we'll get

787
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,973
another chance to eat together.

788
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,278
I asked the caretaker
to give your mom's grave

789
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,948
a little touch-up.

790
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,326
Go take a look.

791
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,970
I haven't held

792
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,596
a press conference

793
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,723
in a while now, right?

794
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,395
I'm sure you have many questions.

795
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:37,399
Please feel free to ask me anything.
I'm ready to answer.

796
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,318
Thank you for arranging this.

797
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,903
As far as I know,

798
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,572
Mr. Oh Won-sik has worked for you
for many years now.

799
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:48,118
Were you really not aware of what he did?

800
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,287
It's really unfortunate indeed.

801
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,083
He's such a family man.

802
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,334
He adores his daughter.

803
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,671
Aren't all parents the same?

804
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,172
He must have wanted

805
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,967
some money for his child.

806
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,262
I was actually thinking of helping him out

807
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,639
with his daughter's college tuition
in the future.

808
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,766
But I regret not helping him earlier.

809
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,728
I should've been more thoughtful.

810
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,313
Is the investigation being conducted
as it should be?

811
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,899
Of course. It definitely is.

812
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,820
But to see my own man
being investigated like that

813
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,906
sure does make me sad.
I can't even sleep well these days.

814
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,616
Still, what can I do?

815
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,870
I couldn't cover up for him
just because he's worked for me.

816
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,123
Oh Won-sik, who had been
under investigation

817
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,791
for his illegal funds allegations,

818
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,002
-Ms. Kang.
-confessed

819
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,796
that the bank accounts belonged to him
and has been taken into custody.

820
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,965
He has received

821
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,676
billions of won from businesses
in return for dealing with

822
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,927
complaints against them.

823
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,890
He also stated that Minister Song
was unrelated to the case.

824
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,144
The prosecution is trying to find out
which companies slipped money...

825
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,522
Does this mean
that Mr. Oh is taking all the blame?

826
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,067
Mr. Oh is back
on Minister Song's side now.

827
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,820
He's not saying a thing
about Youngil Group or Minister Song.

828
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,156
This doesn't feel right.

829
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,242
...denied any involvement in the affair.

830
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,872
Some people say that Youngil Group
slipped money to Mr. Oh.

831
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,419
I've heard that rumor myself.

832
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,840
If anything is found, Youngil Group will,
of course, be investigated.

833
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,927
I promise the investigation
will be thorough

834
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,596
and will leave no doubt.

835
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,644
Don't worry.

836
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,647
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

837
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,898
Bye.

838
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,283
I told you to wait quietly.

839
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,952
What are you doing out here?

840
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,162
Minister Song.

841
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,999
I'd like to show you
something interesting.

842
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,294
I shouldn't have all the fun, should I?

843
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,549
-Get in.
-I'm tired. I'll take a rain check.

844
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:08,925
Do get in.

845
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,513
There are people watching.

846
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:47,172
Mr. Oh has been Minister Song's
closest aide for many years.

847
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,965
Minister Song denied

848
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,301
-any involvement...
-Is Mr. Jang not in?

849
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,011
He went to meet Chairman Sung.

850
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,639
As Minister Song promised
a thorough investigation himself,

851
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,726
it is predicted
that there will be no cover-up.

852
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,996
KANG SEON-YEONG

853
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,414
Hello.

854
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,303
Tae-jun.

855
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,639
Hello? Tae-jun.

856
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,970
Do you know
where he is meeting Chairman Sung?

857
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,436
Where are we going?

858
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,106
We're almost there.

859
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,697
What's going on here?

860
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:22,910
A viper full of venom
shouldn't be kept alive.

861
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,247
When you hunt, you have to
make sure the prey is down.

862
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,376
Go ahead.

863
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,462
Go ahead.

864
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,927
The current Minister of Justice

865
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,680
stood by the scene of a murder.

866
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,517
What will happen if this gets out?

867
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,436
I wonder if there is

868
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,147
any statute of limitations
for covering up a murder.

869
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:38,861
Whether you like it or not, you and I are

870
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,863
in the same boat now.

871
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,757
OPPOSE TO PROTECT THE RIGHT
TO AN ADEQUATE STANDARD OF LIVING

872
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,930
SEOBUK MARKET COMMITTEE
AGAINST REDEVELOPMENT

873
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:03,798
Man, he's a tough one.

874
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,634
Run him over.

875
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,262
Run him over.

876
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:43,921
Tae-jun!

877
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:48,259
We're both covered in shit now.
It's time to wash up.

878
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,469
Ms. Kang is the only person
who can go after

879
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,763
Minister Song and Chairman Sung now.

880
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,683
I need your help, Chief Choe.
Can you help me?

881
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,268
Ms. Kang is preparing

882
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:00,062
a special investigation
into your slush funds, Minister Song.

883
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,522
I know she's reckless,

884
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,900
but how dare she mess with me?

885
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,109
Why would I be afraid?

886
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,612
It won't be easy,

887
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,031
but let's take the bull by the horns.
