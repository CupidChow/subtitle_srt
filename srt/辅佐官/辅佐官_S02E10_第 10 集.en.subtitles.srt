1
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,488
There's a weight of life
one can't bear on his own.

2
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,449
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,534
Get back or people will get hurt!

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,787
In order to disperse
the terminated employees

5
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,081
who were carrying out a strike
within the factory,

6
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,457
a SWAT team was mobilized.

7
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,501
The police commented that the operation

8
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,044
was well within the bounds of duty

9
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,297
and that 20 or so union members
were arrested...

10
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,549
HUNGER STRIKE

11
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,639
Let go!

12
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,519
DEMOLITION

13
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,990
But I must walk

14
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,077
with their weight on my shoulders.

15
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,747
Don't worry about the process.
Just look at the result.

16
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,583
If the process wasn't right,
the result won't be right either.

17
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,377
Do you have to win by all means?

18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,629
Is that so important?
It's more important to win.

19
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,132
You said you wanted to change the world.

20
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,551
You must win to be able to do anything.

21
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,387
Tae-jun, but there is a line
you must never cross!

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,305
I do not care if you criticize my tactics.

23
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,808
You can't change anything without power.

24
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,726
I will do this.

25
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,645
And I will take responsibility.

26
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,370
It is now time
for me to take responsibility.

27
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:59,804
EPISODE 10 WEIGHT OF 6 GRAMS

28
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,396
These are the bank accounts
that we're assuming are Chairman Sung's.

29
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,149
Also, these are the log of deposits

30
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,109
made under his orders.

31
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,861
We must compare both materials

32
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,238
and find proof that links him to lobbying.

33
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,408
Most of the money was withdrawn
then handed out in person.

34
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,285
It's the best way to leave no paper trail.

35
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,747
I'm sure that some of the money
was bounced around different accounts.

36
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,082
They could be labeled
as donations or operation expenses

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,168
to keep the trace clean.

38
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,086
It might take a while,

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,589
but tracking the transaction
will get us to the truth.

40
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,049
Where shall we begin then?

41
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,759
Analyze the transactions.

42
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,677
Check the accounts

43
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,598
of the families and friends
of assemblymen, judges and prosecutors,

44
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,475
companies, and associations.

45
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,602
-Yes, ma'am.
-We're running out of time.

46
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,395
Stop everything you're doing

47
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,189
and focus on tracking down the lobby.

48
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,732
-Yes, sir.
-Got it, sir.

49
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,909
Tae-jun,

50
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,827
don't you need a rest?

51
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,038
-You don't look well.
-I'm fine.

52
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,669
Is there a way to get the accounts
of other banks just like Samyeong's?

53
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,170
I can look into it,

54
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,965
but I doubt it'll be easy.

55
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,764
Tae-jun, are you all right?

56
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,601
I just felt a little dizzy, that's all.

57
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,688
-You really should rest.
-There's no time for that.

58
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,898
I'll take care of this.

59
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,234
Let's get you home first.

60
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,622
Get some rest.

61
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,874
I'll call you
once we've looked at the files.

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,336
I'm sorry to leave
all the burden with you.

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,005
It's all right.

64
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,133
Tae-jun.

65
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,844
Don't try to carry
all the weight by yourself.

66
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,940
LIST OF BANK ACCOUNTS

67
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,449
Da-jeong, get this to Ms. Kang's office.

68
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,992
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,995
Mr. Ahn wanted me to give you this.

70
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,496
-Good night then.
-You too.

71
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,417
It's from Mr. Jang's office.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,211
These must be the accounts they checked.

73
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,173
-Mr. Han.
-Yes?

74
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,761
Can you compare these accounts?

75
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,970
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,817
Youngil Group's secretary's office
just called.

77
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,611
The files Jang Tae-jun acquired

78
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,489
contain Chairman Sung's bank accounts

79
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,574
and the transactions made for lobbying.

80
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,744
Assemblyman Jang
and Assemblywoman Kang's offices

81
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,163
are searching for
the rightful owner of those accounts.

82
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,708
-Where's Chairman Sung?
-In the hospital, sir.

83
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,129
CHAIRMAN SUNG

84
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,256
He's been trying to contact you
since this morning.

85
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,050
I don't know what to do.

86
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,470
-I'll take it from here. You're dismissed.
-Yes, sir.

87
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,897
CHAIRMAN SUNG

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,152
We checked the transaction records
of the accounts

89
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,071
that we suspect are
made under borrowed-names.

90
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,325
Some were made
to members of the Daehan Party

91
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,369
and current and former
government employees.

92
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,872
The total amount we suspect
was lobbied is 19.3 billion won.

93
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,999
It's enough for an Independent Counsel.

94
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,335
Schedule a press conference.

95
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,753
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

96
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,887
Why weren't you taking my calls?

97
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,891
I was busy trying
to remedy the situation, sir.

98
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,894
They now have the list
of accounts and my ledger.

99
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,189
The world will now learn of
all the money I spread out there.

100
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,608
Do you have a way to stop this?

101
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,319
It's why I came to you in person.

102
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,202
Send out a press release after my speech.

103
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,162
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,746
Ma'am,

105
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,875
the prosecution is on the move.

106
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,629
Come in.

107
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:03,399
Are you telling me to give up
everything I have?

108
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,823
I devoted my entire life
to get this far ahead.

109
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:15,244
That money is what
bought you the seat you're in.

110
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,206
Mr. Sung, money isn't
what's at stake here.

111
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,209
Your money is what bought my seat,

112
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,087
but I wiped your behind
with my own bare hands.

113
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,466
A fly can only take advantage
of a cow's back for so long.

114
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,844
Overstay its welcome,
and it'll get smacked by the tail.

115
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,978
So you'll save yourself
and leave me hanging?

116
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,524
I have to, in order to save you if I can.

117
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,527
This'll blow over in a few years.

118
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,947
Then, I'll issue a special pardon
for your release.

119
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,908
So for now, just do as I say.

120
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,876
Let's come clean about the lobbying

121
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,463
before they expose us first.

122
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,928
Minister Song Hui-seop

123
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,264
has invoked his investigative authority.

124
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,141
This morning, Minister Song

125
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,019
issued a command letter
regarding the investigation

126
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,230
into Youngil Group's slush fund.

127
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,691
He stated that he was taking over

128
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,151
due to the fact that the prosecution

129
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,071
was dragging its feet
despite the public outrage.

130
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,031
The command letter is said to contain

131
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,950
the collection of evidence

132
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,660
regarding Youngil Group's lobbying

133
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,745
and the guideline into

134
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,956
Chairman Sung Yeong-gi's investigation.

135
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,376
The Minister of Justice
invoking his investigative authority

136
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,586
falls under the Act...

137
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,754
-Tae-jun.
-Yes, I'm watching.

138
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,841
Denying his right
will be an admission of guilt

139
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,344
which is why the prosecution
has no other option but to accept it.

140
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,804
I'm heading to the office.

141
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,974
The political circles commented
that the Minister of Justice

142
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,726
and the prosecutor general...

143
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,443
Even if we call for
an Independent Counsel,

144
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,069
we won't be able to get Song Hui-seop.

145
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,406
How many members in the office
received bribes from Chairman Sung?

146
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,908
We verified 12 counts.

147
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,038
Even if we reveal our findings,
they'll deny it

148
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,956
and paint it as a unilateral claim.

149
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,541
They'll still feel threatened though.

150
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,793
Not Minister Song,

151
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,587
but the current government.

152
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,088
You'll get the Blue House involved?

153
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,798
I hope they will work with us.

154
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,092
It might put you in danger.

155
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,346
Right.

156
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,932
But we can no longer
give Minister Song any more time.

157
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,523
Sir.

158
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,568
The Blue House just called.

159
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,737
The Chief Presidential Secretary
wants a word.

160
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,326
Come in.

161
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,956
Hello, sir.

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,917
I see you have company...

163
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,885
You won't believe
the traffic I faced on my way here.

164
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,014
Mr. Jang,

165
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,226
I'm curious as to what
brought you here to the Blue House.

166
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,896
Shouldn't you be resting
considering the injuries you received?

167
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,861
Sir, may I ask why you wanted to see me?

168
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,202
DONGBUK DAILY

169
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,664
The investigation
into Youngil Group's lobbies

170
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,541
is making its way to the Blue House.

171
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,835
Don't worry, sir.

172
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,004
It's why I invoked
my investigative authority

173
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,715
in order to swiftly
get to the bottom of this.

174
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,509
If Minister Song leads this investigation,

175
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,720
the public may see it
as the government's attempt of a cover-up.

176
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,389
You're still accused

177
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,558
of being involved
in the slush funds yourself.

178
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,559
So?

179
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,102
What are you suggesting?

180
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,480
You have to show that you are innocent
at the National Assembly.

181
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,941
Are you talking about a hearing?

182
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,486
If you're innocent,
it will do you more good than harm.

183
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,074
Sounds good to me.

184
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,120
But sir--

185
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,956
I can't let the Blue House
be dragged into this.

186
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,001
Prove your innocence
regarding this scandal

187
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,171
and then focus on
the investigation afterwards.

188
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,757
Yes, of course.

189
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,562
Do you think you'll bring me down

190
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,398
with a special hearing?

191
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,866
The Judiciary Committee
will hold a special hearing.

192
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,576
Will it be as effective though?

193
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,953
The head of the Judiciary Committee

194
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
and assistant administrators
are Song's people.

195
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,875
His first course of action
will be to shut them up.

196
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,378
I know. That's why Song Hui-seop
accepted the hearing.

197
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,755
Then what's the plan?

198
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:22,092
Do you remember
how I helped him get his current seat?

199
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,850
-Will the trap work?
-We'll make it work.

200
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,437
It's our only chance
to bring Song Hui-seop down.

201
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,944
My hearing will be conducted soon,

202
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,947
so treating you to a meal is
the least I can do considering

203
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,114
how rough it'll get for you.

204
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,116
Let's eat then.

205
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,702
They say being well-fed even makes
ghosts look more handsome.

206
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,580
On which date shall we have the hearing?

207
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,041
-At the end of the month?
-Why wait?

208
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,793
Let's strike while the iron is hot.

209
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,170
Make it happen as soon as possible.

210
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,339
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,841
No matter how hard
we try to have your back,

212
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,718
Jang Tae-jun will still come after you.

213
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,512
Look.

214
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,973
The head of the committee is here

215
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,517
and so are the administrators
of both parties.

216
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,018
There's only so much he can do.

217
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,773
Besides, I'll make sure
he doesn't attend the hearing.

218
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,529
I considered not ending his life
out of the goodness of my heart,

219
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,323
but I have no choice
since he won't back down.

220
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,326
Anyway, let's eat
before the food goes cold.

221
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,911
Sure.

222
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,664
Keep this in mind before you eat though.

223
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
If this hearing hurts me in any way,

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,838
half of you will lose your jobs.

225
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,300
It's about time you earned your keep.

226
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,176
Don't you agree?

227
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,889
Let's eat.

228
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,406
How's the mood in the office?

229
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,325
Minister Song taking over generated

230
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,993
some backlash among the prosecutors,

231
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,495
but none have been voicing their concerns.

232
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,956
He made a mockery out of us.

233
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,666
If you took the lead,

234
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,543
the prosecutors will have your back.

235
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,713
Do we have a suspect
on Jang Tae-jun's assault case?

236
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,632
A witness last spotted him
at Pyeongtaek Port.

237
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,842
He must be trying to leave the country.

238
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,095
The gang he used to belong to
should have a smuggler.

239
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,972
-Contact him to track him down.
-Yes, sir.

240
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,308
Sir,

241
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,937
should we still be helping
Jang Tae-jun though?

242
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,774
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
will investigate him.

243
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,026
On what charges?

244
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,528
Illegal utilization of
the police's internal documents

245
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,156
and the cover-up
of Assemblyman Jo's bribery.

246
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,080
Just carry on. What we're doing
isn't to help Jang Tae-jun.

247
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,915
We're trying to bring Song Hui-seop down

248
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,709
and upright the discipline
of the prosecutors' office.

249
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,710
Yes, sir.

250
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,671
I'll be in touch.

251
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,640
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

252
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,230
We must shake Minister Song up
before the hearing.

253
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,566
I sent out a press release
which state that he and Chairman Sung

254
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,360
was at the scene of your assault,

255
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,112
but no one's willing to publish the story.

256
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,073
The same goes for Dodam Daily.

257
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,993
And...

258
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,496
The hearing has been scheduled.

259
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,000
He won't give us time to get ready.

260
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,793
Will Chairman Sung testify?

261
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,337
He's refusing to take the stand
due to health issues.

262
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,006
His heart surgery

263
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,841
has been booked on that day.

264
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,344
A doctor already signed off on it,
so it'll be hard to force him there.

265
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,179
Ask for all the material

266
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,306
regarding Minister Song and Chairman Sung

267
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,976
including documents
from Minister Song's confirmation hearing.

268
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,937
We must find the link
between the two of them.

269
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,397
Yes, sir.

270
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,191
Sir.

271
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,529
I'll help Assemblyman Jang
prepare for the hearing.

272
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,782
Gather all the material
you have on Minister Song.

273
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,201
We don't have enough time to prepare.

274
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,911
Would the hearing even be effective?

275
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,455
We only need to find one thing.

276
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,457
The link between
Minister Song and Chairman Sung.

277
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,044
Anyway, get me ready for the meeting.

278
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,879
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,214
Ma'am.

280
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,427
The prosecution has begun
its investigation

281
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,137
into Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun.

282
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,057
Earlier, the prosecution revealed

283
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,560
that Mr. Jang leaked internal information
within the police force.

284
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,021
The prosecution will soon summon Mr. Jang

285
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,482
and begin an investigation on
how he obtained such materials,

286
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,525
his knowledge of illegality
concerning his actions,

287
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,943
and his motives for the crime

288
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,696
as well as planning and repetition
of such illegal activity.

289
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,240
If he is found guilty of

290
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,285
deliberately leaking the information
he obtained to a third party,

291
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,704
he could be arrested for further...

292
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,126
The prosecution issued a warrant out
for your arrest.

293
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,129
A summons will be issued soon.

294
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,799
I think he means to stop you
from attending the hearing.

295
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,967
You can refuse to be questioned
with your immunity.

296
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,719
It may not side well with the public,

297
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,387
but it's your only option.

298
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,556
It's what Minister Song wants.

299
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,975
If they find you

300
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,269
incompetent to lead the hearing--

301
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,563
It will be forced to stop.

302
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,650
We can change the target.

303
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,362
Let the prosecution

304
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,155
question me instead.

305
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,783
I knew the documents
were obtained illegally.

306
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,411
You tried to stop me,
but I disobeyed your orders.

307
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,751
Send out a press release saying
that I acted on my own accord.

308
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,629
-Sure.
-Hye-won,

309
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,257
assemblymen may have immunity,
but you don't.

310
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,801
You could be arrested
right after being questioned.

311
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,261
Must you go this far?

312
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,889
I'm his chief of staff.

313
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,309
It's my job to protect him
until the very end.

314
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,812
Ms. Yun...

315
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,690
Please do a good job
preparing for the hearing.

316
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,613
Going down.

317
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,747
I'll turn myself in.

318
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,166
Let me do it.

319
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,167
Hye-won,

320
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,044
this is my burden to bear.

321
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,297
But you also have a job to do.

322
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,048
Only think about that right now.

323
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,967
We can't let Minister Song

324
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,303
get his way.

325
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,014
Do not let this be the end.

326
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,777
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

327
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,575
Jang Tae-jun's office
sent out a press release.

328
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,911
They're claiming that
Yun Hye-won acted on her own

329
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,746
without Jang Tae-jun's approval.

330
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,414
Where is she right now?

331
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,042
She has already come by to be questioned.

332
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,879
At this moment, it'll be difficult
to have Jang Tae-jun arrested too.

333
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,216
They're trying to buy some time.

334
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,594
Come in.

335
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,771
Sir, here are the lists of requests
from Assemblyman Jang's office.

336
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,148
Let me see.

337
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,817
REQUESTED MATERIAL
HEARING FOR YOUNGIL GROUP SLUSH FUND CASE

338
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,361
Goodness.

339
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,905
Goodness me. What a long list.

340
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,532
I guess I should show some action.

341
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,954
Gather some documents and send them over.

342
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,996
Yes, sir.

343
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,084
Also, I've blocked all media outlets
from reporting about you.

344
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,085
Good.

345
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,422
I made sure that
the reporters at the conference

346
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,132
kept their mouth shut,

347
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,884
so how did

348
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,972
Yun Hye-won know that
I was with Chairman Sung?

349
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,695
Gwi-dong...

350
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,825
Nothing.

351
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,469
These are from the Ministry of Justice.

352
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,929
They sent over plenty but...

353
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,558
The files we requested aren't here
and trash is all they sent over.

354
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,935
Are we supposed to recycle these?

355
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,646
-What about the prosecution?
-We received files via email,

356
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,149
but key words and phrases
have been redacted.

357
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,153
Will any of these lead to the connection
between Minister Song and Chairman Sung?

358
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,946
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

359
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,073
Forget about the materials they sent us.

360
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,200
They're probably a bust anyway.

361
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,952
Why don't we focus on

362
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,204
the bills proposed by Minister Song?

363
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,081
He could've proposed those that benefited

364
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,750
Youngil Group's subsidiaries

365
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,210
or covered up any investigation into them.

366
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,589
The files within the National Assembly
could give us a fighting chance.

367
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,799
Financial investments
is Youngil Group's main business.

368
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,844
During the 17th assembly election,
Song was on the National Policy Committee.

369
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,305
Look into the bills proposed then
and committee minutes.

370
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,059
-Mr. Ahn.
-Right.

371
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,478
-Mr. Park.
-Thanks.

372
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,562
Here you go, sir.

373
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,441
-Can you check these?
-Sure.

374
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,525
Ma'am.

375
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,030
As you can see, the bills were
about FTA with Vietnam and others...

376
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,869
Here are the bills
proposed by Minister Song at the time.

377
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,371
-They're in chronological order.
-Thank you.

378
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,251
Minister Song tabled multiple bills

379
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,754
that benefited Youngil Group's interest.

380
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,298
However, most were joint motions.

381
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,094
Ahn Hyeon-min and No Seung-jin
proposed the bills with him.

382
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,429
That's not enough
to tie those two together.

383
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,224
Even before he became a prosecutor,
Minister Song

384
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,518
was close to Chairman Sung.

385
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,270
Is there a way to prove that?

386
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,150
There is.

387
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,737
Someone who is always
by Minister Song's side.

388
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,621
I hear your daughter is getting married.

389
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,331
Yes, sir.

390
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,459
The wedding takes place this month.

391
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,836
Has she purchased a house yet?

392
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,004
Not yet, sir.

393
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,840
Buying one in Seoul isn't easy.

394
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,426
Find something appropriate

395
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,804
and I'll buy it for her.

396
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,682
-Sorry?
-You've been my driver for 20 years.

397
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,143
It'll be my pleasure.

398
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,228
Don't think too much about it
and find a place.

399
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,856
Consider it a wedding gift.

400
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,025
Yes, sir.

401
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,338
-Good night, sir.
-You too.

402
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,560
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

403
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,062
Gwi-dong, can we meet?

404
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,151
How are your injuries?

405
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,195
Should you even be out and about?

406
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,363
I'm better now.

407
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,616
Ms. Yun told me.

408
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,494
You told her about Minister Song.

409
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,874
Oh, that. I doubt it was any help,
but I hoped it could be.

410
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,377
I was wondering
if you could help us once again.

411
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,172
We're looking for bearer bonds

412
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,799
that Chairman Sung gave to Minister Song.

413
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,970
I thought you'd have an idea
as to where they'd be.

414
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,473
I want to help you,

415
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,894
but he's not the type of person
who'd let me see him do such business.

416
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,229
Then I'll look for them myself.

417
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,732
Could you please let me

418
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,943
look at your driving log?

419
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,861
My driving log?

420
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,745
These show where Minister Song went
and whom he met over the past 20 years.

421
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,789
Crosscheck the entry logs

422
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,667
with when Minister Song met Chairman Sung.

423
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,834
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,390
The hearing regarding
the Youngil Group slush fund

425
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,267
will begin soon at 10 a.m.

426
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,185
Today, Minister Song,

427
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,688
who is said to be directly involved,

428
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,857
will attend the hearing
as the witness himself

429
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,734
to explain his intentions

430
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,654
as to why he invoked
his investigative authority.

431
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,116
-Go easy on me today.
-Sure.

432
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,784
-Good day.
-Hello, sir.

433
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,619
Good luck, sir.

434
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,254
I'm excited to see what you prepared
at the expense of your chief of staff.

435
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,049
Good luck.

436
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,854
We must have it
before the hearing is over.

437
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,273
I'll try my best.

438
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,573
Yes, Chief Choe.

439
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,742
It's Kang Seon-yeong.

440
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,082
Let us begin the hearing.

441
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,837
"I, Song Hui-seop,

442
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,257
swear to only tell the truth
and nothing but the truth

443
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,426
regarding the slush fund of Youngil Group

444
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,387
according to Article Seven

445
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,682
of the Act on Testimony, Appraisal, Etc.

446
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,936
with good conscience and without deceit
before the National Assembly.

447
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,775
I understand that lying today
will be considered as perjury

448
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,235
which is punishable by law."

449
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,947
Minister Song won't ever

450
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,075
take that risk.

451
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,618
He will once we corner him.

452
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,122
What we're looking for
will be the smoking gun.

453
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,043
We need your help
to arrest Minister Song for good.

454
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,007
It could work if everything goes
as Mr. Jang plans.

455
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,634
But if it goes wrong,

456
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:02,889
not only him but the two of us
will also become criminals.

457
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,059
That is a risk both you, Chief, and I

458
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,061
must take.

459
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,775
As the Minister of Justice,

460
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,444
you invoked your investigative authority

461
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,738
to secure a thorough investigation
of this case.

462
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,117
Don't you think you ruffled some feathers
with the prosecution?

463
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,828
It's true that I was met
with some backlash,

464
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,123
but I only acted in a way
which seemed just.

465
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,583
Yes, I agree.

466
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,585
Thanks to your brave decision,

467
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,754
I believe we were able to

468
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,841
promptly arrest
and question Chairman Sung Yeong-gi.

469
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,384
Thank you.

470
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,137
It's like they're giving him
a medal of honor

471
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,596
instead of questioning him.

472
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,100
At this rate, what Mr. Jang says
won't even stir up a response.

473
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,354
Still, I believe that
he'll make something happen.

474
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,234
Mr. Jang, ask your question.

475
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,447
I am Jang Tae-jun of the Daehan Party.

476
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,282
JANG TAE-JUN

477
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,409
During your time as a prosecutor,
you were assigned

478
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,328
to a case regarding
Youngil Group's slush fund.

479
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,248
I'm sure you have
a close relationship with Chairman Sung.

480
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,208
Yes, we're acquaintances.

481
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,461
You two are more than mere acquaintances.

482
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,589
Right after investigating that case,
you resigned as a prosecutor,

483
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,299
and ran in the general election.

484
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,801
Wasn't it because of Chairman Sung?

485
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,388
One doesn't make
such an important decision

486
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,891
based on someone else's suggestion.

487
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,436
It was my decision to become a politician.

488
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,855
Once the revised bill
of the Tourism Promotion Act was passed

489
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,775
after you proposed it, a hotel of
one of Youngil Group's subsidiaries

490
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,569
was built near a historic site.
The bill allowing business reshuffle

491
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,654
led to Youngil Group acquire
its rival company.

492
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,115
That and many other bills you proposed

493
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,826
were to benefit
Youngil Group's operations.

494
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,079
Don't tell me you're still claiming
that you have no ties to Chairman Sung.

495
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,583
I say this on behalf
of my status as minister.

496
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,712
In no way have I ever
proposed a bill to benefit Youngil Group.

497
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,177
This is your secretary's notepad

498
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,931
which contains where you've been
and who you've met

499
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,183
for the past 20 years.

500
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,603
-What?
-Hold on.

501
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,230
Out of all the entries here,

502
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,942
we looked into the places you visited
which weren't for official business.

503
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,694
Restaurants, bars, golf clubs,
hotels, saunas and many more.

504
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,197
Here are when you visited those places.

505
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,492
Also, we looked into whether or not
Chairman Sung was there

506
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,411
or at least had a reservation
on those dates.

507
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,290
It turns out that
when you visited those places,

508
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,125
Chairman Sung also came by

509
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,169
on 84 occasions this year.

510
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,589
For the past few decades,
you and Chairman Sung

511
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,717
also flew abroad on the same date
on 72 occasions.

512
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,803
Even when all this evidence exists,

513
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:50,557
you'll still stick to your claim
saying that you're mere acquaintances?

514
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,142
MINISTER OF JUSTICE SONG HUI-SEOP

515
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:59,148
I understand how and why
you came to that conclusion.

516
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,986
If what you're suggesting is true,
however, why on earth would I

517
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,321
risk the backlash
from the prosecutors' office

518
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,449
and invoke my investigative authority
to have him arrested?

519
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,495
I only decided to testify
at this hearing today

520
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,665
because I deeply agree with the public
on the seriousness of this case,

521
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,293
and how it needs to be

522
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,169
put under the microscope.

523
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,756
Some baseless rumors

524
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,343
should not be used
to cloud the real reason for this hearing.

525
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,514
Don't you agree, Mr. Jang?

526
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,729
We will regroup after a short recess.

527
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,775
Bring Gwi-dong to me.

528
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,319
Yes, sir.

529
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,660
-How is it going?
-We're still looking.

530
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,002
DRIVING LOG, 2018

531
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,380
We need definite proof

532
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,883
that Minister Song and Chairman Sung
were together.

533
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,344
These driving logs aren't enough
on their own.

534
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,261
I know.

535
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,014
I'm after the bearer bonds
that Minister Song

536
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,682
received from Chairman Sung.

537
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,727
Once we have that,
he'll be out of options.

538
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,979
After suspicions
about the slush fund rose,

539
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,190
he probably moved the bearer bonds
someplace safer.

540
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,901
One of the locations
are written in these notepads.

541
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,861
That's what we must find.

542
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,076
I'm sorry, sir.

543
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,204
What is Tae-jun trying to find with those?

544
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,164
I doubt he thinks

545
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,833
my meetings with Chairman Sung
are the smoking gun.

546
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,961
-Well...
-What is it?

547
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,423
He said that he's after the bearer bonds.

548
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,053
Ma'am.

549
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,848
Here are the main points he visited

550
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,518
right after the slush fund case
made the news.

551
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,437
One of these must be
where he stashed the bearer bonds.

552
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,691
Send a copy to Assemblyman Jang
and Chief Choe.

553
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,442
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,029
-Mr. Han.
-On my way, ma'am.

555
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:13,992
Let's begin.

556
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,535
Got it.

557
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,388
He said that he's after the bearer bonds.

558
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,563
PROSECUTOR SEO

559
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,324
Hello, Mr. Song.
Chief Choe is up to something

560
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,744
with prosecutors
who oppose your taking charge.

561
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,413
He's looking for my bearer bonds.

562
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,123
They can't fall into his hands.

563
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,208
-Bring them to me.
-Where can I find them?

564
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,420
Okay.

565
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,636
Tell the chairperson to resume the meeting

566
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,514
-finish the hearing quickly.
-Yes, sir.

567
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,185
Tae-jun, that punk.

568
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,521
He's trying to chain me here,
so he can go after my turf.

569
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,523
That sly thief.

570
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,277
Mr. Jang, the meeting will resume shortly.

571
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,488
Also, the parties have agreed on

572
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,865
shortening the afternoon
Q-and-A session. What do we do?

573
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,201
Mr. Song must want the hearing
to be finished quickly.

574
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,827
Special Investigation Team.

575
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,954
We'll perform a search and seizure.

576
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,414
Let's start.

577
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,791
Don't leave anything out.

578
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,629
Mr. Song's office is being searched.

579
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,298
How is the hearing going?

580
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,467
It's about to resume.

581
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,886
Mr. Song would want to cut it short.

582
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,556
-Who are you?
-We're from Special Investigation Team.

583
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,975
We'll perform a search and seizure
to find bearer bonds.

584
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,519
Please cooperate. Start!

585
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,774
-No!
-Hurry.

586
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,402
It's Choe Gyeong-cheol.

587
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,365
I have something to tell you. Can we meet?

588
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,951
Assemblyman Jang,
you can ask one last question.

589
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,202
Are you aware of

590
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,288
the death of Mr. Go Seok-man,

591
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,916
who was Assemblywoman
Kang Seon-yeong's chief of staff?

592
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,963
Yes, it was very unfortunate.

593
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,842
Before his death, Mr. Go had information
about Youngil Group's funds.

594
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,345
And he died while bringing
the material to the office.

595
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,972
With that material,

596
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,142
there could have been an investigation
into the funds much earlier.

597
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,269
At that time,
the Western Prosecutors' Office

598
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,938
announced that no material
about Youngil Group was found anywhere

599
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,399
including the scene of the incident.

600
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,985
Concluding Mr. Go's death was a suicide,

601
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,487
they terminated the case hurriedly.

602
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,824
I'm wondering
if you ordered anything concealed

603
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,702
because of your relationship
with Chairman Sung.

604
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,037
I didn't.

605
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,497
Fine.

606
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,584
There's plenty of evidence for collusion
between you and Youngil Group.

607
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,502
When Mr. Lee Chang-jin,
CEO of Joojin Chemical,

608
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,297
died while being interrogated
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office,

609
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,841
you were also in the same building.

610
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,051
What were you doing there?

611
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,555
You told Chief Choe Gyeong-cheol
to transfer Mr. Lee's case

612
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,599
to the Western Prosecutors' Office.

613
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,059
Mr. Lee knew about Youngil Group's
slush funds and lobbying.

614
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,520
By having his case transferred,

615
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,647
did you want to keep him quiet?

616
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,357
Answer me.

617
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,735
Answer me, Minister Song.

618
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,863
Answer me!

619
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,916
KYUNGSIN SAVINGS BANK

620
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,715
KYUNGSIN SAVINGS BANK

621
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,593
Chief Choe, Prosecutor Seo took the bonds.

622
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,094
Okay.

623
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,559
JANG TAE-JUN

624
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,937
So we're running out of time.

625
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,272
Here's my last question.

626
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,815
Twenty years ago,

627
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,319
in return for covering up
the Youngil Group slush fund case,

628
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,781
you received bearer bonds
from Chairman Sung, didn't you?

629
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,493
Didn't you?

630
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,828
MINISTER OF JUSTICE SONG HUI-SEOP

631
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,750
Prosecutor Seo has secured all the bonds.

632
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,510
I didn't.

633
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,805
Assemblyman Jang,

634
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,306
please finish up.

635
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,599
Okay.

636
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,811
JANG TAE-JUN

637
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,313
Prosecutor Seo took the bonds.

638
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,690
Witness,

639
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,693
can you swear all your answers
to my questions today

640
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,736
were true?

641
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,613
Yes,

642
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,741
they're the truth
and nothing but the truth.

643
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,371
Now that all the questions
have been answered,

644
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,249
we'll end the hearing here.

645
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,126
I announce that the hearing is over.

646
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,753
CHAIRMAN OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
KIM JAE-MAN

647
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,391
Thank you.

648
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,101
Thank you for today.

649
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,438
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

650
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,189
Chairman, thank you.

651
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,858
-Let's go for a meal soon.
-Sure.

652
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,067
All right.

653
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,322
The battle isn't over yet.

654
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,450
This isn't the time for you to be grinning
like some victorious general.

655
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,869
Stop trying and get ready to be arrested.

656
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,789
I hope you didn't forget
how I made you the Minister.

657
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,460
I'm racking my brain
to figure out how to pay you back.

658
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,754
Then you must remember

659
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,758
how the former Minister
stepped down as well.

660
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,515
Look how happy he is.
He looks like a victorious general.

661
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,727
The fight isn't over yet.
He can't be a victorious general.

662
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,605
You returned empty-handed.
Stop spewing nonsense.

663
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,816
The audit for the Ministry of Justice
has just ended.

664
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,070
But Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office
found the evidence of a false witness

665
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,156
among Minister Park's statements,
and they plan on taking legal actions.

666
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,451
Minister Park denied the charge
that he periodically met the CEO of Bugang

667
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,371
and the chief prosecutor
to delay the investigation.

668
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,248
However, he had regular meetings
with them every month.

669
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,834
And it's been confirmed that
some young women accompanied them.

670
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,752
Make way.

671
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,473
Get out of the car.

672
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,600
-Get out.
-Get out.

673
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,227
-Get out immediately.
-Please cooperate.

674
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,478
Get out.

675
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,272
POLICE

676
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,952
It's on TV now.

677
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,580
A prosecutor was caught
in the act of concealing evidence

678
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,332
relating to a case under investigation.

679
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,836
The police found bearer bonds
worth of billions of won in his car,

680
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,131
which actually belong to
Minister of Justice Song Hui-seop.

681
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:29,427
The bonds turned out to be the same
as the ones that Chairman Sung possessed,

682
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,014
as was found during the investigation
into Youngil Group's slush funds in 2000.

683
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,184
At the hearing of the Youngil Group
slush funds case today,

684
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,188
Minister Song denied
any collusion with Chairman Sung.

685
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,608
His testimony has now proven to be false.

686
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,445
One of the locations
are written in these notepads.

687
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,029
That's what we must find.

688
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,407
But we won't be able to check
all the places.

689
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,743
We won't. Minister Song
will find it for us.

690
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,414
In addition, a question was raised
as to whether Minister Song was involved

691
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,750
in the deaths of Lee Chang-jin,
CEO of Joojin Chemical,

692
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,337
and Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong's
former chief of staff, at today's hearing.

693
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,882
The hearing was broadcast live.

694
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,469
The public is criticizing
Minister Song's perjury

695
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,305
and demanding a swift investigation
into Youngil Group's slush funds...

696
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,223
I can give you my driving log,

697
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,934
but Minister Song is
already suspecting me.

698
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,188
-If he finds out I met you--
-Tell him the truth.

699
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,356
Tell him that your driving log is with me

700
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,026
and that I'm looking for his bearer bonds.

701
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,737
What is Tae-jun trying to find with those?

702
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,740
He said that he's after the bearer bonds.

703
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,909
Lying to the Assembly

704
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,245
carries a sentence
of one to ten years in prison.

705
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,207
Since you're the Minister Justice,
I assume you know that.

706
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,964
Minister Song.

707
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,549
Did you receive bearer bonds?

708
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,967
Is it related to the slush funds?

709
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,594
You denied receiving bribes.

710
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,970
Do you admit the charge?

711
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,680
Is it true? Please answer my question.

712
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,516
-Say something!
-Minister Song!

713
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,267
One question at a time, please.

714
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,977
-Do you admit it?
-Answer me!

715
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,979
-Minister Song!
-Is it true?

716
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,898
-Don't push!
-Wait!

717
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,983
-Sir!
-Minister Song!

718
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,193
Minister Song!

719
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,446
-Say something!
-Sir!

720
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,293
Thank you.

721
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,880
I can finally put things right
thanks to you.

722
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,384
Thank you for letting me help you.

723
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,973
For once, I wanted to do the right thing.

724
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,648
When things settle down,

725
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,609
let's go drink soju together.

726
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,408
Tae-jun, I'll always root for you.

727
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,471
At the hearing of the Youngil Group
slush funds case today,

728
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,017
Minister Song denied
any collusion with Chairman Sung.

729
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,395
His testimony has now proven to be false.

730
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,022
When asked whether he received...

731
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,982
Everything's over now.

732
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,027
Are you really going to take
all the blame?

733
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,820
...Minister Song denied the charge...

734
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,990
This is your last chance
to remain a respectable father.

735
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,245
Let me make a phone call.

736
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,628
Seung-a, daddy needs
to go somewhere real soon.

737
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,343
No. Seung-a, keep talking in English.

738
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,931
No, Daddy isn't crying.

739
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,268
We'll meet again soon.

740
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,896
You have to study hard.

741
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,109
Daddy

742
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,653
is sorry.

743
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,545
Please schedule
a press conference in an hour.

744
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,256
How should I prepare the statement?

745
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,011
I'll do it myself.

746
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,390
I'm stepping out for a minute.

747
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,060
The money in the bank account
in my wife's name

748
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,855
is actually Minister Song
Hui-seop's slush fund.

749
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:36,150
I managed the fund
under Minister Song's orders.

750
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,360
The money came from

751
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,530
bearer bonds provided by Chairman
Sung Yeong-gi of Youngil Group.

752
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,283
I heard Minister Song received them
in return for covering up

753
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,618
Youngil Group's slush funds case
when he was a prosecutor.

754
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,996
The money is being used

755
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,582
to run a social club
called Samil Association.

756
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,461
Mr. Oh Won-sik reversed
his earlier confession

757
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,838
to accepting illegal funds

758
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,383
and revealed that the funds
belong to Minister Song Hui-seop.

759
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,888
Mr. Oh had testified
that he had received illegal funds

760
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,598
into his wife's bank account

761
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,059
and that this was unrelated
to Minister Song.

762
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,188
However, his testimony today...

763
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,023
To think these punks

764
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,818
who used to line up in front of me
for food are now pissing all over me.

765
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,405
I worked my ass off selling cows
to pass the bar exam

766
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,824
and climb all the way up here.

767
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:29,119
Who would've thought
I'd lose everything overnight?

768
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,625
I would've thought twice
before taking you in

769
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,961
if I'd known I'd get bitten so badly.

770
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,631
Don't think it's unfair.

771
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,050
It's you who betrayed

772
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,802
the people as well as me.

773
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,391
Remember I promised
I'd write your resignation speech?

774
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,144
Here it is.

775
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,156
Tae-jun.

776
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,327
Don't think it's over.

777
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,913
As long as I'm breathing,

778
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,833
you'll see me again in this world.

779
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:31,014
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

780
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,020
Youngil Group's head of security
got arrested while fleeing.

781
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,815
Mr. Go Seok-man's case
will be solved soon.

782
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,234
Thank you.

783
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,988
Ms. Yun Hye-won is at the Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

784
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,448
I'll come over
when everything's finished here.

785
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,450
Do you regret it?

786
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,913
Of course not.

787
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,709
No way.

788
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,256
The Blue House and
the National Assembly have agreed

789
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:07,759
on having Independent Counsels investigate
the bribery charges against Youngil Group

790
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,386
and Minister of Justice Song Hui-seop.

791
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,639
Independent Counsel Shin Il-hwan put
Chief of Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office

792
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,267
Choe Gyeong-cheol
in charge of the investigation team

793
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,228
and promised a thorough and careful
investigation into the large-scale...

794
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,522
The long battle has come to an end.

795
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,233
-I thought it'd never end.
-At the center of public attention...

796
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,151
Thank you.

797
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:28,196
Without you, I wouldn't have made it here.

798
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,824
The Ministry of Justice and the police
were requested to cooperate.

799
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,744
-I'm the one who should be saying that.
-Ten prosecutors

800
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,787
and up to 40 special investigators each

801
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,874
are expected to be appointed

802
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,752
within next week.

803
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,089
You can start the press conference
when you're ready.

804
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,674
Okay.

805
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:53,930
What press conference?

806
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,567
Tae-jun.

807
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,195
Are you giving up
on the legislative election?

808
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,119
Don't you know?

809
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:21,166
I don't deserve to carry this weight.

810
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,464
It's time for me to go back
to where I belong.

811
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,257
Tae-jun.

812
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,760
But you shouldn't give up.

813
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:32,969
You should run

814
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,847
in Seongjin City on behalf of me.

815
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:40,936
There, please make Assemblyman
Lee Seong-min's dreams come true

816
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,480
for me.

817
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:35,073
I'm holding this press conference today
to reveal the truth about the suspicions

818
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,908
raised against me.

819
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,870
All the allegations

820
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,707
made so far are true.

821
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,919
Regardless of its purpose,
what I did was against the law

822
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,505
and should be punished.

823
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,591
I'd like to apologize for

824
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,593
-You can go out.
-disappointing everyone.

825
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,764
Also, to take responsibility
for what I've done,

826
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:03,268
I'm resigning my seat
in the Assembly today.

827
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,565
I always believed
the end justified the means.

828
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,652
I always looked for excuses
to justify my actions.

829
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,738
Not wanting to admit regret,

830
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:18,241
I never let myself stop and look back.

831
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,702
After making mistakes that can't be undone

832
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,705
and losing a few people for good,

833
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:28,794
I've realized what tragic consequences
my wrong choice can lead to.

834
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,380
A world where fairness
and righteousness prevail.

835
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,841
A world where the weak are protected

836
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,427
and those who do bad deeds get punished.

837
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,386
URGENT TRANSPORTATION

838
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,847
-I believe creating such a world
-Move along, mister.

839
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:45,435
should begin with admitting my faults.

840
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,480
I'll renounce all my privileges

841
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,399
and cooperate with the investigation.

842
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:53,985
Let me

843
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,279
apologize once more

844
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,949
to everyone.

845
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,958
Mr. Jang.

846
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,381
I'm sorry, Mr. Jang.

847
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,550
For what?

848
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,344
For getting you wrong.

849
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,014
You once told me...

850
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,393
that I don't need to follow your suit.

851
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,938
You said I should act on my faith
if I want to survive here.

852
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,691
I will do that.

853
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,360
I'll be sure to survive here until the end

854
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,115
so that I can prove that you were wrong.

855
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,122
I wanted to apologize.

856
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,832
At first,

857
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,917
I just sought approval.

858
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,587
And there were times when I disliked you.

859
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,922
I'm really sorry.

860
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,675
I didn't know your real intentions.

861
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,886
Please do come back.

862
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,805
There are still people who need your help.

863
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,309
Also, I need you to teach me more

864
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,605
about what I should do here.

865
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,401
There's no one right answer.

866
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,654
Everyone walks a different path.

867
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,242
Just walk your own path, Do-gyeong.

868
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,870
That's all that matters.

869
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,250
Also, help Assemblywoman Kang a lot.

870
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,002
Okay.

871
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,463
You'll make a great chief of staff.

872
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,191
3 MONTHS LATER

873
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,486
In accordance with
Article 31 Murder by Proxy,

874
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,030
Article 33 Bribe-Offering,

875
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,867
and Article 365 Embezzlement
of Criminal Law,

876
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,870
along with Articles 2 and 3

877
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,498
of the Additional Punishment Law
on Specific Economic Crimes,

878
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,376
the court sentences Defendant
Sung Yeong-gi to 20 years in prison.

879
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,170
Next. In accordance with

880
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,381
Article 30 Conspiracy to Murder,

881
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,257
Article 34 Accessory to Murder,

882
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,134
Article 129 Bribe-Taking,

883
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,137
and Article 155 Destruction of Evidence
of Criminal Law,

884
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,516
The court sentences Song Hui-seop
to 15 years in prison. That will be all.

885
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,144
Dear Honor, this trial is invalid.

886
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,398
Your judgment is completely unreasonable.

887
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,858
Defendant, please watch your language.

888
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,777
Watch my language? What do you mean?

889
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,364
You just murdered
the rule of law in this country!

890
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,949
Defendant Song, lower your voice.

891
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,535
A sentence of 15 years in prison?
I can't accept it.

892
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,495
There's no evidence or principle.

893
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,289
You're nothing but a puppet
of the National Assembly.

894
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,916
This is political repression!

895
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,168
The rule of law in Korea is dead!

896
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,504
You killed it! You...

897
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,006
-Stop and sit down!
-Hey!

898
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,465
Order! You should know better.

899
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,092
-Show some respect.
-When I was

900
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,927
serving the country as a prosecutor,

901
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,972
you were just another poor law student
in Noryangjin, you punk.

902
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,766
-You're in court. Shame on you.
-You rude little imbecile.

903
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,351
-How dare you...
-Get him out!

904
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,186
You little... Get off me!

905
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,063
-Watch your language in court!
-Let go!

906
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,566
I know everyone in your alumni, you fool.

907
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,985
You're a piece of trash. Get out!

908
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,612
Seongjin is one
of the most contested areas

909
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,823
in the coming legislative election.

910
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,618
The approval ratings for
Candidate Jo Nam-gi of the Daehan Party

911
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,413
and the nonpartisan Kang Seon-yeong
are only three percent apart.

912
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,374
The final result is still unpredictable.

913
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,502
When are you going to stop
going on about Joojin Chemical?

914
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,212
You're getting in the way

915
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,382
of Seongjin's economic development.

916
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:48,011
The Joojin Chemical victims are
still not being properly protected.

917
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,221
The epidemiological investigation
isn't finished.

918
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,222
It's not going so well.

919
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,932
-Let's hurry.
-...development plans

920
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,642
seem extremely risky.

921
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,311
You frustrate me.

922
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,104
-This definitely shows
-Did you get it?

923
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,398
-your inexperience.
-Yes.

924
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,692
According to the opinion poll,

925
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,987
the majority of Seongjin citizens are
in favor of the development plans.

926
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,031
It's what the citizens want.

927
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:12,118
Candidate Jo has been emphasizing
the importance of development.

928
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,871
Candidate Jo argued that
the development of the industrial complex

929
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,957
will create a stable infrastructure
and revive the business district,

930
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,877
which will help boost
the economy in the city.

931
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,005
Candidate Kang, what do you think?

932
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,800
What if the development
puts the citizens in danger

933
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,803
while benefiting
a certain group of people?

934
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,097
What are you talking about?

935
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,182
It seems like Candidate Jo

936
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,268
purchased some lands near where
the industrial complex will be built,

937
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,937
as large as 3,000 pyeong.

938
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,023
Is that true?

939
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,151
I don't recall it.

940
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,115
A very long time ago, my late father

941
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,034
happened to...

942
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,622
By a sheer

943
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,083
coincidence...

944
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:05,421
Your mother's family purchased
nearly 5,000 pyeong of land as well.

945
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,967
-Is that a coincidence too?
-Well...

946
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,846
Candidate Jo, I ask you
to answer me here and now.

947
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,472
Is this true?

948
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,899
After purchasing contaminated lands
at cheap prices,

949
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,776
he plans redevelopment paid for by taxes

950
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,445
to sell off his lands at raised prices.

951
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,905
Is this really for the good
of the citizens?

952
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,324
Thank you.

953
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,201
Thank you so much.

954
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,538
Ms. Kang, the public response
is overwhelming.

955
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,957
I'm sure you'll win the next opinion poll.

956
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,335
That takes a load off my mind.

957
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,422
Thank you. I couldn't have done it
without you two.

958
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,257
Thank you for acknowledging that.

959
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,342
You always seem to choose
the difficult path.

960
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,220
No one else would've stuck by your side.

961
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,557
The reporters keep calling me.
Let's go do an interview.

962
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,185
Hello.

963
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,479
You saw it? Of course you did.

964
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,983
Chief Choe, you've taken on the huge task
of prosecution reform,

965
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:10,278
but public support for the prosecution
has weakened over the years.

966
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,280
Any thoughts on how you'll cope with this?

967
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,158
Many unfortunate incidents happened
in the prosecution lately,

968
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,702
but my determination remains strong.

969
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,538
I will make sure
the prosecution is not swayed by

970
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,123
political issues or outside pressure

971
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,126
and fulfill its duty
in order to regain public trust.

972
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,211
Thank you.

973
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,880
During the administrative investigation
into Joojin Chemical,

974
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,924
the prosecution arrested
one of its employees

975
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,593
for violating Prevention of Divulgence
Act. Are you aware of it?

976
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,055
Yes, I heard he's under investigation.

977
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:37,972
It's been revealed

978
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,851
that the company
fabricated evidence and reported him

979
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,186
to the prosecution

980
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,897
even though he took the data
following due process.

981
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,234
This is not the first time a company
has retaliated against its whistleblower.

982
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:53,279
Can you please tell me
your opinion on this matter?

983
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,161
The case you just mentioned

984
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,622
will be thoroughly re-investigated

985
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,626
to find out what was fabricated,
by whom, and why.

986
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,670
No one should be punished unfairly.

987
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:12,924
Excuse me now.

988
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,142
Ms. Yun.

989
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,021
How have you been?

990
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,190
What are you doing here?

991
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,985
Ms. Kang is on the Judiciary Committee.

992
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,319
I need to get some material.

993
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,738
I heard you've become
the head chief of staff.

994
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,656
Congratulations.

995
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,117
Well, it's only temporary.

996
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,953
If she loses the legislative election,
I'll be out of work again.

997
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,206
She's got solid approval ratings.
I don't think you should worry.

998
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,042
Please let me know
if there's anything I can write about.

999
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:53,047
Ms. Yun, why don't we
go for dinner together later?

1000
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,174
You still owe me one.

1001
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,010
I'm sorry.

1002
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,471
I'm meeting someone today.

1003
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,473
Who are you meeting?

1004
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,185
See you around.

1005
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,882
Here's the information you wanted
on Joojin Chemical.

1006
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,052
Thanks.

1007
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:44,057
I'm preparing a feature story
about Joojin Chemical's whistleblowers.

1008
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,059
The people who helped us

1009
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:50,480
still haven't been compensated
by the company and are being neglected.

1010
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,939
I heard that

1011
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,069
you suggested Ms. Kang promise
compensation to the victims.

1012
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,237
We started this.

1013
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,073
It's only fair that we see it through.

1014
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,076
You haven't changed

1015
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,703
a bit, Ms. Yun.

1016
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,958
I've quit being chief of staff
a long time ago.

1017
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,377
You don't need to be so formal.

1018
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,381
Then

1019
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,926
what should I call you?

1020
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,053
Well...

1021
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,306
Let's think about it.

1022
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,901
After the legislative candidate debate,
the approval rating

1023
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,821
for the nonpartisan Kang Seon-yeong
soared in Seongjin.

1024
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,323
Candidate Kang turned the tables
by revealing

1025
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,701
that relatives of Candidate Jo Nam-gi
purchased lands

1026
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,370
near where the building
of an industrial complex

1027
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,706
has been promised by him.

1028
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,958
Someone once said

1029
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,544
our society has become cold and dark

1030
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,879
and gotten used to others' pain.

1031
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,298
That's where politicians
should be present.

1032
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,429
He said that is the mission
of politicians.

1033
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,431
I will not give up.

1034
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,225
I will stand by your side.

1035
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,728
I will relieve your ongoing pain.

1036
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,981
I will create a better future
to heal your wounds.

1037
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,942
Please give me a chance
to keep my promise.

1038
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,570
I promise you

1039
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,321
a city where your family,

1040
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,823
where your neighbors

1041
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,158
all can get along in harmony.

1042
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,870
I will make Seongjin a city

1043
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,581
anyone and everyone wants to live in.

1044
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,167
Considering the little time left,

1045
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,628
Candidate Kang is most likely
to win the election.

1046
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,589
Oh, hello.

1047
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:44,385
-Thank you for making time for me.
-No problem.

1048
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,392
I'm wondering why the Chief
Presidential Secretary wants to see me.

1049
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:56,647
As you may know,
the President is in a bit of trouble.

1050
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,233
Many of the plans
he's been pushing ahead with

1051
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,818
are falling through.

1052
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,654
It seems the ruling party
will most likely fail

1053
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,742
to win the majority
in the legislative election.

1054
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,952
That's right.

1055
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,165
I'll be straightforward with you.

1056
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,796
Please come to the Blue House
aid the President.

1057
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,474
If I enter the Blue House after being
investigated by the prosecution,

1058
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,268
it'll cause quite a stir.

1059
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,521
We're prepared for that.

1060
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,649
We're also aware
that you had good intentions.

1061
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,400
But,

1062
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,694
why me, of all people?

1063
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,322
You can ask him directly.

1064
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,366
Ask who?

1065
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,493
The President

1066
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,162
chose you himself.

1067
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,041
He'll give you a call soon.

1068
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,710
Well...

1069
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,463
Thank you.

1070
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:38,165
One light can't light up the night.

1071
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:51,220
Deepening darkness can sometimes
only be fought with darkness.

1072
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:58,853
Yet I must keep my light alive
even in the dangerous darkness.

1073
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,650
As I wait for daybreak,

1074
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:11,115
I must keep shining my light endlessly.

1075
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,710
There is only one path for me.

1076
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,047
This is Jang Tae-jun.

1077
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:45,126
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
CHIEF OF STAFF SEASON 2
