THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,982
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,277
Doubt everything.

4
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,446
Trust the situation, not the person.

5
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,655
FOR OUR PEOPLE
WITH OUR PEOPLE

KOOKMIN PARTY

7
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,075
NO TO MEDICAL INCINERATION PLANTS

8
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,701
Don't show your weakness.

DAEHAN PARTY

10
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,914
Think and analyze at all times.

11
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,173
Don't make choices you'll regret later on.

12
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,341
HUNGER STRIKE, 27TH DAY

13
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,718
BUGANG ELECTRONICS LABOR UNION

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,307
And use all the aforementioned rules

15
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,810
to turn ideals into reality.

16
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,982
These are my beliefs as chief of staff.

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,615
Sir.

18
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,659
At the National Assembly,
there are 300 assemblymen

19
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,078
and 2,700 staffers who assist them.

20
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,248
Hello there, Ms. Kang.
Good morning. Let's go in.

21
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:09,003
This stop is National Assembly Station.

22
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,506
They're like the assemblymen's employees

23
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,508
whose duties deal with political matters.

24
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,722
The number of contract workers

25
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,267
-Chiefs of staff assist assemblymen
-makes up 17.7 percent.

26
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,103
-and draw up policies and bills.
-Only 3.9 percent...

27
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,314
I think "solution" will sound gentler
than "breakthrough."

28
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,108
-"Solution." I see.
-Yes, it'll sound better.

29
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,192
Okay, got it.

30
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,362
-Thanks.
-We also write speeches

31
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,948
for various events and press releases.

32
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,040
Hello.

33
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,625
-Get him...
-Listening to complaints

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,128
from various constituencies
and resolving them is also our job.

35
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,715
-Get him out right now!
-No, don't do this!

36
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,176
Our job has its own challenges, of course.

37
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,760
Say something!

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,846
-Wait.
-Go get him!

39
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,060
We have to go that way.
Are you blind or what?

40
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,396
Jeez, seriously. You idiot.

41
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,149
-Where's Tae-jun?
-Sir...

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,526
-Come back here.
-I can't get into the details,

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,613
but it's just like any other job.

44
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,575
I see. Then what's it like
during election seasons?

45
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,535
A year ago, Assemblyman Song Hui-seop,

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,997
whom you're currently assisting,
and Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,166
competed quite fiercely
for the floor leader role.

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,174
There was Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong,
who is supported by the ruling party,

49
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,134
as Assemblyman Jo's
running mate back then too.

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,989
Even if I get all the neutral votes,
it'll be a tie.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,533
If I lose even a single vote,
I'll have no chance at all.

52
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,911
No.

53
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,622
One vote will be enough.

54
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,793
I guess you worked on getting
the neutral votes over the weekend.

55
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,711
Too bad it won't work.

56
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,257
I'm impressed that he's made it this far.

57
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,968
If it hadn't been for you, Mr. Song

58
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,178
wouldn't even have been nominated.

59
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,889
You can cheer me up later, Ms. Kang.

60
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,766
It isn't over yet, you know.

61
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,104
Just one vote will be enough? Whose vote?

62
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,773
The party's ethics commissioner,
Mr. Lee Jang-su.

63
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,109
Article 22 of the party's
Code of Ethical Conduct.

64
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,193
DUI, bribery,

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,029
giving or receiving illicit
political funds, and the abuse of power.

66
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,241
Anyone who's been accused
of such conduct may be suspended.

67
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,535
That's right.

68
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,163
Eleven members of the Assembly
have been accused.

69
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,124
Nine of them are voting for Mr. Jo.

70
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,167
If their rights are suspended,

71
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,128
it means they won't be able to vote.

72
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,297
-That's correct, sir.
-That's right.

73
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,851
If that happens, I'll win by one vote.

74
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,644
Right? My gosh, you rock.

75
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,480
-I won!
-Song Hui-seop!

76
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,648
-I won!
-Song Hui-seop!

77
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,108
FLOOR LEADER ELECTION

78
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,092
Then last but not least,

79
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,888
may I ask you what your dreams are?

80
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,476
-My dreams?
-Yes.

81
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,068
EPISODE 1

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,409
Members of the ruling

83
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,870
Daehan Party are having
conflicting opinions regarding

84
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,206
the leadership system of the party leader,

85
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,540
who will be elected in February.

86
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,752
At the moment, the Daehan Party's
leader position is vacant.

87
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:21,214
There will be discussions about it
at the party's general meeting today,

88
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,383
but there will be disagreements

89
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,386
between Assemblyman Song Hui-seop,
the floor leader, and the higher members.

90
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,972
DAEHAN PARTY

91
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,266
-Oh, you're here.
-Yes, sir.

92
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,434
Don't worry about a thing.

93
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,269
There's nothing to worry about.

94
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,232
-I'll see you in a bit, sir.
-All right.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
The poll regarding the Daehan Party's

96
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,237
leadership election,
which was conducted yesterday,

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,657
revealed that Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong
was still the most-supported candidate.

98
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,160
Assemblyman Jo outdid the others
in all three criteria, which include

99
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,871
eligibility for the position,
approval rating,

100
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,790
and the likelihood of winning.

101
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,086
Jeez. Serving as the floor leader
didn't even help me for a full year.

102
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,881
These people keep switching sides
like reeds blowing in the wind.

103
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,299
Dear me.

104
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,862
I'm okay.

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,751
Hey, you're here.

106
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,795
Oh, you were home.

107
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,714
What is that?

108
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,009
I thought you'd like this.

109
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,094
-Shall we have some?
-Sounds good.

110
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,890
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
KANG SEON-YEONG

111
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,267
PROBLEMS REGARDING
BUGANG ELECTRONICS' LAYOFF

112
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,603
Did the interview go well?

113
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,147
Yes.

114
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,733
Thanks.

115
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,945
I didn't even do much.
I just put them in touch with you.

116
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,072
Don't say that. That's everything.

117
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,115
Congratulations.

118
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,117
You're famous now.

119
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,209
This is just the beginning.

120
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,752
You need to become more famous.

121
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,089
You deserve it.

122
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,016
Here.

123
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,726
Oh, here?

124
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,020
I'm running late.

125
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,484
I can't find the tie you got me.

126
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,862
Which one?

127
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,114
This one?

128
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,907
You want to wear this today?

129
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,620
The new town development bill that allows

130
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,039
the purchase of landfill sites
is causing quite a stir.

131
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,416
Today, Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong
is in the studio

132
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,084
-to tell us the details
-Thanks.

133
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,754
about some of the issues
that the bill may pose.

134
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,339
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,801
Many people are immensely interested
in the new town development bill.

136
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,386
What are your thoughts on it?

137
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,973
Many have been wanting and waiting for...

138
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,393
Let's go out for breakfast.

139
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,228
Mr. Song has a breakfast meeting.

140
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,814
-A breakfast meeting?
-With the Samil Association.

141
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,611
It's a social gathering
of former four-term assemblymen.

142
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,405
Do you have to go there?

143
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,033
It's an important gathering,
so I should accompany him.

144
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,785
-But still...
-What?

145
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,454
What can I do?

146
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,832
ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG

147
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,585
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,219
-I should head out now.
-What?

149
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,639
Did something happen?

150
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,349
I just need to get going.

151
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,892
I'll call you.

152
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,873
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

153
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,006
Election fraud allegations
have been made against

154
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,676
Assemblyman Song
during the floor leader election...

155
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,844
Sir.

156
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,304
We will now go live
to the site of the press conference.

157
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,764
What the heck have you been up to?

158
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,017
You're my head chief of staff.
How could you let this happen?

159
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,978
We'll begin the press conference
calling for

160
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,813
Floor Leader Song Hui-seop's resignation.

161
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,733
At the moment,
we do not have a party leader,

162
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,736
and Song Hui-seop, the floor leader,
is abusing his power and authority

163
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,613
to arbitrarily postpone
the national convention.

164
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,073
And using the nomination rights,

165
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,700
he is trying to disunite the party.

166
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,995
In addition,
there are allegations that he used

167
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,539
illegal means to be elected floor leader.

168
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,584
It is questionable
whether he is qualified as the...

169
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,254
She can't be doing this alone.

170
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,380
Who's behind her?

171
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,509
ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG

172
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:42,970
Yes, sir.

173
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,638
It's Mr. Jo Gap-yeong.

174
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,349
Jo Gap-yeong? Jeez, that prick.

175
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,352
He lost the election. Why can't he
just shut up and stay out of it?

176
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,439
Does that petty man have no shame or what?

177
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,357
Jeez, that vindictive bastard.

178
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,901
What is this mess?

179
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,236
He's causing internal strife
using a first-term member.

180
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
You should've taken better care of things.

181
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,575
What the hell have you been doing?
You made me look bad.

182
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,501
Gosh, you got it on my face. Watch it.

183
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,134
My apologies, sir.

184
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,875
Jo Gap-yeong has ties to the prosecution.

185
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,711
If they start digging,
things will get even worse.

186
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,713
If he becomes the leader of the party,

187
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,924
all of us will be screwed.

188
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,010
Tae-jun.

189
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,763
We should...

190
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,224
go to the Blue House together.

191
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,726
We can't be bogged down here.

192
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,196
Sir.

193
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,368
Please don't be too concerned.
What you're worrying about won't happen.

194
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,162
Yes, it shouldn't happen.

195
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,479
It's me.

196
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,648
Send the material to the prosecution.

197
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,031
You said Assemblyman Song
is creating a divide within the party.

198
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,741
Could you provide a further explanation?

199
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,286
At the moment, members who want
the convention to take place soon

200
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,122
and those who don't
are locking horns with each other.

201
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,292
As the floor leader, Assemblyman Song
is remaining silent without making

202
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,919
any effort to resolve the tension

203
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,712
in an attempt to create a rift.

204
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,924
So what is Assemblyman Song doing
to postpone the convention?

205
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,927
He's insisting
that the convention should be postponed

206
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,637
until we find a new data firm,

207
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,139
as the one we've been working with
for leadership elections

208
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,724
isn't properly equipped.

209
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,101
However, we can't accept his claim.

210
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,311
What the heck is going on?

211
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,648
I haven't seen that face in a long time.

212
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,067
What card does Mr. Jo have?

213
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,195
I have no idea either.

214
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,490
He just told me to get the word out,
so I rushed to hold the press conference.

215
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,284
You weren't involved in any of it, right?

216
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,328
It all depends.

217
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,122
If Assemblyman Song
continues to oversee...

218
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,208
We'll have another press conference later.

219
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,085
I'm not sure what it'll be about,
but be ready.

220
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,003
-I'll call you.
-Wait!

221
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,254
-Seon-yeong!
-Ms. Kang.

222
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,674
The reporters are coming.
You should leave.

223
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,175
This way, please.

224
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,552
Then I'll wait for your call, Ms. Kang.

225
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,644
-Yes, Mr. Jang.
-Who's in the office now?

226
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,689
It's just me and Ms. No.
How did this happen?

227
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,273
I'm looking into it. Where's Mr. Kim?

228
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,651
He's on his way back from
the Board of Audit and Inspection.

229
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,945
Which reporters are covering
Mr. Jo at the moment?

230
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,364
Kang Seung-wan at KTN,
Lee Jae-seok from International Daily,

231
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,907
and Kim Won-ho from Dodam Daily.

232
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,492
Contact them when Mr. Kim gets back.

233
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,910
-Where's his office?
-Hold on.

234
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,911
Room 605.

235
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,872
Reporters are flocking to our office now.
Just play dumb

236
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,209
-and give them a doctored schedule.
-Okay, sir.

237
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,719
Ms. No, send me Mr. Song's schedule.

238
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,636
Sure.

239
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,358
11 A.M. NGO MEETING

240
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,614
I guess Assemblyman Song isn't here yet.
When will he be here?

241
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,199
Mr. Jang isn't answering either.

242
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,285
-Where is he?
-Did you see the press conference?

243
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,536
Have you contacted him?

244
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,205
He's not back
from his breakfast meeting yet.

245
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,498
He may not know the situation.

246
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,877
-Oh, please. Don't lie to us.
-Will he be attending the council meeting?

247
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm sorry. I don't know anything.

248
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,050
Samcheong-dong. He's there now!

249
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,760
-Samcheong-dong?
-Samcheong-dong!

250
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,601
JANG TAE-JUN

251
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,228
"Head Chief of Staff Jang Tae-jun

252
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,273
faithfully assists
the floor leader of the ruling party,

253
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,610
Assemblyman Song Hui-seop,
in all of his legislative activities.

254
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,529
In addition, he has earned his nickname,
Autumn Viper,

255
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,033
by scoring a major scoop during
every state administration inspection."

256
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,284
Jeez.

257
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,119
"His specialties include

258
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,331
thorough data analysis
and policy development.

259
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,626
He is said to be the number one candidate
to be nominated for next year's..."

260
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,920
Gosh, do they think
the legislative election is a joke?

261
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,047
That obnoxious viper.

262
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,799
He's trying so hard
to climb up the ladder.

263
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,888
You startled me.
Don't sneak in like that, okay?

264
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,223
You're like a real snake,

265
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,933
slithering in here noiselessly like that.

266
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,518
Where's Mr. Jo?

267
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,895
Why are you looking for him?

268
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,979
You can talk to me.

269
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,940
It's not something
I can talk to you about.

270
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,735
You want to talk directly
to the assemblymen now?

271
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,905
You must think you're quite the big shot.

272
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,367
I don't know what kind of joke this is,
but you'd better cut it out.

273
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,451
A joke?

274
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,912
Did you come all the way here thinking
we were joking around?

275
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,918
You must really be hiding something,

276
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,297
judging by how you're roaming around
so desperately like this.

277
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,841
What's wrong?

278
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,260
Did you take care of some dirty stuff

279
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,762
when you got him elected the floor leader?

280
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,392
-Watch what you say.
-Why are you being so serious?

281
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,103
Everyone knows we take care of
the dirty stuff for the assemblymen.

282
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,356
Are you trying to act
like you're different or what?

283
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,859
My gosh, you're scary.

284
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,319
You guys should be careful.

285
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,363
You never know when this viper might bite.

286
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,158
Pass me the documents from earlier.

287
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,039
Be careful before you actually get bitten.

288
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,879
What's his problem?

289
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,009
Hey, you're just a chief of staff.
You can't become an assemblyman.

290
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,930
But Jang Tae-jun has a handsome face
and a great career history.

291
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,516
It's more than possible for him.
Don't you agree?

292
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,851
Yes.

293
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,270
You little punk.

294
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,105
Then what about me?

295
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,276
-Do you really think you're fit for it?
-You darn punk.

296
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,111
-What...
-Go work for Jang Tae-jun.

297
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,821
You're saying that again.

298
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,039
Hey, Da-jeong.

299
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,750
-Is no one here?
-No.

300
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,336
What about Tae-jun?
He won't answer my calls.

301
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,420
I don't know.

302
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,180
I knew the floor leader's office
would be different.

303
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,432
The fridge is completely packed.

304
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,104
This isn't a convenience store.

305
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,773
Drink your own beverages.

306
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,316
You're always doing this.

307
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,818
Your name means "kindness,"
but you're not kind at all.

308
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,029
Is that why your last name is "No"?

309
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,165
Da-jeong, there's...
There's a cockroach over there!

310
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,833
-A cockroach!
-Where?

311
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,294
Darn it.

312
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,465
Hey, Tae-jun.

313
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,092
-Just a second.
-I'm busy.

314
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,843
Come on. Just give me three minutes.

315
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,011
I'm busy too.

316
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,849
Where's Ms. Kang?

317
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,604
Don't look for her.

318
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,190
She can't help you.

319
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,277
She's in a pretty bad pickle herself.

320
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,695
Why?

321
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,656
Mr. Jo is trying to kick her out
and appoint someone else

322
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,908
as the spokesperson.

323
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,952
Who?

324
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,620
Kim Mi-jin, the announcer at KTN.

325
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,085
You're becoming more handsome
as time goes by.

326
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,712
That's nonsense.

327
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,383
Ms. Kang.

328
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,635
Say hello. You know her, right?
She's Kim Mi-jin.

329
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,471
Yes, I know her well.

330
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,349
It's nice to see you, Ms. Kang.
Long time no see.

331
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,144
Yes, it's been a while.

332
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,650
Isn't it obvious?

333
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,028
He's trying to get elected
as the floor leader

334
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,487
with the help of the press.

335
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,656
He's going to attend
this afternoon's press conference

336
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,575
so he can look good.

337
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,201
She knows a lot.

338
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,329
Isn't this a press conference meeting?

339
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,081
What's Ms. Kim doing here?

340
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,666
Oh, about the press conference...

341
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,878
I thought maybe we could do it
in the form of an interview,

342
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,756
with me appearing on the show
that Ms. Kim is hosting.

343
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,010
But wouldn't it be better for Ms. Kang

344
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,220
to give an official speech
in the press room?

345
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,805
Appearing on a TV show

346
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,100
will attract a lot more attention,
and it's better in many ways.

347
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,311
No one watches
the National Assembly Television.

348
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,896
Don't you agree?

349
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,568
You're going to do the interview yourself?

350
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,111
He won't do it himself.

351
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,946
If that's what he had in mind, he wouldn't

352
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,990
have asked her to talk
to the press this morning.

353
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,952
He needs someone to take the bullet
in case things go wrong.

354
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,789
You'll do a much better job than me.

355
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,584
And you look great on camera.

356
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,340
I don't have enough time

357
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,342
to prepare for the interview.

358
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,427
Don't worry.

359
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,138
I'm already in the process
of writing the script.

360
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,562
-I'll look forward to it.
-Of course, sir.

361
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,985
I guess you really can't trust anyone
when it comes to politics.

362
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,530
Ms. Kang worked so hard to make Mr. Jo

363
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,741
seem like a suitable floor leader.
How can he betray her like this?

364
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,161
Don't ever be like that in the future.

365
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,082
Ms. Kang won't be able
to fight back because she's so nice.

366
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,208
I'm worried about her.

367
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,210
FATHER

368
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,633
By the way, what did you do last night?

369
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,886
-You weren't even home.
-You came to my place?

370
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,265
My wife kept nagging,
so I thought we could have a drink.

371
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,853
You're like a stray cat.
Why are you so busy at night?

372
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,646
Something's fishy.

373
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,526
Do you really not know
what Mr. Jo has on you guys?

374
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,611
No, I don't.

375
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,073
That means it's something
Mr. Song did himself.

376
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,619
You must be really anxious.

377
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,584
Are you having fun?

378
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,545
Yes, I read the interview.

379
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,881
You came out nicely.
Not as good as me though.

380
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,051
But do you really want to run for office
even after seeing what I went through?

381
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,180
I spent every single penny I had
just so I could get that darn badge.

382
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,432
And I'm still paying back my interest.

383
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,102
It's not like you're rich,
and you have no powerful connections.

384
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:46,693
The least you can do as my friend
is support me.

385
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,324
Hey.

386
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,577
Eat that and cheer up.

387
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,371
You're not like me, so you'll make it.

388
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,874
At least one of us
should get to wear that badge.

389
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,543
You can do it, Tae-jun!

390
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,468
You've lost touch.

391
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,554
Things must be hard these days.

392
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,723
Was it your idea to use me

393
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,184
as cannon fodder?

394
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,937
What are you talking about?

395
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,814
It's what you used to do as an attorney
back when you hosted the show.

396
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,233
You gladly let me take over,

397
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,902
but our ratings are really poor
these days.

398
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,029
It'd be nice if you could help out
as a former host.

399
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,782
Be well prepared for the interview.

400
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,201
My questions will be a bit sensitive.

401
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,370
You're no longer in your prime,

402
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,789
so you might not be as quick
as you used to be.

403
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,043
I'm just saying this out of concern,
so don't be too offended.

404
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,630
Do you want to get into politics?

405
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,465
Or do you just want to beat me?

406
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,884
Because you're following in my footsteps.

407
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,222
It's both. I want to become like you.

408
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,642
Have you looked into why your ratings

409
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,310
have been declining?

410
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,772
I heard it's the broadcast's
main current affairs program,

411
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,440
so I had high expectations.

412
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,734
But it was no different
from the news I saw this morning

413
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,611
and the articles I read on my phone.

414
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,071
It was exactly the same.

415
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,240
I know you have scripts.

416
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,077
But you're hosting the show
with your name on the line.

417
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,497
Aren't you embarrassed
to read the script exactly as it is?

418
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,416
And as the host
of a current affairs program,

419
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,251
you should know political terms.

420
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,881
You should work on yourself
before you receive someone else's help.

421
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,217
Don't try to imitate me.

422
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,893
Mr. Jo!

423
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,357
The prosecution is on the move.

424
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,318
My goodness.

425
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,737
I bet taking Song Hui-seop's
right-hand man will hurt him.

426
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,031
Yes, it serves him right.

427
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,494
The Daehan Party held
an urgent press conference today.

428
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,165
Its insistence on the resignation
of their floor leader,

429
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,958
caused a huge uproar,

430
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,629
making the members of the party yell at
and make rude comments about each other.

431
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,507
We will hear about the details
from Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong,

432
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,344
the spokesperson of the Daehan Party,
at 8:00 p.m. tonight

433
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,054
on Kim Mi-jin's Current Affairs.

434
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,306
Mr. Jo is

435
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,808
planning to hold a press conference
after the show.

436
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,810
He might run for floor leader.

437
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,104
Well, that's going to be very fancy.

438
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,901
DETECTIVE LEE

439
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,444
Hey.

440
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,699
Okay.

441
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,243
I need to go somewhere.

442
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,955
Hello.

443
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,299
May I help you?

444
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,678
Hello, I'm Han Do-gyeong,
and I'm here for the internship interview.

445
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,808
Tae-jun, the prosecution started
a search and seizure.

446
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,103
Not just your current house
but the one in your hometown, too.

447
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,861
Sir.

448
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,490
The prosecution is apparently
searching Jang Tae-jun's house.

449
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,077
Darn it.

450
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,497
Tae-jun

451
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,749
isn't like himself these days.

452
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,085
I don't know why he's so distracted.

453
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,840
If you don't stay alert,
you end up harming yourself.

454
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,343
Darn it.

455
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,947
Mr. Song set the date himself?

456
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,615
Yes, he asked me to come today.

457
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,451
No one knows when he'll come.

458
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,911
You can either wait or leave your number.

459
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,998
No, I'll just wait here.

460
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,666
By the way,

461
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,918
is this true?

462
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,587
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG SUSPECTED
OF USING ILLEGAL MEANS

463
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,839
I don't know.

464
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,634
By the way, where is Mr. Jang going?

465
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,428
Are you acquainted with him?

466
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,472
No, not exactly.

467
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,975
I just respect him. He's my role model.

468
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,102
And I met him
during the first round of my interview.

469
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,188
Have you read this?

470
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,898
"Doubt everything.

471
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,399
Trust the situation, not the person.

472
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,776
Don't show your weakness.

473
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,736
Think and analyze at all times.

474
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,738
Don't make choices you'll regret later on.

475
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,325
And use all the aforementioned rules
to turn ideals into reality."

476
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,202
Isn't he so cool?

477
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,204
Sure.

478
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,084
Ms. Yun, I'll be at the secretariat
to take care of the expenses.

479
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,002
Okay.

480
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,854
Thanks to my competent son,
my house got invaded

481
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,814
by the prosecution.

482
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,989
PRESIDENT'S AWARD
LIEUTENANT JANG TAE-JUN

483
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,200
Gosh, that hurts.

484
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,327
Damn it!

485
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,373
What a joke. My gosh.

486
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,919
Hey.

487
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,298
You should go to the hospital.
I'll clean up here.

488
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,717
Why would I go to the hospital for this?

489
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,385
I'll just apply some antiseptic on it.

490
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,597
What are you up to these days?

491
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,891
What made the prosecution barge in here?

492
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,101
It's nothing.

493
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,688
How can it be nothing?
They made a mess of the house!

494
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,775
Is this why you quit being a cop?
So you can be a minion?

495
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,070
I mean, seriously. You graduated
the police university with honors.

496
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,530
But for what?

497
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,658
If your late mother saw you like this,

498
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,077
do you think she'd have been happy?

499
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,998
I'm relieved she never got to see this.

500
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,791
Why are you bringing her up?

501
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,003
Why? Are you embarrassed?

502
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,381
You should know your place.
You think you can become an assemblyman?

503
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,008
Did you forget why Mom died?

504
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,177
You wanted to run for office,

505
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,804
so you spent all our money,
including Mom's surgery fee...

506
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,015
What?

507
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,686
If you hate me so much,
why did you even come here?

508
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,104
Why don't we just cut ties?

509
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,482
You come over in three years,
and that's what you say?

510
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,402
If it was easy to cut ties,
we would've cut ties a long time ago.

511
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,239
What did you say, you punk?

512
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,419
-Hey.
-What happened?

513
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,130
I heard about the search and seizure.

514
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,634
Word travels fast.

515
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,011
If the prosecution is handling this,

516
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,013
they'll try their best to hunt you down.

517
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,848
Will you be okay?

518
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,142
Just a second.

519
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,603
Tae-jun, here's what you asked for.

520
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,149
You should be worried
about Mr. Jo, not me.

521
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,151
He messed with the wrong guy.

522
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,029
I'll call you later.

523
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,159
Hey, Aunt. It's me.

524
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,578
How have you been?

525
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,750
Well, the thing is,
Dad hurt his foot a little.

526
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,502
Can you take him to the hospital?

527
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,963
You know he never listens to me.

528
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,298
Please do me a favor.

529
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,026
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

530
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,831
Gosh, thank you.

531
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,466
I didn't know they'd search
your father's place.

532
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,759
They're trying to pressure me.

533
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,801
What do you plan to do?

534
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,763
It seems like they want to meet,
so I should grant them their wish.

535
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,016
Thanks. I'll call you.

536
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,896
Hello.

537
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,105
May I help you?

538
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,815
I'm here to meet Prosecutor Seo.

539
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,110
I'm Jang Tae-jun from Mr. Song's office.

540
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,575
You didn't have to come here yourself.

541
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,910
We would've come for you.

542
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,995
I got bored of waiting.

543
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,792
You're quite brave for a chief of staff.

544
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,668
Is it because you think
Mr. Song has your back?

545
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,924
Mr. Jang, you're being investigated
for bribery.

546
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,258
You mean you have suspicions.

547
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,803
Who's the informant?

548
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,096
The informant?

549
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,726
We're still investigating,
so I can't tell you that.

550
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,062
The prosecution carried out
a search and seizure

551
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,898
based on suspicions and a tip-off?

552
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,358
This is an urgent case,

553
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,193
and you could've tried
to destroy evidence.

554
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,945
You were a cop. You know how it works.

555
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,280
Is that why you looked into
my email, cell phone,

556
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,157
and even my social media account?

557
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,659
We just followed the procedure.

558
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,077
You probably investigated

559
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,995
everyone I called to find out
who bribed me.

560
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,415
Then I'm sure you also know
who these numbers belong to.

561
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,170
There are 35 journalists,
52 organization leaders,

562
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,132
and 172 assemblymen and assemblywomen.

563
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,593
You illegally investigated
all these people without a warrant.

564
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,638
And some of those numbers
belong to chief prosecutors

565
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,849
and Supreme Court justices.

566
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,935
What illegal investigation?

567
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,062
You investigated
not only my phone calls and texts

568
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,689
but theirs as well.

569
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,274
How is this not illegal?

570
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,944
Should I ask them
if you asked for their approval?

571
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,407
How do you think they'll react
once they find out about this?

572
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,161
-Mr. Jang.
-Put everything back to normal.

573
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,498
Then everything will go back
to where it belongs.

574
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,960
Have a good day.

575
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,463
Have a good day, everyone.

576
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,315
The prosecutor in charge and Jo Gap-yeong
went to the same college, right?

577
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,482
Yes, that's right.

578
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,778
Jo Gap-yeong, that jerk,
was trying to take away my right-hand man.

579
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,824
When did you find out
you were being investigated?

580
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,201
It's been about a week.

581
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,493
Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,871
I was going to tell you
once I took care of it.

583
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,082
Who's the informant?

584
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,751
We may have shut them up,

585
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,212
but we need to find the informant
to be safe.

586
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,422
This is a crucial time for me.
If you're not around...

587
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,675
Don't worry. I'm the informant.

588
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,688
Hey, it's me.

589
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,774
Send the material to the prosecution.

590
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,569
So you beat them to it
and threw the bait first?

591
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,613
They can't reuse their bait,

592
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,074
so they won't be able to
use the prosecution anymore.

593
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,701
But you could've gotten hurt.

594
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,620
If you want to catch a whale,

595
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,747
you're bound to get hurt
and break a few fishing rods.

596
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,292
He's not a whale. He's just a small fish.

597
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,128
Let's go have some rice soup.

598
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,047
You didn't even eat breakfast.

599
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,050
Let's eat together next time.
I still need to take care of something.

600
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,135
Okay, sure.

601
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,136
Sir.

602
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,600
Jo Gap-yeong, that little punk.
How dare he mess with me?

603
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,690
Thanks.

604
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,317
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

605
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,736
Okay, bye.

606
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,622
Yes, he's still too good to throw away.

607
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,917
Bye.

608
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,844
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG

609
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,521
Where are you going?

610
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,898
The broadcasting station?

611
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,276
Is it too much?

612
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,070
No, it looks nice on you.

613
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,406
You look great.

614
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,283
My gosh.

615
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,495
You always say
that kind of stuff so easily.

616
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,706
I'm serious. You look great.

617
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,458
You really do.

618
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,587
What's this?

619
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,298
Seoul Continental Hotel.

620
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,094
Mr. Jo is having a meeting there
regarding the legislation.

621
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,104
Will you be okay?

622
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,230
I'll be fine.

623
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,358
Just destroy

624
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,526
Jo Gap-yeong.

625
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,905
That will be enough.

626
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,000
-Yes, Mr. Jang.
-Hey.

627
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,002
I'm sending over meeting materials
and a bill.

628
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,338
Compare it with similar foreign cases
and analyze them.

629
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,007
LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

630
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,010
I'm taking a look at it right now,

631
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,970
and I think there's a similar bill
in Germany.

632
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,808
But it's going to take some time
to translate it.

633
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,601
I'll send it to you once I'm done.

634
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,065
Here you go.

635
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,527
-Thank you.
-Is there anything I can help you with?

636
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,070
I'll do anything you ask.

637
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,032
Can you speak German?

638
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,243
No.

639
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,662
Hey.

640
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,374
-Where's Mr. Jang?
-He's going to Mr. Jo's meeting.

641
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,961
What's he planning to do?

642
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,254
Da-jeong, coffee, please.

643
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,423
She went to the secretariat.

644
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,425
My gosh, why is she never at her desk?

645
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,303
Sir.

646
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,347
Would you like to drink this instead?

647
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,768
-Who's this?
-I'm Han Do-gyeong.

648
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,187
You were there
during the first round of my interview.

649
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,815
Oh, right. Thank you.

650
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,694
I thought he failed the interview.

651
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,571
I didn't see his name on the list.

652
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,698
Mr. Song asked him to come.

653
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,907
Oh, really?

654
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,078
-Give me the meeting materials.
-Here.

655
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,083
-Thank you.
-Sure.

656
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,835
Okay, then.

657
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,795
As I explained earlier,

658
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,340
the current bill calculated
the total contamination level

659
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,720
of our water, air, and soil.

660
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,598
And by calculating the
economic feasibility and preservability,

661
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,767
it aims to keep a balance between
environmental protection and development.

662
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,562
And thus, it is an excellent bill
that will provide a new standard

663
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,564
-for environmental development.
-I sent the email.

664
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,441
MATERIAL REGARDING
LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

665
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,111
POLICY MEETING
FOR LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

666
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,946
LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN GERMANY

667
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,074
Thank you, everyone.
Next, we will move onto...

668
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,410
May I ask an additional question?

669
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,540
No, sir! Time is up...

670
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,168
Does this bill conflict in any kind of way

671
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,712
with the Environmental Protection Bill
that was passed in 2005?

672
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,465
And I would like to hear your thoughts
on the economic strain

673
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,675
that will result
if this bill were to be passed.

674
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,387
Mr. Jo?

675
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,141
We have already
thoroughly reviewed everything.

676
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,394
-Yes, then--
-That doesn't seem to be the case.

677
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,357
This bill you're working on will be
hard to apply in real life.

678
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,944
Depending on the scope of its application,
questions about neutrality will arise.

679
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,197
Contamination levels will differ due to
the characteristics of the environment.

680
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,866
It'll also cause a dispute
among those who have vested interests

681
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,285
in certain facilities and areas
where the bill doesn't apply.

682
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,246
I would like your answer regarding this.

683
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,421
What do you think you're doing?

684
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,965
Why are you trying to ruin this?

685
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,634
You really crossed the line back there.

686
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,679
Mr. Song is a very lucky man.

687
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,683
He has you as his chief of staff.

688
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,226
Tae-jun.

689
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,980
What do you say to working for me instead?

690
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,566
There's no point staying on a ship
that's about to sink soon.

691
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,192
You'll just end up drowning.

692
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,986
My goodness, sir.

693
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,697
Now is not exactly the best time.

694
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,032
So how about after the inspection?

695
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,995
Thank you for the offer,
but you're a bit too late.

696
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,290
You should've made that offer
before making a deal with the prosecution.

697
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,416
What?

698
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,252
I couldn't bring you your gift
because I came here in a hurry.

699
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,588
But it's getting wrapped right now.

700
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,593
Prepare for the press release
regarding Mr. Jo.

701
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,179
Press release?

702
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,848
Mr. Jang.

703
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,058
What did he say?

704
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,810
He asked me to prepare a press release.

705
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,061
What press release?

706
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,814
What press release?

707
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,608
Sir.

708
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,028
You should be careful.

709
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,697
I may have shown you goodwill
during the last election,

710
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,699
but that won't happen again.

711
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,121
I am

712
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,665
very spiteful right now.

713
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,002
Hey, Tae-jun.

714
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,712
What...

715
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,548
Hey, wait.

716
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,674
Hey!

717
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,135
Find out what it is.

718
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,511
Yes, sir.

719
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,109
Yes, I came downstairs. I'm on my way.

720
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,444
Yes. I understand.

721
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,030
It's Mr. Jo's secretary.

722
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,074
I'll write the press release.

723
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,325
Yes, right.

724
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,619
Did you print out
the material regarding Mr. Jo?

725
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,620
One second.

726
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,040
-Put everything together for me.
-Do you have the statements?

727
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,583
Yes, here.

728
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,460
Hurry up. We have no time.

729
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,753
This one too.

730
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,798
Things look really serious.

731
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,966
I think it is about Mr. Jo.

732
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,426
-Send it to Dodam Daily too.
-Yes.

733
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,886
No. Yes, okay.

734
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,304
I understand.

735
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,280
Mr. Ju Gyeong-mun, the CEO
of Hamyeong Constructions...

736
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,449
As I told you before,

737
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,992
delete everything.

738
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,326
You have to delete everything.

739
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,713
There is something going on between
Mr. Jo and Mr. Ju.

740
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,799
Look over the list of sponsors
for Mr. Jo again.

741
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,179
And find out if his office
handed over any press releases.

742
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,350
Did Mr. Jo's office tell you
when they'll hand over the materials?

743
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,977
-Not yet?
-Da-jeong.

744
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,687
How many contracts with Hamyeong?

745
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,981
-I'm looking for them.
-And the list of Mr. Ju's sponsors?

746
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,858
-Yes, I'm working on it.
-Okay.

747
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,693
Yes, okay. Mr. Jang.

748
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,905
Mr. Jo's office hasn't handed over
any materials to KTN yet.

749
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,239
It must be working.

750
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,120
They'll find out soon enough
that we have nothing.

751
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,331
We can't fool them for long.
We must find the real deal.

752
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,959
-Where's the list of his sponsors?
-It just came from the Election Committee.

753
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,586
What about his subsidiaries?

754
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,754
I'm putting them together.

755
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,758
But we already looked into Mr. Ju's side
during the preliminary election.

756
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,636
Do you think we'll find anything?
He said he didn't know him back then.

757
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,806
There has to be a connection
since they are still in touch.

758
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,850
Let's dig up his donation list
and find out.

759
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,768
Yes, sir.

760
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,900
Hello, sir. I am Han Do-gyeong,
here for the internship interview.

761
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,111
Han Do-gyeong?

762
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,780
Didn't you drop him?

763
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,115
Mr. Song personally wanted to see him.

764
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,578
We need to have a meeting,
so have him wait in the lounge.

765
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,538
Yes, sir.

766
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,790
To the meeting room, everyone.

767
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,542
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

768
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,089
CONNECTION, DONATION

769
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,386
-Right here.
-Look at this one too.

770
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,512
Yes.

771
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,517
MR. JU DENIES GIVING MONEY
TO ASSEMBLYMAN JO

772
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,143
RECEIVED 30 MILLION WON
FROM MR. JU?

773
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,488
ILGANG INDUSTRY CEO JU GYEONG-MUN

774
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,199
SPONSORS LIBRARY ESTABLISHMENT

775
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,291
Okay, let's run a camera test.

776
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,753
Did you get the material
from Mr. Jo's office?

777
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,838
Not yet.

778
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,465
They haven't handed it over
to the TV stations either.

779
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,228
Ms. Kang, don't be nervous.

780
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,063
I will lead you.

781
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,940
Thank you.

782
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,790
None of Mr. Ju's subsidiaries
made a donation to him.

783
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,585
Everything they reported
to the Election Committee looks solid too.

784
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,171
Maybe Mr. Jo and Mr. Ju

785
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,714
really don't have a connection.

786
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,051
-What is it?
-Excuse me.

787
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,053
I was wondering if this might be useful.

788
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,387
TO MR. JU,
FROM JO GAP-YEONG

789
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,143
This is an autograph Mr. Ju received
at Mr. Jo's publication party.

790
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,479
It looks like they aren't strangers then.

791
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,564
-Where did you get this?
-Well...

792
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,901
Mr. Ju was involved
in establishing a library,

793
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,402
and he donated this to them.

794
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,905
There is no use
in finding out their relationship now.

795
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,615
That was published seven years ago.

796
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,368
That's before Mr. Ju became
the CEO of Hamyeong Constructions.

797
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,371
And we can't conclude he donated money
just because of this book.

798
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,331
Well, great work finding it though.

799
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,874
Is that so?

800
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,209
RECORDS OF PASSION

801
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,461
TO MR. JU,
FROM JO GAP-YEONG

802
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,546
Can you find
the employee list for Ilgang Industry?

803
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,966
Ilgang Industry closed down six years ago.

804
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,135
Bring me the donation list
for Mr. Jo from seven years ago.

805
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,221
Find everyone
from Ilgang Industry on the list,

806
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,098
call them to check
if they made a donation,

807
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,265
and if the amount is right.

808
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,266
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

809
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,520
What's your name?

810
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,106
-I'm Han Do-gyeong.
-Mr. Han.

811
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,651
If you aren't busy, please give us a hand.

812
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,611
Yes, sir.

813
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,574
Hello. This is
Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office.

814
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,576
-Did you work for Ilgang?
-Are you Mr. Oh?

815
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,287
-I'm calling about a donation.
-You donated money

816
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,457
to Assemblyman Jo. Did you work
at Ilgang Industry seven years ago?

817
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,793
-Yes, I see. Thank you.
-Yes. Yes, you're right.

818
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,211
-Are you Ms. Jang Ji-eun?
-I see.

819
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,964
-While you were with Ilgang Industry...
-Seven years ago, did you...

820
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,883
Hello. This is
Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office.

821
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,843
I found someone.

822
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,304
Director Lee Gi-su of Ilgang Industry
donated five million won to him.

823
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,725
Me too. Kim Won-jun of
Ilgang Industry donated one million won.

824
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,477
Mr. Jang. Lee Mal-nam donated 200,000 won.

825
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,730
Mr. Jang, Ji Sang-ah, one million won.

826
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,731
Ms. Won, 2.5 million.

827
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,066
-Mr. Jang, I found another one.
-Me too.

828
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,861
-Ms. Lee, 1.4 million.
-Ms. Seol, 2.2 million.

829
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,742
LIST OF DONORS

830
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,704
A total of 134 people
from Ilgang Industry.

831
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,832
It adds up to 147.5 million won.

832
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,752
These donations weren't made personally.
Their name was only used

833
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,628
to help the organization donate money.

834
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,757
It's illegal for a corporation
or an organization to fund a politician,

835
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,052
but this was seven years ago. The statute
of limitations has expired. Now what?

836
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,553
If they're still in touch,

837
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,056
it means he gave him more funds
that we don't know about.

838
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,810
Send a fax to Mr. Jo's office
in five minutes.

839
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,895
Let's see how they react.

840
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,563
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

841
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,482
Send me the reporters' numbers.

842
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,275
-Check the assemblymen's list.
-Yes, sir.

843
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,360
-Did you check everything?
-I'm on it.

844
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,790
What? Are you here to apologize?

845
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,834
Ta-da.

846
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,255
"Assemblyman Song exposed
for buying his place in office."

847
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,257
What are you going to do?

848
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,386
Let's see. What time is it?

849
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,805
Goodness.

850
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,057
You're too late.

851
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,184
Hey, can you print

852
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:47,187
-about 15 copies of the press release?
-Yes, sir.

853
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,980
Do you think such a rumor
will do any damage?

854
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,528
This is just the bait, man.

855
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,697
This is the real deal.

856
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,617
Ta-da. What do you think this is?

857
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,661
Try to guess.

858
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,621
This USB

859
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:08,834
contains information on everything
that you guys did.

860
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,962
Do you smell that?

861
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,881
Gosh, something smells really fishy,
doesn't it?

862
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,217
Your boss did a lot of bad things

863
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,970
to become the floor leader of the party.

864
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,805
You knew everything, didn't you?

865
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:22,764
No.

866
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,976
This... This was all your doing, right?

867
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,478
You brat. You're so cheap.

868
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,151
-Send the press release to the TV station.
-Yes.

869
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,152
I need a new tie.

870
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,195
-This color doesn't suit me.
-Yes.

871
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:40,407
Hey, you should go prepare
the counterstatement.

872
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,201
-You have no time to be here.
-You should give this another thought.

873
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,412
I'm just worried about your safety.

874
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,331
Goodness. I don't think you're
in a position to worry about him.

875
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,668
Position doesn't matter when worrying
about someone who's in a shithole.

876
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,878
Watch what you say.

877
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,045
Hey, Tae-jun.

878
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,799
If I gave you a chance,
you should have taken it.

879
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,759
I think there is a misunderstanding.

880
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,012
This time, I'm giving you a chance, sir.

881
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,597
Hey, Tae-jun!

882
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,355
This is your last chance. Take it.

883
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,901
Stop bluffing.

884
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,237
What is this? What? A love letter?

885
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,282
Goodness, unbelievable.

886
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,366
What? What is it?

887
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,951
What is it?

888
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,218
Make your decision.

889
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,678
You don't have much time.

890
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,812
Send the press release to the reporters.

891
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,023
You jerk!

892
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,361
You arrogant jerk.

893
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,948
How dare you threaten
an incumbent assemblyman?

894
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,123
What should I do, sir?

895
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,927
What are you talking about?

896
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,640
Hey. Put the National Assembly TV
on the monitor.

897
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,850
Yes. Please put NATV on the monitor.

898
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,731
I have listened to the opinions
of many different people

899
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:42,237
regarding my running for the election
to become the representative of my party.

900
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:46,574
And today, after much thought,

901
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,160
I decided

902
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,122
-not to run for the election.
-What?

903
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,378
Although I will not be running,

904
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,171
I will continue to work as a member

905
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,634
in creating the conditions for our party
to bring forth innovation,

906
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,680
and continue to do my best on duty.

907
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,516
Sir, why are you suddenly
giving up on the election?

908
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,184
-What is the reason?
-Are you giving up

909
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,603
-because of Assemblyman Song?
-Can you say a word

910
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,856
-to your supporters?
-Why are you resigning?

911
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,232
Why is he doing this?

912
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,026
-What the heck?
-Is this a joke?

913
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,111
To some people, this may be good news.

914
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,070
To others...

915
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,405
What about our program?

916
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,907
What do you think?
Air the substitute program.

917
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,451
Air the substitute program.

918
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,037
Ms. Kang, let us go.

919
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,872
Shall we?

920
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,792
All your effort was for nothing.

921
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,295
See you around.

922
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:44,466
I worked harder than anyone else
in this party to this day.

923
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,218
From now on, I will work even harder...

924
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:56,853
What is the role

925
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,607
of art in our society?
For a long time, art was

926
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,401
regarded as something
only for the rich and powerful.

927
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,030
However, in this modern day,
from the dishes we put on our food...

928
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,700
That was a good blow.

929
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,494
Great work.

930
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,079
Are you all right?

931
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:14,996
This?

932
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,207
I'm fine. Great work.

933
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,753
-Great work.
-Great job.

934
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,652
The doors are closing.

935
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,686
What's with your lips?

936
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,313
It's an honorable scar.

937
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,774
It's pretty sexy.

938
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,529
Thank you for your help today.

939
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,655
No, I should thank you.

940
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,325
I felt much better today thanks to you.

941
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,661
Really?

942
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,749
Do you know why the elevators
in this building are great?

943
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,084
Why?

944
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,631
They don't have any security cameras.

945
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,807
Thank you so much for today.

946
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,810
The doors are opening.

947
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,458
PROUD FLESH OINTMENT

948
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,395
-Goodness, you should go now.
-Yes.

949
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,730
Go on.

950
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,024
People will misunderstand us
if they see this. Go inside.

951
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,318
-Goodness, sure.
-Goodbye.

952
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,570
-Goodbye.
-Yes, see you tomorrow.

953
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,490
Man, those fools are sucking up to me.

954
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,620
-What about Jo Gap-yeong's material on me?
-They have been destroyed.

955
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,248
I see. Goodness.

956
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,500
I put in so much work over the past year.

957
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,670
Who the hell is
trying to mess everything up?

958
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,423
Find out who gave the information
to Jo Gap-yeong.

959
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,717
Yes, sir. And...

960
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,220
what should I do about him?

961
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,179
Who?

962
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,645
-What's your name?
-I am Han Do-gyeong.

963
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,899
We finally got someone talented.

964
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,778
Do-gyeong, come to work starting tomorrow.

965
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,280
Yes, thank you.

966
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,162
Goodbye.

967
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,248
Yes. Go inside.

968
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,542
Thank you. See you tomorrow!

969
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:28,958
Come in.

970
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,503
It's about time you were introduced.

971
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,505
I...

972
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,132
Come in.

973
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,406
-I'm late.
-Goodness, hello.

974
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,158
Come in.

975
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,706
Hey, Mr. Jang.

976
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,169
Hello.

977
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,546
I am Jang Tae-jun.

978
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,125
Gosh, I've only seen this on TV before.
This is so cool.

979
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,627
You're asking your intern
to steal stuff now?

980
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,753
Imagine the look

981
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,339
on Song Hui-seop's face
when he sees him at the audit.

982
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,008
It means you give dangerous jobs
to the laborers of a subcontractor.

983
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,885
Your time is up. You must stop.

984
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,471
Jo Gap-yeong, that dumb punk,

985
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,432
came up with a smart move this time.

986
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,891
We need to do something.

987
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,727
You'll be bored during your long flight.

988
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,603
You should read this on the plane.

989
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,399
If I want something,
I should take the necessary risks.

990
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,450
