1
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,521
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,940
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:10,904
Politicians must be present
in this dark and cold society of ours.

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,701
We must charge toward the darkness
and become the source of light.

5
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,331
That is the purpose and mission

6
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,713
of politicians.

7
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,650
Both you

8
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,902
and I

9
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,073
should get elected as an assemblyman
with a badge on our chest

10
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,575
and walk in there triumphantly!

11
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,621
A fair, corruption-free nation!

12
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,707
A country
where all of its people can prosper!

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,544
Let's work together
to create such a world!

14
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,130
Yes!

15
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,632
Like you said,

16
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,636
let's make a change in this world!

17
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,347
-Let's make a change!
-Let's make a change!

18
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,474
Let's make a change!

19
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,779
Hello... Hello?

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,282
Damn it.

21
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,440
I wanted to become the source of light

22
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,818
in this dark and cold society of ours.

23
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,572
However,

24
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,576
I'm still stuck in the darkness.

25
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,253
JANG TAE-JUN

26
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,798
Tae-jun.

27
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,926
-Seong-min.
-Tae-jun.

28
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,887
You don't need to go to the prosecution.

29
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,056
What do you mean?

30
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,768
And there's no need to feel sorry.

31
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,605
I knew everything.

32
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,066
What do you mean you knew everything?

33
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,652
Seong-min.

34
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,281
When I was about to withdraw my candidacy
because I was short on the fund,

35
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,742
Assemblyman Jo Nam-gi withdrew
from the race due to his bribery scandal.

36
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,369
And my ratings went up.

37
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,497
After that, I received a donation.

38
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,543
That's when I figured out
that you were behind it, Tae-jun.

39
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,424
I shouldn't have accepted the donation.

40
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,343
But I wanted the money,

41
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,432
so I pretended that I didn't know.

42
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,434
Then keep pretending to the end!

43
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,853
I created this mess, so I'll clean it up!

44
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,230
There's a long list of politicians
who get illegal funds,

45
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,398
and they sleep just fine!

46
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,776
Damn it. It was a mere 50 million won.

47
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,237
What did we do with that chicken feed?

48
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,324
We used it to feed our campaign staff
who worked their butts off day and night!

49
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,451
And we barely managed
to pay for the printing.

50
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,202
Just turn a blind eye for a second.

51
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,455
Turn a blind eye to this just this once!

52
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,959
If I turn a blind eye once, I won't
be able to see the world clearly again.

53
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,962
I'm ashamed.

54
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,468
I'm ashamed.

55
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,220
Damn it.

56
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,390
Who will believe me
when I talk about what's fair and just?

57
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,268
Tae-jun.

58
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,898
I'll take responsibility for everything.

59
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,986
Don't give up like me.

60
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,865
You are...

61
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,621
stronger than I am.

62
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,677
Let's not do anything
that we'll end up regretting.

63
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,766
I've already walked down that path,
so I know it will make you feel uneasy.

64
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,268
I never regret anything.

65
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,396
Everyone regrets a thing or two
as they live their lives.

66
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,942
You and I aren't as great
as we'd hope to be.

67
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,881
EPISODE 9

68
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,135
-How does that make sense?
-What's this?

69
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,554
Assemblyman Jeong,
please take your seat now.

70
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,682
Everyone, quiet down!

71
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,601
A change in personnel must be helpful
in operating the country.

72
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,604
It shouldn't be an obstacle.
Nominee Song must resign voluntarily.

73
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,189
If you think he's unfit,

74
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,692
you can include your opinion
in the hearing report.

75
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,610
You can't refuse
to approve it so unreasonably.

76
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,113
Excuse me? We're not the one
being unreasonable here.

77
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,699
You're trying to approve it
when we're against it.

78
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,783
Isn't that unreasonable?

79
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,453
Listen. I'm trying to discuss
this matter in a civil manner.

80
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,496
Please stop twisting my words!

81
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,957
You're saying you'll approve it
regardless of our objection!

82
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,792
When did I say that?

83
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,295
That's what you were basically saying!
It's the same thing!

84
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,130
Everyone, quiet down.

85
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,215
Everyone, take your seats!

86
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,967
We'll adjourn for now.

87
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,385
CHAIRPERSON LEE SANG-GUK

88
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,851
I apologize for the wait.

89
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,020
How did it go?

90
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,939
The opposition party
is showing their disapproval.

91
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,819
They are probably just throwing a tantrum
to get something they want.

92
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,823
I believe it has to do
with the upcoming by-election.

93
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,285
Try to appease them by telling them
that I'll help them out later.

94
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,412
I can't let them hold me back, you know.

95
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,916
Okay. I'll relay the message.

96
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,879
This is so sweet.

97
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:34,889
IT'S LIKELY ASSEMBLYMAN SONG
WILL PASS THE HEARING

98
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,813
SNOOZE
STOP

99
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,654
RECENT CALLS

100
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,947
MS. YUN

101
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,241
Ms. Yun, I saw the news about Mr. Jang.

102
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,201
I called you because I was worried.

103
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,620
Please call me back when you're available.

104
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,098
You stayed up late last night.

105
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,516
I guess things are busy at work.

106
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,018
Yes, a bit.

107
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,853
This is breaking news.

108
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,022
Assemblyman Lee Seong-min,
who was being suspected

109
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,899
of having accepted
an illegal campaign fund,

110
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,443
-has committed suicide last night.
-Oh, dear.

111
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,988
-Poor guy.
-Assemblyman Lee threw himself off

112
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,156
the rooftop of his office building

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,325
-which is located in Seongjin.
-Mr. Lee is dead.

114
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,451
-The paramedics said
-What?

115
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,496
Assemblyman Lee was transported
to a hospital and received surgery,

116
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,249
but unfortunately, he passed away.

117
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,210
The police had found his clothes,

118
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,546
-Yes, Ms. Kang.
-ID, and suicide note on the scene.

119
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,009
In the suicide note, he confessed
to having received

120
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,677
-an illegal campaign fund.
-Yes, Mr. Park.

121
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,429
I just received the call.

122
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,639
-Which news outlet is this?
-I'll have it checked.

123
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,935
Assemblyman Lee also wrote
that he was sorry to his family.

124
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,188
The police have concluded
the cause of death as suicide

125
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,773
-for the time being.
-What's going on?

126
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,651
They won't perform an autopsy
by the request of the bereaved family.

127
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,528
Assemblyman Lee's body

128
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,239
has been moved to the morgue
at Seongjin General Hospital.

129
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,325
And his funeral will be held soon.

130
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,870
However, the details of his funeral
are still being discussed.

131
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,997
This is the end of breaking news.

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,081
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP

133
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,100
-You can put him here.
-Okay.

134
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,189
-Can you get me a towel from the bathroom?
-Okay.

135
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,490
How is everyone responding to this?

136
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,201
They are shocked
at the news of Mr. Lee's death.

137
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,869
And they're shooting their mouths off

138
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,663
about whether he really took
illegal campaign funds or not.

139
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,165
But as you know,
Mr. Lee would never do that.

140
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,876
Do you know anything about this?

141
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,462
No.

142
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,299
I'll get going then.

143
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,205
It's difficult for the flowers to bloom,

144
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,584
but it only takes a moment to wither away.

145
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,962
My goodness.

146
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,427
SEONDAN PHARMACY

147
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,448
You said nothing would happen to him.

148
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,659
What is this?

149
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,453
How could this happen?

150
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,123
You said nothing would happen to him...

151
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,089
-Seo-gyeong!
-Mom!

152
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,423
-Mom! Oh, no.
-Oh, dear.

153
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,717
Mom.

154
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,220
How dare you show your face around here?

155
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,764
You should've kept your dirty hands
to yourself!

156
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,140
How dare you come here?

157
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,643
Get out. Get out of here, you bastard!

158
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,104
Get out!

159
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,023
-Get out, you bastard!
-Don't do this!

160
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,609
Stop it. We are all sad.

161
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,903
Stop it. That's enough.

162
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,135
CHAIRPERSON LEE SANG-GUK
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP

163
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,721
We don't need them. Take them back.

164
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,806
That's not something we can decide.

165
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,016
Get them out of here!

166
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,561
Our job is only to deliver them.
If you really don't want them...

167
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,025
Mr. Lee wanted to have a small funeral.

168
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,276
I appreciate the thought,

169
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,820
-but please take them back.
-Look.

170
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,698
We may argue against each other
in the National Assembly,

171
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,701
but I ought to give him a proper farewell
to bid goodbye.

172
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,077
Don't turn down my compassion.

173
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,538
Let's go.

174
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,824
This way is to the cafeteria.

175
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,926
You look terrible.

176
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,386
Eat up.

177
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm sad for the deceased,
but you must go on with your life.

178
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,933
How dare you attend his funeral?

179
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,731
Ms. Kang, hatred is another form
of affection.

180
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,275
Of course I should bid goodbye to Mr. Lee.

181
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,653
Right, Tae-jun?

182
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,956
One of my friends hated yukgaejang.

183
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,457
He'd never have it

184
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,710
even when I told him,
saying he might be possessed.

185
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,213
He said the red broth
reminded him of blood.

186
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,510
And he left this world
before he turned 50.

187
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,303
He was indeed one of a kind.

188
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,847
Goodness, he never had a chance

189
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,225
to fulfill his dream in this world.

190
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,353
Oh, dear. It was indeed a futile life.

191
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,862
You can only keep your beliefs
and survive as a politician

192
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,572
when you have power.

193
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,074
In politics, you cannot survive

194
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,660
by only keeping
some petty notion of your pride.

195
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,746
I'm sure you know that better
than anyone, Tae-jun.

196
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,374
Mr. Lee did not belong to this world
to begin with.

197
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,547
It's time for your appointment
with the Chief Presidential Secretary.

198
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,633
My gosh, yukgaejang tastes good

199
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,552
when you bring it to a full, rolling boil.

200
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,636
This one is a bit bland.

201
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,143
Ms. Kang, can you pass me the tissue?

202
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,396
FUNERAL HALL

203
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,815
Please say a word to the deceased.

204
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,317
What was your relationship with him?

205
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,694
-A word to the bereaved family.
-Will his death

206
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,946
affect your appointment
as the Minister of Justice?

207
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,369
Do you think your line of questioning
is appropriate at this time?

208
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,247
We must show our condolences
to the deceased

209
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,958
even if it means we stop running
the National Assembly for a while.

210
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,462
The late Assemblyman Lee Seong-min
got into politics to lend a hand...

211
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,547
to the weak in this country.

212
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,510
We must remind ourselves once again
of his dedication to the people.

213
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,220
And I would like

214
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,265
to offer my sincerest condolences
to the bereaved family.

215
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,270
All right. Please let him pass through.

216
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,024
Please share a word.

217
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,239
Sir, let's get rid of Tae-jun now.

218
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,407
Take your time.

219
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,451
If we give him time,
we don't know what he'll do.

220
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,412
Even so, we should leave him alone
until the funeral is over.

221
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,623
Every funeral needs a chief mourner.

222
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,377
I'll tell Prosecutor Seo
to keep an eye on him.

223
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,296
We should go.

224
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,234
Okay, fine.

225
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,780
Fight until the very end.

226
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,451
Instead,

227
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,329
I'm also going to do my best to stop you

228
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,749
and keep my place.

229
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,422
You understand that, right?

230
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,802
Right?

231
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,363
How could you do this?

232
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,372
So what if you got your hands
a little dirty?

233
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,793
No one is morally perfect.

234
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,424
Those who don't even have
an ounce of shame

235
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,636
are laughing, hiding behind the law.

236
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,096
So why...

237
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,934
What are you doing here?

238
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,850
This badge...

239
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,020
How much do you think this is worth?

240
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,193
I didn't come this far
just to wear this badge on my chest.

241
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
It's not like you knew this would happen.

242
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,617
Can I really say I didn't know?

243
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,288
This is all my fault.

244
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,213
I made this happen.

245
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,299
I used Assemblyman Lee.

246
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,597
I'm too ashamed to even apologize to him.

247
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,062
No.

248
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,857
It's not true.

249
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,694
Don't beat yourself up.

250
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,993
We don't have time.

251
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,579
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

252
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,205
Mr. Song...

253
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,293
I must trample all over him
before he becomes a minister

254
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,004
so that he can never rise up again.

255
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,510
Oh, dear. You passed away
at such a young age.

256
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,357
Ms. Kang.

257
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,653
You're really something.
You had the audacity to come here.

258
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,365
I mean, didn't Mr. Lee
end up like this because of you?

259
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,744
You should've known when to stop.
Going overboard always causes problems.

260
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,120
Why didn't you know better?

261
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,255
Yes?

262
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,343
POLICE STATION

263
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,976
INCIDENT REPORT: THEFT

264
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,395
She got caught
while trying to steal from a toy crane.

265
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,482
I asked for her guardian's number,
and she gave me Ms. Kang's information.

266
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,193
The machine got damaged,
but she'll be released

267
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,403
-if you can settle with the owner.
-I'll do that.

268
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,656
Then I'll contact the owner.

269
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,657
Sure.

270
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,998
When did you leave the hospital?

271
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,797
Why did you check out so soon?
You should've gotten some rest.

272
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,590
You might ruin your health.

273
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,181
I'll call the center.
Stay there for the time being.

274
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,726
Hello. This is Go Seok-man,
Assemblywoman Kang's chief of staff.

275
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,104
Is the administrator there?
I'd like to speak to her.

276
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,313
I can't go there now.

277
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,983
The administrator told me
you caused trouble and ran away.

278
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,193
I'll have a talk with her,
so just go back there.

279
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,113
I was told I can't stay there anymore
because I'm no longer a mom.

280
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,158
You're no longer a mom? What do you mean?

281
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,076
I got an abortion.

282
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,340
Ms. Kang, is it true
that you helped Su-min get an abortion?

283
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,430
She was in critical condition,
so I had no choice.

284
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:38,018
If people find out about this,
it'll definitely turn into a problem.

285
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,895
The media talking about it is one thing,

286
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,106
but you may also end up
receiving a criminal penalty.

287
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,652
-I'm aware of that.
-Then why did you do that?

288
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,079
Do you know any place
where Su-min can stay?

289
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,540
I'll look for a place.

290
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,501
For now, just pretend
you know nothing about this.

291
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,129
-I'll take care of everything.
-Thank you.

292
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,968
Hello.

293
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,137
-You made it, sir.
-My gosh.

294
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,805
-I'm glad you came.
-Let's sit.

295
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,848
Have a seat.

296
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,644
Let's be honest here.
He died because he received the money.

297
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,646
Otherwise, why did he take his own life?

298
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,398
-We don't know that for certain.
-What can be firmer proof than this?

299
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,193
The prosecution would've brought
the truth out into the open,

300
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,904
so he probably thought,
"Shit, I'm screwed. I should just die."

301
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,323
I bet that was his thought process.

302
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,034
Gosh, we're talking about Mr. Lee here.

303
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,661
I never imagined he'd do such a thing.

304
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,081
That's what I'm saying.
Jeez, I need a drink.

305
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,333
Oh, boy.

306
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,440
Stay here for the time being.

307
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,403
And don't show Ms. Kang's business card
to random people.

308
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,196
Is she your friend or what?

309
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,783
If you need anything, call me from now on.

310
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,370
CHIEF OF STAFF
GO SEOK-MAN

311
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,882
How can you bring her without telling me?

312
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,011
Sorry, she has a bit of a situation.
Let her stay here for just a few days.

313
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,470
Where's her family?

314
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,222
She cut ties with them
because of her baby.

315
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,807
I don't think they even care about her.

316
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,184
-She got pregnant?
-She got an abortion recently,

317
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,477
so take good care of her.

318
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,105
Call me if anything happens.

319
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,774
Make sure she doesn't leave the house
for the time being.

320
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,651
Okay.

321
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,951
How have you been?

322
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,246
-Good.
-I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

323
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,166
-Things have been pretty hectic.
-Don't worry. It's all right.

324
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,461
Ms. Yun.

325
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,131
Could you please make sure
Mr. Jang gets this?

326
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,516
Do you think it'll be helpful for him?

327
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,437
No?

328
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,317
Actually, I think
Mr. Jang will be happy to see this.

329
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,319
But why...

330
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,654
You should give it to him yourself.

331
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,741
You're the one who discovered this.

332
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,246
I heard you got suspended.

333
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,457
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

334
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,917
No, I should be apologizing to you.

335
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,419
I haven't even returned
half of the favors you did for me.

336
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,964
All the files from Naon Accounting
that are related to Youngil

337
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,133
have been transferred to the prosecution.

338
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,427
-Yes, I heard.
-I'm not sure if this will be helpful,

339
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,431
but I've done some research
because something was bothering me.

340
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,687
The accountant asked numerous times
if it has anything to do with LD Global,

341
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,064
and I thought it was odd.

342
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,025
So I was going through
a list of corporations

343
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,569
that Naon Accounting
has evaluated in the past

344
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,363
and came across an investment firm.

345
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,993
It's a company called Hwain Infra.

346
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:30,125
Rumor has it that Mr. Song
may be affiliated with Hwain Infra.

347
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,301
I need the files that Mr. Lee had.

348
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,554
Okay, I'll bring them with me.

349
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,014
Where shall we meet?

350
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,811
Okay.

351
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,691
Sir, that was Prosecutor Seo.

352
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,360
Apparently, Tae-jun has fallen
off the grid since the funeral.

353
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,695
He's not even at home.

354
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,240
He's probably visiting his dad
in his hometown.

355
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,577
Maybe he wants to say goodbye
before he leaves for his long journey.

356
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,704
No, sir. He didn't go to his dad's place.

357
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,830
And his phone is off.

358
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,628
It's an investment firm.

359
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,964
From Joojin Constructions
and Joojin Chemical

360
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,883
to Hong Kong and Russia,
it's investing in many projects.

361
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,926
They're probably investing
in many companies

362
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,095
to avoid the funds being traced.

363
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,097
Mr. Song must be connected as well.

364
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,058
It's an overseas corporation
like Chairman Sung's LD Company,

365
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,935
so I bet the FSS
doesn't have any information.

366
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,062
We'll have to contact overseas FIUs
for information.

367
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,481
We just need evidence.

368
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,400
I'll see what I can do.

369
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,654
Mr. Jang. It's me, Hye-won.

370
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,959
I brought Mr. Han
because he has something to show you.

371
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,838
Here.

372
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,307
It's consent for the redevelopment
of Seobuk Market.

373
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,560
The ones that have been crossed off
actually aren't residents from the area.

374
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,314
So they got fake consent?

375
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,442
They just need 70 percent of the residents
to consent to the redevelopment.

376
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,778
How many are there?

377
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,656
So far,
35 for the Seobuk Market project alone.

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,283
I'm sure there are more.
Can you pass me the map?

379
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,409
Sure.

380
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,625
There are five redevelopment sites
in total.

381
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,088
-A comprehensive inspection is needed.
-Good job.

382
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,716
I thought all you could do was steal.
How did you manage to find this?

383
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,344
I looked up
and compared every single name.

384
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,389
Contact Mr. Kim and ask him
to send us files on Seongjin City.

385
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,598
Sure.

386
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,519
I'll be off, then.

387
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,733
Mr. Han.

388
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,444
Yes.

389
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,239
Please give us a hand.

390
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,827
You started it,
so you should see it through.

391
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,206
Sure.

392
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,333
I'll do my best.

393
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,925
If there were such issues
from the beginning stage,

394
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,469
I bet they rigged the budget
and feasibility evaluation too.

395
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,596
I'll look into those two.

396
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,347
You two should dig more
into Seobuk Market.

397
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,099
-Sure.
-Yes, sir.

398
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,519
He'll send me files on Seongjin City.
I'll take care of it.

399
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,647
I'll contact overseas FIUs
and look into Hwain Infra.

400
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,493
Mr. Kim, how have you been?

401
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,704
Oh, Mr. Jeong. What brings you here?

402
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,123
I heard you moved to the city desk.
You must be busy.

403
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,375
Even so, I can't be busier than you are.

404
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,210
Well, I'm always busy.

405
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,756
-What? Got something to say?
-No.

406
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,175
Guys, get going first.

407
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,384
-We'll wait outside.
-Okay.

408
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,721
-What's going on?
-I'm actually here

409
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,557
to give you a valuable piece
of information. Not for free though.

410
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,517
Jeez, you prick.
Are you sure it's valuable?

411
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,560
Let's hear it first.

412
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,023
-Ms. Kang Seon-yeong...
-Yes.

413
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,071
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

414
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,823
All right. I'll call you.

415
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,452
Yes, sir.

416
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,245
I have something to tell you urgently.

417
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,705
Ms. Yun, could you have a look at this?

418
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,175
Tae-jun, I feel bad for saying this
knowing the situation,

419
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,511
but you should end things
with my boss now.

420
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,815
All right.

421
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,695
I've been assisting her for years.
You can't fool me.

422
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,032
I can't believe you never told me
when you call yourself my friend.

423
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,701
You sly jerk.

424
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,330
Don't do anything
that might tarnish her reputation.

425
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,500
She wants to be reelected.
Make sure rumors don't spread.

426
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,922
As for her reelection,

427
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,049
I'm counting on you.

428
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,470
I'm already working my butt off.

429
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,932
But mere chiefs of staff like us
busting our butts is useless.

430
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,227
You should become an assemblyman
and help her.

431
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,436
Don't you agree?

432
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,861
Ms. Kang gave me this,

433
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,196
so I don't share it with anyone.

434
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,614
But I'll give you some.

435
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,037
Deer antlers?

436
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,414
That's right.
Deer antlers are good for you.

437
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,471
Ms. Yun, have some coffee.

438
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,016
Have some coffee, ma'am.

439
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,726
Thank you.

440
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,688
-Mr. Go.
-Oh, thanks.

441
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,940
-Have some coffee, Mr. Jang.
-Great, thanks.

442
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,610
Let's have some coffee
and take a quick break.

443
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,989
Gosh, I'm exhausted.
Let's chill for a few minutes.

444
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,657
All right.

445
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,299
Mr. Jang, how about we look
into local newspapers of Uigwang City?

446
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,343
They usually cover matters regarding
local assemblymen in great detail.

447
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,555
They must have materials
on Assemblyman Song on their database.

448
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,642
Good idea. You should go find out.

449
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,060
I'll call the editor in chief.

450
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,022
Great. Then I'll wrap up here
and head out.

451
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,865
I just got a call
from the FIU in Hong Kong.

452
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,783
They said it'll take a few days.

453
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,494
I'm not sure if they'll be willing
to hand the materials to us.

454
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,705
I'll keep following up with them.

455
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,707
Nagging is my specialty, you know.

456
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,292
I'll make sure to get it.

457
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,713
Mr. Jang.

458
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,050
The firms that conducted
the project feasibility evaluation seem

459
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,885
to have a connection with Mr. Oh Won-sik.

460
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,596
It looks legitimate at a glance,
but the numbers don't match at all.

461
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,681
I contacted all the organizations
that are mentioned,

462
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,517
but they denied any involvement.
I bet this was written

463
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,894
without even visiting the site.

464
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,103
This isn't enough.

465
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,440
He'll just blame it all on Won-sik,
like what he did to me.

466
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,318
We need evidence

467
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,446
to prove Mr. Song's connection
with Jungnam Constructions.

468
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,658
But do you think there'd be anything left?

469
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,245
Minister of Justice Nominee
Song Hui-seop's

470
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,497
confirmation hearing report
has been accepted.

471
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,333
The Blue House stated
that the appointment process

472
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,544
will be expedited
as the seat has been vacant for some time.

473
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,755
We'll need some time to find evidence.

474
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,132
And we'll have to make sure
Mr. Song doesn't find out.

475
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,260
I'll buy us some time.

476
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,638
The report states that he is
more than capable enough for the role.

477
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,727
Jo Gap-yeong, this prick.
Why does he call me all the time?

478
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,437
His chief of staff also called me

479
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,815
about the authority
over prosecution's HR matters.

480
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,278
Goodness, they're counting their chickens
before they've even hatched.

481
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,744
Oh, right. What about Tae-jun?
You still haven't found him?

482
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,330
No, sir.
I'm trying to track him down, but...

483
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,582
Jeez, what a nuisance.

484
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,959
Oh, dear.

485
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,462
Darn it.

486
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,609
Mr. Song just came to the office.

487
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,777
Be careful.

488
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,739
Mr. Oh is looking for you.

489
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,702
Yes, okay.

490
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,078
I'll do that.

491
00:38:58,794 --> 00:38:59,795
Who were you talking to?

492
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,255
A reporter.

493
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,592
What are you doing?

494
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,010
Stay still.

495
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,637
RECENT CALLS
MR. JANG

496
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,307
Are you dating Tae-jun?

497
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,018
-What's with all these calls?
-I called him for work.

498
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,771
For work?

499
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,152
Do you know that Tae-jun and Ms. Kang

500
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,570
are an item?

501
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,155
They even live together.

502
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,325
My goodness, I guess you didn't know that.

503
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,160
Don't stay too close to Tae-jun.

504
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,204
You'll end up ruining your life.

505
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,665
I told you I only called him for work.

506
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,213
Well, I guess I can't really stop you
from liking him.

507
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,548
I won't comment too much on that.

508
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,887
But I really can't
turn a blind eye on this.

509
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,264
What should I do?

510
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,155
Tae-jun's career is over now.

511
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,617
If you stay by his side,
you'll end up going down with him.

512
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,161
You can't let your life get destroyed.

513
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,832
Once Mr. Song becomes the minister,
you should follow him to his office.

514
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,130
What's Tae-jun up to?

515
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,884
Come in.

516
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,970
Hey, Prosecutor Seo.

517
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,393
Ms. Yun!

518
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,868
Start driving.

519
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,055
Keep this for me.

520
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,141
Mr. Oh.

521
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,643
Hello, sir.

522
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,313
Hey, what are you doing here?

523
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,814
I'm here for an interview.

524
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,858
A friend of mine from college works here.

525
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,611
-He told me they're hiring.
-Oh, okay. I wish you the best.

526
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,821
-Wait, Mr. Oh.
-Yes?

527
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,116
I never got to apologize
for putting you in trouble.

528
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,701
It's okay. You don't need to apologize.

529
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,496
But what brings you to the hotel?

530
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,251
I never got to apologize.

531
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,878
No, it's okay. Hey.

532
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
Move.

533
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,817
Darn it, he ran away.

534
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,944
Get in here.

535
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,197
Put everything in the box.
Check if he's inside.

536
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,913
Yes?

537
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,332
Okay.

538
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,919
This little jerk.

539
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,296
Mr. Jang just left the hotel.

540
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,506
Then let's go catch him.

541
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,924
Let's go!

542
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,180
What in the world has he been doing here?

543
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,350
Let's go catch him. Let's go.

544
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,615
My gosh.

545
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,866
Darn it.

546
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,802
My gosh, damn it.

547
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,186
For God's sake, I almost died.

548
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,945
Drive faster!

549
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,836
-Hurry up and go after him!
-Drive faster, you punk!

550
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,142
Shit!

551
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,275
Damn it!

552
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,861
Damn it!

553
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,363
How much time do you think we can buy?

554
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,034
Be careful. Mr. Oh is looking for you.

555
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,203
We need to make Mr. Song
focus on something else.

556
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,413
Let them find out where I am.

557
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,581
Yes, okay. I'll do that.

558
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,377
Who were you talking to?

559
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,878
How much time do you think we can buy?

560
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,713
They probably took
every file from the hotel.

561
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,173
I have all the important stuff.

562
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,842
The rest of them are all useless.

563
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,386
Won-sik will dig into things
that aren't important.

564
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,888
-Will they do what we anticipate?
-We need to make them nervous

565
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,306
and give them no time to think.

566
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,898
The files are all mixed up.

567
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,316
We need to analyze everything

568
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,610
to find out
what Tae-jun has up his sleeve.

569
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,279
This little prick.

570
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,407
I can't believe he's even trying
to take what's left of me.

571
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,542
What do you think you're doing?
I cut you some slack because I pitied you.

572
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,377
You'll soon find out what I'm up to.

573
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,505
Tae-jun, are you trying
to get yourself buried next to Mr. Lee?

574
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,883
I'm going to make sure
you'll get buried with me.

575
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,177
Where are you? Let's meet.

576
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,179
Do you really have time for that?

577
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,930
You should bid farewell to your family

578
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,349
before I release everything I have
to the public.

579
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,604
I don't ever cling onto anyone
who betrays me.

580
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,897
I just eat them alive.

581
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,483
Just take good care of yourself, sir.

582
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,444
-Are you not going to regret this?
-I never regret anything.

583
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,454
This little jerk.

584
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:34,291
How can he be so confident
to act up like this?

585
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,793
Sir, there's only one person

586
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,046
who can help Tae-jun right now.

587
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,475
So you're saying Tae-jun and Ms. Kang

588
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,061
have been working together until now?

589
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,021
My goodness, they are unbelievable.

590
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,481
What's Ms. Kang doing right now?

591
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,191
I checked her schedule,

592
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,734
-and it was empty.
-I see.

593
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,199
Wait a minute.
Tae-jun is a very meticulous guy.

594
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,826
He wouldn't have left these behind
for no reason.

595
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,329
Oh, I get it now.

596
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,456
He's trying to buy time.

597
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,667
This asshole is buying time!

598
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,670
Hurry up and find Ms. Kang.
Hurry up and find her! Do it now!

599
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,214
This bastard is unbelievable!
He's buying time!

600
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,551
My goodness, this bastard.

601
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,346
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LIBRARY

602
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,523
We need evidence to prove Mr. Song's
connection with Jungnam Constructions.

603
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,109
But do you think there'd be anything left?

604
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,902
Yes.

605
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,071
Go to the National Assembly archive

606
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,198
and check the minutes
of the Budget Committee

607
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,534
from back when they formed a budget
for the redevelopment.

608
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,244
You'll be able to find something.

609
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,454
SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND ACCOUNTS

610
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,718
Ms. Kang is currently
at the National Assembly archive.

611
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,469
-What's she doing there?
-She asked to see

612
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,472
the 2014 minutes from back when
you used to work at the Budget Committee.

613
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,812
Tae-jun, you were right.

614
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,274
Mr. Song pushed ahead
with the redevelopment budget plan.

615
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,900
And there's a record where he said

616
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,778
he gave work to Jungnam Constructions.

617
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,533
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP'S REMARKS

618
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,661
Mr. Song, this report says that you
entrusted the feasibility evaluation

619
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,413
to a company named Jungnam Constructions.

620
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,457
Is this a legitimate company?

621
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,294
My gosh, I've already
reviewed the company numerous times

622
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,338
and entrusted them
with the project myself.

623
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,299
Are you really going to cause an issue
with every little detail?

624
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,884
Just take a look at the report.

625
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,386
He won't be able to deny this.

626
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,058
I'll call you back.

627
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,232
Just stop.

628
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,238
Stop what?

629
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,116
Just stop whatever you're trying to do.

630
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,451
I'm sorry.

631
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,371
-But I can't do that.
-Do you really think you can

632
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,997
harm me with that minutes?

633
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,707
We'll see what happens.

634
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,251
You're free to take a look
at the confidential minutes.

635
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,795
But if you disclose it to the public,

636
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,927
you'll have to risk your position
as an assemblywoman.

637
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,596
I never knew you'd be so worried about me.

638
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,557
Thank you for your concern,
but I'm well-informed about the law.

639
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,519
Ms. Kang.

640
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,188
You need to watch what you say
when you're in politics.

641
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,650
If I can't say what needs to be said,
there's no reason for me to be here.

642
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,713
If the proceedings go public,

643
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,633
they'll try to dig into your relationship
with Chairman Sung.

644
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,886
The opposition party
will instigate the civic organizations

645
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,013
and make a request
to disclose the minutes.

646
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,224
If that doesn't work,
they'll even file a lawsuit.

647
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,060
We can ask the secretariat
to reject the request,

648
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,396
and the lawsuit will take over a year.

649
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,023
Plus, I'm sure Ms. Kang
won't risk her position

650
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,651
and disclose it to the public.

651
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,656
Ms. Kang worked as an attorney
for over ten years.

652
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,992
She'll come up with a way
to avoid risking her position.

653
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,371
Let's delete the comments
that could cause an issue.

654
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,457
We can ask the chairperson
to delete the remarks.

655
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,751
It's a legal process,
so they can't cause an issue.

656
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,504
Okay, call Chairperson Lee
and ask him to come see me.

657
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,756
Yes, sir.

658
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,220
Mr. Song.

659
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,765
Ms. Kang is apparently
getting ready to hold a press conference.

660
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,686
My goodness.

661
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,857
You're very hard to meet these days.

662
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,610
I'm worried I won't be able to see you
once you become a minister.

663
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,945
My goodness,
things are very hectic these days.

664
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,864
Everything's going very smoothly,

665
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,866
so we should get together and celebrate.

666
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,201
Yes, of course.

667
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,744
You really helped me out a lot.

668
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,455
Since we're on the subject,
how about we celebrate now?

669
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,833
How about next time?
I'm in quite a hurry right now.

670
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,378
Why are you in such a hurry?

671
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,299
The viper has lost its fangs,
and the fox will soon get arrested.

672
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,431
We're all doing this
to make a decent living.

673
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,724
Let me pour you a glass.

674
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,268
I'm not sure if it'd be okay
for me to accept that.

675
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,023
I didn't know you could get
so easily intimidated.

676
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,150
We just need to sit back, enjoy our drinks

677
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,737
and watch what happens to Ms. Kang.

678
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,863
It'll be fun.

679
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,375
So tell me. Where's the girl?

680
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,294
Apparently, Seok-man
is taking care of her right now.

681
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,477
Ms. Kang, the press conference is ready.

682
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,864
Release the press materials as soon
as the press conference ends.

683
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:41,950
Yes, ma'am.

684
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,119
We need to add some stuff
to the press materials.

685
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,704
-So let's hurry up. Come on.
-Okay.

686
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,289
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Go.

687
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,673
Hey, what's up?

688
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,508
I'm busy right now. Can we talk later?

689
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,719
What?

690
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,640
What are you saying?
Will you please slow down?

691
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,269
I went out to buy some groceries,
and she was gone when I came back.

692
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,062
I kept calling her, but she won't pick up.

693
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:31,791
MR. GO SEOK-MAN

694
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,088
My gosh, they're always very busy.
Don't you think so?

695
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,424
I'll keep this for a while.

696
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,097
Don't be scared.

697
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,099
You just need to do as I say.

698
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,023
I want you to keep calling this number.

699
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,150
And let me know right away
if she picks up.

700
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,319
Okay, sir.

701
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,405
Mr. Go!

702
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,741
Look.

703
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,339
I warned you, didn't I?

704
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,635
Ms. Kang, people's words

705
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,015
are more feared than the law in politics.

706
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,269
Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong

707
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:37,065
is being suspected of having helped
a single mother get an abortion.

708
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,650
According to the informant,

709
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:42,696
Assemblywoman Kang
met the single mother, Ms. Shin,

710
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,864
at the lone-parent facility
that she sponsors

711
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,910
and signed the surgery consent form
as her guardian.

712
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:54,457
The constitutional court may have ruled
against the punishment on abortion,

713
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,252
but the government hasn't passed
a new law to replace the old one,

714
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:01,131
so people think Assemblywoman Kang
might end up

715
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,091
getting punished for what she did.

716
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,885
If an assembly member in office
gets sentenced to prison,

717
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,679
that person will end up having to resign.

718
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:11,474
Therefore, Daehan Party
is apparently in a difficult situation

719
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,893
since they could end up
losing a party member.

720
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,563
Okay.

721
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,526
My goodness, if things go wrong,

722
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,737
I might have to attend another funeral.

723
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,786
It's Assemblywoman Kang!

724
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,124
-Did you really help her?
-What punishment do you think you'll get?

725
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,501
-When will you make an announcement?
-Please say a word.

726
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,669
Are you pro-abortion?

727
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,171
You must be aware of the punishment.

728
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,339
-What's your opinion about it?
-Please tell us.

729
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,009
-Can you please tell us?
-What do you have to say to the citizens?

730
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,054
According to a source from Daehan Party,
it's highly possible

731
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:53,349
for Assemblywoman Kang
to get punished within the party.

732
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,269
Apparently, a few assembly members
in Daehan Party

733
00:55:56,352 --> 00:56:00,273
think the ethics committee
should expel Assemblywoman Kang.

734
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,110
I'm going to disclose

735
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,864
the confidential minutes
and the files I have found to the press.

736
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,616
That's going to be useless.

737
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,785
Mr. Song would have
already deleted the original copy.

738
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,995
And if you keep going,
you'll only end up getting hurt.

739
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,539
I still need to do what I can.

740
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,500
If the proceedings go public,

741
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,169
the ethics committee
will kick you out of the party.

742
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,172
Seon-yeong, it's over now.

743
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,757
If you get kicked out of the party...

744
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,383
I'll end up losing my position

745
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,177
as an assemblywoman as well.

746
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,644
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
SONG HUI-SEOP

747
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,106
The Blue House held
an appointment ceremony this morning

748
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,982
for Minister Song,
the new Minister of Justice.

749
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,859
President Kim Dong-gyu asked Minister Song

750
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,654
to do his best
to keep the law fair and just

751
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:52,242
and to fulfill his duty
as the new Minister of Justice.

752
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,553
MINISTER OF JUSTICE
SONG HUI-SEOP

753
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,244
Do you have video footage of this
by any chance?

754
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:39,664
I invested some money in a company
called Hwain Infra.

755
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,168
But to be honest, I don't really know
what kind of company it is.

756
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,628
The reason I was able
to invest in that company

757
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,882
was that it was being managed
by a person that I trust.

758
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,093
I think this will be enough
to prove Mr. Song's connection

759
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,137
with Hwain Infra.

760
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,268
Do you think it's too late?

761
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,939
No, it's not too late.

762
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,443
This is more than enough.

763
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,490
Good work.

764
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,413
The new Minister of Justice,
Minister Song Hui-seop,

765
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,584
had an urgent meeting with prosecutors,
which is unprecedented.

766
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,836
Minister Song said
he's strongly determined

767
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,839
to make the righteous prosecution
and trustable Ministry of Justice.

768
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,592
He expressed his strong will
to reform the prosecution

769
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,636
to the prosecutors.

770
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,305
Minister Song is considered

771
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,682
to have the most influence
on the prosecution...

772
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,437
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can help you with this.

773
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:48,525
Mr. Song is now the Minister of Justice
who has control over the prosecution.

774
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,778
This could end up causing a conflict
between the prosecution and police.

775
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:56,783
How about you try and contact someone
who has more power?

776
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:01,329
To be honest, you and I won't
be able to handle this.

777
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,830
I'm sorry.

778
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,874
It seems like you're mistaken
about something.

779
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,751
You're just a chief of staff.

780
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,629
And I'm the future Minister of Justice
who will soon have the power

781
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,214
to move all the prosecutors in Korea.

782
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,216
He's right.

783
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,469
I'm just a chief of staff.

784
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,263
Next on the news.

785
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,557
A total of five areas
have been picked for the by-election

786
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,184
which includes
two National Assembly members

787
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,228
and three local assembly members.

788
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,065
Seongjin City, which was run
by the late Assemblyman Lee Seong-min,

789
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,944
had been supporting Daehan Party
up until the last legislative election.

790
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,364
Thus, many people are interested
in whom Daehan Party will be nominating

791
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,116
as their next candidate
for the by-election.

792
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,421
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN'S OFFICE

793
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:03,141
I WILL WORK HARD FOR SEONGJIN CITY
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

794
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,465
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

795
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,513
I came to give you this.

796
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,349
I figured

797
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,769
it'd be better for you to have it

798
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,146
than to keep it myself.

799
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,537
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING ELECTED
JANG TAE-JUN

800
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:31,979
I'm sorry.

801
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,067
I'm sorry.

802
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,321
Tae-jun.

803
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,874
Seon-yeong.

804
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,462
I want you to trust me

805
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,091
no matter which choice I make.

806
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,719
What's that supposed to mean?

807
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,804
I want you to trust me no matter what.

808
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,782
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

809
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,075
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

810
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,410
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

811
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,498
Assemblyman Song...

812
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,125
My goodness, why would you call him that?

813
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,336
He's a minister now.

814
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,801
Please forgive me, Minister Song.

815
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,346
There will be a by-election
in Seongjin City,

816
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,140
so we should quickly nominate someone
as a candidate from our party.

817
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,101
Yes, of course. Seongjin City
is a very important district to us.

818
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,478
That's right.

819
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,271
-Let's drink.
-Okay.

820
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:47,406
I invested some money in a company
called Hwain Infra.

821
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,993
But to be honest, I don't really know
what kind of company it is.

822
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,287
The reason I was able
to invest in that company

823
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,791
was that it was being managed
by a person that I trust.

824
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:57,875
That's why...

825
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:12,598
If I can't change anything,
that means there's no hope.

826
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,310
If I can't hatch out of my own world,

827
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,480
I'll end up getting eaten alive.

828
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,296
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

829
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,885
-How dare he show up here?
-What's he doing here?

830
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,161
This contains the video file
that I sent you earlier.

831
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,040
I destroyed the original copy
that the press had before I came here.

832
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,669
So this is the only copy of the file.

833
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,435
I must change.

834
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,654
Being righteous was sad,

835
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,156
and I have absolutely nothing.

836
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,284
There's no need to hesitate.

837
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,291
I want you to nominate me as the candidate
to run for Seongjin City's by-election

838
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,794
that was once run by Assemblyman Lee.

839
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,508
Even if I get consumed by darkness

840
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,594
and go to a point of no turning back,

841
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,981
I still choose

842
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,858
to walk this path.

843
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,552
If you want this, throw away everything.

844
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,345
That's the only way to survive.

845
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,265
Mr. Jang is being considered as the
next candidate to run for Seongjin City.

846
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,891
That little jerk.

847
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,893
Is the hearing preparation going well?

848
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,479
You gathered all of us here!
What kind of ruse is this?

849
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,064
You were right.

850
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,900
But I hope you can forgive me
just this once.

851
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,486
I'll prove that you were wrong, Mr. Jang.

852
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,612
I'll look forward to it.

853
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,240
It was all my doing.
I should take responsibility.

854
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:18,784
The viper has returned with more poison.

855
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,077
You can start.

856
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:43,726
