00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,563
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,982
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,553
I don't mind cooperating with you.
But there's one thing that bothers me.

4
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,724
I'd like to catch a sly traitor
that stabbed me in the back.

5
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,227
-About Kang Seon-yeong...
-Yes, sir.

6
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,646
Do what you need to get rid of her
at the right timing.

7
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,607
That's what Jo Gap-yeong wants in return.

8
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,286
Congratulations.

9
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,789
You made a fancy comeback.

10
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,869
EPISODE 5

11
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,874
You're back.

12
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,377
-I thought you were sleeping.
-I was reading up on the bill.

13
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,212
That was quite a long run.

14
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,882
It's been ages since my last one.

15
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,805
What are you watching?

16
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,517
It's the first day we met.

17
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,565
Mr. Jang, we'll run a camera test.

18
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,280
Excuse me.

19
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,581
You can move closer.

20
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,625
Right.

21
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,713
Did you come up with these answers?

22
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,050
Yes.

23
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,428
Are they not good?

24
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,180
Not at all.

25
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,431
They're great.

26
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,849
I see.

27
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,227
Thank you.

28
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,854
Let's time the answers first.

29
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,247
"That wretched day
is still in our memories.

30
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,584
Amidst the fire..."

31
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,175
"Amidst the fire and baton strikes,

32
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,303
the people's homes
were broken into pieces.

33
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,348
And as we watched the scene unfold,
our hearts broke to pieces too.

34
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,143
We groaned and mourned.

35
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,396
However, we're hiding
an inconvenient truth

36
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,274
in the midst of our groans.

37
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,903
The truth that incidents like this
are still happening in our society.

38
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,032
When I bring this up again,

39
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,743
some will say

40
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,828
they're sick of it

41
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,123
and they want it to stop now.

42
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,463
Our society has become cold and dark
and gotten used to others' pain.

43
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,177
Politicians must be present
in this dark and cold society of ours.

44
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,974
We must charge toward the darkness
and become the source of light.

45
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,771
That is the purpose and mission

46
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,070
of politicians."

47
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,627
You were really cool that day.

48
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,296
Time flies, doesn't it?

49
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,465
It's already been five years.

50
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,971
How did it go with Mr. Jo?

51
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,185
He's not the type of man to back down.

52
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,062
I should sort things out.

53
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,233
Let me know if you need help.

54
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,694
I don't need to try to be
on good terms with him anymore.

55
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,656
I'll keep that in mind.

56
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,410
Would you like some tea also?

57
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,746
Sure.

58
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,303
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP'S OFFICE

59
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,102
Damn it.

60
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,062
-Hello.
-Hey.

61
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,481
What are you doing?

62
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,109
I'm putting together new materials
for the presentation.

63
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,070
-New materials?
-Yes, it was Mr. Jang's idea.

64
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,239
Let me see.

65
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,658
Here.

66
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,083
How dare he fix this
without running it by me first?

67
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,515
That bastard must think I'm a joke.

68
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,525
Hello, Mr. Hwang. It's me, Oh Won-sik.

69
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,445
Yes, I'm aware of that.

70
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,697
If you can spare me some time,
why don't we grab a drink?

71
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,910
No, please. It's my treat.

72
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,161
I'll head to your office.

73
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,914
Okay.

74
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,253
Mr. Jang should've done a better job.

75
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,672
I should've been at the presentation.

76
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,801
It's all the same no matter who comes.

77
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,054
We're working hard, too, you know.

78
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,599
Mr. Hwang,

79
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,061
did someone buy your field?

80
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,314
I can only get a good price
once the roads are paved.

81
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,733
They keep changing their minds.
It's torture.

82
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,152
Why did you have to bring that up?
It's only frustrating me.

83
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,948
I plan on clearing up the frustration

84
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,116
you're feeling now.

85
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:55,993
Let's drink.

86
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,165
Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong
of the Daehan Party

87
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,125
will be joining us today
to discuss the bill

88
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,919
to support lone-parent families.

89
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,671
She's joining me at the booth today.

90
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,507
-Hello.
-Hello. This is Kang Seon-yeong.

91
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,678
Please briefly explain
to our listeners about your bill.

92
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,348
Most lone-parent families
are struggling financially.

93
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,518
The child rearing expenses
take up the most of their funds.

94
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,936
This bill enables more families

95
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,398
to receive financial support to cover
the expenses that incur to raise a child.

96
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,941
If you're supporting more families,

97
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,068
it sounds like you'd need
to secure a big budget.

98
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,529
Yes. Currently, single parents
who are under 24

99
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,740
qualify for additional funds
to cover their expenses.

100
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,201
With this bill, the age limit will go up.

101
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,911
Therefore, an increased budget is crucial.

102
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,164
And currently, we provide financial
support to help teenage single parents,

103
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,710
who have stopped their education,
to obtain GED or pay for tuition.

104
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,836
However, it doesn't support

105
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,046
their employment.
The bill will include this support.

106
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,424
We want to support lone-parent families
with low income

107
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,884
who never received benefits
due to the age limit.

108
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,219
The purpose of this bill is

109
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,805
to give opportunities
to young single parents

110
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,640
to educate themselves and get a job.

111
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,225
Starting today, bills will be evaluated

112
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,019
by the Judiciary Committee.

113
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,813
You shared with us
that you expect the bill to pass.

114
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,690
Gathering enough budget will be difficult.

115
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,526
But a lot of people
see the need to implement the bill.

116
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,821
-I hope to gain support from the public.
-Turn it off. She'll ruin my morning.

117
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,574
-Hey, turn it off.
-Damn it.

118
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,996
CHIEF PRESIDENTIAL SECRETARY

119
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,875
Hello, sir. What an honor
to receive a call from you this morning.

120
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,084
What is this about?

121
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,547
Yes, Mr. Jang. The budget proposal?

122
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,342
Yes. I'm writing it up now.

123
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,470
The redevelopment of Seobuk Market
is the first step of a large-scale

124
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,639
redevelopment that stretches
from Uigwang to Seongjin.

125
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,892
At this rate,
the whole project will be delayed.

126
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,728
If you take over the district office
without resolving this,

127
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,897
you'll have to take responsibility
for everything.

128
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,150
I know that. I need to resolve
this redevelopment problem quickly.

129
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,944
The problem is the lay-out.

130
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,946
Take a look at the revised blueprint.

131
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,158
Their stores have gotten smaller,
but the rent has doubled.

132
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,369
Those who own their stores
won't have a problem with it.

133
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,287
But the tenants can't afford the rent.

134
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,832
On top of that, the landlords filed
for the eviction order at the court.

135
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,752
The merchant association is delaying it,
but it won't last.

136
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,463
It'll be hard to reach an agreement
at the public hearing today.

137
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,508
Gather information
on Taejeong Market in Yuseong.

138
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,135
It's the most successful redevelopment
case of traditional markets.

139
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,012
Yes, sir.

140
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,014
Where's Mr. Han?

141
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,518
He's giving out flyers
to the merchants for the public hearing.

142
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,895
Mr. Jang, the budget proposal is ready.

143
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,647
Thank you.

144
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,863
CONSTRUCTION
OF SEOUL AND UIGWANG EXPRESSWAY

145
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,573
Why did we put aside our budget for this?

146
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,743
Mr. Oh told me to include that just now.

147
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,081
Bring me a revised one without it.

148
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,791
Pardon?

149
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,002
Mr. Oh said it must be included.

150
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,133
See you later, sir.

151
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,137
I give up.

152
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,098
Damn it. What do they want me to do?

153
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,392
They should sort this out between them.

154
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,686
Mr. Oh tells me to include it,
and he tells me to pull it.

155
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,396
Damn it.

156
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,440
Ms. No, coffee, please.

157
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,150
Okay.

158
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,196
Mr. Kim, you should make your own coffee.

159
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,786
I'll meet with the head
of the merchant association.

160
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,746
The Judiciary Committee meeting
will start soon.

161
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,248
It won't take long.

162
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,168
Since we're on the subject,
do something about Seobuk Market.

163
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,629
-People keep calling me since yesterday.
-I might be able to find a solution soon.

164
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,673
Okay. That's better.

165
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,092
Ms. Kang.

166
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,138
Have you heard what happened to Ms. Jeong?

167
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,807
She reported Mr. Song
to the ethics committee of our party.

168
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,684
According to her chief of staff,

169
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,437
Mr. Jo initially promised to support her,
but he changed his mind.

170
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,314
It looks like she's in a tight spot.

171
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,983
Do you think
Mr. Jo might be plotting something?

172
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,782
-Hello, Mr. Song.
-Hello, Ms. Kang.

173
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,660
You were great on the radio show.

174
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,579
You indeed have a beautiful voice.

175
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,540
The Judiciary Committee meeting
is at 11:00 a.m.

176
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes, I already talked to Chairperson Lee.

177
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,046
I have no doubt
that your bill will be passed.

178
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,465
Okay. I'll send the budget proposal

179
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,425
for the lone-parent bill to Mr. Jang.

180
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,968
Sure.

181
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,432
Hello, Mr. Jo.

182
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,021
By the way, I still haven't heard
from the Blue House.

183
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,190
When will I meet
the Chief Presidential Secretary?

184
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,317
I will make a reservation at a restaurant.

185
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,445
I hear that he likes sashimi.

186
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,866
He can't dine at the restaurant
without knowing what it serves.

187
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,826
He must have a taste
to work up his appetite.

188
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,165
I'll call you after checking
what the side dishes are.

189
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,124
Okay.

190
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,919
I hope you'll be favorable
to the bill I'll propose

191
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,046
to the Judiciary Committee tomorrow.

192
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,047
Sure. Of course.

193
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,266
He's one picky eater.

194
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,686
-What's his bill?
-It's about industrial innovation.

195
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,730
That jerk. He's asking me for a favor
when he's not doing me any good.

196
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,191
See you around.

197
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,536
Chairperson Lee wants
to meet before the meeting.

198
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,621
Tell him that I'll call him.

199
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,039
Yes, sir.

200
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,045
Hey.

201
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,757
Get rid of Kang Seon-yeong quickly.

202
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,510
Otherwise, we might not get to see
the Chief Presidential Secretary.

203
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,722
You're planning
to introduce the bill with Ms. Kang.

204
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,682
If the bill gets passed, it will help you.

205
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,268
That's not that important.
Get rid of her now.

206
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,815
Darn it.

207
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,329
Mr. Han, how are the merchants reacting?
Will a lot of them participate?

208
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,664
A lot of them don't seem very favorable
about the idea.

209
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,750
Yes.

210
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,085
Okay, I'll gather as many people as I can.

211
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
Okay, have a good day. Bye.

212
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,344
Hello, I'm from
Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office.

213
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,804
There will be a public hearing
at the city hall at 6:00 p.m.

214
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,140
-I'm not interested.
-Please read this, sir.

215
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,558
No, thanks.

216
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,851
Have a good day.

217
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,103
I'll carry that for you, ma'am.

218
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,188
Who are you?

219
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,648
I'm from Assemblyman Song's office.

220
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,067
There's a public hearing
at the city hall at 6:00 p.m.

221
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,151
I'm not interested.

222
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,820
Ma'am, please have a read
when you have time.

223
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,113
Please, ma'am.

224
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,991
PUBLIC HEARING ON THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF UIGWANG AND SEONGJIN CITY

225
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,660
SIDE DISHES, KIMCHI

226
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,210
PUBLIC HEARING ON THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF UIGWANG AND SEONGJIN CITY

227
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,880
Hello, there's a public hearing
at the city hall at 6:00 p.m.

228
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,049
Please have a read.
It's about the redevelopment plan.

229
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,641
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
CONFERENCE ROOM

230
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,942
MEETING WITH MR. HWANG

231
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,075
-Hey, Mr. Jang.
-Is Mr. Song still inside?

232
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,035
Yes, he's taking longer than expected.

233
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,038
By the way, Mr. Oh's with him.

234
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,039
Won-sik?

235
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,249
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

236
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,959
It's been so long.

237
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,004
Don't worry.
Mr. Oh will take care of everything.

238
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,922
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

239
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,757
-Step outside for a second.
-Of course.

240
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,763
Yes, Mr. Song talked to Mr. Oh

241
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,432
over the phone this morning.

242
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,310
He kept talking about the expressway.

243
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,981
-Where are they?
-Oh, here?

244
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,318
Hey, it's me. What's up?

245
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,654
The Judiciary Committee meeting
has already begun.

246
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,741
Yes, I know. But Mr. Song apparently
can't make it to the meeting

247
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,617
because he isn't feeling so well today.

248
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,786
Please convey the message
to Chairperson Lee.

249
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,122
By the way, Jong-uk is going
to add a budget proposal.

250
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,207
Mr. Song approved of it,
so take care of that for me.

251
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,585
I'll talk to Mr. Song
about the budget myself.

252
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,836
What?

253
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,297
Hey, Mr. Song already gave me
his consent--

254
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,549
I'll proceed with it
once I check with Mr. Song.

255
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,597
My gosh, this little punk.

256
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,849
Mr. Lee.

257
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,271
I know you and Tae-jun are close.

258
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,981
But watch what you tell him.

259
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,858
You don't want to lose your job, do you?

260
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,453
Ask the Ministry of Strategy and Finance
and the Ministry of Labor

261
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,830
-if they checked the bill.
-Yes, ma'am.

262
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,458
Show me the bill
on the outplacement for women.

263
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,168
Ms. Kang.

264
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,214
-How did the meeting go?
-The committee put our bill on hold.

265
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,549
And Mr. Song
didn't even attend the meeting.

266
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,264
Where's Mr. Song?

267
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,266
It'll be useless for you to go see him.

268
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,770
Apparently, Mr. Song and Mr. Jo
had a one-on-one meeting last night.

269
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,897
They must've struck a deal.

270
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,440
No wonder something felt so off.

271
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,152
How did it go with Mr. Jo?

272
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,950
He's not the type of man to back down.

273
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,910
I should sort things out.

274
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,704
I need to go somewhere.

275
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,086
I just got a call from Mr. Oh again

276
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,130
-about the expressway--
-I said, get rid of it!

277
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,091
Okay, I'll do that.

278
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,094
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG

279
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,474
I'm sorry about that. Just get rid of it.

280
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,684
Yes, sir.

281
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,774
What the heck do they want me to do?

282
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,779
What? Why are you staring at me?

283
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,205
Mr. Jang.

284
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,667
Let's talk outside.

285
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,217
Mr. Jo wants to bring me down in return
for letting Mr. Song become the minister?

286
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,930
I'm a pretty valuable hostage, aren't I?

287
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,515
So what now?

288
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,603
-What's your plan?
-Let's wait for a little while.

289
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,771
You can propose the bill again

290
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,274
-once he becomes the minister.
-What about after that?

291
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,112
Mr. Song will be the Minister of Justice
who has control over the prosecutors.

292
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,698
Mr. Jo will be the floor leader
who has control over the party.

293
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,325
Who will be able to deal with them then?

294
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,912
Waiting isn't going to make a difference.

295
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,457
Seon-yeong.

296
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,876
Don't get involved.

297
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,545
This is my fight.

298
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
You could really get hurt.

299
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,341
Mr. Song will be the one getting hurt.

300
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,928
I'm going to be a thorn in his side.

301
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,641
See you later, ma'am.

302
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,892
RICE CAKES

303
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,894
Excuse me, young man.

304
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,646
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,984
Are people like me allowed
to attend the hearing as well?

306
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,659
Up until a few days ago,

307
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,580
I used to sell stuff over there
with my grandson.

308
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,375
If it weren't for my grandson,

309
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,294
I wouldn't have been able
to work for so long.

310
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,339
He would always come
and stay by my side after school

311
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,466
and help me sell stuff.

312
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,718
What a kind grandson.

313
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,804
Yes, he's very kind.

314
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,556
He grew up with no parents.

315
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,850
But he's still
the kindest person on earth.

316
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,481
After he graduated from high school,
he wanted to start his own business.

317
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,359
So he leased and renovated a store.

318
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,610
But the landlord

319
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,780
sold the store in just two months.

320
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,325
He was so upset

321
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,912
that he cried for days and nights.

322
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,124
Now he's working at a factory
because he doesn't want

323
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,750
to burden me.

324
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,172
So tell me.

325
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,549
If I attend this hearing,

326
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,926
will I be able to work

327
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,845
with my grandson again?

328
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,644
I can't guarantee anything.

329
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,022
But it might help you find some solutions.

330
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,859
There's a very competent chief of staff
working in our office.

331
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,529
If you explain your situation to him,
I'm sure he'll help you out.

332
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,325
Is he that competent?

333
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,160
Of course, ma'am.

334
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,587
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG

335
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,380
Is the Judiciary Committee meeting over?

336
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,801
Yes, I got a call
from Chairperson Lee earlier.

337
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,428
He did what you asked.

338
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,476
Mr. Song, you should be more supportive
of Chairperson Lee.

339
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,187
If he finds out you made a deal
with Mr. Jo over the floor leader--

340
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,396
Just play dumb for now.

341
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,607
If he finds out now,
it won't do us any good.

342
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,858
Okay, sir.

343
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,526
My goodness, that feels nice.

344
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,819
-Press harder.
-Okay, sir.

345
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,739
I haven't even officially
become the minister yet.

346
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,366
Why are there so many people
asking me for favors already?

347
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,244
My goodness, my shoulders are killing me.
That feels nice.

348
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,538
Mr. Song, it's been so long.

349
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,873
Yes, it has. Hello.

350
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,459
My gosh, things are so hectic these days.

351
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,839
-This will feel refreshing.
-My goodness, that's nice.

352
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,596
Ms. Kang.

353
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,146
I'm sorry. I know how hard you worked
to make that bill.

354
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,898
There's no need for you to be sorry.

355
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,609
This isn't the first time
our bill got stomped on like this.

356
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,446
We can't just stand still
just because our bill got stomped on.

357
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,825
We need to get ready to fight back

358
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,370
to make sure it doesn't get
stomped on again.

359
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,630
Hello, Ms. Jeong Eun-hui.

360
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,383
This is Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong.

361
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,391
He's been in there for ages.

362
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,685
He's reading the bill
from Mr. Jo's office, right?

363
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,727
Yes.

364
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,480
Why does he care so much about their bill?

365
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,695
Mr. Jang.

366
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,197
Here are the files on Seobuk Market.

367
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,120
Hye-won.

368
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,916
-Yes?
-Keep an eye on Ms. Kang's office.

369
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,335
Tell me if you notice anything.

370
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,172
Should I know what this is about?

371
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,136
No.

372
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,638
Okay, I'll let you know.

373
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,819
The water supply and sewerage system here
is too old, and the river smells very bad.

374
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,863
So 60 percent of the residents
had already agreed

375
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,865
to the redevelopment
before you got elected.

376
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,992
Once Seobuk Market
starts getting redeveloped,

377
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,368
the same thing will happen here.

378
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,913
But this area only needs to deal

379
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,290
with the river
and the water supply and sewerage system.

380
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,875
Well, yes.

381
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,921
But the residents and merchants
want the area to get redeveloped.

382
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,173
The city is in a pickle because of that.

383
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,389
That can't be a reason
to kick these people out of their homes.

384
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,683
But they're going
to carry out the execution soon.

385
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,352
Yes, you're right.

386
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,771
The public hearing
only causes people to fight.

387
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,898
I'm not sure how it'll turn out this time.

388
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,821
-Ma'am, let us help you.
-No, it's okay.

389
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,240
-Give her a hand.
-Yes, sir.

390
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,537
Joojin Chemical's affiliate

391
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,666
is part of the redevelopment, right?

392
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,459
Yes, it's Joojin Constructions.

393
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,632
I heard you're concerned these days

394
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,009
because you reported Mr. Song

395
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
to the ethics committee of our party.

396
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,931
I did report him,
but you know how it works.

397
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,642
The head commissioner
is in support of Mr. Song.

398
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,061
I'm very concerned about what I should do.

399
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,398
-The party isn't very happy with it.
-If you're not going to cancel the report,

400
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,774
I'd like to help you out.

401
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,362
That'd be great for me.
But it could put you in a tight spot.

402
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,990
I'll help you out as long
as you're okay with it.

403
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,201
But the head commissioner--

404
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,078
He might be able to put out a small fire,

405
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,707
but he won't be able to put out a big one.

406
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,462
Mr. Jang.

407
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,592
Apparently, Ms. Kang
met up with Ms. Jeong.

408
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,431
She also contacted the assemblywomen
of the opposition party and ours.

409
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,141
I think Ms. Kang is planning

410
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,602
to report Mr. Song
to the National Assembly Ethics Committee.

411
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,479
Where is Ms. Kang right now?

412
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,107
She's in a meeting with the Ministry
of Gender Equality and Family.

413
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,151
Okay.

414
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:12,255
Now that we're done
discussing the lone-parent project,

415
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,507
I'd like to start talking
about the National Assembly.

416
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,926
Assemblyman Song's offensive comment
toward women

417
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,929
has become quite an issue recently.

418
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:20,847
Assemblywoman Kang.

419
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,017
You're planning to report him
to the National Assembly Ethics Committee?

420
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,644
Yes. I'm going to report him
to the committee

421
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,772
for violating Article 146
of the National Assembly Act

422
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,275
which prohibits making insulting comments
at the National Assembly.

423
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,735
Many assemblywomen from both

424
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,279
the ruling and opposition party
have agreed to participate.

425
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,739
I see.

426
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,950
Offensive comments toward women
have become a global issue these days.

427
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,161
Is there a reason why
it can be more of a problem when

428
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,121
such comments
are made by an assembly member?

429
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,374
Assembly members are people who make laws.

430
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,626
They have an obligation to be fair.

431
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,462
They shouldn't make comments
that could encourage discrimination.

432
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,672
Thus, the right punishment
and disciplinary action

433
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,550
need to be taken against assembly members
who make such comments.

434
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,928
I'm hoping this will warn people

435
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,390
about making offensive comments
on all kinds of issues.

436
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,649
You could really get hurt.

437
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,442
Mr. Song will be the one getting hurt.

438
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,029
I'm going to be a thorn in his side.

439
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,537
With the lead of Assemblywoman Jeong
of the Daehan Party,

440
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,747
twenty assemblywomen
reported Assemblyman Song

441
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,165
to the National Assembly Ethics Committee

442
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,960
for having made an offensive comment
toward women.

443
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,170
-The assemblywomen of both parties
-Won-sik.

444
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,173
-Hand me the toner.
-filed a request to the executive office

445
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,175
-to take disciplinary action
-Here you go.

446
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,969
-against Assemblyman Song.
-That's enough.

447
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,138
In the worst-case scenario,

448
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,514
he might even end up resigning.

449
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,349
Once the request reaches the committee,

450
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,520
-it will cause a controversy
-Gosh, it's so hard to become a minister.

451
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,065
as to whether he's qualified to become
the next Minister of Justice.

452
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,235
We're getting tons of phone calls
from the press.

453
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,738
Find out all the assemblywomen
who participated.

454
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,197
And prepare for a press conference.

455
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,657
Mr. Jang.

456
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,620
Do you think Mr. Song will be satisfied
with just a press conference?

457
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,623
-What?
-You should put yourself

458
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,250
before Ms. Kang for now.

459
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,838
If you don't stop Ms. Kang,

460
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,132
you'll end up losing everything.

461
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,427
You've recently come back
from the district office.

462
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,054
If you keep hesitating,

463
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,683
we can't guarantee
what move the assemblyman will make next.

464
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,939
Yes, Mr. Song.

465
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,612
The most severe disciplinary action that
the National Assembly Ethics Committee...

466
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,751
You startled me.

467
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,087
My goodness, the buzzing sound
really gets on my nerves.

468
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,181
Are you not going to do anything?

469
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,391
Not only one but two assemblywomen
are after me.

470
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,231
Is there a thing between you and Ms. Kang?

471
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,024
No, sir. There's nothing.

472
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,151
Then why are you hesitating?

473
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,946
Sir, let me take care of this.

474
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,531
-I'll--
-I'll take care of it.

475
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,075
How?

476
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,991
UIGWANG CITY HALL

477
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,367
PUBLIC HEARING ON THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF UIGWANG AND SEONGJIN CITY

478
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,202
WITHDRAW THE REDEVELOPMENT PLAN

479
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,912
My goodness.

480
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,414
WITHDRAW THE REDEVELOPMENT PLAN

481
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,165
WE ARE AGAINST
POSTPONING THE REDEVELOPMENT

482
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,835
-There are a lot of people.
-What a relief.

483
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,671
-Let's sit over there.
-There?

484
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,839
Yes.

485
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,760
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

486
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,345
Wait here. I'll get you a drink.

487
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,471
-Thanks.
-Okay.

488
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,558
Is Mr. Hwang not here?

489
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,185
Why isn't he here yet?
He said he'd be here.

490
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,237
They're going to pass
Ms. Kang's bill today, right?

491
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:50,199
Yes, but I got a call earlier
saying the bill got postponed.

492
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,826
-Really?
-Yes.

493
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,370
-How come?
-Hello, Mr. Lee.

494
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:59,208
Hey, you even came to the public hearing?
You're working very hard.

495
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,545
Mr. Lee, this is for you.

496
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,716
You didn't have to spend money.
I should be the one buying this.

497
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,676
Is Mr. Jang not here?

498
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,471
He'll come as soon
as he takes care of something urgent.

499
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,972
I see.

500
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,309
PUBLIC HEARING ON THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF UIGWANG AND SEONGJIN CITY

501
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,186
-Thanks for this.
-No problem, sir.

502
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,775
Okay, bye.

503
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,904
Ms. Kang, Ms. Jeong just withdrew

504
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,740
the report on Mr. Song from
the National Assembly Ethics Committee.

505
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,677
Ms. Jeong, I heard you canceled--

506
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,179
You came just in time.
I was just about to call you.

507
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,806
What happened?

508
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,599
I feel like it's too risky of a move.

509
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,102
The other assemblywomen
also agree with me.

510
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,604
I won't forget how much you helped.

511
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,231
I need to go to a meeting now.

512
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,983
Wait, Ms. Jeong.

513
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,694
Ms. Kang.

514
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,364
Let's not make this a big gender issue.

515
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,283
The society is already complicated
as it is.

516
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,091
This is a letter of dismissal
as a spokesperson. Please sign it.

517
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,884
Tae-jun!

518
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,846
If she refuses, she'll also be dismissed
from the Environment and Labor Committee.

519
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,180
What? Dismissed?

520
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,099
Just accept it.

521
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,309
Then I'll find a new position for you.

522
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,687
-Come outside!
-Will you please excuse us?

523
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,313
-Ms. Kang, I'll--
-Mr. Go.

524
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,287
Who's the new spokesperson?

525
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,415
Ms. Jeong?

526
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,795
Go and tell Mr. Song this.

527
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,631
He'll get hurt as much as I do.

528
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,467
-Seon-yeong.
-Don't give up on your dream.

529
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,344
I won't give up on mine either.

530
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,929
I'll protect both my dream and you.

531
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,390
This is the best option. Please trust me.

532
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,392
I did trust you.

533
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,770
Up until now, that is.

534
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,772
Then keep trusting me!

535
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,658
Do you have to take it this far?

536
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,288
Take good care of Ms. Kang
before things get worse.

537
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,249
Tae-jun!

538
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,127
Hello, everyone. I hope this goes well.

539
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,218
Hello, everyone.

540
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,805
I'm Jeong Eun-hui, and I've been
appointed as the spokesperson

541
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,056
for the Daehan Party.

542
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,432
DAEHAN PARTY EXECUTIVE OFFICE

543
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,227
I feel a great sense of responsibility
for taking on an important duty

544
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,270
in such an important time.

545
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,565
I will do my best to make sure
the people of our country

546
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,901
will be able to love and trust our party
more than before.

547
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,403
I will fulfill my duty

548
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,405
-as the spokesperson
-Just accept it, ma'am.

549
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,657
Even the bill got postponed.

550
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,991
If you also get dismissed from--

551
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,869
Then that will end my term
as an assemblywoman.

552
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,162
I will communicate a lot more.

553
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,290
Unjust condemnations will be dealt
with harsh criticism.

554
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,584
And logical criticism will be dealt
with realistic and...

555
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,006
Did you take care of it?

556
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,342
You don't look so happy.

557
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,517
Mr. Jang, I have everything ready
for the public hearing.

558
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,145
-Where's Mr. Song?
-He just left.

559
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,772
Bring the rest of the materials.
I'll see you there.

560
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,315
Okay.

561
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,612
-He works at Uigwang City Hall.
-I see.

562
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,906
-I'm sorry for being late.
-You must be busy.

563
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,450
We're grateful that you came.

564
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,828
The hearing has just begun.
Let us go inside.

565
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,705
-This way, please.
-Sure.

566
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,042
You said this project

567
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,128
should be implemented
for the sake of this community.

568
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,839
But how can a project
that disregards its people

569
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,048
do good for their community?

570
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,384
They can't do business elsewhere
during the construction,

571
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,719
and the rent will increase.

572
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,471
You know that these merchants
can't return here.

573
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,308
Did you begin this project
to kick out the merchants

574
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,143
-and to increase the rent?
-Why is he here?

575
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,438
The redevelopment
also involves Seongjin City.

576
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,190
He probably wants to have a say.

577
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,567
If you call this is a win-win situation,

578
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,444
you probably don't know
what that phrase means.

579
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,322
-Do not proceed without an alternative.
-Ma'am.

580
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,073
-You must
-The man on the left

581
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,117
-persuade them first.
-is the man I talked about.

582
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,744
I suggest that you proceed

583
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,664
-after you come to an agreement.
-He's repeating textbook lines.

584
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,833
He's going to mention the rent.

585
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,586
If we establish a regulation
to prevent an increase in the rent

586
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,796
and let the landlords and tenants
sign an agreement,

587
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,841
we can drop the rent increase
from ten percent to five percent.

588
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,761
We already decided to do this.
Why should we stop it?

589
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,429
-You all agreed!
-He's right.

590
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,598
Why do you think we've waited until now?

591
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,184
We couldn't repair our building
because of the redevelopment

592
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,561
-even when our roofs leaked.
-They want us to lower the rent

593
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,647
and fix the building because it's too old.

594
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,524
-We lost so much money like that!
-We couldn't even do business!

595
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,070
-We're just trying to survive together!
-You have to let the community live!

596
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,364
-Enough gambling with the compensation!
-What?

597
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,406
The compensation?

598
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,243
What's the point
of preparing for the hearing?

599
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,036
The public hearing is a mess.

600
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,330
-Stop saying that!
-Let us go, Mr. Song.

601
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,165
I said that's not the case!
What's with you?

602
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,125
They asked us to lower the rent

603
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,378
and be considerate.
Do you know how much we suffered?

604
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,921
What? What did you say?

605
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,590
Is it our fault that this is happening?

606
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,050
We have to make a living also!

607
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,778
It looks like Mr. Oh planned this.

608
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,239
I found this
as I looked over the budget...

609
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,865
for Seoul and Uigwang Expressway.

610
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,128
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

611
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,505
The public hearing is going smoothly.

612
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,844
Yes, if you convince
the rest of the landlords,

613
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,221
the expressway project will be
on the fast track to success.

614
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,392
They're fighting each other now.

615
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,312
What are you doing, you jerk?

616
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,355
Hello?

617
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,816
Why are you glaring at me?

618
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,276
Your eyes might pop out.

619
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,988
-What are you doing?
-What do you think? Working, you idiot.

620
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,490
Mr. Song told me
to deal with Seobuk Market!

621
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,576
If it's Mr. Song's business,
no one man is in charge.

622
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,370
Also, you can't take
all the credit forever.

623
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,205
I want to receive credit from him too.

624
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,416
You're not in the position to say that.

625
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,585
-What?
-Do you think I don't know the reason?

626
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,380
Your father owns a piece of land
where the expressway will be built.

627
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,133
Does Mr. Song know about this?

628
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,343
LAND REGISTER

629
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,098
Hey, come on.

630
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,354
We need to make money with these things
while working for assemblymen.

631
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,731
We don't get bonuses or extra pay.

632
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,232
We have to do this to...

633
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:24,028
Why do you pretend like you're so clean?
Everyone else makes extra money like me!

634
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,738
No, it's only you.

635
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,367
-Do you want me to tell Mr. Song myself?
-You little jerk. I'll show you...

636
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,539
If you want to keep the benefits you have,
then learn to behave.

637
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,844
Thank you so much for coming.

638
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,347
-Goodbye.
-Sure. Great work.

639
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,431
Thank you.

640
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,270
Sir, please reconsider
the Seoul and Uigwang Expressway project.

641
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,271
Just go ahead with it.

642
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,899
That project failed
to pass the validity test.

643
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,276
We can say that we're doing it
to keep the regional balance.

644
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,986
Merchants are going to support that, too.

645
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,365
There are less than ten merchants who own
their stores or a piece of land there.

646
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,992
This will cause more serious conflict
between the merchants.

647
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,285
I'll meet Mr. Hwang again...

648
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,664
I thought you were smarter than this.

649
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,374
Don't you want to take over Uigwang City?

650
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,418
If you want to do politics,
calculate the numbers.

651
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,962
Those ten people
have half of the ballots in Uigwang City.

652
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,922
Then you already know what you should do.

653
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,093
It's easier to do business
after you split up a tightly-knit group.

654
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,053
Don't mind them and keep it going.

655
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,013
Then they will get dispersed naturally.

656
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,690
Are you Mr. Jang Tae-jun?

657
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,777
-Yes.
-Goodness.

658
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,447
I heard that you are a competent man.

659
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,157
Please help me

660
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,784
so that I can keep doing business
at the market

661
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,327
with my grandson.

662
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,372
I ask of you, sir.

663
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,499
Please help us out.

664
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,377
I ask of you. Please.

665
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,829
Don't you want to take over Uigwang City?

666
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,373
If you're going to do politics,
calculate the numbers.

667
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,836
Those ten people have
half of the ballots in Uigwang City.

668
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,477
Let me pour you a glass.

669
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,112
Was it your plan

670
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,115
to ruin the public hearing?

671
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,993
I told you that it wasn't.

672
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,038
Then you should have taken a measure
in advance.

673
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,581
Why did you stand idle?

674
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,961
Those landlords
are also part of Uigwang City.

675
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,214
Of course,
they can claim their legal rights.

676
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,051
Remember the people before the law!

677
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,346
You stopped seeing those people
because you're blinded by political games!

678
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,645
A redevelopment?

679
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,522
It's great.

680
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,732
The town will be cleaner.
There will be broader roads.

681
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,318
People who live here
wouldn't want to live like this either.

682
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,655
It's so old and cramped
with barely any space for people to pass.

683
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,704
Do you know why these people
live in such cramped conditions?

684
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,332
Because they feel anxious
unless they live as a group.

685
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,793
They needed to learn how to survive

686
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,671
and live through harsh times together.

687
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,048
Because they don't know
when they will get kicked out.

688
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,259
Do you have to

689
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,971
split them up

690
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,181
and make the lights in the market go out?

691
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,855
My mother also worked in a market
from early morning!

692
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,857
Do you think I don't know how they feel?

693
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,317
If you know that,

694
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,069
you should have dealt with this already!

695
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,614
Damn it.

696
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,036
I mean, this isn't something
we can resolve

697
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,498
just because you and I know how they feel.

698
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,923
I'm leaving.

699
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,302
I'll take you home.

700
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,387
Forget it. I don't need you.

701
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,056
I'm leaving alone.

702
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,935
-Mr. Lee.
-Mr. Lee.

703
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,313
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

704
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,230
I'm fine.

705
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,904
Darn it.

706
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,367
-Mr. Lee.
-I'm fine.

707
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,452
I can go alone.

708
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,287
-I'm...
-Mr. Lee.

709
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,748
Gosh, darn it.

710
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,334
You two can go first.

711
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,294
I'll take him home.

712
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,588
-Forget it. I can go by myself.
-Go home.

713
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,465
-I'll be fine.
-Darn you.

714
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,967
Hey. Let go of me.

715
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,980
Mr. Jang has nothing to do with this,

716
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,565
does he?

717
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,401
No.

718
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,529
I'm relieved.

719
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,784
I was worried
that he might be behind this.

720
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,830
Why do you like him so much?

721
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,545
Back in high school,

722
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,381
my father was hospitalized
because of an industrial accident.

723
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,342
But he couldn't prove
he was injured at work,

724
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,469
so our family had a difficult time.

725
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,805
That's when he helped us out.

726
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,598
He did?

727
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,142
Yes.

728
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,978
It happened long ago,

729
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,397
so I don't think he remembers me.

730
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,818
As much as he helped out our family,

731
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,529
I want to be that someone
for another person.

732
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,531
That's why I came to work here.

733
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,367
I'm not competent enough though.

734
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,312
Get some more sleep.

735
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,731
I'll wake you once we're there.

736
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,359
I'll take care of myself.

737
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,405
By the way, what happened to Ms. Kang?

738
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,781
I heard the bill didn't pass.

739
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,658
Is something going on
between her and Mr. Song?

740
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,661
You need to stop caring
about other people's offices.

741
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,499
And

742
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,126
look at your shoes.

743
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,921
-They're so ragged.
-What's so bad about these?

744
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,632
You're the one who should stop caring.

745
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,634
You always nag at me.

746
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,518
You said your mother
also worked in a market.

747
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,690
When my father
lost all of our money in an election,

748
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,693
she worked in a market
from early morning to support me.

749
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,029
Then you must know

750
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,949
how difficult this must be for them.

751
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,534
I do.

752
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,702
When I was a kid,

753
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:15,499
I just thought the lights in the market
looked pretty.

754
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,209
But one day,

755
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,465
I realized how hard she had to work

756
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,801
to light up her humble little store.

757
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,014
We see that the lights in the market
are going out one after the other,

758
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,183
but it's very hard
to light them up again one by one.

759
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,812
We need to make this into a place
where the lights will never go out.

760
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,612
I desperately hope for that.

761
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,700
PENDING PROJECTS FOR JUNGIL-GU

762
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,785
SUPPORT PLAN
FOR LONE-PARENT FAMILIES IN JUNGIL-GU

763
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,551
Hey, Mr. Jang.

764
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,597
I'd like to have lunch with Mr. Song.

765
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,890
Reserve a good sashimi place.

766
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,141
-Okay, sir.
-Good.

767
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:58,935
Hey, Ms. Kang.

768
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,026
You should've been satisfied to work
as the spokeswoman with your great looks.

769
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,195
Why did you act up?
It's about time you became quiet.

770
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,072
You're the one who got this far

771
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,824
thanks to my great looks.

772
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,076
What?

773
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,952
I can't congratulate you
on your nomination

774
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,538
as the floor leader.

775
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,547
Has she gone mad?

776
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,216
What is she talking about?

777
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,134
This is unbelievable.

778
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,345
See you later.

779
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,033
The doors are opening.

780
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,757
Thank you for giving up on your position
as the spokesperson.

781
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,347
I looked into the positions
that you may be able to take.

782
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:18,890
Please read through it.

783
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,479
Thank you.

784
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,210
I like the side dishes.

785
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,675
-They're here.
-Sorry for being late.

786
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,135
-Goodness.
-Hello, sir.

787
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,428
-Welcome.
-How have you been?

788
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,763
Hello.

789
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,891
-Mr. Jo. You haven't changed.
-Thank you for coming.

790
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,434
Hello.

791
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,602
Hello.

792
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,104
You still look the same, Mr. Song.

793
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,189
It's thanks to you.

794
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,524
The Blue House has nominated
Assemblyman Song Hui-seop

795
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,985
of the Daehan Party
for the Minister of Justice.

796
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,696
Mr. Song is from Uigwang City,
Gyeonggi-do.

797
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,449
He became a prosecutor in Seoul
District Prosecutors' Office in 1982

798
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,619
-and served as a deputy chief prosecutor.
-Why are you watching this?

799
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,578
It'll only hurt you.

800
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,038
When will the Judiciary Committee meeting
be held?

801
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,124
At 2:00 p.m. Ms. Kang, you should give up.

802
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,252
I'll work harder to find another agenda.

803
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,963
No, I'll continue to fight.

804
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,089
Pardon?

805
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,634
This is only the beginning.

806
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,555
I'll protect both my dream and you.

807
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,140
This is the best option.

808
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,643
-Please trust me.
-I did trust you.

809
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,230
-Up until now, that is.
-Then keep trusting me!

810
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,398
No one can guarantee your position
as a spokeswoman.

811
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,943
Only the floor leader has the power,
and you know that.

812
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,904
But I will help your bill
pass the Judiciary committee.

813
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,615
Mr. Song needs Mr. Jo
to become the Minister of Justice.

814
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,535
Now that they've joined hands,
we have only one option.

815
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,580
It's the chairperson.

816
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,709
-Mr. Lee Sang-guk?
-Only Mr. Jo will benefit

817
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,795
from the fight between us.

818
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,173
Now we need to make
Mr. Jo and Mr. Lee fight.

819
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,305
INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION PROMOTION LAW
AMENDMENT BILL

820
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,437
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SANG-GUK

821
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,650
Ms. Kang, what brings you here?

822
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,943
I have something to tell you.

823
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,444
Can you spare a minute?

824
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,655
You can talk to me
about the lone-parent bill next time.

825
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,575
-I have to go to a meeting soon.
-It'll only take ten minutes.

826
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,953
Take a seat.

827
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,589
I heard that you agreed
with the purpose of my bill.

828
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,842
-Isn't that true?
-Just because I agree with the purpose

829
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,844
doesn't mean that the bill can be passed.

830
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,387
Is it because of Mr. Song?

831
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,056
Ms. Kang.

832
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,601
How much do you trust him?

833
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,228
I must go.

834
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,563
We can discuss this later.

835
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,356
If you leave now,

836
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,651
you will not get your position
as the floor leader.

837
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,613
Mr. Lee does not know

838
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,908
Mr. Jo made the deal with Mr. Song
to get the floor leader position.

839
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,200
We can make use of that.

840
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,369
We still have five minutes left.

841
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,914
What do you want to do?

842
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,546
The Blue House said Mr. Song is
most suitable as the Minister of Justice

843
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,300
who must work in close relationship
with the National Assembly.

844
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,469
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Sure, thank you.

845
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,304
They believe he is the perfect candidate

846
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,598
-to meet the public's expectations.
-Congratulations.

847
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,183
Thank you.

848
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:52,938
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG

849
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:04,240
JANG TAE-JUN

850
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,913
The drink is sweet with great food.

851
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,083
That's why I had them make this
especially for us.

852
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,252
We get to eat such precious food
thanks to you, Mr. Song.

853
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,796
Don't say that.

854
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,174
Please help out the government
in many ways, Mr. Song.

855
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,592
Of course.

856
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,260
I will be the Minister of Justice,

857
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:28,640
and Mr. Jo will be the floor leader.

858
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,809
-So what are you worried about?
-I feel reassured.

859
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,481
So this is why
Mr. Song has been avoiding me.

860
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,404
-Have some more.
-Sure.

861
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,655
JANG TAE-JUN

862
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,786
Mr. Jo is

863
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,455
a man with many flaws.

864
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,458
He lost the trust within the ruling party
because of his son's scandal.

865
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,085
I think he isn't as competent as you

866
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,129
to become the floor leader.

867
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,798
Does this mean

868
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,135
you will give me your support?

869
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,680
That depends on your decision.

870
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:14,185
I heard Mr. Jo's bill
will be discussed in today's meeting.

871
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,111
As you can see on the data,
once the bill gets passed,

872
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,280
the research facility in Mr. Jo's district

873
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,282
will receive additional financial support.

874
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,534
Naturally, people will suspect
if the favor was granted.

875
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:34,289
I don't think it's necessary for you

876
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,374
to take such a political risk.

877
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,168
We only need one person

878
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,879
to suffer from this.

879
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,890
The lone-parent support bill

880
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,517
has passed the Judiciary Committee.

881
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:58,146
-The bill was put on hold the day before,
-What? What happened?

882
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,981
-but with Chairperson Lee's effort,
-Ms. Kang.

883
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,316
-it finally passed.
-You're back.

884
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,444
-Most bills that pass the committee...
-Ms. Kang.

885
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,738
-What happened?
-get approved in the plenary session.

886
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,239
It's a great bill.

887
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,451
Chairperson Lee
recognized the value of that bill.

888
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,245
The lone-parent support bill,
which passed the committee today,

889
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,707
is absolutely necessary
for low-income single parents

890
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,876
who are in the blind spot
of the welfare system.

891
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,879
This law will greatly

892
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,591
help the lone-parent families
who need financial support.

893
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,176
-This is great!
-Great job!

894
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,427
-Good work.
-My gosh.

895
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,388
-Congratulations, Ms. Kang.
-Great work.

896
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,682
-My gosh.
-That was tough.

897
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,267
Once the bill gets the final passage,

898
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,479
there will be a huge increase
in the number of lone-parent households

899
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,856
who can enjoy the benefit

900
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,944
-of additional childcare support.
-I had a great time.

901
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,862
-Okay.
-The food was really good.

902
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,531
-Thank you.
-Let's meet again next time.

903
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,158
-It was nice meeting you.
-Keep up the good work.

904
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,326
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

905
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,286
-Okay.
-I'll get going.

906
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,752
Sir, the lone-parent support bill
has been passed.

907
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,004
What about Mr. Jo's bill?

908
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,715
The Industrial Innovation Law

909
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,801
has come to look like what it is today

910
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,928
after many discussions.

911
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,139
Mr. Jo's amendment

912
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,724
may favor a certain research facility.

913
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,185
-Do you think Mr. Song will stay quiet?
-Don't worry.

914
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,854
Once he gets what he wants,
he'll abandon Mr. Jo.

915
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,441
I believe we must reconsider
the amendment.

916
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:30,405
Mr. Lee also spent quite a number of years
in the National Assembly.

917
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,866
-I knew he wouldn't just sit around.
-What should I do?

918
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,284
Leave it.

919
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,619
I'm about to become a minister.

920
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,997
There's no reason to provoke him now.

921
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,501
If Mr. Jo and Mr. Lee get into a fight,

922
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,003
it won't be bad for me.

923
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,133
Mr. Jo is going to be desperate.

924
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,052
Mr. Jo's amendment

925
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,722
may favor a certain research facility.

926
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,142
-We must reconsider the amendment.
-Damn it, this jerk is so annoying.

927
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,185
-Darn it!
-Goodness!

928
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,355
Damn it!

929
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,774
Damn it, seriously?

930
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,735
Mr. Song, that little...

931
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,363
By the way,

932
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,742
Mr. Lee wouldn't
have done this all by himself.

933
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,578
Was it Ms. Kang?

934
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,833
She sure is sly.

935
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,463
-We did it!
-Yes!

936
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,840
-Yes!
-All right!

937
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,175
I can't believe this.

938
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,844
-My gosh.
-I can't believe this.

939
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,305
-Great work.
-Good job.

940
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,808
-The Judiciary Committee
-How did it get passed?

941
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,894
passed the lone-parent support bill.

942
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,104
-Isn't it good news for us?
-The bill was put on hold...

943
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,648
Mr. Song made a joint motion.

944
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,858
Right. Technically,
we didn't do anything, though.

945
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,403
But why was Mr. Jo's amendment blocked?

946
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,197
Mr. Jang has been looking into that.

947
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,823
-Most bills that pass...
-Not sure.

948
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,200
Mr. Jang was looking into it?

949
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,495
Yes, he read through the bill
and the data all day yesterday.

950
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,830
The public is watching

951
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,625
if the plenary session
will be held as planned.

952
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,545
Jang Tae-jun was supposed

953
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,631
to make sure that Ms. Kang's bill
gets blocked, but it got passed.

954
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,218
He cared so much about Mr. Jo's bill,
but that was rejected.

955
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,304
Jang Tae-jun.

956
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,684
Kang Seon-yeong.

957
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,245
Let's watch a movie tonight
and grab a drink afterward.

958
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,707
Sure. See you at the theater.

959
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,734
-Hey! I caught you.
-Hello.

960
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,360
-Hey.
-Hello.

961
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,612
Are you all going home?

962
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,905
-Yes, are you going somewhere?
-Yes, a get-together.

963
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,158
We need to celebrate
since our bill has been passed.

964
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,117
Come with us.

965
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,786
Are you sure we can join you?
We just mooched off of you.

966
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,955
Then come and mooch off of us again.

967
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:26,873
Where's Tae-jun?

968
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,791
He had to go somewhere, so he left first.

969
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,003
That punk.
He's busier than the assemblymen.

970
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,504
-All right, let's go.
-Let's go.

971
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,214
Come on, Ms. Yun.

972
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,550
And Ms. No! Hurry up and come.

973
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,718
Come on, let's go.

974
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,720
Let's go.

975
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,971
Here you go.

976
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,223
Is Ms. Kang not coming?

977
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,227
She is very considerate.

978
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,771
She wanted us to eat comfortably.

979
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:50,855
Look!

980
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,484
She gave me this and left.

981
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,444
All right, let's make a toast first.

982
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,196
Okay, our...

983
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,616
Hey, thief.

984
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,868
-Yes?
-Make a toast for us.

985
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,870
A toast? Me?

986
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,211
Great work today.

987
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,546
For a better Korea! Cheers!

988
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,756
Darn it.

989
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,300
What's with him?

990
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,637
-Should I do it again?
-Of course.

991
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,185
Whatever happens to the country,

992
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,937
let's drink as if there's no tomorrow!

993
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:34,482
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

994
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:38,820
Back then,

995
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,907
I thought I would become an assemblyman.

996
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:47,328
I thought, "You can do it too, Seok-man."

997
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,122
I had such a thought.

998
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,289
But...

999
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,501
But I failed. Why?

1000
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,421
Why do you think the reason is?

1001
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,464
-Can I be frank?
-Sure.

1002
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,383
Be frank.

1003
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,096
Because of your face?

1004
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,600
What?

1005
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,519
What's wrong with my face?

1006
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,354
A squid.

1007
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,442
Have some squid.

1008
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,901
-Right.
-Open up.

1009
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,195
Darn it.

1010
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,115
I kind of feel offended.

1011
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,454
Excuse me, Ms. Yun.

1012
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,999
Why did you quit working as a reporter
to do this job?

1013
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,420
Your articles looked great.

1014
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,089
I've read a few.

1015
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,594
I didn't want to write articles anymore.

1016
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,848
The man you saw at the hospital.

1017
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,308
Mr. Shin Jae-gyeong.

1018
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,811
He ended up like that
because of my article.

1019
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,649
-Okay.
-Stop it.

1020
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,651
-More.
-Hey, drink up.

1021
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,111
-Cheers.
-Let's drink until we die.

1022
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,363
-Why did you spill your drink?
-Hey.

1023
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,440
What do you think Mr. Song will say

1024
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,651
if he finds out about
your relationship with Ms. Kang?

1025
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,654
Let's get rid of Oh Won-sik
before Mr. Song's hearing.

1026
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,655
There was an accident

1027
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,448
-at a factory in Seongjin.
-Stop them!

1028
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,742
Don't get intoxicated
with what Mr. Lee has to offer.

1029
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,203
Do you think revealing the truth
will change anything?

1030
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,914
I think Joojin Constructions is
trying to conceal what happened.

1031
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,625
It seems like they made sure
the workers don't talk.

1032
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,253
We need to give up what we're holding
to gain something bigger.
