1
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,356
Give me the information about the bribes

2
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,777
you and Mr. Song have handed out
to politicians under Mr. Sung's orders.

3
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,740
I'm the only person
who can help you right now.

4
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,038
How can I trust you?

5
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,209
How about we make a deal?

6
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,963
I can give you one thing you want.

7
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,968
That chief of staff who died...

8
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,598
He was a friend of yours, wasn't he?

9
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,443
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

10
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,029
ARREST WARRANT

11
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,827
Save me first.

12
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,039
Then I'll tell you who killed Go Seok-man.

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,877
Who was it? Who killed him?
What are you talking about?

14
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,755
-Lee Chang-jin!
-We're taking him.

15
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,424
-Who was it?
-The chief ordered him

16
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,468
-to be arrested immediately.
-Let go!

17
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,388
Lee Chang-jin!

18
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,350
Let go of me!

19
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,192
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,529
If it wasn't Lee Chang-jin...

21
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,240
It must've been
either Minister Song or Chairman Sung.

22
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,453
Mr. Jang.

23
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,960
Lee Chang-jin, CEO of Joojin Chemical,
who had been arrested

24
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,296
on suspicion of offshore tax evasion
jumped to his death

25
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,382
during an investigation
at Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

26
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,635
The prosecution had been requested
to investigate into Lee's allegations

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,430
of tax evasion in the Philippines
by the National Tax Service.

28
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,856
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
arrested Lee immediately

29
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,858
considering the scale of the crime

30
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,735
and the possibility
of tampering with evidence.

31
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,820
The Ministry of Justice announced
that it'd find out

32
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:21,367
if any coercive or inappropriate measures
were taken during the investigation.

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,625
Even if it turns out
there was no insult or harsh treatment

34
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,627
during the investigation,

35
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,129
the prosecution is likely
to face criticism

36
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,299
about repeated suspect suicides.

37
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,094
Another problem is, following
the suspect's death, the case might be

38
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,972
-terminated without the truth of the case
-What is going on?

39
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,807
-I know.
-ever coming to light.

40
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,268
This is crazy.

41
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,856
Ms. Yun, what is going to happen now?

42
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,693
If a suspect dies
during an investigation...

43
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,528
The investigation and indictment on

44
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,406
all the cases Lee Chang-jin is involved in
will be suspended.

45
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,158
And the investigation on Joojin Chemical

46
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,410
will be stopped where it is now.

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,829
It's a wrongful death.

48
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,499
How are we supposed to go on living?

49
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,175
I'm taking medication,
but it's not working.

50
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,637
It's so itchy that I can't even sleep.

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,264
There's not much we can do.

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,057
All we can do is disinfect the crops.

53
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,728
Why are you buying all the land?

54
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,647
-Did you hide the leak on purpose?
-Have you...

55
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,859
Their sad cries and tears
are buried under a death.

56
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,825
It's a world where only lies
lurk beneath the hidden truth.

57
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,915
Tragedy continues without a stop.

58
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,675
EPISODE 7 SCAPEGOAT

59
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,515
What happened?

60
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,810
The suspect wanted to go to the restroom.

61
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,979
Who was with him?

62
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,231
Third Deputy Chief was with him.

63
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,026
Third Deputy Chief?

64
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,489
Assemblyman Jang,
Youngil Group's Chairman Sung,

65
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,868
and Minister Song will be among those
you investigate.

66
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,167
But there is no clear suspicion
of wrongdoing on their part.

67
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,044
If we look into them,

68
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,672
we could be criticized
for being reckless with our authority.

69
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,965
Especially Minister Song--

70
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,426
No one is above the law.

71
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,428
Anyone who violates it

72
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,555
must be punished.

73
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,234
Third Deputy Chief
is not answering the phone.

74
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,700
Mr. Lee.

75
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,995
It wasn't easy for us to bring you around.

76
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,747
You must be having a hard time.

77
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:19,212
CAM2

78
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,673
It stopped recording after this.

79
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,593
-What about Minister Song?
-He just left the office.

80
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,852
Chief Choe, Mr. Song wishes to see you.

81
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,771
Tell him I'll come over soon.

82
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,606
Well, he's in your office right now.

83
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,276
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

84
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,284
Hand Lee Chang-jin over
to Western Prosecutors' Office.

85
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm sorry, but I intend to
investigate him here.

86
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,793
Are you saying
you'd go against the Minister of Justice?

87
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,217
Restrict the access of journalists
and send the body to the NFS.

88
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,635
Are you conducting an autopsy?

89
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,012
A suspect died under investigation.

90
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,639
We have to determine his cause of death.

91
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,017
Get his family's consent
on the autopsy and get on with it. Now!

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,269
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,129
CHAIRMAN SUNG

94
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,389
What have we been doing?

95
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,351
All that for nothing.

96
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,436
Mr. Lee.

97
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,772
What do we do about the news release
about Mr. Lee Chang-jin?

98
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,982
Why do you even ask?

99
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,109
Who'd take it in a situation like this?

100
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,408
What did the assemblypeople say?
Are they having a meeting?

101
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,494
No.

102
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,454
You all can go home now.

103
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,921
I'll get going then.

104
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,506
See you.

105
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,342
Bye.

106
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,393
Aren't you going home, Da-jeong?

107
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,687
I need to finish this first.

108
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,452
Bye.

109
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,141
Is there really nothing we can do?

110
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
What about the victims?

111
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,318
They've trusted and followed us so far.

112
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,821
We won't give up just like this.

113
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,824
We have to show them.

114
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,329
That we are still fighting
without giving up.

115
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,457
We still have a chance.

116
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,795
A chance? You said that Mr. Lee's death
will close down all his cases...

117
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,381
That's true. But it doesn't mean

118
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,050
the slush fund of Minister Song
and Chairman Sung is gone.

119
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,846
If the string to Lee Chang-jin is cut,
we can find another string.

120
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,518
This is Minister Song's property statement
submitted for the hearing.

121
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,688
All his family and relatives
including himself

122
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,648
were clean.

123
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,151
Who do you think has been
managing the money?

124
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,571
If it's not his family or relatives,
there must be only one.

125
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,657
-Someone closest to him.
-Mr. Oh Won-sik.

126
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,326
What about Oh's property statement?

127
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,995
There was nothing suspicious
about his declared property.

128
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,372
We will get his travel history
and detailed tax data

129
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,999
from the National Tax Service tomorrow.

130
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,918
It's Minister Song
who's more anxious than we are right now.

131
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,130
The more he tries to hide the truth,
the more intimidating a weapon it becomes.

132
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,341
It's still worth trying.

133
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,900
My sweet Seung-a.

134
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,744
Well...

135
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,503
Tae-sik's family is coming too?

136
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,131
No, Seung-a. I told you not to use Korean
even when you talk to me.

137
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,384
Do you know how much money
I spent to send you there?

138
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,190
Seung-a, okay?

139
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,489
Hey, honey. You can't just buy anything.

140
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,032
Buy only what you need.

141
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,701
I'm not telling you
to cut down on everything.

142
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,245
Why can't you understand what I say?

143
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,080
Okay. I should get going now.

144
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,040
I'll be there when I have some time.

145
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,000
Why would you ask me that?

146
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,014
-What about Chairman Sung?
-He's just arrived.

147
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,359
Something happened
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office?

148
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,528
Did you not hear about Mr. Lee Chang-jin?

149
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,113
What?

150
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,872
LEE CHANG-JIN, CEO OF JOOJIN CHEMICAL,
COMMITS SUICIDE UNDER INVESTIGATION

151
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,971
Here.

152
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,190
I guess they were expecting three people.

153
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,985
Those who are supposed to leave

154
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,903
must leave.

155
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,906
I'll see to it that a company

156
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,658
is taken to the grave with Mr. Lee.

157
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,369
You don't have to worry.

158
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,413
Yes, sir.

159
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,958
That's enough about Mr. Lee. Are you sure

160
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,337
the National Assembly won't make
a big deal out of it?

161
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,923
I'm talking about Jang Tae-jun.

162
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,635
We have to make sure
the fire is completely out.

163
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,097
A fire might break out in ashes
that went out three years ago.

164
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,682
Please don't worry.

165
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,063
I'll make sure Tae-jun is taken to
Mr. Lee's grave as well.

166
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,668
Mr. Go's case was closed as suicide.

167
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,336
I know. I heard.

168
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,631
Tae-jun.

169
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,925
Are you connected to this case?

170
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,764
If I tell you I'm not,
will you believe me?

171
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,017
No, I won't.

172
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,520
-Seon-yeong.
-If you are

173
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,274
connected to this case in any way,

174
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,733
I can never forgive you.

175
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm sorry I doubted you.

176
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,620
I don't deserve an apology from you.

177
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,791
About Seok-man's case.

178
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,253
It's my fault that I didn't stop it.

179
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,174
I'm the one to blame.

180
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,428
Chief Choe, do you admit there was
a problem supervising the suspect?

181
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,679
What was the situation like?

182
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,974
With the case where Lee Chang-jin,
CEO of Joojin Chemical,

183
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,226
committed suicide
during the prosecution's investigation,

184
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:41,607
there have been calls to hold
Chief Choe Gyeong-cheol responsible.

185
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,234
Chief Choe offered an apology

186
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,695
for not managing a suspect properly.

187
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,324
He also promised to investigate
the details of the case thoroughly

188
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,660
-not to leave any doubt,
-This is the data about Mr. Oh.

189
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,620
but it seems hard
to evade the responsibility.

190
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,747
I'll share it with Assemblywoman Kang.

191
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,665
Okay.

192
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,126
And new personnel appointments
were just announced in the prosecution.

193
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,672
Third Deputy Chief and Seo Hyeong-cheol
of Western Prosecutors' Office were moved

194
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,049
to the Anti-Corruption Unit
of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

195
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,220
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

196
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,648
TRANSFER OF PERSONNEL

197
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,858
Do we have the autopsy results?

198
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,362
Why? What's wrong?

199
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,614
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
is stopping the autopsy.

200
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,574
The corpse is already moved to a hospital.

201
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,452
They are going to cremate it
after holding a funeral.

202
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,629
Minister Song is trying to

203
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,008
control the investigation
with the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

204
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,636
Is it Mr. Yang who leaked our information?

205
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,514
We can't be sure yet.

206
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,599
Tell him to look into

207
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,060
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
and the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

208
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,187
Yes, sir.

209
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,113
-Mr. Han.
-Yes.

210
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,784
Mr. Han.

211
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,704
Where are you going?

212
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,622
Assemblyman Jang's office.

213
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,833
We're having a meeting with him.

214
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,717
-Please review them carefully.
-Okay.

215
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,719
Mr. Yang.

216
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,513
Can you check the situation
at the prosecution?

217
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,808
Sure.

218
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,291
I heard there's a meeting at your office.
I guess you didn't go.

219
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,417
Right.

220
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,087
They've been having meetings
only with Ms. Yun these days.

221
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,924
I guess they are still working
on the Joojin Chemical case.

222
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,384
It's strange
that they're doing it without us.

223
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,720
I know. They even told us
to have lunch first.

224
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,975
It must be a meeting
we're not supposed to know about.

225
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,979
Please excuse me.

226
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,484
I think there's something going on.

227
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,404
Oh Won-sik has properties
in the Philippines

228
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,823
in his wife and daughter's names.

229
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,243
The date of acquisition is
April 2014 and August 2016.

230
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,328
With his immigration history,
it is estimated that

231
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,539
he purchased it
when Mr. Oh went to the Philippines.

232
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,166
He also holds quite a lot of stocks.

233
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,960
They are also in his wife's name.

234
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,422
He bought all the stocks
before the companies were listed.

235
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,800
The stock prices rose 12 times
after they were listed.

236
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,637
It is highly likely that he invested
in stocks with undisclosed information.

237
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,972
It was just timely.

238
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,308
And it is suspicious that he made several
purchases during a certain period of time.

239
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,228
With his properties in the Philippines,
how much is it?

240
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,064
The amount that's been confirmed
is more than 1.7 billion won.

241
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,821
We need to make money with these things
while working for assemblymen.

242
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,739
We don't get bonuses or extra pay.

243
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,575
We have to do this to...

244
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,620
Why do you pretend like you're so clean?
Everyone else makes extra money like me!

245
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,833
We might be able
to catch Mr. Oh with this data,

246
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,003
but can we find out Minister Song
and Chairman Sung's slush fund?

247
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,463
This isn't enough for that.

248
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,175
I bet they have bearer bonds
for their slush fund.

249
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,470
All the transactions are anonymous,
so it's not easy to track them.

250
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
Oh Won-sik is just the bait.

251
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,688
You just said bearer securities are
not easy to track.

252
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,274
Not anymore.

253
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,237
Where do you think Oh Won-sik
got the money for the stocks

254
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,698
and properties?

255
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,409
They must've realized
some of the bearer securities.

256
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,289
If we follow the money trail,
we can find the bearer securities.

257
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,105
Apparently, Tae-jun is looking
into Lee Chang-jin's slush fund.

258
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,069
What the hell is that fly still doing?
Summer's past already.

259
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,698
This is Jang Tae-jun's agent
in the police.

260
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,328
JEONG HAN-SU

261
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,165
What do we do?

262
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,584
We will cut off Tae-jun's limbs

263
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,504
so he can't even stand nor crawl.

264
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,423
Send it
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

265
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,341
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,911
Why are you trying to stop the autopsy

267
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,372
when you've already transferred
the Third Deputy Chief?

268
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
Hey.

269
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,670
Do we really have to put a scalpel
on a dead man's body?

270
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,841
Making his family sees his body
all ripped open then stitched up again,

271
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,134
won't it be too much for them?

272
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,177
If we don't determine
the exact cause of death,

273
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,679
it will arouse

274
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,598
suspicion of conspiracy or murder.

275
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,892
Murder?

276
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,521
He confessed his crime in his will.
It can't be murder.

277
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,773
Isn't it what you want to believe?

278
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,158
What is it you want to know?

279
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,457
There's only one thing
a prosecutor would want to know.

280
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,584
The truth.

281
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,921
Around the time when Mr. Lee died,

282
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,591
why did you want to see me?

283
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,677
What?

284
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,513
If you keep getting in my way,

285
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,391
it will only make me
cast doubts on you, Minister.

286
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,810
Hey, Chief Choe.

287
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,397
You can't try a shot in the dark.

288
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,735
We have to investigate the case thoroughly
so the dead can rest in peace.

289
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,737
That's what the bereaved would want.

290
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,032
It seems like you're mistaken.

291
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,161
You're not supposed
to investigate the case.

292
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,038
You should be investigated.

293
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,459
What on earth did you do

294
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,088
to make a suspect commit suicide
during an investigation?

295
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,633
You're the chief of Seoul Central
Prosecutors' Office to reform prosecution.

296
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,844
I guess I lost my brightness with age.

297
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,055
I must've misplaced my confidence.

298
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,810
You're still one of us,
so I can't just throw you away.

299
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,355
I'll let you go with
a quiet, internal audit.

300
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,482
That's that. You may leave now.

301
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,859
You have a lot to prepare.

302
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,824
Gosh, this is so shameful.

303
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,577
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

304
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,166
HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE UNIT ONE JEONG HAN-SU

305
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,460
Mr. Jeong, the Commissioner
wants to see you.

306
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,129
The Commissioner?

307
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,507
-What is it about?
-I'm not sure,

308
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,426
but the deputy chief prosecutor
is meeting with him now.

309
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,102
This is sooner than I expected.

310
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,896
Oh, right.

311
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,607
Here.

312
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,027
Send this to Assemblyman Jang's office.

313
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,446
Yes, sir.

314
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,209
INTELLIGENCE BUREAU

315
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,841
It's been a long time.

316
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,641
Mr. Oh must've realized the securities
right before buying

317
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,518
the properties and stocks.

318
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,604
Find the transaction statements
and check the dates.

319
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,856
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

320
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,378
-What's the matter?
-The prosecutors smelled a rat.

321
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,881
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office is on it.

322
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:15,138
This might be our last conversation.
So I just wanted to say bye.

323
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,768
I deleted all the information about you.
You don't have to worry.

324
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,311
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,190
-Are you--
-You don't have to apologize.

326
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,485
It's not like I did it only for you.

327
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,073
I sent you a document.

328
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,742
I hope it will help.

329
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,578
-I'm hanging up.
-Hello?

330
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,180
I thought something stank.
I guess it was you.

331
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,225
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

332
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,782
A police official has allegedly
leaked confidential data

333
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,035
and forwarded it to
an incumbent Assemblyman.

334
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,706
The prosecution has secured
circumstantial evidence

335
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,292
that Jeong, the head of
Intelligence Unit One handed

336
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,545
classified data and investigation data
over to the Assemblyman

337
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,380
and started an investigation.

338
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,634
The Anti-Corruption and Violent
Crimes Unit investigating the case...

339
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,763
...will find out how the assemblyman
obtained and used the data.

340
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,224
If it turns out to be used
for his personal use,

341
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,852
the prosecution will summon him
for an investigation.

342
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,603
If he used it for public use...

343
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,940
We're looking into it.
We have nothing to say.

344
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,443
Please don't publish unconfirmed...

345
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,322
There are other assemblymen
who are from the Police College.

346
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,365
We can't tell you anything
when we know nothing.

347
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,701
-We will call you once it's confirmed.
-Please.

348
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,202
Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun's office.

349
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,495
Yes, please speak.

350
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,872
Is the news true?

351
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,291
What is going on?

352
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,375
Don't worry.

353
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,419
They can't summon me for the time being.

354
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,962
Tae-jun.

355
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,214
I'll tell you the details later.

356
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,759
We have to hurry.

357
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,805
I'll look into the banking transactions.

358
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,143
If we get lucky, we might find out
Mr. Oh's borrowed-name bank accounts.

359
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,811
Okay. Please do that.

360
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,480
I'll deal with Oh Won-sik.

361
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,940
What are you going to do?

362
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,777
I should make him useful.

363
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,409
The door is closing.

364
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,877
It's me.

365
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,879
Would you like to have a meal with me?

366
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:59,177
Of course I'll be there
if you treat me to a nice meal.

367
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,221
Where shall we meet?

368
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,318
You're eating well.

369
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,363
I thought you'd be too stressed to eat
with all that's been going on.

370
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,783
-Did you not see the news yet?
-I did.

371
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,703
Such things are apt to happen.

372
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,040
I wonder what made you buy me a meal.

373
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,918
I feel so uncomfortable
that I might get an upset stomach.

374
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,047
You think you'd never get
an upset stomach.

375
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,676
What do you mean?

376
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,722
I was going to give you this
after you're done.

377
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,935
This is a gift to you.

378
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,982
I owe you about my father.
I should return the favor.

379
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,572
My property details?

380
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,286
A hell of a retirement plan you got there.

381
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,960
You seem to have too much free time,
digging around me like this.

382
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,712
I'm not interested in your properties.

383
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,548
I just want to know
where the money came from.

384
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,634
If you don't tell me,

385
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,053
I'll make reporters find it out.

386
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,473
There will be articles tomorrow morning.

387
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,101
"Oh Won-sik, Policy Adviser
to Minister Song involved

388
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,855
in questionable stock transactions
using undisclosed information."

389
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,108
-Jang Tae-jun.
-"And...

390
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,321
property speculation in the Philippines
by realizing bearer bonds."

391
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,283
What would Minister Song say

392
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,952
when he finds out
that you messed with the bearer bonds?

393
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,959
What do you think you're doing?

394
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,795
The deadline is tomorrow.

395
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,007
Give me the details of the slush fund
of Minister Song and Chairman Sung.

396
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,551
How would I know that?

397
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,595
If you don't, you have to find one.

398
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,222
Once this breaks out,

399
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,516
do you think
Minister Song will protect you?

400
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,645
You saw what happened to Mr. Lee.

401
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,777
PHILIPPINES HOME

402
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,073
PHILIPPINES HOME, ONE MISSED CALL

403
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,578
You have to protect yourself
and your family, not Minister Song.

404
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,508
Minister Song is trying to
put you in a coffin now.

405
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,009
Do you think you can stop him?

406
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,470
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
will investigate you soon.

407
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,098
And you will stop it for me.

408
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,934
What? Why would I?

409
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,936
Once they investigate me,

410
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,438
the data will become public.

411
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,735
We don't have much time,
but you got yourself one more thing to do.

412
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,160
Please take your time and finish
your meal. You'll need it to work harder.

413
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,290
BILL

414
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,337
Damn it!

415
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,674
OH WON-SIK'S ASSET STATEMENT

416
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,853
His story was on the news.
Is everything all right?

417
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,398
I'm doing everything I can to stop it.
What's the prosecution up to?

418
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,483
It's quite a mess.

419
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,110
I heard the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

420
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,987
is planning an internal investigation
on the Chief Prosecutor.

421
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,906
Also, deputy chief prosecutors

422
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,783
aren't following
the Chief Prosecutor's orders.

423
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,577
And it looks like the Lee Chang-jin case

424
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,746
will be transferred
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

425
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,790
-I'll update Mr. Jang.
-I already did.

426
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,211
Didn't Mr. Jang request this?

427
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,673
He did. Well done.

428
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,302
Did you find the spy?

429
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,682
I guess you couldn't yet.

430
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,185
I'm concerned.

431
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,605
You can't continue holding secret meetings
when people are watching.

432
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,608
You're still not going to let me know
what it's about?

433
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,818
I thought I was off your suspect list.

434
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,241
I'm sorry about that incident.

435
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,534
But,

436
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,204
I still don't trust you.

437
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,415
I appreciate your honesty.

438
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,709
But you should find the spy soon.

439
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,463
It looks like other staff members
started to sense what's going on.

440
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:49,759
Once they find out that they're being
suspected, it might offend them.

441
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,511
Then,

442
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,180
can you help me with that?

443
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,558
Well, I'm not sure if I can be helpful,

444
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:02,313
but if I were to find the spy,
I would suspect that person the most.

445
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,733
Only one person pops into my head.

446
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,819
No clue yet?

447
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,201
-Ms. No.
-Yes.

448
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,287
Could you make ten copies
and bind them together?

449
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,748
The member on the chief of staff handles

450
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,002
all the paperwork and schedules
of the assemblyman or woman.

451
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,211
The administrative secretary.

452
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,879
Sure.

453
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,641
Ms. No

454
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,436
can read all the documents in the office.

455
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,398
Even if she enters Mr. Jang's office,
no one would suspect her.

456
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,316
And she also worked for Mr. Song.

457
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:52,697
Mr. Jang handpicked her.
We've been working together for long, too.

458
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,867
She has never done anything
to raise suspicions from me.

459
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,536
Is that so?

460
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,457
Then, why did you suspect me the most
in the very beginning?

461
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,418
Wasn't it because of Ms. No?

462
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,761
Yesterday, Mr. Yang asked if
he could see the office ledgers,

463
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,722
and I couldn't say no.

464
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,933
I thought I should tell you though.

465
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,158
Mr. Jang.

466
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,203
Reporters have been calling
about the information leakage.

467
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,456
Tell them we'll take strong action against
any articles on unconfirmed information.

468
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,166
Then, they won't publish the articles now.

469
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,376
We can't get bogged down here.

470
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,419
Will that work?

471
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,131
But if your name is mentioned,
the prosecution will disclose it first.

472
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,258
He's not the type to talk.

473
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,889
Isn't it true that you leaked information?

474
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,977
Tell me who you leaked the information to!

475
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,521
Answer me.

476
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,858
I know he'll try to buy time for me.
Keep the reporters at bay until then.

477
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,985
Yes, sir. Also,

478
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,904
I think I found the leak.

479
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,533
What should I do?

480
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,868
Spill some information,

481
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,913
and catch them red-handed.

482
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,915
Yes, sir.

483
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,423
What's going on?

484
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,552
We're setting up a trap.

485
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,555
We must catch the mole.

486
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,890
What about you?

487
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,271
-Ms. No.
-Yes.

488
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,566
Give this to Bill Information, please.

489
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,527
It's important, so make sure
you hand it to the head of the department.

490
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,778
Yes, I will.

491
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,304
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

492
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,318
Yes, sir.

493
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,029
You helped me a lot.

494
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,156
So I should return the favor, too.

495
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,450
Yes. Okay. I see.

496
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,916
Ms. Yun must trust you a lot
to delegate an important task.

497
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,173
Where's the file?

498
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,932
Yes, sir. I just sent the file
to your department. Did you receive it?

499
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,935
He took it back
because he said it had to be revised.

500
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,603
Who did?

501
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,856
Okay.

502
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,112
He just left Bill Information.

503
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,489
Okay.

504
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,158
I guess the mole is in the trap.

505
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,619
Let's go see him.
He couldn't have gotten far.

506
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,754
There's no point in reading that.

507
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,758
Nothing is written on it.

508
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,439
I didn't know
you were the mole, Mr. Jeong.

509
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,206
We need more data than what we have now.

510
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,421
Mr. Han is looking into accounts
that could have been borrowed.

511
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,174
For now, there's no way to tell
if those accounts are borrowed or not.

512
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,468
It'll be hard to prove it
with the accounts,

513
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,097
but if the account holder speaks up,
we might have a chance.

514
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,641
You want to find out
who laundered the money?

515
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,769
As we don't have evidence,
we must find witnesses.

516
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,438
Tae-jun.

517
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,273
It's dangerous to take action now.

518
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,442
They're investigating
the information leakage now.

519
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,111
If they summon you,
you have no choice but to comply.

520
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,321
It's not just about this.

521
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,115
As long as Mr. Song is the Minister,
the prosecution will be after me.

522
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,453
Stopping here
is exactly what Mr. Song wants.

523
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,169
-What about Mr. Oh?
-He worked under Mr. Song for ten years.

524
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,463
He won't be swayed that easily.

525
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,056
What happened?

526
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,895
Okay.

527
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,482
It was in my office.

528
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,487
The mole who handed
over information to Mr. Oh.

529
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,075
-Who is it?
-Mr. Jeong Min-cheol.

530
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,330
I'll keep pressuring Oh Won-sik.

531
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,415
Call me if you find anything.

532
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,722
-Thank you.
-No, I should thank you.

533
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,850
You didn't suspect me

534
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,852
unlike someone.

535
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,357
But how did you figure out
that it was Mr. Jeong?

536
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,692
She told me.

537
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,029
She said starting several days ago,
he's been helping her with a lot of tasks

538
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,989
such as making copies and cleaning.

539
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,409
You have sharp eyes.

540
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,621
I thought we were a team.
I can't believe he sold information.

541
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,957
Why did he do that?

542
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,959
He needed money.

543
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,253
His mother is at the hospital.

544
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,965
He told me she could have died
unless she had the surgery right away.

545
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,678
Hello, sir.

546
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,363
This is killing me.

547
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,868
CEO OF JOOJIN CHEMICAL COMMITS SUICIDE

548
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,912
Once this breaks out,

549
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,206
do you think
Minister Song will protect you?

550
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,252
You saw what happened to Mr. Lee.

551
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,095
Sir. Mr. Song wants to speak with you.

552
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,597
He's here?

553
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,103
Sir. Did you ask for me?

554
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,897
I heard you had a meal with Tae-jun.

555
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,983
-Yes.
-For what?

556
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,487
It was nothing.

557
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,489
I think he was trying to dig around

558
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,657
the investigation on
the head of the Intelligence Unit.

559
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,743
Is that so?

560
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,120
Sir.

561
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,039
Sir.

562
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,707
Well...

563
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,294
A reporter found out that you were
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office

564
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,630
around the time
Mr. Lee jumped out the window

565
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,006
and is asking a lot of questions.

566
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,384
By any chance, do you have anything
to do with Mr. Lee's death?

567
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,933
I'll take care of it myself.

568
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,191
Send the video we recorded
as proof of Jo Gap-yeong's bribery

569
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,360
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

570
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,778
Pardon?

571
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,072
Why would you want to do that?

572
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,825
Do you have to ask?
He covered up the evidence of bribery

573
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,161
and blackmailed them
to fulfill his own selfish interests.

574
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,496
He must be punished for it.

575
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,455
Sir,

576
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,290
the video we have

577
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,001
will bring a lot of controversies
to nitpick Tae-jun's wrongdoings.

578
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,878
That doesn't matter.

579
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,256
If I add that onto the information
leakage problem he has,

580
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,174
how would the people think about him?

581
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,885
He's holding out
because he has immunity to arrests.

582
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,221
Hey, once the public
turns their back on him,

583
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,641
it will be much easier
for the prosecution to summon him.

584
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,353
Check the investigation's status
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

585
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,938
and report everything to me.

586
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,357
Also, about Choe Gyeong-cheol.

587
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,110
Keep a close eye on
what that bastard is up to.

588
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,112
Yes, sir.

589
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,453
-Won-sik.
-Yes.

590
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,497
-It's nothing.
-Okay.

591
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:05,916
Okay.

592
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,379
I'm sorry, Mr. Jang.

593
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,923
How much information did you give them?

594
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,928
I only gave them your schedule
and our materials on Joojin Chemical.

595
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,680
I swear. Nothing else.

596
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,348
When was your last contact with them?

597
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,726
It was after lunch.

598
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,437
He wanted to know how much information
we found on his assets.

599
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,190
He called me to ask for that.

600
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,984
Call him back.

601
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,904
- Pardon?
- If you're really sorry,

602
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,115
tell him exactly what I say.

603
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,539
OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE

604
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,342
All right.

605
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,306
MEMORY CARD 4GB

606
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,065
Mr. Song is trying to
put you in a coffin now.

607
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,441
Do you think you can stop him?

608
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,902
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office will
investigate you soon.

609
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,529
And you will stop it for me.

610
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,366
What? Why would I?

611
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,368
Once they investigate me,

612
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,787
the data will become public.

613
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,500
Should I hand it over or not?

614
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,210
Should I? Or should I not?

615
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,128
Should I? Or should I not?

616
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,755
Damn it!

617
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,260
MOLE

618
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,184
Hey, did you look into what I asked?

619
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,356
Yes.

620
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,485
Tell me. How much does Tae-jun know?

621
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,569
OH WON-SIK

622
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,280
Well, I'm not 100 percent sure,

623
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,784
but I think he found the account
you borrowed.

624
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,453
Really? My wife's account?

625
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,253
-Yes.
-You've got to be kidding me.

626
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,004
How did he figure that out?

627
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,385
And he's also tracking the bearer bonds
you cashed out.

628
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,095
What?

629
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,596
He'll tell the press in the morning.

630
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,185
Damn it! Shit.

631
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,524
He was managing the money
with his wife's account.

632
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,359
I'll send the recording
to the National Tax Service.

633
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,904
They'll figure out the bank and
the records of deposits and withdrawals.

634
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,614
Thank you.

635
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,425
How's the investigation
on Tae-jun's friend going?

636
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,552
He's exercising
his right to remain silent.

637
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,723
Request for a warrant and arrest him.

638
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,766
Sir, the subject of investigation

639
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,727
is the head
of the police's Intelligence Unit.

640
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,522
If they arrest him, it'll become a war
between the police and the prosecution.

641
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,025
This turned into a war a long time ago.

642
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,401
Do whatever it takes

643
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,654
to get him to mention Tae-jun's name.
Got it?

644
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,198
Yes, sir.

645
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,742
Did you send the video to Mr. Seo?

646
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,871
Yes, I did.

647
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,373
All right. Tell him
that I'll take full responsibility,

648
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,626
and tell him
to wrap things up quickly. Okay?

649
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,044
Yes, sir.

650
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:43,926
Those slowpokes.

651
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,812
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

652
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,442
This arrived for you, sir.

653
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,447
I'm sorry.

654
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,326
-Are you--
-You don't have to apologize.

655
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,829
It's not like I did it only for you.

656
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,292
I sent you a document.

657
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,711
I hope it will help.

658
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:44,027
INVESTIGATION REPORT
SEOUL SEOBU POLICE STATION

659
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:54,204
INVESTIGATION REPORT
SUMMARY

660
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,354
Hey, it's me.

661
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,734
You need to see this.

662
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,822
INVESTIGATION REPORT
SUMMARY

663
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,285
What's this?

664
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,539
That's the case report for Seok-man.

665
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,211
These cases are too similar
to say they are isolated cases.

666
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,428
What kind of case was this?

667
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,306
It was about the slush fund
for Chairman Sung of Youngil Group.

668
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,725
Who was the prosecutor in charge?

669
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,769
Minister Song.

670
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,316
The dead victim, Choe Yong-hyeon,

671
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,778
was one of the individuals
involved in the slush fund case.

672
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,492
How come no one knew about this incident?

673
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,328
Back then, people thought
that he fled Korea.

674
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,331
The case was suspended
as the suspect's whereabouts were unknown.

675
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,333
And his death was not
even covered by the press.

676
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,545
And this case had been buried,
even leaving his family clueless.

677
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,637
If we don't catch the culprit,

678
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,847
Mr. Go's case will be buried as well.

679
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,809
We can't let that happen.

680
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,023
I'll investigate this case.

681
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,858
No, it's dangerous.

682
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,860
I'll do it.

683
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,071
I must do it.

684
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,157
I must investigate this
to ask for Seok-man's forgiveness.

685
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,550
Did you find anything?

686
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,011
The police station in charge of the case
destroyed the files. I found nothing.

687
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,972
Who was in charge
of the initial investigation?

688
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,601
His name is No Jin-gi.

689
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,521
He retired now.
I heard he's living in Gangwon-do now.

690
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,107
Go meet with him
and ask him about the case.

691
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,734
Yes, sir.

692
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,166
This is Jang Tae-jun.

693
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,376
Could you spare me some of your time?

694
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,673
It looks like you have a lot on your mind.

695
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,471
I could say the same thing to you.

696
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,348
I heard they will do
an internal investigation on you.

697
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,477
Will you just sit back
and let them walk all over you?

698
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,772
I don't plan on responding
to every single accusation I get.

699
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,775
Even with the internal investigation,
nothing will change.

700
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,277
Here's the thing about Mr. Song.

701
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,029
If he doesn't find anything,

702
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,323
he forges things to find.

703
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,866
Once the investigation begins,

704
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,786
you'll have to resign
and kneel down for your life.

705
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,207
At this rate, he will be a prime candidate
for the presidential election.

706
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,751
And who knows?
He might be the president next year.

707
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,301
Even if he does become the President,
nothing will change.

708
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,471
I will continue to go after him
and try to bring him down.

709
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,891
I'm glad to hear

710
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,061
that you're ready to throw away
everything for this fight.

711
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,397
Well, I'm sure he'll have to do the same.

712
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:05,747
INVESTIGATION REPORT
SEOUL SEOBU POLICE STATION

713
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,378
You're on your way to a battlefield.
I must give you a weapon.

714
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,380
It will be helpful.

715
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,314
Ms. Kang, I think I found the accounts
Mr. Oh borrowed to hide the money.

716
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,987
There were 13 accounts
under the name of Mr. Oh's wife.

717
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,906
She opened accounts
at seven banks in total.

718
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,033
And five accounts were opened at one bank.

719
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,119
It's Samyeong Bank.

720
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,873
SAMYEONG BANK

721
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,459
If we investigate Samyeong Bank,
we'll be able to find evidence.

722
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,170
Should I send the files
to Mr. Jang's office?

723
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,550
No.

724
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,011
Don't send it yet.

725
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,763
Okay.

726
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,897
-I'll be out for a while.
-Okay.

727
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,493
Yes, Ms. Lee.

728
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,298
That head of the Intelligence Unit.
He still hasn't talked?

729
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,093
Yes, I got the police commissioner's
permission to search his office,

730
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,721
but I think he already deleted
all the traces leading to Mr. Jang.

731
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,848
What about the video?

732
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,516
Pardon?

733
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,519
I am not sure if I follow.

734
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,314
Didn't Won-sik give you the video?

735
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,358
No, he didn't.

736
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,529
Did you send the video to Mr. Seo?

737
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,659
Yes, I did.

738
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,506
Where's Won-sik?

739
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,050
He's not feeling well today.
So he's taking the day off.

740
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:32,143
Sell the house right now, and call me
when you get to the hotel in Singapore.

741
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,521
-I'm on my way now.
-What are you talking about?

742
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,731
I can't up and move right now.
What about her school?

743
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,900
We're all about to die.
That doesn't matter.

744
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,070
Just don't ask questions. Do as I say.

745
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,697
Okay.

746
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,160
MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP

747
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,163
DECLINE

748
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,584
Sir.

749
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,588
Mr. Oh bought a flight ticket to Singapore
departing at 11 a.m.

750
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,134
What is that bastard up to now?
Ban him from leaving Korea.

751
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,176
Yes, sir.

752
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,429
Yes, ban Oh Won-sik
from leaving the country.

753
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,431
Okay. I got it. Okay.

754
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,225
I'll call you again. Okay.

755
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,978
An investigator
at Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office says

756
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,440
they banned Mr. Oh from leaving Korea.
Do you know anything about that?

757
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,781
Mr. Oh is banned from leaving the country.

758
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,284
He booked a flight
leaving at 11 a.m. to Singapore.

759
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,746
Minister Song must have figured it out.
Send me Mr. Oh's home address.

760
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,997
Okay.

761
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,211
JANG TAE-JUN

762
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,757
OH WON-SIK

763
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,885
Mr. Song banned you
from leaving the country.

764
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,345
If you want to live, call me.

765
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,555
Damn it.

766
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,456
Goodness. Look at this. What a mess.

767
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,128
You're making quite an effort
to stir things up here and there.

768
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,838
That must be a hassle for you.

769
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:09,300
You're also making quite an effort.
Coming all the way out here.

770
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:15,473
I understand that you're trying to
take me down by using Won-sik as the bait.

771
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,810
But if you want to fish,
you must catch the fish with live bait.

772
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,645
Because of you,

773
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,522
an innocent lure is about to get killed.

774
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,859
Not everything in the world
will go your way.

775
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,240
Do you think you can change the world
by bringing me down?

776
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,283
Goodness.

777
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,744
Well, at least you will be the start.

778
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,833
Why don't you take the first step and set
an example? It'll make my life easier.

779
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,503
Quite a foul mouth you got there.

780
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,342
PROSECUTOR SEO

781
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:54,846
Yes.

782
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,556
Is that so?

783
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,433
Okay.

784
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,316
My gosh, the lure freed himself
from the hook and escaped.

785
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,322
Hey.

786
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,782
You should stop now.

787
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,078
I'm really tired of seeing people
go down like this.

788
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,624
He has a family.
We can't make him be a fugitive.

789
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,084
No, we cannot.

790
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,589
If I dig a little deeper,
the pit might be big enough for you, too.

791
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,885
Tae-jun. If you dig a little deeper,

792
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,723
you might end up burying
Kang Seon-yeong in that pit, not me.

793
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,981
SAMYEONG BANK

794
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,711
Shouldn't you be pacing yourself?
You can go over that after you get out.

795
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,965
Lying down for days
is making me itch for work.

796
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,760
So Ms. Kang is going to look into the bank
of the borrowed accounts herself?

797
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,887
Yes.

798
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,641
But when she read the files from the bank,

799
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,018
she grew a little stiff.

800
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,772
Could I see them, too?

801
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,025
Here.

802
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,407
TRANSACTION HISTORY, JEONG YU-MI

803
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,621
PRIVATE ACCOUNTS OF JEONG YU-MI
SAMYEONG BANK

804
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,832
"Samyeong Bank"?

805
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,293
What about it?

806
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,755
The president of Samyeong Bank

807
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,968
is her father.

808
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,688
PRESIDENT OF SAMYEONG BANK,
KANG SEONG-YEOP

809
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,696
Did you think that fox became
an assemblywoman

810
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,448
only through proper means?

811
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,409
If you take this a step further,

812
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,786
you will not be taking me down.

813
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,706
You will be taking Kang Seon-yeong down.

814
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,538
You helped launder money for a slush fund.

815
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,498
Both your father and hers

816
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,667
do have a knack in
getting in their children's way.

817
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,460
I will start all over from square one

818
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,586
solely on my own.

819
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,839
Find Won-sik and bring him to me.

820
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:58,798
Make sure he's alive.

821
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,425
Damn it!

822
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,592
Tae-jun,

823
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,844
help me.

824
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,389
Minister Song. I'd like to show you
something interesting.

825
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,433
Don't you dare think about starting over.

826
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,810
Just take whatever you have left
and enjoy them.

827
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,270
I must change the world.

828
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:16,733
I cannot let someone like you
influence the world anymore.
