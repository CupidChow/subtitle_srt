1
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,021
Hide between the bushes

2
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,898
and silence your breathing.

3
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,028
Discard all emotions.

4
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,990
Do not be wavered.

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,658
If you

6
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,995
are connected to this case in any way,

7
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,455
I can never forgive you.

8
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,083
You must wait.

9
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,876
Damn it.

10
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,420
-Wait, Minister Song!
-Don't stop me!

11
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,756
-Sir, you'll injure yourself!
-Get out of my way!

12
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,633
Damn it.

13
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,055
Until your opponent
reveals their weakness.

14
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,193
And

15
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,654
until they're on the verge
of spitting venom.

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:09,671
EPISODE 2 POISONOUS FANG

17
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,300
What happened?

18
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,762
A few members of the Supreme Council
must've changed sides at the last second.

19
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,265
Is that your way of saying
it was out your hands?

20
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,517
I apologize.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,519
If you couldn't persuade them,

22
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,896
you should've tried to threaten them.

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,066
Are you done getting your hands dirty
now that you have a badge?

24
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,484
Never, sir.

25
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,735
Jo Gap-yeong will use

26
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,406
the legislative election nomination
as leverage to put his people

27
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,533
in the prosecutors' office.

28
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,995
Do you still think you could
secure the Chief Prosecutor position?

29
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,997
I think it'll be best

30
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,125
to postpone any new appointments.

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,502
You will only be met
with backlash and resistance.

32
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,672
No can do. Just go forward with it.

33
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,674
I don't care what the others say.

34
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,301
The Minister of Justice has jurisdiction

35
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,177
over appointments
in the prosecutor's office.

36
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,513
I'll take command of the office
before people talk

37
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,432
and shut them up for good.

38
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,728
Still, you can't ignore
the concerns of the Ethics Committee.

39
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,231
MR. LEE CHANG-JIN

40
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,901
Why is this degenerate always calling me?

41
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,863
One more thing.
It's about Assemblywoman Kang.

42
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,823
I hear she's interested in the bill

43
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,075
that the late Lee Seong-min
was trying to have passed.

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,660
What's that about?

45
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,121
It's a bill for
improved labor environment.

46
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,213
Crying over spilled milk now, isn't she?

47
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,215
This woman!

48
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,719
She's good at finding trouble
for herself, I give her that.

49
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,181
Anyway, Lee Chang-jin
has been barking about it.

50
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,724
I want the issue resolved.

51
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,687
The dung may stink now,

52
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,775
but take it as the price you pay
for the fertilizer that blooms your heart.

53
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,360
Got it?

54
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,072
You should be busy. Go on.

55
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,991
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,917
OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE

57
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,926
JO GAP-YEONG EMPHASIZES
ON PROSECUTION REFORM

58
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,721
REPORTER KIM SEUNG-U

59
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,988
Jong-uk, it's me.

60
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,868
Do you know Kim Seung-u of Dodam Daily?

61
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,038
Hye-won, hi.

62
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,873
Seung-u?

63
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,584
Thanks for the article.
It scored some points with my bosses.

64
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,254
There's no need to thank me.
You wrote a good story.

65
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,384
I was worried when you gave up journalism
to work as a chief of staff.

66
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,344
I had no idea it would help me.

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,638
You're not the only one.

68
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,349
I'm receiving help too, and I need that.

69
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,560
Then let me ask you this.

70
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,853
I hear that
the Prosecution Reform Committee

71
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,229
is striking the Ministry of Justice.

72
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,648
What's the ammunition?
How about a heads up?

73
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,985
You know I can't tell you
even if I did know.

74
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,322
Even between us? Come on.

75
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,991
Once I know,
you'll be the first one I call.

76
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,037
You're really a proper chief of staff now.

77
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,415
Anyway, about Assemblyman Jang.

78
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,960
Does he really have nothing to do
with Lee Seong-min's campaign slush fund?

79
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,796
What do you mean?

80
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,174
Rumors are flying among the reporters.

81
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,634
Jang Tae-jun was in
Lee Seong-min's campaign.

82
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,512
Mr. Jang managed the fund,

83
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,556
so it's hard to think he didn't know.

84
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,643
I'm sure you're aware of this,
but he left the campaign

85
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,312
before Mr. Lee received the money.

86
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,439
I know,

87
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,774
but you know how reporters are.

88
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,817
I'm just giving you a heads up.

89
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,907
Anyway, we'll get coffee sometime.

90
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,909
Yes, it's me.

91
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,299
The last person Mr. Go met before he died

92
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,802
was Jang Tae-jun.

93
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,400
Where did you get this footage?

94
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,362
I heard that the prosecution
confiscated all evidence.

95
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,198
The footage is from
the Facilities Corporation.

96
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,243
They manage the security cameras
in the park as well.

97
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,328
The prosecution
must not have thought of it.

98
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,581
Is that all the lead detective said?

99
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,958
Yes.

100
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,837
He couldn't say more
because of the prosecution though.

101
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,673
Burying the case
by giving orders to the prosecution

102
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,466
and shutting the police up has to be...

103
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,468
Minister Song.

104
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,638
How about asking
for Assemblyman Jo's help on this case?

105
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,683
He is good friends with Seo Hyeong-cheol.

106
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,436
It won't work.

107
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,105
As long as Mr. Song holds power over them,

108
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,692
Mr. Seo will have to follow
Minister Song's orders.

109
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,698
Then your next option
is to talk to Jang Tae-jun.

110
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,284
Right now, Mr. Jang is also

111
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,911
a prime suspect in Mr. Go's case.

112
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,437
Rumors are flying among the reporters.

113
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,565
Jang Tae-jun was in
Lee Seong-min's campaign.

114
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,404
-Hello.
-Good morning.

115
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,745
Sir,

116
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,331
Assemblyman Jo sent over a list

117
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,374
of candidates for
chief of the Prosecutors' Office.

118
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,376
RECOMMENDED CANDIDATES
FOR CHIEF PROSECUTOR

119
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,712
They're all his people.

120
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,963
Right.

121
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,925
I think he's planning
announce the recommended candidates

122
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,427
during the Prosecution Reform Committee
press conference.

123
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,014
Send his office a copy
of the press release.

124
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,974
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,477
Sir,

126
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,650
the reporters are asking around
about Lee Seong-min's campaign fund.

127
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,694
They're trying to tie you to it.

128
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,822
Could Mr. Song have found out?

129
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,785
No, not yet.

130
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,121
Look into where the leak came from.

131
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,082
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,046
Sir.

133
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,226
Could I have a word, Mr. Jang?

134
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,104
JANG TAE-JUN

135
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,526
Could you excuse us?

136
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,337
Have a seat.

137
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,590
The day before Mr. Go died,

138
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,341
did you

139
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,135
meet with him?

140
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,846
Tell me.

141
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,264
Did you meet him?

142
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,349
Yes,

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,351
-I did.
-Did you know

144
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,563
that Mr. Go had the FIU file in his hands?

145
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,898
I did.

146
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,778
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because you'll look at me that way.

147
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,533
-What?
-You think I killed Seok-man.

148
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,039
Tell me what happened that day.

149
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,217
Do you realize how you look right now?

150
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,179
You look like
a corrupt, backstabbing jerk.

151
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,350
-Come to your senses, you prick!
-Seok-man.

152
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,060
Let go, you jerk!

153
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,189
Seok-man.

154
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,691
Seok-man!

155
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,284
Are you insane?

156
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,328
What are you doing?

157
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,330
I'll take care of it, so leave it with me.

158
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,956
-Tae-jun!
-Okay, fine.

159
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,585
Seobuk Market vendors, Assemblyman Lee,
Seon-yeong, and you.

160
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,504
I haven't done right by any of you.

161
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,506
But I'll make everything
normal again. Soon!

162
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,050
Enough with your excuses.
Your greed took over you,

163
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,386
and I won't let it happen to me.

164
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,888
Seok-man!

165
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,099
Seok-man...

166
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,186
Seok-man!

167
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,022
Seok-man.

168
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,774
Get out.

169
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,277
Seok-man!

170
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,622
If it weren't you,

171
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,834
-then who was it?
-Those who were afraid of

172
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,585
the FIU file coming out.

173
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,837
Song Hui-seop, Lee Chang-jin,

174
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,256
Chairman Sung of Youngil Group,
of Samil Association.

175
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,966
Who knows? It could be all of them.

176
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,635
And...

177
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,679
even you.

178
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,807
Had that file been released,

179
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,309
your position here wouldn't have existed.

180
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,033
Facilities Corporation?

181
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,618
-So this is...
-Hold on.

182
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,503
Why is she pacing again?

183
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,088
Walking is the best exercise

184
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,882
for postpartum swelling, apparently.

185
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,804
Good. The bill seems sorted out enough.

186
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,139
Good job, everyone.

187
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,603
Are you happy? Well, don't be.
It's too early for that.

188
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,732
Having the bill get passed
is another uphill battle.

189
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,776
We need it to be something that'll
force the assemblymen to pass.

190
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,863
Let's make it a public issue,
and let the public say that they need

191
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,031
this bill to go through too.

192
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,116
All right.

193
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,285
Shoot me some ideas.

194
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,996
Yes, ideas...

195
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,461
According to the opinion poll,

196
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,881
those who knew about
cases of big industrial accidents in Korea

197
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,382
were more accepting of the bill.

198
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,134
Industrial accidents?

199
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,095
We should search for a case

200
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,680
where the bill could rule in its favor.

201
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,140
Have you come across any?

202
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,934
Joojin Chemical.

203
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,728
-Joojin Chemical?
-Yes.

204
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,610
Employees of Joojin Chemical
filed for the death of laborers

205
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,321
who were exposed to toxic chemicals
seven years ago.

206
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,324
The employees claimed that
the company knew of its toxicity

207
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,034
but hid the fact.

208
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,411
However, the case was closed
for no charges were found.

209
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,833
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,383
I like the idea, but the case is too old.

211
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,134
Find something more recent.

212
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,636
An ongoing one is the best.

213
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,972
-I'll look into it.
-Okay.

214
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,684
Find me articles
that'll help pass this bill.

215
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,228
Find something useful,
and we'll discuss it.

216
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,063
-Sure.
-Yes, ma'am.

217
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,149
The Entrepreneurs' Association material?

218
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,194
Here it is.

219
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,988
She needs to leave soon, so get ready.

220
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,281
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,575
JANG TAE-JUN

222
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,168
Sir,

223
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,796
I think Assemblywoman Kang
has the CCTV footage.

224
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,841
Lee Ji-eun stopped by
the Facilities Corporation.

225
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,844
Once that footage is released,

226
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,637
you will become a prime suspect.

227
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,807
Unless you stop Ms. Kang, all your plans

228
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,267
will go awry.

229
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,312
-Let's focus on our next goal for now.
-But sir--

230
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,648
Minister Song is moving forward
with his appointments.

231
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,817
He will announce it next week.
We must move fast.

232
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,361
Isn't it too soon? We're not ready--

233
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,032
When Minister Song takes command
is when everything goes down.

234
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,951
Just be ready.

235
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,923
Did you talk to Assemblyman Jang?

236
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,927
I doubt he'll easily admit it.

237
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,553
Ma'am,

238
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,513
you should release the CCTV footage.

239
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,849
Then the investigation will be reopened.

240
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,484
You don't have to trust me.

241
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,861
I can't prove it to you
right now anyway. However,

242
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,574
you won't be able to uncover anything
while Minister Song is in office.

243
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,287
No, releasing the footage
won't do any good

244
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,082
while Minister Song is still in office.

245
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,672
How is the bill coming along?

246
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,257
Mr. Han suggested a fine idea.

247
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,219
Seven years ago at Joojin Chemicals,
there was an industrial accident

248
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,262
where laborers
were exposed to toxic chemicals.

249
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,975
Once we attach the related story,
the bill will be ready for announcement.

250
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,894
Mr. Lee Chang-jin
is very invested in this bill.

251
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,772
If Joojin Chemical is involved,
he'll fight us.

252
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,358
Thoroughly research
all the related material

253
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,859
so that he can't refute it.

254
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,987
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,322
This is the file regarding

256
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,241
the Entrepreneurs' Association's
public hearing.

257
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,702
I hope that the association backs you up.

258
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,246
I'll have to be persuasive.

259
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,085
Yes, I got it.

260
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,336
She's ready to move.

261
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,631
Entrepreneurs' Association just called.

262
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,341
You aren't needed at the public hearing.

263
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,761
Has it been canceled?

264
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,056
No, the hearing will commence
as scheduled.

265
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,099
I wasn't given a reason.

266
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,309
They just said
you'll put them in an awkward situation.

267
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,062
They canceled all other events
and meetings as well.

268
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,857
Someone must be pressing on them.

269
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,859
Lee Chang-jin.

270
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,528
He's the head
of Industrial Policy Committee

271
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,155
for the Entrepreneur's Association.

272
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,366
If the bill passes, he's the one
most likely to have a problem with it.

273
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,619
Ma'am.

274
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,333
This morning,

275
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,502
the Entrepreneurs' Association
released a statement

276
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,547
expressing their objection
against legislation that only hurt

277
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,923
the entrepreneurs of this nation.

278
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,633
Park Jin-hak, the chief of the association

279
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,553
accused the National Assembly
for passing bills

280
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,680
that are insensitive
to the current economic crisis...

281
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,974
It sure seems like
Lee Chang-jin is powerful.

282
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,226
Let's see to what extent.

283
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,770
He went on to accuse them

284
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,606
of disregarding the ramifications.

285
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,984
Tabling a bill just
to score points with the public

286
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,778
-will result in
-Ma'am.

287
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,696
-shrinking the economy...
-Do you have a moment?

288
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,783
Many other economic organizations agree...

289
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,838
It's the file on Lee Sang-guk.

290
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,592
It's the same one
you based your statement on.

291
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,928
Who sent this to Assemblyman Jo?

292
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,138
Is it Mr. Jang?

293
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,808
Yes.

294
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,644
What game is Mr. Jang playing?

295
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,396
You'll find out soon.

296
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,503
I was wondering
who was next on your hit list.

297
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,963
This I didn't expect.

298
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,591
It sure paid off to enter the tiger's den.

299
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,009
What do you think?

300
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,053
This is enough to start digging.

301
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,600
You can count on me for backup,
so don't worry.

302
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,773
Minister Song has survived
in the political arena for 16 years.

303
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,442
Two thousand prosecutors follow his lead,

304
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,861
so don't get comfortable yet.

305
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,405
Just get this one done for me.

306
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,243
A head-on collision then?

307
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,954
So be it, I guess.

308
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,011
Were you waiting for me?

309
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,596
Gosh, I told you to go ahead.

310
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,682
Now I feel bad for keeping
busy prosecutors waiting.

311
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,267
That's absurd, sir.

312
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,103
Of course we should
wait for you, minister.

313
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,898
Right, let's sit then.

314
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,317
The party is choking me

315
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,195
with their emergency planning committee
or some stuff like that.

316
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,949
But I still have my family
to look out for me, don't I?

317
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,076
Have a drink.

318
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,291
I'm worried that
it'll take a toll on your health.

319
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,253
It doesn't have to happen
this time around, you know.

320
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,213
We can wait.

321
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,384
But it's me who can't.

322
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,386
You know how I am.

323
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,805
I'm the type to wield a sword,

324
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,974
not fool around with my tongue
in some political game.

325
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,226
It's stifling, to say the least.

326
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,772
I need you all to be my strength.
You know that, right?

327
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,023
-Yes, sir.
-Of course.

328
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,942
Must you ask?

329
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,195
Only Chief Prosecutor is
up for grabs this time,

330
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,405
but Prosecutor General

331
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,492
and then the Minister of Justice
should be on your radar.

332
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,290
Well, please know that
we have your back, sir.

333
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,585
I will make sure that
all my nominations are appointed,

334
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,421
so let's keep aiming high.

335
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,173
Raise your glasses.

336
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,259
For Korea.

337
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,802
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

338
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,883
JOOJIN CHEMICAL
SUBCONTRACTOR REBATE INCIDENT

339
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,053
JOOJIN CHEMICAL HEAD OF PRODUCTION
EMBEZZLES 2.56 BILLION WON IN REBATE CLAIM

340
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,975
Call the chief of White Collar Unit Two
to my room, please.

341
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:40,901
HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE UNIT ONE,
JEONG HAN-SU

342
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,993
What do you think?

343
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,831
Betraying Minister Song

344
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,833
and joining forces with Assemblyman Jo

345
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,877
could be the groundwork for reelection.

346
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,047
This isn't enough to say

347
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,425
that he had nothing
to do with Mr. Go's death.

348
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,055
What could be Mr. Jang's intentions?

349
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,185
What game is Mr. Jang playing?

350
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,770
You'll find out soon.

351
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,282
The rebate case of Joojin Chemical
was revealed

352
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,451
to be in the scale of billions of won.

353
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,495
The police has decided

354
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,039
to expand the investigation
to include the executives.

355
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,542
A search warrant has already been issued

356
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,169
for CEO Lee's residence
and Joojin Chemical's head office.

357
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,462
Jang Tae-jun

358
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,965
is after Minister Song.

359
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,425
The investigation will include
a close look into the books...

360
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,845
Lee Sang-guk and Lee Chang-jin.

361
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,430
Mr. Jang's getting rid of
Minister Song's people one by one.

362
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,476
He's actually playing a dangerous game.

363
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,813
It's not so bad for us though.

364
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,358
We can use this opportunity
to strike Mr. Lee.

365
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,403
Let's eliminate the suspects one by one

366
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,738
starting with Mr. Lee.

367
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,995
Gather everything you can on Mr. Lee.

368
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,663
Sure.

369
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:20,000
I just can't help
being a former prosecutor, I guess.

370
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,668
Chief Prosecutor.

371
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,128
-That will be--
-Sir.

372
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,296
What is it?

373
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,173
All eyes seem to be on

374
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,925
the Joojin Chemical rebate case

375
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,052
which is mounting up to be
billions of won.

376
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,182
According to a source
within the police department,

377
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,018
those in higher positions
seem to be involved.

378
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,769
It has sparked an investigation into...

379
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,191
Mr. Jang, it's you.

380
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,361
I was hoping to see you.
Are you getting back from somewhere?

381
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,280
Yes.

382
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,324
What is this about?

383
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,367
I just heard some interesting news.

384
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,120
Was that your work as well?

385
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,497
I haven't seen the news yet.

386
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,874
Is it good news?

387
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,668
You'll see. By the way,

388
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,504
I was hoping to nominate a candidate

389
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,965
for chief of Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

390
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,552
Give Minister Song a heads up.
I wouldn't want to shock him.

391
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,971
I saw the list of your nominees.

392
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,182
None seemed adequate.

393
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,773
Having the power to nominate
doesn't matter

394
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,775
when the legislative election
is still weeks away.

395
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,693
While my title is still worth anything,

396
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,403
I have to take what I can, don't I?

397
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,741
Do you really think planting a few
of your people in the prosecutors' office

398
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,743
will bring down Mr. Song?

399
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,997
Are you saying we should do nothing then?

400
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,417
-No.
-Then what will you do?

401
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,711
I'll let you know later.

402
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,546
I heard you're holding a press conference

403
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,298
regarding
the Prosecution Reform Committee.

404
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,635
We have put together
your press release for you.

405
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,221
I'm sure your office received it by now.

406
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,139
Please read it carefully.

407
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,937
Mr. Jang.

408
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,526
Are you trying to steer the ship
now that you're in charge of the helm?

409
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,988
If you don't like it,
you're always welcome to jump off.

410
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,781
I won't stop you.

411
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,460
MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP

412
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,439
Do you have someone you can trust

413
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,357
in the police department?

414
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,568
Yes, I do.

415
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,612
There's a Detective Lee Hyeong-bae
who's a friend.

416
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,740
Isn't he the detective

417
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,700
who was suspended?

418
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,369
-That's right.
-I'll have him reinstated,

419
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,457
so have him find out
the cards the police are holding.

420
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,917
Yes, sir.

421
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,045
And where's Jo Gap-yeong now?

422
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,338
He's addressing the press

423
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,757
regarding the appointment of personnel.

424
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,926
For the first time
as the Minister of Justice,

425
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,555
Song Hui-seop will soon announce
the prosecutors of high-ranking posts.

426
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,640
However, the people being mentioned

427
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,310
are those very close to him,
who are known members

428
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,188
of the so-called Song Hui-seop Clan.

429
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,106
-You little rat.
-You asked us to trust you

430
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,609
- with the reformation of the prosecution.
-How dare you?

431
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,821
So how could you
even consider such favoritism?

432
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,616
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

433
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,787
What will you do

434
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,914
about Lee Chang-jin?

435
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,337
I haven't decided yet.

436
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,963
If you dismiss the seizure warrant,

437
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,673
more suspicion will be raised.

438
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,262
MR. LEE CHANG-JIN

439
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,939
What used to be a fine stepping stone

440
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,982
is now a rock in our way.

441
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,984
Mr. Lee

442
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,113
will only hurt your chances
at the presidency.

443
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,156
You should cut him loose.

444
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,493
I know I should cut him loose,

445
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,537
but he won't go down

446
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,580
without a fight.

447
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,377
MR. LEE CHANG-JIN

448
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,630
What an annoying pig.

449
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,382
Good heavens.

450
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,845
You seem relaxed.

451
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,931
I've just been thrown into a fire.

452
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,851
Meanwhile, I guess
you had time for a nice meal.

453
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,437
No matter how worried you are,

454
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,731
know that I feel worse.

455
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm looking for a way, so be patient.

456
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,693
Until when?

457
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,405
All you care about is the presidency
and I'm not your priority.

458
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,992
Dismiss the search and seizure warrant.

459
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,163
Look. If I dismiss it
without probable cause,

460
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,999
the situation will only get worse.

461
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,919
Once I'm done appointing
new members of the prosecutors' office,

462
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,588
I'll help you out.

463
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,014
The stock price plummeted 22 percent after
news of the investigation went public.

464
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,517
Being a businessman,
I couldn't care less about probable cause.

465
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,644
The personnel reshuffle you're planning.

466
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,481
Do you think I'll let you get your way
if I ever got arrested?

467
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,443
What happened seven years ago
will resurface.

468
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,615
-Lee Chang-jin--
-Minister Song!

469
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,788
Have you already forgotten

470
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,166
who set your table here for you?

471
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,921
My hands aren't the only ones
with blood on them.

472
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,049
I want the warrant dismissed
by tomorrow morning.

473
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,927
This isn't some friendly request.

474
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,607
Arrogant prick.

475
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,235
I treated him nicely

476
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,111
as a favor to Chairman Sung,

477
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,657
but now he's trying to control me.

478
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,414
The reporters are having
a field day because of this...

479
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,083
-You're back, sir.
-You were great...

480
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,888
Sir, your speech has been sent out

481
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,849
to the reporters.

482
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,976
They've actually been asking for more.

483
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,019
They're eating it up.

484
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,354
Did Jang Tae-jun call?

485
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,524
I'm afraid he hasn't, sir.

486
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,236
Damn it!

487
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,864
Who does he think I am? His puppet?

488
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,545
POLICE ISSUES WARRANT
IN SUSPICION OF KICKBACKS

489
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,675
JOOJIN CHEMICAL REBATE AFFAIR
REVEALED TO BE BILLIONS OF WON

490
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,969
Where in the world
are these articles coming from?

491
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,806
Materials are being fed to the press
from an assemblywoman's office.

492
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,433
Whose?

493
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,977
Kang Seon-yeong.
They're collecting everything from

494
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,521
the BAI, the Ministry of Environment,
and the Ministry of Labor.

495
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,898
Even if the warrant is dismissed,

496
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,025
if the press keeps releasing articles,

497
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,777
it'll be hard to stop
the case from reopening.

498
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,530
And that's all you have to say
as my general counsel?

499
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,699
I apologize, sir.

500
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,159
Why...

501
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,330
Is this really all I get for putting food
on all your tables?

502
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,418
Is it true that Mr. Song
nominated Mr. Jang as a member?

503
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,837
What will the committee be focusing on?

504
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,797
Don't play dumb with us.

505
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,133
I'm sorry.
I'll answer your questions later.

506
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,182
-How did it go?
-Song Hui-seop...

507
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,061
is going to dismiss
the search and seizure warrant.

508
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,813
Then he'll hurt his chances
at the presidency

509
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,733
as well as taking command
of the prosecutors' office.

510
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,110
There's a secret between them
that I'm not aware of.

511
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,531
We're running out of time.

512
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,993
We must figure out what that is
and sever their relationship.

513
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,372
And how's Lee Chang-jin?

514
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,166
Ms. Kang's office is keeping him occupied.

515
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,836
-What?
-I told Ms. Kang that you sent

516
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,755
the file about Lee Sang-guk.

517
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,967
-Hye-won!
-I know you're worried about her,

518
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,428
but this is too much
for you to handle alone.

519
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,764
And like you said, the clock's ticking.

520
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,099
If things go south,

521
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,059
it won't be Ms. Kang who gets hurt.

522
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,353
It'll be you.

523
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,003
I heard that
you're going after Lee Chang-jin.

524
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,380
I want him behind bars too.

525
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,758
Tell me everything that you know

526
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,677
about him.

527
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,847
Lee Chang-jin won't hold back
if he's backed into a corner.

528
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,390
Stay out of this.

529
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,100
Let me worry about myself.

530
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,854
-Seon-yeong.
-You can't fight both of them

531
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,772
while under Mr. Song's watchful eye.

532
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,984
You can't deal with this alone.

533
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,118
Minister Song and Mr. Lee are involved

534
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,871
in an incident seven years ago
that I don’t know about.

535
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,206
The personnel reshuffle you're planning.

536
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,917
Do you think I'll let you get your way
if I ever got arrested?

537
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,796
What happened seven years ago
will resurface.

538
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,425
-Lee Chang-jin--
-Minister Song!

539
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,845
That incident must be
their Achilles tendon.

540
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,766
Mr. Han suggested a fine idea.

541
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,560
Seven years ago at Joojin Chemicals,
there was an industrial accident

542
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,604
where laborers
were exposed to toxic chemicals.

543
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,397
Once we attach the related story,

544
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,274
the bill will be ready for announcement.

545
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,403
There was an industrial accident
at Joojin Chemical seven years ago.

546
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,448
The chemical exposure incident?

547
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,950
That case was handled by Jo Ji-hun,

548
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,952
a candidate for the chief of
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

549
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,955
If we manage to bring the incident
to light,

550
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,665
we can stop both Mr. Lee

551
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,460
and Minister Song's appointment plans.

552
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,757
Mr. Jang.

553
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,136
We'll share information
with Assemblywoman Kang.

554
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,888
I see.

555
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,724
Gather information on Joojin Chemical's
incident seven years ago.

556
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,184
Yes, sir.

557
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,355
-Mr. Oh.
-Hey.

558
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,984
-Did you ask around?
-Yes.

559
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,945
Reporter Kim Seung-u was

560
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,573
Yun Hye-won's mentor at Dodam Daily.

561
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,908
They were pretty close.

562
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,703
Some even say that they dated
when they worked together.

563
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,540
-Really?
-May I ask what this is all about?

564
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,208
Nothing.

565
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,340
Yes, Ms. Lee. I just arrived.

566
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,927
Okay. I'll be right up. Hold on.

567
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,268
Get in. It looks like you're running late.

568
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,687
Thank you.

569
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,824
Are you here to see Ms. Kang?

570
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:01,951
Yes.

571
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,036
You too?

572
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,872
Yes.

573
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,971
Ms. Kang, I'm still not sure
about working with Mr. Jang.

574
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,765
Don't worry too much.

575
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,643
I don't trust him.

576
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,063
Ms. Kang, it's Han Do-gyeong.

577
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,077
Hi.

578
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,496
I haven't seen you since the election.

579
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,458
It's been a while.
Congratulations on your new baby.

580
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,127
Congratulations on winning the election.

581
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,755
Enough chit-chat.
Let's get down to business.

582
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,423
Mr. Han.

583
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,508
Yes, ma'am.

584
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,262
Joojin Chemical's accident seven years ago

585
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,182
is assumed to have been caused
by the chemicals that they were using.

586
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,100
There were a total of 12 victims.

587
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,020
Four of them passed away
after a long illness.

588
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,981
The rest of them are still
in the hospital.

589
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,820
They were all exposed to toxic chemicals

590
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,530
called dichloromethane and formaldehyde.

591
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,740
If inhaled in a big amount,

592
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,909
they cause heart conditions,
lung cancer, and leukemia,

593
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,286
which can even lead to death.

594
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,955
When so many people died,

595
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,748
why wasn't Mr. Lee even indicted?

596
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,458
The evidence was insufficient.

597
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,085
The company hasn't even revealed

598
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,796
exactly which chemicals were involved,
saying it's a company secret.

599
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,590
The accident was blamed
on the manager's negligence.

600
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,260
They even got a doctor's note
that the victims' illnesses were

601
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,886
not chemical-related.

602
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,266
Officially, Joojin Chemical stopped
using those chemicals.

603
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,853
I'm not sure we can make this public
with the information we have right now.

604
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,898
It happened a while ago,
so it won't make much impact either.

605
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,776
What if

606
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,444
it's still ongoing?

607
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,581
This person, Park Hee-jin,
left Joojin Chemicals last year.

608
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,167
She fell ill after she did,
and filed a suit against the company.

609
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,962
The company claims that her illness
is personal and irrelevant to them.

610
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,966
All her symptoms match
those of the victims from seven years ago.

611
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,596
That must mean the company is still using
the banned chemicals.

612
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,850
All chemical imports must be reported
to Korea Environment Corporation.

613
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,601
There might be some data left there.

614
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,147
Please request them
to share the chemical import records.

615
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,982
There's a possibility
that Joojin Chemicals

616
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,276
has been importing chemicals
using another company's name.

617
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,364
There must be someone
on night duty at KEC.

618
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,575
-Let me go and ask.
-All right.

619
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,210
Are there any other people
with similar symptoms?

620
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,048
I do have a list of people
who recently left the company,

621
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,008
but I haven't gone through it yet.

622
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,136
This is going to take a while.

623
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,847
Let's finish as much as we can
by tomorrow morning.

624
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,058
Call everyone on the list
and ask questions.

625
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,309
Yes, sir.

626
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,194
You still don't know
where Lee Sang-guk’s document came from?

627
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,779
No. But I'm looking into it.

628
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,699
Won-sik, do better,

629
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,451
or you'll lose your job.

630
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,205
The exact source is not known yet,
but there is a suspect.

631
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,505
It's Reporter Kim Seung-u at Dodam Daily.

632
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,883
He published a breaking story
about Chairperson Lee and Mr. Lee.

633
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,052
-Dodam Daily?
-Yes.

634
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,721
Yun Hye-won was a reporter there
before entering the assembly.

635
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,139
Kim Seung-u was her mentor.

636
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,268
LEE SANG-GUK GETS
THE DAEHAN PARTY IN TROUBLE

637
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,357
Mr. Song, don't you think
Jang Tae-jun could have other intentions?

638
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,650
Isn't it strange?

639
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,861
Jo Gap-yeong took charge of the emergency
planning committee too easily,

640
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,363
and Mr. Lee's incident broke out

641
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,281
right after what happened
to Chairperson Lee.

642
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,248
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR INAUGURATION,
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

643
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,375
If you try to protect Assemblyman Lee,

644
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,794
they will raise the issue to attack you.

645
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,171
You ought to

646
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,424
give up on him.

647
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:30,553
I think your appointment plans
in the prosecution should be put off.

648
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,096
Mr. Lee

649
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,141
will only hurt your chances
at the presidency.

650
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,809
You should cut him loose.

651
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,866
Mr. Song.

652
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,784
Mr. Song.

653
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:04,378
That sly prick stabbed me in the back.

654
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,339
That viper was full of venom.

655
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,731
In total, there are 31 people
who seem to be victims of the chemicals.

656
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,568
Combine that with the number of victims
7 years ago, and you get 43 in total.

657
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,739
We haven't gone through everyone,
so there might be even more.

658
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,366
We need the victims' testimonies.

659
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,743
It's best if you can film them.

660
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,622
Okay.
I'll call them up and ask if I can visit.

661
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,752
See you later.

662
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,303
-Good job.
-Thank you, sir.

663
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,607
Have you heard from Ms. Lee?

664
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,779
The person on duty insists
he needs permission.

665
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,115
So Ms. Lee will wait at KEC
until the person in charge comes to work.

666
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,742
I'll let you know.

667
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,122
Tae-jun.

668
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,167
Mr. Jang.

669
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,920
You have guests in your office.

670
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,423
All right.

671
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,519
I asked for coffee! What's taking so long?

672
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,396
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

673
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,109
I can't believe
I'm in an assemblyman's office.

674
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,696
We should thank Chun-bae for bringing us
country bumpkins to this nice place.

675
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,574
-Right?
-Get your coffee.

676
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,201
"Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun".

677
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,245
I always knew he'd become a big shot.

678
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,330
He's an ambitious man.

679
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,876
There was no way he'd be stuck
being a cop all his life!

680
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,461
-Well said.
-Of course.

681
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,964
Goodness. Our assemblyman is here.

682
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,051
-Our assemblyman is here.
-The pride of our town!

683
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,306
-The coffee smells fantastic.
-It does.

684
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,977
These country bumpkins
wouldn't stop pestering me,

685
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,604
so I had to bring them here.

686
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,441
If you have time, show them around a bit.

687
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,486
Hello.

688
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,406
My name is Yun Hye-won,
and I work for Mr. Jang.

689
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,699
If it's okay with you,

690
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,076
I can show you around the building.

691
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,622
No way. It's only right
for him to show us around!

692
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,249
Your neighbors came all the way here.

693
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,002
I'm sorry, but Mr. Jang
has a tight schedule today.

694
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,379
I can do a good job.

695
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,758
-All right.
-Sure. Our assemblyman must be busy.

696
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,676
It doesn't matter
who shows us around, does it?

697
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,094
It's no big deal.

698
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,930
-Da-jeong.
-He's right.

699
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,892
Oh, my. Are these for us?

700
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,144
-Take it.
-Goodness.

701
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,438
It's not much, but it's from Mr. Jang.

702
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,066
It's from the National Assembly.
It sure looks fancy.

703
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,109
You have a great son.

704
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,319
Without Chun-bae,

705
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,321
we'd never get to be here.

706
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,782
-Mr. Park, please show them around.
-Sure, ma'am.

707
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,077
Gentlemen, please wait outside.
I'll show you around the building soon.

708
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,038
-All right.
-Let's go out.

709
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,999
Don't forget anything. Carry mine too.

710
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,840
You can't show up unannounced like this.

711
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,094
Do I need to make an appointment
to see my own son?

712
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,098
Go buy them a meal or something.

713
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,308
Hey.

714
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,977
A meal is not enough.

715
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,272
-We should at least hold a feast.
-What are you talking about?

716
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,775
A person from our small town
became an assemblyman.

717
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,693
The least we can do is celebrate.

718
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,738
When the village head's youngest son
passed the bar exam,

719
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,741
he butchered a pig and everything
to celebrate.

720
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,328
Isn't that ridiculous?
Just because his son passed the bar exam?

721
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,872
That's nothing
compared to what you achieved.

722
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,959
Now that we have an assemblyman,
we should butcher at least a cow.

723
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,836
Do that. Go butcher whatever you want.

724
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,129
-Look at this.
-Nice.

725
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,132
What are you doing? Go take a look around.

726
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,219
Please do help the busy Assemblyman Jang
with his legislative duties.

727
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,847
-I will. Bye.
-Bye.

728
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,181
Man-su, let's go.

729
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,641
-This way, please.
-Bye.

730
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:30,144
-Let's start from the end of this hallway.
-All right.

731
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,272
Chun-bae should be proud.

732
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,650
Go back in.

733
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,361
-Go back in.
-Let's go.

734
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,529
-Hi.
-Hi.

735
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,322
This way.

736
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,200
You've never been here before.

737
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,745
This place is incredible!

738
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,374
-Stop acting like a fool!
-Come on.

739
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,507
Oh, my.

740
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,302
Your father must have wanted
to take a look around here.

741
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,720
He must be so happy.

742
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,139
He gets to be here
thanks to his assemblyman son.

743
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,223
What brings you here?

744
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,851
Mr. Song would like to see you.

745
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,603
Why couldn't you just call?

746
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,438
He was worried you'd run away.

747
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,608
He told me to bring you to him myself.

748
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,361
Get ready.

749
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,198
I'll wait here, Assemblyman Jang.

750
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,414
Minister of Justice Song Hui-seop
announced

751
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,959
that the appointments of
39 high-ranking prosecutor positions

752
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,503
including the Chief
of Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office

753
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,171
will be carried out today.

754
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,215
This will be
the first large-scale personnel change

755
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,050
since his inauguration.

756
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,135
There is much speculation
as to who will be appointed

757
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,262
to Chief of Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office,

758
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,847
which is the largest prosecutors' office
in the country.

759
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,225
I didn't expect him
to carry out the appointments so fast.

760
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,436
He must have found out about my plans.

761
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,107
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

762
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:01,902
Yes?

763
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,366
Okay. Thank you.

764
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,537
What are you going to do now,

765
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,705
Mr. Jang?

766
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,501
Now that my fangs have been revealed,

767
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,671
it's time to tear him to pieces.

768
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,099
Hello.

769
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,725
-Mr. Oh.
-Hi, Mr. Jeong.

770
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,727
When will the appointments be announced?

771
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,354
Wait a little longer.

772
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,231
I'm a bit busy.

773
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,367
This time, you'll have to take off
your underwear or something.

774
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,001
OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE

775
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,057
Too bad. If you had grown it longer,

776
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,018
you would have seen it bloom.

777
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,728
I know.

778
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,731
Tae-jun, what is this all about?

779
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,983
Revenge for Lee Seong-min's death?

780
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,110
I haven't even started yet.

781
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,654
Now that you've got
some power for yourself,

782
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,657
-you think you're the big man now?
-Do you think

783
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,118
I'm still your chief of staff?

784
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,664
Well, I'll be damned.

785
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,168
The stray dog I took in is biting me now.

786
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,420
Don't forget.

787
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,714
I'm the one who made you

788
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,675
the Minister of Justice.

789
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,680
I know.

790
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,599
I know.

791
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,184
I know you did.

792
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,771
But you should remember
what this position means.

793
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,441
Do you want to end up like Lee Seong-min?

794
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,362
It takes effort to bloom a flower,

795
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,905
but it takes a second for it to fall!

796
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,575
For God's sake.

797
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,915
The youngest Chief Prosecutor,
a four-term assemblyman,

798
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,251
the floor leader,
and now the Minister of Justice.

799
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,961
You've had many impressive titles so far.

800
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,714
Now let me add another title
to your career.

801
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,258
The first sitting Minister of Justice

802
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,219
to get arrested.

803
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,679
Jang Tae-jun!

804
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,404
The reporters must be waiting for you.

805
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,614
It's time to step into the spotlight.

806
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,950
By the way,

807
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,787
don't smash the TV.
It was paid for with taxes.

808
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,927
I'm Kang Seon-yeong from the Daehan Party.

809
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,472
Joojin Chemical's chemical exposure
incident seven years ago

810
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:22,686
has not ended yet. It is still ongoing,
producing new victims at this moment.

811
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,773
Joojin Chemical is still using
the banned chemicals to this day.

812
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,235
This tragedy would have been stopped
if Mr. Lee Chang-jin,

813
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,740
Joojin Chemical's CEO, had been punished
properly seven years ago.

814
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,075
The case was handled
by Prosecutor Jo Ji-hun,

815
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,245
who has been nominated for Chief of Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

816
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,914
This incident revealed
a long-term collusion

817
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,752
between Minister of Justice, Song Hui-seop
and Mr. Lee.

818
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,713
While Minister Song admitted
his personal relationship with Mr. Lee

819
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,716
at his confirmation hearing,

820
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,178
he denied any power abuse or collusion...

821
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,597
-Was he asked a special favor?
-Is that true?

822
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,807
-What's going on?
-Where is he?

823
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,727
-Wait for me!
-If he was bribed...

824
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,940
Minister Song!

825
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,151
-Did you stop the indictment of Mr. Lee?
-Is it true?

826
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,820
At the hearing, you said your relationship
was a personal one!

827
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,448
-Were you aware of the incident?
-Say something!

828
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,200
-Minister Song!
-Say something!

829
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,868
-Gosh!
-Minister Song!

830
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,553
While Minister Song admitted
his personal relationship with Mr. Lee

831
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,348
at his confirmation hearing,

832
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,392
he denied any power abuse

833
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,394
or collusion with Mr. Lee.

834
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,232
In the recent Joojin Chemical rebate case,
however, Minister Song dismissed

835
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,108
the search and seizure warrant.

836
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,985
-What?
-In addition, he nominated

837
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,153
Prosecutor Jo Ji-hun,

838
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,696
who exempted Mr. Lee from indictment,

839
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,615
for the Chief of Seoul Central
Prosecutors' Office.

840
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,325
This series of actions clearly shows

841
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,078
that Minister Song
is trying to protect Mr. Lee.

842
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,956
More people are falling victim
to toxic chemicals

843
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,750
even at this moment.

844
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,586
-What a turn of events.
-Joojin Chemical is still denying

845
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,338
responsibility for the victims' exposure

846
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,757
-to the toxic chemicals.
-Find out more at Ms. Kang's office.

847
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,300
Yes, sir.

848
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,011
However, the symptoms of the new victims

849
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,305
are identical to those of the victims
seven years ago.

850
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,351
Joojin Chemical is continuing to use
life-threatening chemicals.

851
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,395
We demand the search and seizure...

852
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,021
Jo Gap-yeong speaking.

853
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,108
That was tasty.

854
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,235
The meat was a bit tough.

855
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,532
That viper is making a mess everywhere.

856
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,117
What a headache.

857
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,493
Is Jang Tae-jun

858
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:44,911
behind all this?

859
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,830
Who else could it be?

860
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,500
He hasn't changed a bit, I guess.

861
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,294
By the way,

862
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,463
I thought Ms. Kang
and Jang Tae-jun broke up.

863
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,841
But apparently, they're still
a match made in heaven.

864
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,176
They must have missed the good old days.

865
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,429
That's what usually happens.

866
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,443
You still have a big appetite.

867
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,404
I'm a cow being dragged
to the slaughterhouse.

868
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,032
I should have a full belly
to have strength

869
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,034
to at least put up a fight
with my butcher.

870
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,538
You sound like you have a plan.

871
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,167
But I can't make it happen by myself.

872
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,210
I need your help.

873
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,550
I'd love to defend you,

874
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,552
but my mouth is not mine.

875
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:50,143
I guess I'm not the only one
who fell into Jang Tae-jun's trap.

876
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,525
From Joojin Chemical's
chemical exposure incident

877
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,779
to Chairperson Lee's
recent bribery allegations,

878
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:04,366
doubts about the prosecution's
investigations have continuously existed.

879
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,701
Mr. Jang, we're here
to talk about prosecution reform.

880
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,245
Why would you bring up
irrelevant incidents?

881
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:13,667
The incidents I just mentioned
expose the problems the prosecution has.

882
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,669
Did you say that they're irrelevant?

883
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,629
I'd like to know why.

884
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,674
Is there any reason why these incidents
shouldn't come to light?

885
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,008
That's not it.

886
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:26,262
I just want you to clearly explain how
those incidents are related to our topic.

887
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,639
Continue.

888
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,226
The prosecution tends to go easy

889
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,895
on political authority and conglomerates.

890
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,522
When prosecutors are involved in a case,

891
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,982
whether former or current,

892
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,109
no investigation or indictment
is carried out.

893
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,153
To root out these bad practices,

894
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,822
we need a thorough reorganization.

895
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,825
But at this critical moment,
the Minister of Justice

896
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,035
is filling the prosecution
with people on his side

897
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,412
despite all opposition.

898
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,123
You're getting off the subject again.

899
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,710
Isn't power adjustment between
the prosecution and the police the key?

900
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,878
You agreed to reducing
the prosecution's power earlier.

901
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,547
Yes, I do.

902
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,383
But I do not think
the goal of prosecution reform

903
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,136
is to reduce the prosecution's power.

904
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,472
It should be a means, not an end.

905
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,197
The key to power adjustment
between the prosecution and the police

906
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,451
is not to reduce power on one side
or how power is divided.

907
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:33,163
It is to introduce an advanced
investigation system that reflects

908
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,331
the principle of checks and balances.

909
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,711
The goal of prosecution reform should be
to strengthen mutual cooperation

910
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,172
between the prosecution and the police.

911
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,591
I have something to say to the Minister.

912
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,218
The reform plan submitted
by the Ministry of Justice shows

913
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,596
the Ministry's determination
to hold on to its right

914
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,474
to directly investigate,
control police investigations,

915
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,685
and execute sentences,
as well as its exclusive right to indict.

916
00:55:55,769 --> 00:56:00,356
It goes directly against
the public demand for prosecution reform.

917
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,610
I ask you to contemplate
what the public truly wants

918
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,154
and propose new plans accordingly.

919
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,032
Look at him, all excited.

920
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,326
That punk.

921
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:23,296
When fall radishes are this thick,
it means the winter is going to be cold.

922
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,049
The winter has to be cold
for the viper to go into its hole.

923
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,513
But I can't let it disappear
into its hole so easily.

924
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,933
I'll pull out all its teeth,

925
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,853
skin it neatly,

926
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,482
and hang its skin in the sun first.
Shouldn't I?

927
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,159
To do that, I need a snake hunter.

928
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,497
Can you help me with that?

929
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,630
As long as you can let me off my leash,

930
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,799
it sounds like a good deal.

931
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,730
I have something to say to the Minister.

932
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,733
The reform plan submitted
by the Ministry of Justice shows

933
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,278
the Ministry's determination
to hold on to its right

934
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,656
to directly investigate,
control police investigations,

935
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,076
and execute sentences,
as well as its exclusive right to indict.

936
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:43,418
It goes directly against
the public demand for prosecution reform.

937
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,838
I ask you to contemplate
what the public truly wants...

938
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:47,839
Hi, Seung-u.

939
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:51,134
Hi. It's about Assemblyman Lee Seong-min's
campaign fund rumors.

940
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,552
Okay. Did you ask around?

941
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,762
-What's the biggest problem...
-The public demand...

942
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,016
What do you think of
the Ministry's appointments?

943
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,811
The prosecution's collusion
with politicians should come to an end.

944
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,981
The prosecution should stop wielding
absolute power over the nation.

945
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:10,612
It should be democratically controlled
and serve the nation.

946
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,363
I believe that's what the public wants.

947
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,242
The key to power adjustment
between the prosecution and the police

948
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,828
is not to reduce power on one side

949
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,205
-or how power is divided.
-Thanks.

950
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,458
It is to introduce an advanced
investigation system that reflects...

951
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,588
The hearing is over.

952
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,465
I'm on my way to the office.

953
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,552
-Check Mr. Jo's schedule.
-Yes, sir. By the way,

954
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,263
the information about Assemblyman Lee's
campaign fund probably

955
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,806
leaked out from the prosecution.

956
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,892
An internal investigation is going on.

957
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,143
Who is in charge of the case?

958
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:43,937
Mr. Jang.

959
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,986
Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol
of Special Investigation Team.

960
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,532
You really impressed me at the hearing.

961
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,325
I'm Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol.

962
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,579
I see. Thank you.

963
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,045
So, you attended the hearing?

964
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,090
I see you're very interested
in the committee.

965
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,771
Well,

966
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,399
I'm not that interested

967
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,193
in prosecution reform though.

968
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,906
I was just curious
about what kind of person you were.

969
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,743
I can tell from your expression
that you already know

970
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,122
that I'm doing an internal investigation
into you.

971
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,249
I thought the case was closed.

972
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,961
On paper, yes. But not for me.

973
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,672
If you're trying to make
a political issue out of it,

974
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,465
you better give up.

975
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,305
Mr. Jang.

976
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,018
I know

977
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,437
people like you very well.

978
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,190
I know how you climbed all the way up here
from the bottom.

979
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:17,572
You dress yourself in fancy clothes,
but the stink of the gutter remains.

980
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,409
Politics? I'm not interested in it at all.

981
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:25,163
My job is to put trash in its place.

982
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,500
See you around.

983
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:45,058
I wanted Tae-jun to lead me
to the Blue House.

984
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,893
What a shame.

985
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,980
But public support is
much better than what Jang has to offer.

986
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:51,981
You're right.

987
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,359
Do you know
what the public hates the most?

988
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,778
Assemblymen who line their pockets
with taxpayers' money.

989
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,032
By putting corrupt politicians in prison,

990
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,326
I can change the public opinion about me.

991
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,120
Of course. Here, sir.

992
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:14,337
I think I should add a nice title
to Tae-jun's profile too.

993
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,338
Pardon?

994
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,798
This government's

995
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,677
first sitting assemblyman to get arrested.

996
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,056
Sure.

997
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,642
That's right.

998
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,199
Ms. Kang.

999
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,714
I didn't mean to startle you.

1000
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,674
I was just so excited to see you.

1001
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,551
I didn't know you live here.

1002
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,553
Quite a nice place you live in.

1003
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,804
What are you doing here?

1004
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,849
I've never paid you a visit
since you became an assemblywoman,

1005
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:11,185
so I thought I'd come over
and congratulate you properly.

1006
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,147
You didn't have to.

1007
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,608
We'll see each other a lot
in the Assembly from now on.

1008
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,695
It seems like a lot has been going on
at Joojin Chemical.

1009
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,613
When you appear in the Assembly
as a witness,

1010
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,574
we'll get a chance to have a proper talk.

1011
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:30,121
Why, you're just as gutsy as I've heard.

1012
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,707
I'll take that as a compliment.

1013
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,044
You'll receive a witness summon soon.

1014
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,298
Ms. Kang.

1015
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,136
Be careful.

1016
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:49,515
It's not a good idea to be out so late
without even a personal secretary.

1017
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,518
It's a dangerous world.

1018
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,931
All the invisible wounds

1019
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,308
eventually become an invisible weapon.

1020
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,187
The venom has filled up.

1021
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,690
-Meanwhile,
-Mr. Jang.

1022
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,400
the first prosecution personnel change

1023
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,819
since Minster Song took office
was carried out today.

1024
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:28,698
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office
will be led by Chief Choe Gyeong-cheol

1025
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,199
from the Special Investigation Team.

1026
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,743
His promotion to chief came
five years earlier than expected...

1027
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:36,247
Once revealed,
your fangs can't be hidden again.

1028
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,332
...Minister Song's determination
to carry out reform.

1029
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,334
Chief Prosecutor Choe is known

1030
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,212
to push forward investigations

1031
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,133
without being affected
by any outside pressure or rumors.

1032
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,135
Starting with this personnel change,

1033
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,598
the prosecution will reorganize
to deal with many urgent problems

1034
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,558
including prosecution reform

1035
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,519
and fighting corruption
among high-ranking officials...

1036
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,313
But remember.

1037
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,566
If you fail to take down your enemy
at once,

1038
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,694
you'll be the one going down.

1039
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,292
PERSONNEL CHANGE
TO INITIATE REFORM AND FIGHT CORRUPTION

1040
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,707
I will show Minister Song
that he messed with the wrong person.

1041
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,376
We need more definite proof

1042
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,045
of chemical exposures.

1043
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,714
Watch your step.
You might break your nose.

1044
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,217
You're doing an internal investigation
into Mr. Jang?

1045
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,469
I will request a warrant.

1046
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,554
Do you have to go this far?

1047
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,225
I don't think that's for you to say
after stabbing me in the back.

1048
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,811
I'll show you who I am.
I'll make you regret this.

1049
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,854
By all means.
