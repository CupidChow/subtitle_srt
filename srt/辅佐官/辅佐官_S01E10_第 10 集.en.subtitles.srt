1
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,354
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

2
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,940
ACTUAL PEOPLE, PARTIES, LOCATIONS,
CORPORATIONS OR INCIDENTS

3
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,596
Mr. Jang, everything's ready.

4
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,329
Every step I've taken,

5
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,207
I've had regrets.

6
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,336
But...

7
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,130
I will not look back.

8
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,634
JANG TAE-JUN WILL TAKE THE LEAD

9
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,011
I've come too far...

10
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,847
to stop.

11
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,978
In order to bring forth my light,

12
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,481
I need to go into the dark.

13
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,067
And this journey

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,403
begins now.

15
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,118
EPISODE 10

16
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,052
I guess there's nothing we can do.

17
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,476
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY HELD TODAY
FOR THE NEW MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP

18
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,648
Mr. Jang will come up with a way.

19
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,112
I found evidence
that Mr. Song has a connection

20
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,448
with Hwain Infra.

21
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,658
There was a video

22
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,953
of him giving a speech
to the district party members.

23
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,707
He made a comment in that video
saying he invested in Hwain Infra

24
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,752
because it was established
by his acquaintance.

25
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,130
Where's the video?

26
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,965
I gave it to Mr. Jang.

27
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,300
Didn't he tell you?

28
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,223
What's the matter?

29
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,268
Ms. Yun.

30
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,648
It's nothing.

31
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,214
This contains the video file
that I sent you earlier.

32
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,677
I destroyed the original copy
that the press had before I came here.

33
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,722
So this is the only copy of the file.

34
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,509
I want you to nominate me as the candidate

35
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,428
to run for Seongjin City's by-election

36
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,847
that was once run by Assemblyman Lee.

37
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,425
Take this.

38
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,481
If I nominate you as the candidate
for Seongjin City,

39
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,774
it will cause an uproar.

40
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,111
Do you think you'll be
able to shut everyone up?

41
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,865
If I wasn't confident,

42
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,201
I wouldn't be here right now.

43
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,513
Tae-jun.

44
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,396
Did you drink?

45
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,191
Yes.

46
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,492
I'm sorry.

47
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,415
I'm sorry.

48
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,626
Why are you sorry?

49
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,296
Get up. Let's go inside.

50
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,390
Are you okay?

51
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,935
I'd be lying if I told you that I'm okay.

52
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,482
I feel as if I fell right before
the finish line of a marathon.

53
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,737
But if I think about it,

54
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,364
nothing was ever easy.

55
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,331
You look tired. Get some rest.

56
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,945
2019 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ETHICS COMMITTEE
MEETING AGENDA

57
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
PUNISHMENT ON ABORTION
WHY IS IT A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION?

58
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,271
I'm going now.

59
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,087
-Hello.
-Mr. Jang!

60
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,381
Hello, sir.

61
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,301
Ms. Yun.

62
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,973
What's going on? Is he back?

63
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,781
-My goodness, salute.
-Hello.

64
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,659
You should be at the minister's office.
What brings you here?

65
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,078
My gosh, it's so suffocating
to work with civil servants.

66
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,705
-Pass me a cigarette.
-Didn't you quit?

67
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,123
I thought you decided to quit.

68
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,959
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, you're here.

69
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,212
Is Minister Song going to vacate his seat
in the National Assembly?

70
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,882
Have you ever seen a minister
give up their seat?

71
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,884
He'll keep his seat until the day he dies.

72
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,719
What? Seriously?

73
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,431
That means he had never planned on
giving his position to Tae-jun.

74
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:44,018
If it were you, would you do that?
What's the point of being so committed?

75
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,728
In the end, he's just a servant.

76
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,105
My gosh, he's going to have
such a hard time in prison.

77
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,067
-Light this up for me.
-He'll be like a viper in a cage.

78
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,070
Mr. Jang is in the office.

79
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,615
What's he doing here?

80
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,368
Well, I don't know.

81
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,078
On my way here, I heard

82
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,330
that Mr. Jang is being considered
as the next candidate

83
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,623
to run for Seongjin City.

84
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,958
-What?
-That's nonsense.

85
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,543
What kind of bullshit is that?

86
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,380
I heard it from a friend
who works in the Nomination Committee.

87
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,092
Anyone from the Daehan Party
is bound to be elected in Seongjin City.

88
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,635
And Tae-jun is taking that spot?

89
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,306
My gosh, this is unbelievable.
I should just quit this job.

90
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,433
-I can't do this.
-That little jerk.

91
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,559
Damn it.

92
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,566
So what are you going to do now?

93
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,320
I need to prove that I've made

94
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,280
the right choice.

95
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,080
Ms. Kang.

96
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,749
-What happened?
-Mr. Ahn submitted a petition

97
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,752
to the Ethics Committee asking them
to take disciplinary action against you.

98
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,421
He wants you punished for...

99
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,923
Is this because of Su-min?

100
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,843
Yes, he’s asked them
to dismiss you from the party

101
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,471
for having violated the code of ethics
by encouraging abortion.

102
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,723
He's even holding a press conference.

103
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,767
I'm Ahn Hyeon-min of the Daehan Party.

104
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,061
Today, I’m going to report
Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong

105
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,064
to the Ethics Committee
for having evoked public criticism

106
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,067
by aiding and abetting abortion
and for not showing any signs of regret.

107
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,404
Ms. Kang, if you get dismissed
from the party...

108
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,072
Yes, I know.

109
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,782
I'll no longer be an assemblywoman.

110
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,082
Is there a way to stop
the Ethics Committee?

111
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,959
If they proceed with the meeting...

112
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,712
Are you Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong?

113
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,505
Yes.

114
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,925
How can a murderer be brazen enough
to walk around like this?

115
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,471
-Fetuses have the right to life!
-Fetuses have the right to life!

116
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,805
Let me go! What are you doing?

117
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,516
Let go of me! I said let go!

118
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,059
-Stop abortion!
-Let me go!

119
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,729
-Hey!
-You should be arrested, you murderer!

120
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,730
-Hey!
-You murderer!

121
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,565
-Abortion is murder!
-You murderer!

122
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,317
-You murderer!
-You're a murderer!

123
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,194
You don't deserve to be an assemblywoman!

124
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,862
-Abortion is murder!
-Abortion is murder!

125
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,114
-It's murder!
-It's murder!

126
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,783
-It's murder!
-Fetuses have the right to life!

127
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,535
-Abortion is murder!
-It's illegal!

128
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,123
Ms. Kang, let's go.

129
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,501
Ms. Kang.

130
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,544
Let's go, Ms. Kang.

131
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,356
Ms. Kang, are you okay?

132
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,276
I'm okay.

133
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,738
Assemblywoman Kang of the Daehan Party was
attacked at the Members' Office building

134
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,783
by a group of citizens
who are against abortion.

135
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,702
She has been reported
to the Ethics Committee

136
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,580
for having aided and abetted
a single mother’s abortion,

137
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,708
and will be investigated
by the prosecution soon.

138
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,629
Assemblyman Ahn Hyeon-min
submitted a petition...

139
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,880
This is Jang Tae-jun.

140
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,792
You seem to be going through a tough time.

141
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,836
I've been meaning to come see you.

142
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,630
Have you been well?

143
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,508
What brings you here?

144
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,346
As you already know, we shoot
a live debate show every week.

145
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,390
I'll be talking about women's rights

146
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,309
with the members
of the Daehan Party tomorrow.

147
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,019
So I'm here to do some interviews.

148
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,356
It seems like they have a lot to say
regarding the issue that you've caused.

149
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,942
I feel like our ratings will go up
thanks to you.

150
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,528
I was worried that your show
might get canceled.

151
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,113
What a relief.

152
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,617
Ms. Kang, you should come on the show.

153
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,619
You're at the center of this issue.

154
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,203
There are a lot of people

155
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,748
who are very curious to find out

156
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,833
why an assemblywoman in office

157
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,377
helped a single mother get an abortion.

158
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,921
It's a great opportunity.

159
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,964
You used to be my senior at work.

160
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,800
So I'm giving you a chance
to explain what happened.

161
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,761
What do you say?

162
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,472
I'll think about it.

163
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,280
-Are you okay, Ms. Kang?
-Yes, I'm fine.

164
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,078
Has the Ethics Committee
settled on a meeting date?

165
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,621
No, not yet.

166
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,456
And the doctor who carried out
the abortion?

167
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,167
I asked Mr. Lee to go see him,
but he kept refusing to meet.

168
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,711
I think Mr. Song and Mr. Jo
already did what they can

169
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
to keep his mouth shut.

170
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,298
Ms. Kang, we're able to summon Su-min

171
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,925
up until a week before the meeting.

172
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,094
Let's find her and make her explain...

173
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,804
I heard her story has already gone viral

174
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,847
among the press and social media.

175
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,685
Yes, a blurred-out photo
of her face is all over the internet.

176
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,603
Let's not get her involved in this.

177
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,189
She's already going through enough.

178
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,109
We won't be able to get anywhere

179
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,735
without her testimony.

180
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,529
Let's summon her.

181
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,156
Her condition was critical
when she arrived at the hospital.

182
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,076
So when people find out
that you had no other choice,

183
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,204
the public's opinion will change.
And you won't have to get disciplined.

184
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,457
I'll do everything I can to find Su-min.

185
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,002
Then what about her life?

186
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,881
I don't want her face
to be revealed by the press.

187
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,635
-Ms. Kang.
-It was all my doing.

188
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,971
I should take responsibility.

189
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,809
Ms. Kang, listen to me.
Mr. Ahn, who filed the petition,

190
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,228
and Mr. Lee, the chairperson
of the Ethics Committee,

191
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,688
are both supporters of Mr. Song.

192
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,774
The chairperson has the right
for an ex officio investigation,

193
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,901
and they'll take care of this issue
very urgently.

194
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,945
I'll just be risking my seat,

195
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,741
but they'll have to risk
the rest of their lives.

196
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,704
After the court ruled
against punishing abortion,

197
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,540
the assembly members would've
prepared bills regarding abortion.

198
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,460
Ms. Jeong is the only person
who has submitted

199
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,461
a bill regarding that.

200
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,339
Then I'll try to ask her for help.

201
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,469
Hello, sir.

202
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,221
-What did Chairperson Lee say?
-He just wants

203
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,931
you to help him become the floor leader.

204
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,476
My gosh, he should learn
to be more patient.

205
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,394
Why is he whining like a kid?

206
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,064
Sir, what's going to happen to Tae-jun?

207
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,899
Why do you ask?

208
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,610
I heard he's being considered
as the by-election candidate

209
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,320
for Seongjin City.

210
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,115
Yes, that kind of happened.
Don't worry about it.

211
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,117
How can I not worry?

212
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,244
Why did you pick him and not me?

213
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,874
Sir, can't you put me
in charge of Seongjin City?

214
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,292
I won't let you down.

215
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,836
-Won-sik.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,881
-If you ask for too much...
-Yes, you said I'd get in trouble if I do.

217
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,509
Sir, but I'm really confident about this.

218
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,930
Just work hard to keep
the job you have right now.

219
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,933
Let's go.

220
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,479
Bye, sir.

221
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,905
Damn it.

222
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,367
How did Tae-jun manage to convince him?

223
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
That jerk is so tenacious.

224
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,580
CHAIRPERSON JO NAM-GI

225
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,128
Because of Assemblyman Lee,

226
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,755
I've been the chairperson
of the party committee for four years.

227
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,549
And now I have to give up Seongjin City

228
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,925
to a chief of staff?

229
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,261
Don't you think Minister Song's
crossing the line?

230
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,807
I know how you feel, but what can we do?

231
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,392
It's what the minister wants.

232
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,395
I don't care if he's the minister.
He just humiliated me!

233
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,606
I know, right? He should know
how humiliating this is to you.

234
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,150
This is so wrong!

235
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,576
So I've been thinking. Come closer, sir.

236
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,294
Hello, sir.

237
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,920
-You're back.
-Hey.

238
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,839
Sir.

239
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,009
You have a guest in your office.

240
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,719
A guest?

241
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,512
CONGRATULATIONS
FROM JO NAM-GI

242
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,943
What brings you here?

243
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,572
You got appointed as the minister.
So I thought I should send flowers.

244
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,409
My goodness,
you didn't have to bring it yourself.

245
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,493
Thank you so much.

246
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,245
Of course, I should bring it myself.

247
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,664
I also wanted to make sure
you didn't forget about me.

248
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,124
Oh, I'm guessing

249
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,502
this must be about the nomination
regarding the by-election candidate.

250
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,880
That's not something
I have full authority over.

251
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,049
The Nomination Committee--

252
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,634
Do you think I'm a joke?

253
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,637
Sir, if you invite a viper
into your house,

254
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,306
the rabbits living there
will get scared and go nuts.

255
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,600
I know you were able to sit in that seat

256
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,185
thanks to Mr. Jang's hard work.

257
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,604
But you were planning
to get rid of him anyway.

258
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,314
You might lose your family

259
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,483
if you keep looking after other people.

260
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,118
Chairperson Jo has over
1,000 assembly members on his side.

261
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,329
And a lot of them are in office right now.

262
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,581
If he takes them with him
and creates his own party,

263
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,166
it'll cause a big problem

264
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,961
to both you and the Daehan Party.

265
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,089
And wouldn't it be better to nominate
Chairperson Jo as the candidate

266
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,757
if you consider the redevelopment

267
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,884
of Uigwang and Seongjin City?

268
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,346
That redevelopment project
is worth tens of trillions of won.

269
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,598
If the project gets put on hold,
it'll bring a huge loss

270
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,351
to the business projects in our districts
including yours.

271
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,852
Don't you think

272
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,440
that would put Chairman Sung and Mr. Lee
in quite a pickle?

273
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,318
I heard they lost a lot of money
after they halted the redevelopment.

274
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,820
Seobuk Market's redevelopment

275
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,114
is the start of the entire
redevelopment project.

276
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,199
Seobuk Market hasn't even been
redeveloped yet.

277
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,909
If we cause trouble with the nomination,

278
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,328
we won't be able to get support
from the party.

279
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,582
You should just give up
on nominating Mr. Jang.

280
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,167
Mr. Lee is already

281
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,962
getting ready to support Assemblyman Jo.

282
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,020
Yes, sir.

283
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,063
Yes, of course.

284
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,774
Yes, we should meet.

285
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,736
Goodness, I'm really busy these days.

286
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,820
Yes.

287
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,531
Mr. Lee is very upset with you.

288
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,450
Even if you get nominated,

289
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,660
it'll cost a lot of money
to run an election campaign.

290
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,829
How are you going to pay for all that?

291
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,832
You should go and soothe Mr. Lee a little.

292
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,001
That way, he'll have your back.

293
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,963
Okay, sir. I'll visit you some time.

294
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,682
The minister called me
and told me about you.

295
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,185
He told me you have something to say.

296
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,644
I'm busy, so please keep it short.

297
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,856
It seems like you're here
for the nomination.

298
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,402
But I'm not quite sure
if I should support you.

299
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,572
People from Ms. Kang's office have been
digging into my company and myself.

300
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,325
They even requested files
to the FIU in Hong Kong.

301
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,285
Weren't you behind all that?

302
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,329
It'll take over a month
to get those files.

303
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,749
And even if they get it,
I'll make sure I have your back.

304
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,043
I'm not sure.

305
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,923
I don't really see
what I'll be gaining from this deal.

306
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,508
I'll proceed with Seobuk Market's

307
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,760
redevelopment project.

308
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,478
The people in Seobuk Market were recently
forced to evacuate.

309
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,522
It came to a halt
because the merchants resisted.

310
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,440
But if they get forced to evacuate again,

311
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,025
it'll cause an even bigger collision.

312
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,693
When's the next date?

313
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,362
It's in three days.

314
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,614
-And the merchants?
-People who are against

315
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,158
the merchant association
formed an emergency planning committee.

316
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,954
And the committee is rejecting all
the negotiations that have been settled.

317
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,415
We won't be able to gain much
by doing a hearing at this point.

318
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,001
Mr. Jang.

319
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,504
Here's the list of the committee members.

320
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,967
Give me the list of their demands.

321
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,803
And check how much the city
and the company need to compensate.

322
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,513
Yes, sir.

323
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,351
-Mr. Han.
-Hello.

324
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,771
Hello.

325
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,607
-Mr. Han, what brings you here?
-I asked him to come.

326
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,777
He knows a lot about Seobuk Market,
so he'll be of help.

327
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,362
He's close with the merchants there.

328
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,576
I'll go meet the leader of the committee.

329
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,286
Get ready for the hearing.

330
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,537
-Okay.
-Okay.

331
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,872
Bye, sir.

332
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,920
Why bother preparing the materials for
the hearing? It'll end up in the trash.

333
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,469
What should I start with?

334
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,055
Can I have a word with you?

335
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,896
ASSEMBLYMAN SONG HUI-SEOP

336
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,275
Mr. Han, I know how you feel.

337
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,444
But I don't think you should help.

338
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,987
What?

339
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,364
Well... Why?

340
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,409
I think that will be best.
You should do as I say.

341
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,290
-But why...
-Mr. Han, could you get the files

342
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,833
in the copy room for me?

343
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,710
Okay, I will.

344
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,298
You're the one who said

345
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,759
you wanted to try

346
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,011
and make the world a better place

347
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,889
where no one ever needs to get hurt.

348
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,099
You said that's why you started this job.

349
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,018
The same goes for me.

350
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,686
I want to protect

351
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,439
the people at Seobuk Market.

352
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,026
I'll do my best.

353
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,867
Mr. Han.

354
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,702
-Yes?
-What are you doing?

355
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,537
I'll get going.

356
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,725
Assemblyman Ahn of the Daehan Party
announced at a press conference

357
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,769
that Assemblywoman Kang should be expelled

358
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,688
for having caused a social issue

359
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,439
by aiding and abetting abortion.

360
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,692
Assemblywoman Kang helped Ms. Shin,
a single mother

361
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,403
whom she's been sponsoring
after meeting her

362
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,363
at a lone-parent support facility
in Jungil-gu...

363
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,991
MR. GO SEOK-MAN

364
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,329
My gosh, they're always very busy.
Don't you think so?

365
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,665
I'll keep this for a while.

366
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,257
Don't be scared.
You just need to do as I say.

367
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,342
How long do I need to stay here?

368
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,928
You can do what you want.

369
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,931
You can leave whenever or just stay.
It's up to you.

370
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,352
But make sure you keep your mouth shut.

371
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,439
Judging from my experience,

372
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,108
your mouth is
what always gets you into trouble.

373
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,486
You don't want people to start
talking about you and your abortion.

374
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,364
You have no idea how much people enjoy
talking about other people.

375
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,868
You need to protect yourself now.

376
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,995
Right?

377
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,080
...is getting criticized.

378
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,458
Assemblyman Ahn claims

379
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,045
that what she has done
is considered a violation of the law.

380
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,174
I don't think I can help you with this.

381
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,926
-Ms. Jeong...
-I understand the situation you're in.

382
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,803
But this is a very delicate issue.

383
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
If I support you right now,

384
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,349
people will start attacking me as well

385
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,641
for encouraging abortion.

386
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,727
I don't encourage abortion.

387
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,897
I just think that it's not something
that the government can stop.

388
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,733
Yes, I know. And I agree with you.

389
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,612
But people already think
you're encouraging abortion.

390
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,947
You can deny it all you want,

391
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,908
but it'll be hard to change
how they think.

392
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,160
If the public opinion changes,

393
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,661
will you help?

394
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,041
My goodness.

395
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,878
I never thought you'd become famous

396
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,254
for something like this.

397
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,508
The court may have ruled against
the punishment on abortion,

398
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,676
but the government hasn't even passed
a revised bill.

399
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,220
You should've known better.

400
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,013
It helped you get the spotlight,

401
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,224
but you'll end up losing your seat
if you get punished.

402
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,434
So it was a useless thing to do.

403
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,605
I'm close with four out of the nine people
in the Ethics Committee.

404
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,273
Tell me if you need help.

405
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,610
I'll consider our old friendship
and help you avoid getting expelled.

406
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,279
I don't ever intend on
asking you for help.

407
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,825
Because if the Ethics Committee
carries out a fair screening,

408
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,410
I won't end up getting punished anyway.

409
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,751
What the...

410
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
My goodness.

411
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,677
Did you talk things out with Ms. Jeong?

412
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,720
She refused.

413
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,098
Tomorrow, on Kim Mi-jin's Current Affairs,

414
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,850
we'll be having a debate

415
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,103
with the members of the Daehan Party
regarding women's rights.

416
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,229
Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong,

417
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,397
Assemblyman Ahn Hyeon-min,

418
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,024
and Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong
will participate in the debate.

419
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,276
What?

420
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,696
Ms. Kang, did you decide to participate?

421
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,281
No.

422
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,533
How dare they announce that
without your permission?

423
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,118
This is unbelievable.

424
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,619
I'll call the TV station.

425
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,954
No.

426
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,665
If I refuse to participate now,

427
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,751
it'll look like I did something wrong.

428
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,710
Pardon?

429
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,463
Please don't tell me
you'll participate in the debate.

430
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,465
I can't back down without a fight.

431
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,844
No. If you appear on a TV program now,
you'll be bombarded with criticisms.

432
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,680
I cannot let you suffer
such criticism on TV.

433
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,392
I didn't work hard all this time
just to see you suffer like this.

434
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,561
Let's just wait
until the public sentiment cools down.

435
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,063
My actions may deserve to be criticized,

436
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,275
but I know
that my principles aren't wrong.

437
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,240
Ms. Kang.

438
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,244
THIS AREA WILL BE DEMOLISHED

439
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,288
-Hello, ma'am.
-You have a lot of nerve to be here.

440
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,456
There's a hearing tomorrow.

441
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,665
-Please come.
-Forget it.

442
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,209
Hello. There's a hearing tomorrow.

443
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,795
-There's a hearing tomorrow.
-Why do you keep coming here?

444
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,796
Please come tomorrow.

445
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,006
-Please come to the hearing.
-Hello.

446
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,549
There's a hearing tomorrow.

447
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,843
There's a hearing tomorrow.
Please come to the hearing.

448
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,887
Hello. Hi.

449
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,016
There's a hearing tomorrow.
Please come to the hearing.

450
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,227
I'll try to get the construction company
to accept

451
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,895
as many of your demands as possible.

452
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,524
I told you I'm not interested.

453
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,819
This time around, the demolition workers
will make sure they tear down the place.

454
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,031
Conflicts between the merchants
and the workers could lead to accidents.

455
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,117
Everyone here put their lives
on the line for this.

456
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,704
I don't care what they do.
Tell them to kick us out if they can.

457
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,166
We're not just going to sit here
and watch it get demolished.

458
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,751
-Go away!
-Sir.

459
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,086
Leave!

460
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,880
STOP THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

461
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,931
These are the statements domestic
and foreign women's organizations made.

462
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:50,890
Based on them,

463
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,935
I put together a list of questions
and answers for the debate.

464
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,270
Okay.

465
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,521
SAMPLE QUESTIONNAIRE

466
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,691
When the Constitutional Court ruled
to ban punishment on abortion,

467
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,735
did you look into the statements
from the members of the Daehan Party?

468
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,820
Yes.

469
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,282
The discussion of repealing

470
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,909
the abortion ban in Korea
began around 2016.

471
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,078
Find all of their statements since then.

472
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,997
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'm on it.

473
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,170
THIS AREA WILL BE DEMOLISHED
DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION

474
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,468
STOP THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

475
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,726
They're even wearing uniforms now.
What a royal mess.

476
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,604
I heard that they'll eat and sleep there.

477
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,606
Despite my effort to kick them out,

478
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,524
they won't even budge an inch.

479
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,984
Oh, dear.

480
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,279
I think I'm getting a muscle spasm
because of those bastards.

481
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,615
So you're setting up a hearing?

482
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,199
Yes.

483
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,079
You seemed so confident
that I thought you had a plan.

484
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,414
Was it just holding a hearing?

485
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,335
It seems like I have overestimated you.

486
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,713
I still have some time. If you wait...

487
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,839
Wait?

488
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,138
You don't have much time left, Mr. Jang.

489
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,099
The announcement is coming up soon.
It's no time to relax.

490
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,517
Get things moving.

491
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,479
Chairperson Jo keeps calling me.

492
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,189
You have three days.

493
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,902
If it doesn't get resolved in three days,
I'll just tear it down to the ground.

494
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,238
In that case, you'll have to
forget about the campaign club.

495
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,049
OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE

496
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,600
Is the hearing preparation going well?

497
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,185
We haven't prepared much.

498
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,730
Our focus is that we'll accept
the committee's demands.

499
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,066
But the city nor the construction company
will accept it.

500
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,319
Gosh, I'm staying late when it's just
a waste of time. This is tiring.

501
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,487
Okay.

502
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,910
Sir, can you take me to the minister's...

503
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,995
Mr. Oh?

504
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,248
He always hangs up first.

505
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,418
Damn it.

506
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,544
Gosh.

507
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,213
HEARING FOR SEOBUK MARKET

508
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,392
Lee Chang-jin came by and complained.

509
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,227
Are you doing your job properly?

510
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,438
Don't worry.

511
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,357
It might take time,
but I'm sure I can persuade them.

512
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,694
Tae-jun.

513
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,075
If you want to climb up to the top,
you must throw away everything.

514
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,703
How could you go up with such
a heavy heart?

515
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,123
If you want this, throw away everything.

516
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,708
That's the only way to survive.

517
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,438
Ms. Kang, why don't you
take a power nap before you go?

518
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,773
I can sleep in the car.

519
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,276
Could you find out more
about this statement here?

520
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,820
-Okay.
-I'll get going.

521
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,490
Bye.

522
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,992
-Bye.
-Bye.

523
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,293
LATE LEE SEONG-MIN

524
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,711
You were right.

525
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,631
What you said was right.

526
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,177
"Politics exists
for the good of the people."

527
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,931
If I focus on that,

528
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,101
I'll find a way.

529
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,439
You were right.

530
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,611
But...

531
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,449
I hope you can forgive me just this once.

532
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,496
Just this once.

533
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,979
Distribute the flyers for the hearing.

534
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,191
Hello, we know that the merchants
made the biggest effort

535
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,152
in helping the market grow.

536
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,571
And we've come up with a way
to compensate for your efforts.

537
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
Please come to the hearing and...

538
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,782
I really hope you can attend it.

539
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,325
Thank you. I'll see you then.

540
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,577
-Hello.
-Here's the flyer.

541
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,121
-Forget it.
-I know you're busy, but if you could...

542
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,414
How will you help us move?

543
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,833
-We live paycheck to paycheck.
-I don't trust you at all!

544
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,960
Please come.

545
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,587
Sir, please read this.

546
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,839
The hearing will cover

547
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,008
a plan to help you move
and a compensation package.

548
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,552
-Please attend the hearing.
-I hope you can really help us.

549
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,305
-Thank you. I'll see you then.
-Please hear me out.

550
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,098
-I'll see you then. Thank you.
-Please.

551
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,725
-Please come.
-Thank you.

552
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,977
STRIKE

553
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,563
PUBLIC HEARING ON THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF UIGWANG AND SEONGJIN CITY

554
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,148
A while ago, the abortion ban

555
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,483
was ruled unconstitutional
by the Constitutional Court.

556
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,653
I am aware that a revised bill
is urgently needed.

557
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,822
Are you preparing to propose a bill
from your party?

558
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,742
Yes, Assemblywoman Jeong Eun-hui
proposed the bill on the party's behalf.

559
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,120
As the bill was put together after
taking the party's input into account,

560
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,248
you can see it as a bill
from the whole party.

561
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,626
However, the bill hasn't been passed yet.

562
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,630
Correct. We haven't come up with a bill
to replace the policy yet.

563
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,883
So, I am flustered and deeply sorry

564
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,969
that such an unpleasant incident
took place.

565
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,138
-I found it.
-What?

566
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,683
Today, Assemblywoman Kang
is also here with us.

567
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,186
Could you please tell us

568
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,855
your side of the story
regarding the recent incident?

569
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,400
First of all, I am deeply sorry
for having disturbed

570
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:17,985
the public.

571
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,528
To elaborate on the incident,

572
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,740
it was a critical situation
where the mother's life was in danger.

573
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,950
Ms. Kang.

574
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,452
Aren't you ashamed?

575
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,498
I was utterly shocked when I heard
you were joining us today.

576
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,335
As of now, getting an abortion
is still illegal.

577
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,504
How could you come here
after violating the law?

578
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,006
As you have just pointed out,
because abortion is illegal,

579
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,050
there aren't any accurate statistics.

580
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,760
We need to know the scale of this matter

581
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,388
in order to provide policies
and come up with an alternative.

582
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,848
But we're not capable of doing so--

583
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,976
Don't change the subject.

584
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,603
You should've tried to stop the abortion.

585
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,189
You are an assemblywoman
who represents the people of the country.

586
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,566
How could you make such a rash decision?

587
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,279
KIM MI-JIN'S CURRENT AFFAIRS

588
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,797
Ms. Kang, I found additional materials.

589
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,178
We'll start soon.

590
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,188
I'd like to continue the discussion
before the break.

591
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,608
Assemblyman Ahn brought up
that Assemblywoman Kang

592
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,653
must be punished accordingly
for her action.

593
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,739
What's your take on this, Assemblyman Jo?

594
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,699
I agree with him.

595
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,035
Regardless of what the situation was like,

596
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,038
I believe that she should be punished.

597
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,289
It was clearly a criminal act.

598
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,751
Both of you stated that
there must be a punishment.

599
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,130
Shouldn't we at least give her
a chance to explain herself?

600
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,966
Ms. Kang?

601
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,137
We are all aware...

602
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:13,392
that abortion isn't something
the law can prevent from happening.

603
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,645
With that logic, wouldn't it be
a form of violence for a country

604
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,439
to deny people's right of choice?

605
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,024
The times have changed.

606
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,235
I believe that we must legally allow
people to have abortions.

607
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,072
Excuse me? How could you say that?

608
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,615
What do you mean?

609
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,367
Look, Ms. Kang.

610
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,703
This is why the public believes
that you're encouraging abortions.

611
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,455
It seems you are all very shocked.

612
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,248
I was actually directly quoting

613
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,835
Mr. Ahn from an event he spoke at,
a few years ago.

614
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,130
Pardon?

615
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,591
It was at a celebratory event
in your district two years ago

616
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,009
on Women's Day.

617
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,428
This is a direct quote
from your speech that day.

618
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,515
In case you had forgotten,
I brought this to jog your memory.

619
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,517
Would you like to take a look?

620
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,398
ASSEMBLYMAN AHN, I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST
LEGALLY ALLOW ABORTIONS

621
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,485
Well, let me explain. A lot of women

622
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,404
had attended the event that day.

623
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,531
Are you telling me that
your opinions may change

624
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,157
depending on who your audience is?

625
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,702
You're a member of the National Assembly.
That shouldn't affect your opinions.

626
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,330
The atmosphere of the event
was different, you know.

627
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,959
Well, my memory of that event
is quite blurry.

628
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,462
I meant if the mother was in critical
condition and if it's an unjust incident

629
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,424
it should be allowed.
But only in that circumstance.

630
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,467
Yes. I believe I've explained to you

631
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,636
that my case was a similar circumstance.

632
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,346
It was a critical circumstance

633
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,974
where a mother could have lost her life
without the surgery.

634
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,934
Given the circumstance,

635
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,896
I think you would have made
the same decision.

636
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:41,939
Am I wrong?

637
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,735
By asking to legalize abortion,

638
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,363
I'm not asking to let women
have an abortion without cause.

639
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,116
I'm saying that abortion isn't a choice
for some people.

640
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,286
I'd like to use this opportunity
to say something to the public.

641
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,330
I urge you to stop trying to disclose
the identity of the mother

642
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,501
as well as writing vicious comments
toward the mother on the Internet.

643
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,212
It's a tragedy that can happen to anyone.

644
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,132
It's a problem of our society,
not of individuals.

645
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,093
It's an assignment of our era
we must solve together.

646
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,762
I am deeply sorry to have caused

647
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,973
disturbances to the public
regarding this incident.

648
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,600
If you want to punish me,

649
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,643
I will accept any punishment
that is given to me.

650
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,353
You can criticize me.

651
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
Or you can support me.

652
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,275
I'd just like for you all
to think about the decision

653
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,361
you would have made
if you were in my shoes.

654
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,073
If you can agree with me that
a law cannot be used to regulate

655
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,118
everyone's life, that will be enough...

656
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,581
for me to be grateful for.

657
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,637
-Well done.
-Good work.

658
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,058
-Well done, sir.
-Okay.

659
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,645
We just helped hike up
her approval rating.

660
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,689
Damn it.

661
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,733
Your car is ready for you, sir.

662
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,864
What's the point
of having a public hearing?

663
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,203
PUBLIC HEARING
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

664
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,329
Over here.

665
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,333
-Another hearing?
-So what?

666
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,544
-Why are we here anyway?
-This better be good.

667
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,129
-Let's sit over there.
-This is a waste of time.

668
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,676
Can I take this seat here?

669
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,972
From what I've heard earlier,
they prepared a lot for this hearing.

670
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,599
They emphasized that
we'd like the compensation package.

671
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,434
Goodness, they're just saying that.

672
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,311
-We've been fooled before.
-Come on.

673
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,897
I mean, hear me out.
All they did was gather people around

674
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,817
and talk about their own interests.
They never once listened to us.

675
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,860
Whatever. I have no expectations.

676
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,112
Don't say that.

677
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,489
You know that young guy
who's been going around the market?

678
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,117
He's close with Ok-ja
and he made it sound like

679
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,827
-this will be resolved today.
-Really?

680
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,495
-That's why I came.
-Really?

681
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,123
Does that mean things are going

682
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,249
work out well for us?

683
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,084
Yes. Let's trust him and hear them out.

684
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,460
I really hope it works out.

685
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,462
-Gosh.
-Right. Same here.

686
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,258
Mr. Jang.

687
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,218
Except for a few merchants at the market,

688
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,803
everyone is here.

689
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,726
PUBLIC HEARING

690
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,328
If you want this, throw away everything.

691
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,746
That's the only way to survive.

692
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,416
Politics exists
for the good of the people.

693
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,210
If you focus on that,
you'll be able to find a way.

694
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,100
You can start.

695
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,409
The muscle spasms seem to be better now.

696
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:27,790
Goodness,
I brought this upon myself, you know.

697
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,876
It would've been all better if I left
this world when I was supposed to.

698
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,837
Because I'm staying here longer
than I should have,

699
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,547
I had to see my grandson die.

700
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,592
And I'm making it harder
for you to do your job, too.

701
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,344
Gosh, please don't say that.

702
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,971
People like me have our jobs

703
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,140
because of your votes.

704
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,267
I'm imposing on so many people.

705
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:49,853
Ma'am.

706
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,106
Please hang in there a bit more.

707
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,942
Do you remember the chief of staff
who helped you before?

708
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,319
He's trying his best to resolve this.

709
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,822
I'm sure things will work out
for the merchants soon.

710
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,200
That man who helped me before?

711
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,035
Yes.

712
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,206
Don't worry, ma'am.

713
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,166
THIS AREA WILL BE DEMOLISHED

714
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,421
We're here. Let's go.

715
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,967
-Hey, hurry up.
-Let's start.

716
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,593
-Yes, sir.
-No!

717
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,719
What are you doing?

718
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,267
I'm working over here!

719
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,145
You can't just barge in here!
You have no right!

720
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,022
If you had moved out of here,
you wouldn't be in this situation!

721
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,358
We're just following the law.
Take it up with the owner!

722
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,235
You bastard!

723
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,030
-Why are you selling bean sprouts here?
-No! Don't!

724
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,824
-No! No!
-Damn it.

725
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,075
-No!
-Are you all right?

726
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,202
If you had left,
you wouldn't have to face this.

727
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,413
No...

728
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,749
PUBLIC HEARING
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

729
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,923
HAN DO-GYEONG

730
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,557
You can't do this!

731
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,434
-Don't you dare!
-Move!

732
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,685
-What are you doing?
-Damn it.

733
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,729
-Stop it!
-Hey.

734
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,482
-You'd better back off.
-What are you doing?

735
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,816
Get them out.

736
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,735
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

737
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,361
You bastards! Let go of me.

738
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,989
-What are you doing?
-Back off!

739
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,034
-You can't come in.
-Hey, hey.

740
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,660
-Stop it.
-Get out of here!

741
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,580
Move back!

742
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,999
No...

743
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,293
Please pick up.

744
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,049
-This is taking too long.
-Why is it being delayed?

745
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,554
Why are they wasting our time?

746
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,182
What? What are you saying?

747
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,518
-They're demolishing the market?
-What?

748
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,645
Sir, what do you mean
they are demolishing the market?

749
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:58,857
They are demolishing the market right now.

750
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,401
-Oh, no!
-I can't believe this!

751
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,449
Let's hurry! They're demolishing it now!

752
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,874
HAN DO-GYEONG

753
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,460
-No! My store!
-Oh, no.

754
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,132
Back off!

755
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,221
Don't you dare touch her!

756
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,473
What the hell are you doing?

757
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,101
-Let go!
-How dare you!

758
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,811
Are you guys the demolition crew?

759
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,064
-Let's hurry.
-Let's go.

760
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,401
-Hurry.
-My gosh!

761
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,155
You bastard, you gathered all of us here!
What kind of ruse is this?

762
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,076
Do you even know
what we've been through to get this far?

763
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,121
Let go!

764
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,455
Let's hurry to the market!

765
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,999
You said you were on our side.

766
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,210
How could you do this?

767
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
-Over here!
-Let's go.

768
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,966
We're not going to back down!

769
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,260
-Come on!
-Let's go.

770
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,595
Mr. Jang.

771
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,058
Mr. Jang.

772
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,537
You bastards, you can't do this!

773
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,331
What the hell do you think you're doing?

774
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,796
Are you okay?

775
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,008
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

776
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,177
This way.

777
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,770
MR. LEE CHANG-JIN

778
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,525
Hey.

779
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,195
I see.

780
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,366
He's finally decided
to dump all his burdens.

781
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,034
Only then can he thrive as a politician.

782
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:57,119
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE SEONG-MIN

783
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,540
Mr. Jang.

784
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,668
Do you think
this was the right thing to do?

785
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,131
More than 100 people came
from the demolition crew.

786
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,175
The merchants would've suffered
severer injuries if we hadn't done this.

787
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,428
We prevented the worst-case scenario.

788
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,929
Mr. Jang.

789
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,144
I'm ready for the criticism.

790
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,691
Forced demolition for the redevelopment

791
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,985
of Seobuk Market in Uigwang City
has commenced.

792
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,737
When the demolition began,

793
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,199
most of the merchants were attending
a public hearing at the City Hall.

794
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,619
Enraged by the news, the merchants
strongly protested against it, but...

795
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,539
-Where's Ms. Kang?
-She's in a meeting with the reporters.

796
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,752
Mr. Go, did you hear about
the nominations for Seongjin City?

797
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,838
-What about it?
-I heard Mr. Jang will be one of them.

798
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,590
-Tae-jun?
-Yes.

799
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,134
Everyone is already talking about it.

800
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,722
-Mr. Go.
-Yes.

801
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,849
You received a mail from overseas.

802
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,356
You always need to pester people
to get things done.

803
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,525
Tell Ms. Kang to give me a call.

804
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,902
-Okay.
-Yes, we will.

805
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,201
Hey.

806
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,579
-Are you going somewhere?
-I'm heading out to see Tae-jun.

807
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,372
I got the documents from Hong Kong.

808
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,168
See you later!

809
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,146
What happened?

810
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,775
It was forced execution
carried out in accordance with the law.

811
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,027
That's it?

812
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,825
Then was all of this...

813
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,953
Mr. Jang's plan?

814
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,501
I can't believe we executed the demolition
while the merchants were not there.

815
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,546
You knew about it too, right?

816
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,381
That's probably why
you told me to give up.

817
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,135
-Mr. Han.
-Was it really Mr. Jang's plan?

818
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,512
Was it?

819
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,974
If he hadn't decided to go this route,

820
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,184
more merchants would've suffered injuries.

821
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,311
They would've ended up on the streets

822
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,480
without any proper compensation.

823
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,733
Mr. Jang simply did

824
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,069
what no one else was willing to do.

825
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,712
Oh, my. The man of the hour is here.

826
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,130
Here, have a seat.

827
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,594
Mr. Jang Tae-jun made
such a remarkable contribution.

828
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,139
Who'd make a better candidate
for Seongjin City than Mr. Jang?

829
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,599
Don't you agree?

830
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,978
All right, everyone.

831
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,688
Now that Tae-jun is here,

832
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,065
-let's all drink.
-Sure.

833
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,860
Great work today. Let me pour you one.

834
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,531
All right.
Here's to Jang Tae-jun's future!

835
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,366
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

836
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,790
MR. GO SEOK-MAN

837
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,544
You should answer it.

838
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,428
The FIU in Hong Kong

839
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,722
sent some documents to Ms. Kang's office.

840
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,841
This came from Hong Kong.

841
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,387
I figured the official document would take
too long, so I asked for a copy.

842
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,638
You were right, Tae-jun.

843
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,474
Hwain Infra has a connection
with Mr. Song.

844
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,060
They're collecting slush funds
through their construction projects

845
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,561
in Thailand, Singapore, and Russia.

846
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,729
Seok-man.

847
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,025
With this, we can take down
Lee Chang-jin of Joojin Constructions

848
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,611
as well as Chairman Sung of Youngil Group.

849
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,744
Hey, what's the matter?

850
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,998
Let's not make this public
for the time being.

851
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,624
What are you talking about?

852
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,001
We need some time.

853
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,585
I'll handle this.

854
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,090
I heard the Nomination Committee

855
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:05,468
is considering you as one of the
candidates for Seongjin City. Is it true?

856
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,594
Seok-man.

857
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,972
I guess it is true, then.

858
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,102
Have you lost your mind?

859
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,479
Assemblyman Lee passed away
only a little while ago.

860
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,607
And you're seriously vying for that spot?

861
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,154
So the Seobuk Market incident
was your doing too.

862
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,989
You used it to cut a deal
with Minister Song.

863
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,907
I simply did what I could do.

864
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,577
-Do you really have to do all this?
-I have to hold on to something.

865
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,745
What else can I do?

866
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,664
Must you sell your conscience
just for a seat in the National Assembly?

867
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,332
I'll gladly sell my conscience

868
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,251
if I can be elected and gain power.

869
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,754
Without power, we can't do anything.

870
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,339
You said I should become an assemblyman
and help Seon-yeong.

871
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,470
Let's wait for just a little while.
I'll sort it all out.

872
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,520
I can't wait until then.

873
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,023
Do you realize how you look right now?

874
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,234
You look like
a corrupt, backstabbing jerk.

875
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,198
Can you say what you just told me
in front of Assemblyman Lee?

876
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,951
You won't be able to
become someone like that.

877
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,286
I know you can't.

878
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,704
Come to your senses, you prick!

879
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,789
Seok-man.

880
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,123
Let go, you jerk!

881
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,630
-Hey.
-Mr. Jang.

882
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,632
I heard the FIU in Hong Kong
sent the documents.

883
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,967
-I'm aware.
-What are you going to do?

884
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,928
If it's made public now...

885
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,608
-Hello.
-You're back.

886
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,528
Hello.

887
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,862
Where's Mr. Go?

888
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,365
I think he's running a little late.

889
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,035
This is a list of
all the by-election candidates.

890
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,997
We'll start the meeting
as soon as Mr. Go gets here.

891
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,666
Yes, ma'am.

892
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,676
LIST OF BY-ELECTION CANDIDATES

893
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,052
SEONGJIN CITY, JANG TAE-JUN

894
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,144
Seon-yeong.

895
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,771
I want you to trust me

896
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,607
no matter which choice I make.

897
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,235
What's that supposed to mean?

898
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,737
I want you to trust me no matter what.

899
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,998
I'm sorry.

900
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,879
I'm sorry.

901
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,686
I'm going now.

902
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,451
JANG TAE-JUN

903
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,550
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

904
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,644
Mr. Jang, everything's ready.

905
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,774
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG

906
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,749
Earlier today, the Nomination Committee
of the Daehan Party

907
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:08,169
announced the results of their
by-election candidate evaluations.

908
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,880
The committee announced
that the Daehan Party has nominated

909
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,008
Mr. Jang Tae-jun, the head Chief of Staff
of Minister Song Hui-seop,

910
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,427
for the upcoming by-election
in Seongjin City.

911
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,722
Originally from Seongjin City,
Gyeonggi-do,

912
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,558
Mr. Jang worked
in the Financial Crimes Unit

913
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,894
at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
upon graduating summa cum laude from KNPU,

914
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,731
and he has been working in assemblymen's
offices for ten years since 2009.

915
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,194
Seobuk Market.

916
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,573
Did you plan the whole thing?

917
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,785
Why?

918
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,328
Why did you do that?

919
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,331
When Mr. Yu Jin-su died,

920
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,833
I trusted you.

921
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,085
I believed that it was the best choice
you could've made.

922
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,588
We should create a world
without the underprivileged,

923
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,506
rather than to focus on helping them.

924
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,092
We can't do anything
unless the law and the system change.

925
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,803
I thought you were trying to change that.

926
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,556
That's what I believed.

927
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,059
I will do that.

928
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,644
Do what?

929
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,271
For whom?

930
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:09,731
Mr. Han.

931
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,194
Let's go in together.

932
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,780
We saved a seat for you.

933
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,410
No.

934
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,081
You once told me...

935
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,752
that I don't need to follow your suit.

936
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,380
You said I should act on my faith
if I want to survive here.

937
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,634
I will do that.

938
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,553
I'll be sure to survive here until the end

939
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,806
so that I can prove

940
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,059
that you were wrong.

941
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,603
Okay.

942
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,521
I'll look forward to it.

943
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,193

957
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,116
DAEHAN PARTY
JANG TAE-JUN WILL TAKE THE LEAD

958
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,285
-Jang Tae-jun.
-Jang Tae-jun.

959
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,207
Hello.

960
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,751
I'm Jang Tae-jun,
and I'll be representing the Daehan Party

961
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,587
in the upcoming by-election
for Seongjin City.

962
01:01:57,338 --> 01:02:00,717
I had dreamed of a world
where fairness and righteousness prevail.

963
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,010
I had hoped to welcome a world

964
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,597
where the weak are protected
and those who do bad deeds get punished.

965
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,725
However,

966
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,437
my ten years of experience
as assemblymen's aide taught me this.

967
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:17,316
Such a world simply does not exist.

968
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,360
-Move!
-My gosh!

969
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,988
Why are you doing this to us?

970
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,494
What the hell are you doing?

971
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,708
A world that is fair to everyone
does not exist.

972
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,044
A world where everyone is treated justly
doesn't exist either.

973
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,674
Ms. Kang.

974
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,426
It has never existed until now.

975
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,554
And even in the future,
such a world will probably never come.

976
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:51,184
Those with power will continue
to bring the powerless to their knees,

977
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,269
and the rich
will continue to take from others

978
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,688
to protect what they have,
just like they're doing now.

979
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,566
Then they will put on a smile again

980
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,195
and reach their hands out to you.

981
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,282
The road to hell is always paved
with good intentions.

982
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,493
The viper has returned with more poison.

983
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,953
-One thing that's clear is that...
-I'm so impressed by him.

984
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:15,208
I refuse to live even just one day
in a world like this.

985
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,377
A world where everyone
gets equal opportunities.

986
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,880
A world where we can all stand tall.

987
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:25,218
A world where we can make
our dreams come true if we work hard.

988
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,095
A world, which we can pass down
to our future generations

989
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,347
without feeling ashamed.

990
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,808
I will create such a world.

991
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,684
I, Jang Tae-jun, will create

992
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,228
a world like that with all of you.

993
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,979
-No...
-This can't be happening.

994
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,873
"Is a mere chief of staff qualified
for a seat in the National Assembly?"

995
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,085
"Is he competent enough?" You may wonder.
And let me assure you.

996
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,547
I do not wish to become just another
assemblyman wearing the gold badge.

997
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,174
Like what I've done for the past 10 years,

998
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,261
I'll go out there and listen
to your concerns firsthand.

999
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,929
I will hold your hands

1000
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,514
and touch your hearts.

1001
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:14,600
I promise you that I will be
Seongjin City's faithful chief of staff.

1002
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,916
I have made many mistakes in my career.

1003
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,335
I might make more mistakes in the future.

1004
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:45,131
But even if I do,
I will learn from those mistakes

1005
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,634
and fix them to ensure a better future.

1006
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,777
I will rise
with a huge weight on my shoulders

1007
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,529
for the new Seongjin City.

1008
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:13,159
March toward the new path with me.

1009
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:16,913
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1010
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,707
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1011
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,208
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1012
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:25,421
-Please give me your support.
-Jang Tae-jun!

1013
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,716
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1014
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,217
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Thank you.

1015
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,137
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1016
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,265
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1017
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,352
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1018
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,358
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1019
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,402
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1020
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,447
-Jang Tae-jun!
-Jang Tae-jun!

1021
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,084
PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO
CHIEF OF STAFF SEASON 2
