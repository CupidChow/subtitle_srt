1
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,109
The prosecution obtained evidence
that the chairperson of the Daehan Party,

2
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,903
Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong, accepted bribes

3
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,821
in exchange for nominations
on the committee.

4
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,656
The prosecution has launched
an investigation.

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,533
-Did you promise to nominate them?
-Did you...

6
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,952
The prosecution announced
that they'll summon the assemblyman

7
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,331
and raid his house and office
with a search and seizure warrant.

8
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,627
Assemblyman Jeong Seung-yun,
Assemblyman Park Yeong-beom,

9
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,630
and Assemblyman Son Jeong-yeol of
the Daehan Party who bribed Assemblyman Jo

10
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,507
will be summoned to be investigated, too.

11
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,009
All of the assemblymen involved

12
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:36,179
were on the committee to investigate
Joojin Chemical's chemical leak.

13
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,848
The National Assembly will have difficulty
to investigate the leak.

14
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,435
-Sir!
-Any words?

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,728
Coming through.

16
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,401
-Yes.
-As a current assemblyman

17
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,696
whose duty is to obey the law
and diligently fulfill his given tasks

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,323
in good conscience,

19
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,743
how could you cover up evidence of bribery

20
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:03,081
and threaten another assemblyman
in order to fulfill your own interests?

21
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,211
Tae-jun.

22
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,174
You should've known that a war
always sheds blood.

23
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,929
-Sir!
-Assemblyman Jo!

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,600
It is impossible to find your way
if you get lost in the dark.

25
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,732
Being unaware of what's to come

26
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,112
elevates your fear,

27
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,575
and the darkness
will ultimately swallow you up.

28
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:53,590
EPISODE 6 MAZE

29
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,718
Sir, is this true?

30
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,428
-Excuse us.
-Could you spare a second?

31
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,598
-Have you stepped down as chairperson?
-What about the Daehan Party?

32
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,933
-Won't the party hold you accountable?
-Coming through.

33
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,560
Sir, just a few words.

34
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,978
Get out of the way!

35
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,939
-Sir, any words?
-Will you be resigning as chairperson?

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,692
-What will happen to the Daehan Party?
-Sir.

37
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,903
Sir, what about the Daehan Party?

38
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,655
-Sir, answer us.
-A word, please, sir.

39
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,074
Gosh. Sir, are you all right?

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
Must you even ask?

41
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,537
-The Daehan Party, sir?
-My apologies.

42
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,331
Let's get going.

43
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,875
Sir, your seat belt.

44
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,170
Why the hell is Song Hui-seop calling me?

45
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,715
Hello?

46
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,479
Gizzard shads are plump and delicious
during this time of year.

47
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,939
Please try some.

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,400
You expect me to swallow that
with the thorn you stuck in my throat?

49
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,739
Gizzard shad sashimi is fatty and tasty,

50
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,908
but the fine bones are a nuisance.

51
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,411
What game are you playing?

52
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:12,293
I'll try my best to have the investigation
wrapped up before it gets too far.

53
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,633
How am I supposed to interpret
the carrot after the stick?

54
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,302
We're long-time acquaintances.

55
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,932
It wouldn't be right to let you be out
in the cold at the end of your term.

56
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:31,479
If you stay put, I'll put together
a toasty room for you to rest in.

57
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,900
You have your hands around my neck,
so I'm supposed to shut up

58
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,485
and let you walk all over me?

59
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,613
How could I possibly control you, Mr. Jo?

60
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,781
Goodness.

61
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,366
Minister Song.

62
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,911
If you don't like my offer,

63
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,957
take your chances at the slaughterhouse.

64
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:59,841
You see, because gizzard shads
have too many fine bones,

65
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,345
they were usually salted and fermented.

66
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:09,559
However, I love to eat them
the way they are, bones and all.

67
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,401
Stay put like salted fermented fish,

68
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,946
or you'll be chewed to pieces.

69
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,040
Gosh, this is so good.

70
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,460
The Daehan Party's chairperson
Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong

71
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,963
was proven to have received bribes
in exchange for nominations.

72
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,008
With the election right around the corner,
his party meets a major crisis.

73
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,551
Good day, everyone.

74
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,012
The Daehan Party called
an emergency meeting

75
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,513
to discuss possible countermeasures.

76
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,142
If the party can't produce a solution

77
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,394
-to win back the public's trust,
-Let's discuss it later.

78
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,815
many predict that it'll lead to them
losing in the general election.

79
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,944
Did you meet the committee chairperson?

80
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,656
He dropped Assemblyman Jo
and the other assemblymen

81
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,116
involved in the bribe.

82
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,080
As of now, it won't be easy
to bring back the committee.

83
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,998
It coming back is a problem too.

84
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,209
Instead of those who were dropped,

85
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,587
Song Hui-seop's people
will most likely fill the spots.

86
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,300
Minister Song, you're here.

87
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,968
Hello, sir.

88
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,489
Goodness.

89
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,660
According to a source...

90
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,495
What a colossal mess.

91
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,497
A solution to this issue...

92
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,415
-What do you think?
-It's obvious.

93
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,626
Minister Song will seize power
over the party.

94
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,671
The investigation committee
will go down the drain.

95
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,091
So what brings you by?

96
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,009
I'm here for the files on Joojin Chemical.

97
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,680
I heard that Ms. Lee is in the hospital.

98
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,890
What happened?

99
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,643
The guy on the motorcycle

100
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,438
struck her on the head with a helmet.

101
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,356
She won't be back any time soon.

102
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,109
This is bad.

103
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,735
Considering what happened to Mr. Go too,

104
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,113
we should probably be careful.

105
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,783
This happened in broad daylight.
Who knows it couldn't happen to us?

106
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,327
What about Ms. Yun?

107
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,038
She and Mr. Han
went to meet Joojin Chemical employees.

108
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,958
There's a father and son who works there.

109
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,294
The Administrative Investigation Committee
is a bust,

110
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,421
so I'm not sure if we should carry on.

111
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,551
The basis of liability
for the public notification policy...

112
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,844
-Carry on then.
-The prosecution

113
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,805
questioned if the introduction of
mugshot policy by the Ministry of Justice

114
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,183
went against current laws,
and requested a reexamination.

115
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,397
They're running late.

116
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,066
I'll try calling them.

117
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,409
Hello, sir.

118
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,372
This is Yun Hye-won
at Assemblyman Jang's office.

119
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,833
Hello, I'm Yun Hye-won.

120
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,335
-Hello.
-Hi.

121
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,962
Didn't your son come with you?

122
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,216
Something came up, I'm afraid.

123
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,053
Right. Please have a seat.
Would you like some coffee?

124
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,055
No, I'm good.

125
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,609
I'm sorry, but I don't think
we can help you.

126
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,069
Sorry?

127
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,363
That's what I came here to say.

128
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
Is there

129
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,492
something wrong?

130
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,286
Why couldn't your son make it today?

131
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,628
JOOJIN CHEMICAL ENGINEER
LEAKS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY

132
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,341
-What happened?
-The son was arrested

133
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,885
for leaking Joojin Chemical's
industrial technology.

134
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,971
I'm sure you read the article,

135
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,348
but he took out classified files
without authorization.

136
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,102
The problem is that those files
contained core industrial technology.

137
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,604
Is he in violation
of the Prevention of Divulgence Act?

138
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,274
Yes, and the sentence is quite heavy too.

139
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,235
He could get up to seven years in prison.

140
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,322
Thank you. I'll call you back.

141
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,351
His son only took out the files
after receiving approval.

142
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,730
That's when the audit team
caught him though.

143
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,566
It was a trap.

144
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,486
What about the other employees
we were scheduled to meet?

145
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,489
No one's answering my calls.

146
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,410
They've set an example.

147
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,246
This is what happens if they talk to us.

148
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,043
How do you think

149
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,337
Joojin Chemical knew

150
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,755
we were meeting Mr. Kim today?

151
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,717
The same goes for the others.

152
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,470
Only the people at our offices know

153
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,513
who we were meeting today.

154
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,143
Here's the press release.

155
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,898
We have a mole.

156
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,734
It's someone from your office or mine.

157
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,259
Right?

158
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,140
Where did Mr. Yang go?

159
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,685
He's meeting a reporter regarding
the redevelopment of Seongjin City.

160
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,729
Ms. Yun, here you go.

161
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,689
Thank you.

162
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,279
I have something to tell you.
Could you spare me some time?

163
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,491
I'm heading to the secretariat
to hand in these receipts.

164
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,252
Da-jeong.

165
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,675
Yesterday, Mr. Yang asked if
he could see the office ledgers,

166
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,636
and I couldn't say no.

167
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,889
I thought I should tell you though.

168
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,184
Thank you for telling me.

169
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,061
Sure.

170
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,238
Going up. Doors closing.

171
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,158
Hey, there.

172
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,076
Hi.

173
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,704
I hear you met with
the employees of Joojin Chemical.

174
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,997
Did it go well?

175
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,708
It did.

176
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,253
Deciding to talk
wouldn't have been the easiest choice.

177
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,963
I truly respect them.

178
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,424
So who are they?

179
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,178
I'm sorry, but I can't reveal
their identities yet.

180
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,308
Yes, of course.
Protecting whistle-blowers is key.

181
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,313
I heard you met with a reporter.

182
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,939
Yes, it was to

183
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,443
request a favorable article
regarding the redevelopment

184
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,278
of Seongjin City.

185
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,239
Let me know when it gets posted.

186
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,158
I'll tell Mr. Jang.

187
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,577
Sure, of course.

188
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,089
Hello, everyone.

189
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,300
How's it going?

190
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,719
You seem exhausted.

191
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,596
-My eyes are killing me.
-Then take a nap.

192
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,974
-You're a busy man, aren't you?
-Gosh, please.

193
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,184
Hi.

194
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,790
It's good to see you.

195
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,211
My goodness. It's been a while.

196
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,796
He's like the man who owns the world.

197
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,840
Well, he now owns
the prosecutors' office and his party.

198
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,182
Yes, Ms. Lee.

199
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,644
I'll be right there.

200
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,773
Ms. Lee's awake.

201
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,609
That's great news. You should go to her.

202
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,363
Goodness, Ms. Kang.

203
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,576
You must be worried
about your injured chief of staff.

204
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,288
She should've been careful.
This really shouldn't happen again.

205
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,248
Right?

206
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,168
Does the big minister has time
to care for my chief of staff now?

207
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,468
She's still as bitchy as ever.

208
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,848
Oh, Mr. Jang.

209
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,186
If you have time, I'd like to have a word.

210
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,029
The typhoon must've veered away.

211
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,032
What nice weather we have.

212
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,120
Enjoy it while you can.

213
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,082
Because once you're in prison,
you won't be able to.

214
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,128
Two months ago,
I was only a chief of staff.

215
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,339
But now I'm an assemblyman.

216
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,217
Not everything will go your way.

217
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,096
You may have the right
not to be arrested at this moment,

218
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,349
but with Jo Gap-yeong gone,

219
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,185
it'll be easy to vote
for your right to be revoked.

220
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,812
So much for this badge, right?

221
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:44,151
You'll be taking it off
in less than a month's time.

222
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,279
That's all the time I need to

223
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,365
drag you down too.

224
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,783
Such nonsense!

225
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,457
-Sir, your ride is here.
-Good.

226
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,462
Don't waste what time you have left
on anything frivolous

227
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,673
and use it wisely.

228
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,806
You seem worse
than the last time I saw you.

229
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,766
Are you sick?

230
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,309
How was the Philippines?

231
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,940
I'm honored to know
that you're checking my whereabouts.

232
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,568
I apologize for not
getting you something from the trip.

233
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,488
Next time, I'll remember
to buy you some Tiger Balm.

234
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,949
It works wonders on sore spots.

235
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,952
I should be the one getting you a gift.

236
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,954
After all, I haven't forgotten

237
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,623
what you did to my father.

238
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,043
I'm grateful, but that's a gift

239
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,170
I'd rather decline.

240
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,842
I'll get going.

241
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,441
This is Jang Tae-jun.

242
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,484
Could we meet?

243
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,320
Jang Tae-jun and Kang Seon-yeong.

244
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,574
You never know what they could be cooking,
so keep an eye on them.

245
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,618
Don't worry, sir.

246
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,913
I took the liberty of
planting a mole in the office.

247
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,543
You adorable boy.

248
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,420
Thank you, sir.

249
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
A mole?

250
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,927
Gosh, my baby.

251
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,930
Did your grandma feed you?

252
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,517
Have fun with your dad
and be good to your grandma.

253
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,311
Are you sleepy?

254
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,026
Honey, I'll call you later. Bye.

255
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,039
How are you feeling?

256
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,624
I'm all right.

257
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,044
Having to lie down all day
is giving me the cramps though.

258
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,213
Aren't you dizzy or anything?

259
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,423
You know how healthy and strong I am.

260
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,136
I had to get a few stitches on the head
which means I have bald patches.

261
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,807
All I need to do is cover them up.

262
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,058
What about your family?

263
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,063
It seemed too much for my husband
to care for both kids,

264
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,066
so I told him to leave them with my mom.

265
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,485
The audit

266
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,695
is a bust, right?

267
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
Mr. Han informed me.

268
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,993
Lee Chang-jin will get away with it.

269
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,412
I can't let that happen.

270
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,126
I have a strong feeling
that it was him who hurt Mr. Go.

271
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,004
She should have been more careful.

272
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,174
You can't afford to lose
one more chief of staff.

273
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,762
Are you behind Mr. Go's death as well?

274
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,307
Why are you accusing me?

275
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,603
I thought he took his own life
because you gave him too much work.

276
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,067
He's more than capable of doing so.

277
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,572
I apologize for being out of commission
at a time like this.

278
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,868
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

279
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,703
Now I'm worried about the office.

280
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,705
We all know what Lee Chang-jin is after.

281
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,456
I'm sure our people

282
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,042
are shaken up by this ordeal.

283
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,380
I'll take care of it,

284
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,507
so don't worry.

285
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,392
All I wanted was to catch a cattle,
but it ran all over me.

286
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,397
Minister Song will try
to tie you up in this too.

287
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,025
I know.

288
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,947
I can't end my career
going down as an old cat.

289
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,075
We need something
to hit Song Hui-seop with,

290
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,620
but my people haven't
been able to find anything.

291
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,624
He's a former fourth-term assemblyman

292
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,877
and the current Minister of Justice.
He must've taken a shit somewhere, right?

293
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,087
Don't you have anything?

294
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:21,178
I'm sure that Minister Song
cleaned up after himself,

295
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,224
and I've used up
all the leverage I have too.

296
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,685
So?

297
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,688
It's not like you to
just give up like this.

298
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
You're back, sir.

299
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,780
-So here...
-Come see me.

300
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,334
What happened at
the party council meeting?

301
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,711
Members of the Supreme Council
are leading the party,

302
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,006
but Minister Song's
pulling the strings from behind.

303
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,051
He'll make sure
the party's decisions favor him.

304
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,636
Things are bad.

305
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,348
We need to find a way out of this
by hitting Joojin Chemical.

306
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,563
He's one of the employees of Joojin
we were scheduled to meet today.

307
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,776
Other employees who offered their help
have severed contact with us too.

308
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,696
I suspect we have a mole
hired by Joojin Chemical.

309
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,366
In one of our offices?

310
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,243
That's the only explanation.

311
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,744
The list was only shared

312
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,330
between our office and Ms. Kang's.

313
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,209
-Any suspects?
-I can't be sure,

314
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,503
but Mr. Yang is one.

315
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,339
JOOJIN CHEMICAL ENGINEER
LEAKS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY

316
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,891
I've been checking his whereabouts
since he joined us.

317
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,728
-Should we work around him for now?
-Don't jump to conclusions.

318
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,690
Those at Ms. Kang's office are probably
shook up after Ms. Lee's accident.

319
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,775
It could be one of them.

320
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,153
Mr. Han is looking into her office
as we speak.

321
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,955
Ma'am, you're back.

322
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,708
How's Ms. Lee?

323
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,794
I think she'll be fine
after a few more days of rest.

324
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:19,963
That's a relief.

325
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,798
Did you meet
the Joojin Chemical employees?

326
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,555
Actually, I have something to tell you
regarding that matter.

327
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,706
Mr. Han just informed me.

328
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,585
Things are getting worse.

329
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,212
A roadblock only means that

330
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,380
we have to go another way.

331
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,093
Minister Song, Chairman Sung, and CEO Lee.

332
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,011
They have each other's backs.

333
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,930
It's hard to get between them.

334
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,892
Congratulations, sir.

335
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,354
Could it be going any more smoothly?

336
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,483
-Congratulations, Minister Song.
-Thank you.

337
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,776
It's my pleasure.

338
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,779
Now that you own the party,

339
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,116
your path is clear
all the way to the Blue House.

340
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,993
Water should be sipped, not chugged.

341
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,578
I don't need an upset stomach.

342
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,331
So what if you get one though?

343
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,626
I can always rub it
until the pain subsides.

344
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,420
Don't you agree?

345
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,508
I'm sorry for causing such a commotion.

346
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,139
It's normal for vines
to tangle up a growing tree.

347
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,932
Just make sure this never happens again.

348
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,642
Yes, of course.

349
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,936
You'll take center stage

350
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,022
while Chairman Sung and I watch your back.

351
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,900
I thought fate
only brought couples together,

352
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,735
but look at us.
We're a match made in heaven!

353
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,030
Let's raise our glasses then.

354
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,282
Always stay healthy, sir.

355
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,117
Stay healthy, sir.

356
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,785
You too, Minister Song.

357
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,628
We can find a way to get between them.

358
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,425
It's easier to do business
after you split up a tightly-knit group.

359
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,343
Don't mind them and keep it going.

360
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,013
We must get them to turn on each other.

361
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,934
Lee Chang-jin is the bridge
that links them.

362
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,605
What ties them together
isn't some grand loyalty.

363
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,440
It's money, no doubt.

364
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,568
We no longer have the Hong Kong FIU file.

365
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,154
He probably relocated
the money by now too.

366
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,700
Moving that amount of money
is bound to leave a trail.

367
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,413
Assemblyman Jo will help us.

368
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,792
So?

369
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,337
It's not like you to
just give up like this.

370
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,088
If we can't get the cow,

371
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,382
then we'll go after the ones
that fed them.

372
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,509
How?

373
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,553
I hear you are

374
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,265
good friends with the Commissioner of
the National Tax Service.

375
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,894
That's right.

376
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,812
Will you help us?

377
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,149
Leaving anything behind isn't worth much.

378
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,735
I'd rather die an honorable death.

379
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,999
You will soon have the tax records.

380
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,590
Seon-yeong,

381
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,927
it's time we pulled out

382
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,554
the rotten tree by the roots.

383
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,900
He was in the police academy
with Mr. Jang.

384
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,986
His name is Jeong Han-su

385
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,113
and he's currently the head
of Intelligence Unit One.

386
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,283
The files on No Seung-jin
that Mr. Jang submitted

387
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,910
are identical to the ones
written up by the intelligence unit.

388
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,288
Jeong Han-su must've
provided him with the files.

389
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,793
JEONG HAN-SU

390
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,631
Mr. Jang is also connected
to Assemblyman Jo's bribery case as well.

391
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,967
I'll take care of this myself.

392
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,303
Where are we on
the Joojin Chemical scandal?

393
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,846
Why is there no update?

394
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:42,017
The deputy chief prosecutors must
feel pressured because of Minister Song.

395
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,732
Round them all up.
I will allow no absences.

396
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,858
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,201
-Keep up the good work.
-Good night, sir.

398
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,911
Good night.

399
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,163
You too.

400
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,417
-Sir.
-What?

401
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,795
Chief Choe rounded up
the deputy chief prosecutors

402
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,341
as well as
all the investigative prosecutors.

403
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,011
It seems like he'll be
launching an investigation

404
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,013
based on the files Jang Tae-jun sent.

405
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,849
The wind never leaves alone
a tree with many branches, it seems.

406
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,270
He can run around all he wants.
He's still just a prosecutor.

407
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,440
Give word to the prosecutor general.

408
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,691
Yes, sir.

409
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,738
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN

410
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,991
Here are the tax reports
sent over by the National Tax Service.

411
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,660
Ms. Kang's office
received a copy via email.

412
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,622
Foreign bank accounts
with over one billion won

413
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,749
must be reported to
the National Tax Service.

414
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,001
They also carry out audits every year

415
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,296
on those who are suspected of tax evasion
including big companies.

416
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,091
Of course, Joojin Chemical
was one of them.

417
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,178
But it's never been caught until now.

418
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,304
Of course.

419
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,140
I'm sure they were able to evade the law.

420
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,810
What we should find out
is how it was possible.

421
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,146
Some of these transactions
might not be legitimate.

422
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,107
How can we sniff them out though?

423
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,943
We'll look into
all the companies they deal with.

424
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,529
A normal tax audit won't be able
to reveal as much.

425
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,989
We'll have to get
a tax crime investigation issued.

426
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,575
A tax crime investigation?

427
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,329
There's your everyday tax audit
and a tax crime investigation.

428
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,125
An everyday tax audit
is carried out to charge additional tax.

429
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,710
Meanwhile, a tax crime investigation is
a judicial investigation,

430
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,879
where even search and seizure
can be incorporated.

431
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,299
If Lee Chang-jin's secret ledger,
false contracts,

432
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,968
and forged documents are found,

433
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,012
it can lead to Minister Song
and Chairman Sung's slush fund.

434
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,016
The investigation can only be launched
if Lee Chang-jin

435
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,435
is suspected of tax evasion.

436
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,062
We will give them a reason.

437
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,988
JOOJIN CHEMICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

438
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,909
Where are we on
Joojin Chemical's stock scandal?

439
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,246
We have requested transaction records
of Lee Chang-jin's family

440
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,165
from the stock firm they dealt with.

441
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,417
The records could be falsely under
a normal transaction

442
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,960
rather than one with an affiliate.

443
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:18,381
Please check all the sales made with those
who aren't connected to Mr. Lee.

444
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:23,845
Assemblyman Jang,
Youngil Group's Chairman Sung,

445
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,265
and Minister Song will be among those
you investigate.

446
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,609
But there is no clear suspicion
of wrongdoing on their part.

447
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,277
If we look into them,

448
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,697
we could be criticized
for being reckless with our authority.

449
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,407
Especially Minister Song--

450
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,868
No one is above the law.

451
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,870
Anyone who violates it

452
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,997
must be punished.

453
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,003
Stop walking on eggshells around them
and perform due diligence.

454
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,380
I will take full responsibility
of the outcome.

455
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,554
Mr. Prosecutor General?

456
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,529
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

457
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,451
What brings you here, sir?

458
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,870
You and the prosecutors
of the Supreme Office.

459
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,289
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office

460
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,333
will take over this case.

461
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,919
Sir.

462
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,133
Are you trying to challenge me
because my term is almost over?

463
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,886
-That's not what I meant.
-Then do as I say.

464
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,181
A thorough investigation
will be conducted.

465
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,230
Is this what you want
or is it what Minister Song ordered?

466
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,316
What?

467
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,544
Do you still have more to do?

468
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,754
Need any help?

469
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,382
No, I'm good.

470
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,260
This is a task
Ms. Kang gave to me directly.

471
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,097
I see.

472
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,646
-Get home safe.
-See you.

473
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,731
Take it easy.

474
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,073
Aren't you heading home?

475
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,576
I still have some work to do.
I'll see you tomorrow.

476
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,786
We'll get going then.

477
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,913
-Good job today.
-See you.

478
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,583
See you tomorrow.

479
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,546
Those files...

480
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,467
Didn't I ask you to destroy them
for security reasons?

481
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,594
Right.

482
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,931
I'll do it right away.

483
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,699
Are you guys heading home too?

484
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,952
Well, there's nothing
we can exactly do at this moment.

485
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,787
What about Ms. Kang?

486
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,789
She's still upstairs with Mr. Han.

487
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,127
Things are frustrating enough,
so how about we get some drinks?

488
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,128
Why not?

489
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,630
Let's go for some drinks.

490
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,465
Mr. Yang, will you be joining us?

491
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,927
Sure thing. Let's go.

492
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,930
Maybe some other time for me.

493
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,603
Yes, it's me.

494
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,563
She always eats alone too.

495
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,273
Why is she always so busy?

496
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,442
Does she have a boyfriend
we don't know about?

497
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:07,944
Let's go ourselves.

498
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,279
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

499
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,741
I'm envious.

500
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,872
Mr. Yang.

501
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,792
-Let's go.
-Okay.

502
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,003
Let's go.

503
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,507
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN'S OFFICE

504
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,100
These overseas firms entered into a deal
with Joojin in the past six months.

505
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,604
Among them, 35 do business with
Joojin Chemical's headquarters.

506
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,774
Take their subcontractors and overseas
offices into account, and we have 72.

507
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,569
They might be paper companies.
Find out more about them.

508
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,070
Mr. Lee and the legal team

509
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,865
must have worked on
the establishment of overseas firms.

510
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,366
By checking their travel history,

511
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,993
we can narrow down the number.

512
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:57,910
Yes, sir.

513
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,206
Let's sort out the firms that are likely
to be managing Joojin Chemical's money

514
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,000
under the disguise of normal transactions.

515
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,626
If we find something suspicious,

516
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,046
it'll speed up
the prosecution's investigation.

517
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,423
We have to light a fire.

518
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,301
I know it's tough, but let's hurry.

519
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,886
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

520
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,057
Please look into the overseas firm.
We'll take the domestic ones.

521
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,645
SEUNG-U

522
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,564
Excuse me.

523
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,610
Hi, Seung-u.

524
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,534
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office's
investigation into the collusion

525
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,080
between Joojin Chemical's CEO and
Assemblymen Lee, Ahn, and No has been

526
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,248
transferred to
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

527
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,043
According to the prosecution,
the decision is to enable

528
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,420
a prompt and thorough investigation

529
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,632
as the collusion between
politicians and businesses

530
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,093
is expected to cause public outrage.

531
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,846
The prosecution also announced
that the case is likely to be handled

532
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,309
by the Anti-Corruption and Violent Crimes
Unit of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

533
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,146
As three sitting assemblymen
are involved in the case,

534
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,484
a rigorous investigation is required
to leave no room for doubt.

535
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,527
Yes?

536
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,288
This seems to be where the material
you handed over to me came from.

537
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,380
JEONG HAN-SU

538
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,592
Just because you want to change the world
doesn't mean you can break the law.

539
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,471
If the world was in order,
I wouldn't have had to do this.

540
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,808
You believe you can change the world
by yourself?

541
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,019
Don't you realize
how reckless that sounds?

542
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,980
By myself,

543
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,024
it might be hard. But with your help,

544
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,026
things might be different.

545
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,820
You should know this well.

546
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,948
As long as Mr. Song stays in his position,

547
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,952
it'll be hard for you
to stand by your convictions.

548
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,873
I heard about
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

549
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,042
When you step down
without getting anything done,

550
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,878
will you give an excuse

551
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,505
that you stood by your convictions?

552
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,177
I'm not going to be dragged into the power
struggle between you and Mr. Song.

553
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,803
Are you saying

554
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,848
you'll stop at just putting me in prison?

555
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,643
I must have overestimated you.

556
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,521
I thought you were a prosecutor
who deserved to be called one.

557
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,274
Do you really believe

558
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,235
you can change anything now?

559
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,448
You even blackmailed the assemblymen
involved in Mr. Jo's bribery case.

560
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,704
When this too falls into Mr. Song's hand,

561
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,541
you won't be able to hold out anymore.

562
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,254
I'll hold out, no matter what.

563
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,550
And so should you.

564
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,261
Things will change.

565
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,186
We'll see.

566
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,654
I'm sorry for putting you through all this
in your last years.

567
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,118
I should remain a prosecutor
until the end of my term.

568
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,706
Once this is done,

569
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,003
I'll make sure you wear something
much nicer than the prosecutor's robe.

570
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,341
Please.

571
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,975
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

572
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,936
Even if National Tax Service conducts
search and seizure,

573
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,272
the prosecution
will handle the case, right?

574
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,316
That's right.

575
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,237
That means, if Mr. Song intervenes again,

576
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,740
-this case...
-...will be hard to solve.

577
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,412
Still, we can try to find something
to pressure Joojin Chemical,

578
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,081
although a legal punishment
might take longer.

579
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,589
-Where's Ms. Kang?
-She's in her office.

580
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,176
-Get something to eat.
-We will. What about you?

581
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,886
I'm fine.

582
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,141
I'll go pick up something.
What do you want?

583
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,352
-I can go.
-No. Let me go.

584
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,688
I need a break, anyway.

585
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,149
-What should we eat?
-I'm fine with anything.

586
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,693
Still,

587
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,903
I could really use
a little walk right now.

588
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,655
Let me come with you.

589
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,741
Sure, let's go.

590
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,326
Okay.

591
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,132
How did it go?

592
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,592
Do you

593
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,677
want some fresh air?

594
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,184
Unless things change,

595
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,478
it'll be hard for Chief Choe
to take action.

596
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,235
That means, as long as Mr. Song
is the Minister of Justice,

597
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,322
we can't do anything.

598
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,035
I'm sorry.

599
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,412
For what?

600
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,375
I'm the one
who made Mr. Song the minister.

601
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,215
This contains the video file
that I sent you earlier.

602
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,094
I destroyed the original copy
that the press had before I came here.

603
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,723
So this is the only copy of the file.

604
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,789
I want you to nominate me as the candidate
to run for Seongjin City's by-election

605
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,541
that was once run by Assemblyman Lee.

606
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,502
My choice caused this.

607
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,504
I became an assemblyman,

608
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,549
but nothing has changed since.

609
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,843
I can't change anything.

610
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,512
I just keep on struggling.

611
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,435
Even without your choice, he would've
become the minister one way or another.

612
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,646
I couldn't do anything either.

613
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,524
Let's not look back.

614
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,158
Tae-jun.

615
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,495
There's only one thing we can do.

616
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,333
Yes.

617
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,715
Didn't you say you like their toast?

618
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,967
I do.

619
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,687
Ms. Yun, let's go somewhere else.

620
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,647
-Pardon?
-Let's get something else.

621
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,941
Well, what about something with rice?

622
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,485
Rice sounds good. Let's go...

623
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,659
The coffee smells so good.

624
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,415
I see Mr. Jang and Ms. Kang in there.

625
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,339
I guess we should go somewhere else.

626
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,216
Is there any place you particularly like?

627
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,969
Not really.

628
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,431
But there will be after today.

629
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,852
It'll be the first restaurant
you and I have eaten together at.

630
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,942
Let's go. Let's eat together.

631
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,581
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN'S OFFICE

632
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,044
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN'S OFFICE

633
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,429
Mr. Ahn.

634
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,098
You startled me.

635
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,642
I thought you'd left.

636
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,852
I haven't. What are you doing?

637
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,190
I forgot the material I'm supposed to
hand over to reporters tomorrow morning.

638
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,152
I'm so forgetful these days.

639
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,741
Mr. Han is still here too.

640
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,163
Well, see you tomorrow.

641
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,683
YUN HYE-WON

642
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,567
Could it be Mr. Ahn?

643
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,111
All the documents and files
are still there.

644
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,905
Let's keep a closer eye out.

645
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,741
Yes.

646
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,717
Is he already here?

647
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,011
Yes, it seems like
he pulled an all-nighter last night.

648
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,974
What's the meeting about?

649
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,226
I'm not sure.

650
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,404
Good morning.

651
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,199
Hi. Good morning.

652
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,242
-Hi.
-Good morning.

653
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,498
I sorted out the firms
that pay the highest taxes.

654
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,835
There are seven firms that seem to
have aimed for transfer gains.

655
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,838
Request more information
from the relevant tax offices.

656
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,549
-Yes, ma'am.
-Joojin Chemical does business with

657
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,052
firms in Hong Kong, Malaysia,
the Philippines, and India.

658
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,555
There are a total of 11 overseas firms.
Those suspected to be paper companies are

659
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,558
Hapon Chemical in Hong Kong,
Foreden Company in Malaysia,

660
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,269
plus Hanti Industry and Moan Tech,
both in the Philippines.

661
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,690
All those countries
are regularly visited by Mr. Lee

662
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,316
and Joojin Chemical's legal team.

663
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,487
Isn't Mr. Oh's family in the Philippines?

664
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,782
Yes, his wife and daughter live there.

665
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,992
Can we access information
on Mr. Oh's assets?

666
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,246
Yes, we can check
the public officials' asset declarations.

667
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,458
Most of the Filipino companies
invest in a third country.

668
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,795
By looking at where they invest,
we might detect offshore tax evasion.

669
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,047
But there are too many places.

670
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:22,469
Even if the National Tax Service helps us,
we're too short-handed.

671
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,728
Hand out the data to all staff members.

672
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,235
What if the information leaks again?

673
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,695
We haven't found the culprit yet.

674
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,407
Do you want the information
to be disclosed?

675
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,579
If we can't find it ourselves,
we should make Mr. Lee find it for us.

676
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:53,500
When Mr. Lee hears word
that we're tracking down the funds...

677
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,419
He'll take action.

678
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,172
All we have to do is watch him closely.

679
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,091
The National Tax service
will take care of the rest.

680
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,804
Hand out copies of the data.

681
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,890
Keep an eye on the staff.

682
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,725
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,106
-Mr. Ahn.
-Okay.

684
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,778
-Ms. No.
-Yes.

685
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,616
-Is it done?
-Yes.

686
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,409
Please look through it.

687
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,294
The National Tax Service
will send over more data.

688
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,254
Please analyze it carefully.

689
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,672
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

690
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,474
I'm sorry, but may I use the bathroom?

691
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,644
I'm not feeling so well.
I'll be right back.

692
00:47:59,042 --> 00:47:59,918
Yes.

693
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,754
Things are not so good
at the office right now.

694
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,007
How would I know that?

695
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,219
All right. I'll try to come this weekend.

696
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,307
Stop telling me to go on a blind date.

697
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,851
I have to go, Father.

698
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,853
Gosh.

699
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,152
I'm sick of his nagging.

700
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,323
Don't end up like me,
and get married early.

701
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,450
Okay.

702
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,243
Gosh.

703
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:45,172
The National Tax Service
is focusing on the Filipino companies.

704
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,381
What about Joojin Chemical?

705
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,467
Nothing much seems to be happening.

706
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,427
Let me know if you hear anything more.

707
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,553
Yes, sir.

708
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,976
Let me see.

709
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,728
Where's Mr. Yang?

710
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,690
He just went out to make a phone call.

711
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,415
I just e-mailed you a summary.

712
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,002
Please handle it carefully,
or I might get fired.

713
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,798
I'll call you once I know more.

714
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,675
Bye.

715
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,180
You startled me.

716
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,225
What are you doing here?

717
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,268
Tell me what you were doing.

718
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,731
I was talking on the phone.

719
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,111
May I ask who you were talking to?

720
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,697
Why?

721
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,741
Am I not supposed to know?

722
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:03,125
I think I know why you're doing this,
but I'm a little offended.

723
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,877
Why do you think I'm doing this?

724
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,505
You're looking for the spy, aren't you?

725
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,093
Since Joojin Chemical's
whistleblower list leaked,

726
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,138
the four of you have been having meetings
without the rest of us.

727
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,431
Of course, I figured out.

728
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:21,977
I might not be as competent as you are,
but I'm quick to understand things.

729
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:27,107
Then prove you're not the spy.

730
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,493
LEE SI-MYEONG, MYEONGSEONG DAILY

731
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,791
I just checked the e-mail.
Stop calling me.

732
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,168
I'll write an article about it.

733
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,795
It'll be released tomorrow morning,
so take a look.

734
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,422
Buy me a drink, okay?

735
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,965
Hello? Mr. Yang?

736
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,015
I'm sorry I got you wrong.

737
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,936
I know you had no bad intentions,

738
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,230
but an apology won't do, would it?

739
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,192
I'll keep this a secret.

740
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,861
Good luck with finding the spy.

741
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,172
Mr. Song, it seems like
Mr. Jo met with Jang Tae-jun yesterday.

742
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,051
That old fool.

743
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,345
What does he think
that helpless kid can do for him?

744
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,387
How pathetic.

745
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,555
That's not it.

746
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,723
The National Tax Service

747
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,850
is investigating Joojin Chemical.

748
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,521
Jang Tae-jun suspected Mr. Lee of

749
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,606
offshore tax evasion
and initiated the investigation.

750
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,235
Jo Gap-yeong, that bastard...

751
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,402
Wait.

752
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,406
Once they dig into overseas funds,

753
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,326
not only Mr. Sung's
but also your slush funds will...

754
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,953
Do you think I don't know that?

755
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,831
How much do they know?

756
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,707
They're looking into
domestic companies first.

757
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,670
But I've just been told they're moving on
to overseas companies now.

758
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,130
I've informed Mr. Lee as well.

759
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,677
He's not moving the funds
right now, is he?

760
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,595
He is.

761
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,018
Find out what
the National Tax Service is up to.

762
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,061
Yes, sir.

763
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,400
-What do you think?
-Well...

764
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,277
I think you're right.

765
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,832
Yun Hye-won speaking.

766
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,628
Okay.

767
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,760
The National Tax Service called.
Joojin Chemical started moving.

768
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,679
-Where?
-They're withdrawing funds

769
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,931
from Moan Tech in the Philippines.

770
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,892
Search and seizure will be conducted soon.

771
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,728
-E-mail me all the information.
-Yes, sir.

772
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,232
I'll send out a press release
as soon as it's ready.

773
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,320
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG TAE-JUN'S OFFICE

774
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,784
Chief Choe,

775
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,661
things have changed.

776
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,456
Okay.

777
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,499
Mr. Song.

778
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,419
The National Tax Service is on the move.

779
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,966
We got caught in Jang Tae-jun's trap.

780
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,718
Pardon?

781
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,138
That bastard didn't know
where the funds were hidden.

782
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,691
-It's me.
-Hello, Mr. Song.

783
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,443
The funds are being moved right now.

784
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,445
-It'll be done by--
-Stop it right now!

785
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,116
It's Jang Tae-jun's trap
to find the slush funds!

786
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,457
Mr. Lee, the National Tax Service is
searching our offices.

787
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,589
Don't move.
We're from the National Tax Service.

788
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,091
Please cooperate. Let's start.

789
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,105
What are you doing, you scum?

790
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,859
Bastards.

791
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,824
-What are you doing?
-Mr. Lee!

792
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,159
Get off me! Move!

793
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,253
The National Tax Service
and the prosecution

794
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:02,298
are conducting search and seizure on
Lee Chang-jin, CEO of Joojin Chemical.

795
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,926
According to the National Tax Service,

796
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,513
a probe into Mr. Lee's allegations
of offshore tax evasion

797
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,474
revealed a need for
an in-depth tax investigation including.

798
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,185
-A tax crime...
-Contact the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

799
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,437
Yes, sir.

800
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,314
The National Tax Service
and the prosecution

801
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,026
searched the headquarters
and confiscated accounting data,

802
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,153
-financial records,
-Chief Choe.

803
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,071
-and hard disks.
-Supreme Prosecutors' Office is moving.

804
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,115
By analyzing...

805
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,536
I'll hold out, no matter what.

806
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,874
And so should you.

807
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,543
Things will change.

808
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,297
Chief Choe, things have changed.

809
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,341
The acquired evidence...

810
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,718
I don't want to

811
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,013
hand Lee Chang-jin over
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

812
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,016
Joojin Chemical...

813
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,100
Bring him here.

814
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:58,271
Serious issues concerning...

815
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,733
...were also found...

816
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,448
Thank you for saving me so much trouble.

817
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,575
I found the secret account thanks to you.

818
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,120
Jang Tae-jun,
do you think I'll go down like this?

819
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,039
You can't go down just yet.

820
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,249
You're the grand opening.

821
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,337
Now that the secret account has been
found, not even the Minister of Justice

822
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,506
could stop
the National Tax Service's investigation.

823
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,424
Right now,
there's only one secret account.

824
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,593
But how many will there be
after the investigation?

825
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,554
In addition to coughing up
all the money you've siphoned off,

826
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,681
you'll lose your company too.

827
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,684
Look how excited you are.

828
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,355
You want to add fuel to the fire?

829
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,190
No.

830
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,694
I want to put out the fire in your house.

831
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,408
Come clean, and everything will be easier.

832
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,702
With what?

833
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,579
Who the funds really belong to.

834
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,458
Admit that you only managed them.

835
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,797
Are you telling me
to declare myself as a figurehead?

836
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,466
That'll make me lose my company.

837
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,594
You might, but you'll also save yourself.

838
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,973
Everyone knows about the slush funds now.

839
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,641
What will be Mr. Song's next move?

840
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,771
He'll have you arrested
and put all the blame on you.

841
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,941
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
has already set to work.

842
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,068
Go ahead and check if it's true.

843
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,410
What's the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
up to?

844
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,878
They've requested
a warrant for your immediate arrest.

845
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,057
Once they take you,
there will be no way out.

846
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,979
So what am I supposed to do?

847
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,273
Give me the information about the bribes

848
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,693
you and Mr. Song have handed out
to politicians under Mr. Sung's orders.

849
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:13,656
I'm the only person
who can help you right now.

850
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,996
How can I trust you?

851
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,670
How about we make a deal?

852
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,383
I can give you one thing you want.

853
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,389
That chief of staff who died...

854
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,353
He was a friend of yours, wasn't he?

855
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,537
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

856
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,083
ARREST WARRANT

857
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,005
Save me first.

858
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,010
Then I'll tell you who killed Go Seok-man.

859
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,472
Who was it? Who killed him?

860
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,724
What are you talking about? Lee Chang-jin!

861
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,726
We're taking him.

862
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,396
-Who was it?
-The chief ordered him

863
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,189
-to be arrested immediately.
-Let go!

864
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,775
Lee Chang-jin!

865
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,737
Let go of me!

866
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,338
How did it go?

867
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,717
Choe Gyeong-cheol.
That bastard beat us to it.

868
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,351
CHAIRMAN SUNG

869
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,031
I'm sorry.

870
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,867
Mr. Song.

871
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,788
It's been only a day
since you last said that.

872
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,378
If you fail to keep Lee Chang-jin quiet,

873
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,463
you and I

874
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,590
will get hurt too.

875
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,259
I'll keep him quiet by all means.

876
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,428
By all means?

877
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,974
You couldn't even control the chief
of Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office!

878
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,601
Your means don't mean a thing!

879
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,758
Chief Choe, Mr. Song wishes to see you.

880
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,927
Tell him I'll come over soon.

881
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,638
Well, he's in your office right now.

882
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,604
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

883
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,570
Hand Lee Chang-jin over
to Western Prosecutors' Office.

884
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,367
I'm sorry, but I intend to
investigate him here.

885
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,745
Are you saying
you'd go against the Minister of Justice?

886
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,415
A prosecutor is not under the orders
of the Minister of Justice

887
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,041
but takes action based on the law.

888
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,876
If you don't trust my investigation,

889
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,962
officially take command
of the investigation.

890
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,339
Choe Gyeong-cheol!

891
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,800
The investigation will be conducted here.

892
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:04,345
Thoroughly, leaving no room for doubt.

893
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,680
You son of a...

894
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:18,901
Chief Choe.

895
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,448
What are you talking about?

896
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,952
Save me first.

897
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:32,123
Then I'll tell you who killed Go Seok-man.

898
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,125
If it wasn't Lee Chang-jin...

899
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,836
It must've been
either Minister Song or Chairman Sung.

900
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,341
Mr. Jang.

901
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,306
Lee Chang-jin, CEO of Joojin Chemical,
who had been arrested

902
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,850
on suspicion of offshore tax evasion
jumped to his death

903
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,770
during an investigation
at Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

904
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:57,231
The prosecution had been requested
to investigate into Lee's allegations

905
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,193
of tax evasion in the Philippines
by the National Tax Service.

906
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,162
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
arrested Lee immediately

907
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,122
considering the scale of the crime

908
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,999
and the possibility
of tampering with evidence.

909
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,084
The Ministry of Justice announced
that it'd find out

910
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:22,590
if any coercive or inappropriate measures
were takenduring the investigation.

911
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,680
Even if it turns out
there was no insult or harsh treatment

912
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,849
during the investigation,

913
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,268
the prosecution is likely
to face criticism

914
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,688
about repeated suspect suicides.

915
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,400
Another problem is,
following the suspect's death,

916
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,403
the case might be terminated
without the truth of the case

917
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,113
ever coming to light.

918
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,538
CEO OF JOOJIN CHEMICAL JUMPS TO DEATH

919
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,957
It's dangerous to take action now.

920
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,418
Stopping here
is exactly what Mr. Song wants.

921
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,253
We can't get bogged down here.

922
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,046
Jang Tae-jun,
what are you trying to do here?

923
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,382
Do you think Minister Song
will protect you?

924
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:49,468
You saw what happened to Mr. Lee.

925
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,889
I think I found the leak.
What should I do?

926
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,474
Spill some information,
and catch them red-handed.

927
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,184
You should stop now.

928
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,354
Do you think you can change the world
by bringing me down?

929
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,274
Not everything in the world
will go your way.

930
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,319
