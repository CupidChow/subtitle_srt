1
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,448
A viper full of venom
shouldn't be kept alive.

2
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,451
When you hunt, you have to
make sure the prey is down.

3
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,090
OPPOSE TO PROTECT THE RIGHT
TO AN ADEQUATE STANDARD OF LIVING

4
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,222
SEOBUK MARKET COMMITTEE
AGAINST REDEVELOPMENT

5
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:42,060
The current Minister of Justice
stood by the scene of a murder.

6
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,897
What will happen if this gets out?

7
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,400
I wonder if there is any

8
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,528
statute of limitations
for covering up a murder.

9
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,780
Whether you like it or not,

10
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,242
you and I are

11
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,244
in the same boat now.

12
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,509
An undeniable causal relationship.

13
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,513
An indelible trace of life.

14
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,144
Man, he's a tough one.

15
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,937
Run him over.

16
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,107
Run him over.

17
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,111
There's no present

18
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,282
that can stop the blade of tragedy
that comes from the past.

19
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,568
EPISODE 9 HIBERNATION

20
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:06,037
When the weather gets cold,
a viper should go back to its tunnel.

21
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,373
Don't you agree?

22
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,421
-Finish it off.
-Yes, sir.

23
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,823
Where is he supposed
to meet with Chairman Sung?

24
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,076
I don't know the place. But I know
someone who knows it.

25
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,160
CHAIRMAN SUNG YEONG-GI

26
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,580
Hello. Are you done thinking?

27
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,333
I know where it is. I'll be right there.

28
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,379
I'll call you as soon as I have it.

29
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,089
Okay.

30
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,638
If something goes wrong,
call Detective Lee.

31
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,056
He'll be with us.

32
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,935
He said Detective Lee would be with him.

33
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,647
Yes, this is Lee Hyeong-bae.

34
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,816
I'm Yun Hye-won
from Assemblyman Jang's office.

35
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,401
Are you with Assemblyman Jang now?

36
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,403
No. I'm on my way to meet him now.

37
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,030
Where are you meeting with him?

38
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,448
Joojin Chemical's garbage dump.

39
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,366
Please call me once you meet him.

40
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,868
Okay, I will.

41
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,539
They are meeting at the garbage dump
of Joojin Chemical.

42
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,501
Please tell me
once you reach Assemblyman Jang.

43
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,878
Okay.

44
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,237
Hey, hurry!

45
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,769
-Have you met Assemblyman Jang?
-He's not here. I guess

46
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,187
something happened to him.

47
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,649
Someone's driving his car,
so I'm chasing it.

48
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,243
I'd like to report a car stolen.

49
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,704
It's Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun's car.

50
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,718
Now that the funeral is over,
we should have a drink.

51
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,391
Now make sure

52
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,060
to take care of Kang Seon-yeong
and Samyeong Bank.

53
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,105
The president of Samyeong Bank
has my documents.

54
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,733
Once it's taken care of,
things will be a lot easier.

55
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,987
Jang Tae-jun is an incumbent assemblyman.

56
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,322
He's not like the other guys.

57
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,951
What's the difference between killing one

58
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,786
and a few more?

59
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,621
You know what?

60
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:41,002
The Minister of Justice
who has the prosecution in his hand

61
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
is sitting right in front of me.

62
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,965
I have nothing to be afraid of.

63
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,012
All right. We're both covered in shit now.

64
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,097
It's time to wash up.

65
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,415
Faster.

66
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,626
Damn it.

67
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,091
Turn the car around.

68
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,984
-Hey.
-Hey, reverse the car.

69
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,612
Hey!

70
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,447
Damn it.

71
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,407
Gosh, that jerk.

72
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,260
Get them.

73
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,679
Bastard!

74
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,519
Hey, you...

75
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
Run!

76
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,367
Let's run.

77
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,036
Hey, stop right there!

78
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,081
Hey!

79
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,302
Tae-jun.

80
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,140
Tae-jun.

81
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,355
Tae-jun!

82
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,818
Hello? Please send an ambulance.

83
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,265
IN SURGERY

84
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,797
What happened?

85
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,676
I found him after I got there.
I don't know the details.

86
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,095
What about the guy who fled?

87
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,638
The police are chasing him.

88
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,474
Here.

89
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,603
Tae-jun asked me to look into it.

90
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,023
He said there was the same incident
as Go Seok-man's case

91
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,608
seven years ago.

92
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,693
Choe Yong-hyeon?

93
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,488
Yes. I went to the retired cop
who was in charge

94
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,240
of the initial investigation.

95
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,991
All the evidence is concealed,

96
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,703
but he told me
the prime suspect in the case.

97
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,914
When Minister Song was a prosecutor,

98
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,999
he arrested a gang in one big raid.

99
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,085
And there was this gang boss.

100
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,796
Minister Song set him free
without detention,

101
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,549
and the next day, Choe Yong-hyeon died.

102
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,884
Now he works as the head of security
at Youngil Group.

103
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,264
He's the guy who just fled the scene.

104
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,851
-Let's run.
-Hey, stop right there!

105
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,310
Catch him!

106
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,812
KWON GIL-SU

107
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,776
Take this as well.

108
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,974
He's passed the critical stage,
but he had a cerebral hemorrhage

109
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,018
and internal injuries
due to being stabbed.

110
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,645
So we will have to observe
his progress for a while.

111
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,730
When will he wake up?

112
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,942
I don't know. We can't be sure yet.

113
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,569
We should wait and see how he does.

114
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,089
Tae-jun.

115
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,468
Get some rest.

116
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,389
You've worked nonstop so hard
for the past ten years.

117
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,230
Let me know if you need anything.
I'll always be by your side.

118
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,112
Thank you.

119
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,533
But I can't just stay here
and watch him from afar

120
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,328
when I'm so close to achieving my dream.

121
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,756
You're the one who seems exhausted.

122
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,091
You're right.

123
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,010
This is all quite tiring.

124
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,390
Don't worry. No one can beat you.

125
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,350
Apart from me, that is.

126
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,065
So don't go around
looking like you lost already.

127
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,608
It doesn't suit you.

128
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,695
Let's do everything we can
to bring down the Minister of Justice.

129
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,821
I'll help.

130
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,452
Thanks.

131
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,955
Let me rely on you.

132
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,142
I'll take care of the things
you couldn't finish.

133
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,436
Get some rest until then.

134
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,397
Don't rest for too long though.

135
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,563
Chief Choe,

136
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,690
this is Kang Seon-yeong.

137
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,443
May I talk to you for a moment?

138
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,613
Why is he...

139
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,449
What on earth happened to him?

140
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,243
He went out to meet with Chairman Sung.

141
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,041
They have nothing

142
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,126
to be afraid of now.

143
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,879
"They"?

144
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,052
I have a suspicion that Minister Song
is involved in this in any way.

145
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,180
Chairman Sung wouldn't have
been able to do something like this

146
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,933
unless he wasn't sure
he could evade the law.

147
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,606
You can go. I'll stay here.

148
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,775
I'll stay here with you.

149
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,861
Ms. Kang is the only person
who can go after

150
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,156
Minister Song and Chairman Sung now.

151
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,325
She will be a lot busier.

152
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,660
You should go and help her.

153
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,791
Is it all right if I leave you here alone?

154
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,876
I'll be fine.

155
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,853
How is Assemblyman Jang?

156
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,814
His operation is over,

157
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,107
but it will take a while

158
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,359
for him to recover consciousness.

159
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,780
Damn it!

160
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,117
Things are just getting more difficult.

161
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,369
What about Ms. Kang?

162
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,955
She went to meet with Chief Choe.

163
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,708
Even if we begin an investigation,

164
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,002
as long as Mr. Song
has a connection with the prosecution,

165
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,628
the whole thing will be hushed up.

166
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,882
And if Assemblyman Jang doesn't recover
his consciousness,

167
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,633
we can't get a statement from the victim.

168
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,594
I'm sorry to say this,

169
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,889
but it's not something
the prosecution can do at the moment.

170
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,393
If the prosecution can't do it,
the National Assembly shall step up.

171
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,147
We'll form the Independent Counsel.

172
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,775
Nothing has been easy so far.

173
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,485
If the National Assembly begins to act,

174
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,862
I'll need your help, Chief Choe.

175
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,073
Can you help me?

176
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,372
I will.

177
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,419
My goal is the same as yours
regarding this matter.

178
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,880
Thank you.

179
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,300
Do you think
Assemblyman Jang will wake up?

180
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,594
He will.

181
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,472
He's not a weak man.

182
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,609
I've come all the way here with you.

183
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,655
You can't collapse by yourself like this.

184
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,991
We're almost there.

185
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,869
Please...

186
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,456
Please wake up.

187
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,380
Why did you apply for this position?

188
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,881
Because I want to change the world.

189
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,595
Look at you making such a cheesy remark
without even batting an eye.

190
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,515
Doesn't it make you cringe
when you say things like that?

191
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,017
No, because I mean it.

192
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,916
Both you and I...

193
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,753
should get elected as an assemblyman
with a badge on our chest

194
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,089
and walk in there triumphantly!

195
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,926
A fair, corruption-free nation!

196
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,221
A country
where all of its people can prosper!

197
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,891
Let's work together
to create such a world!

198
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,990
I want you to nominate me as the candidate
to run for Seongjin City's by-election

199
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,576
that was once run by Assemblyman Lee.

200
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,416
I WILL BE THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS

201
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,887
ASSEMBLYMAN

202
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,477
JANG TAE-JUN

203
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,374
The Daehan Party launched
the nomination board

204
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,334
for the legislative election this year

205
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,712
in order to prepare
for the primary election early.

206
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,173
To settle the unfavorable factors
within the party,

207
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,093
they are rushing
the process of the primary...

208
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,387
They say the party candidate
has already been nominated.

209
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,806
Chairperson of Daehan Party
Committee for Seongjin City

210
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,976
and Assemblyman Mun for Jungil-gu.

211
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,853
At this rate, Assemblyman Jang
will fail to get reelected.

212
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,439
It was decided that they would need

213
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,235
the early launch
of the nomination board for that.

214
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,906
They are also considering plans
to have candidates

215
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,284
register before the launch date
so new politicians can

216
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,203
-put themselves across better in advance.
-Let's start the meeting.

217
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
After the registration process

218
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,832
-of primary candidates,
-Let's go.

219
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,875
they are planning
to reflect the changes...

220
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,253
I will pass a bill
for the Independent Counsel

221
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,879
to investigate Mr. Song's slush fund.

222
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,880
Independent Counsel?

223
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,135
The Independent Counsel will look into
all the cases that are related to him.

224
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,137
Once we find the evidence

225
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,264
that Minister Song
and Chairman Sung are related,

226
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,308
we will be able
to investigate them together.

227
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,851
I know what you're trying to do,

228
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,854
but the party leaders are
all Minister Song's people.

229
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,689
It won't be easy
to get the party platform.

230
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,233
And the Blue House wouldn't
want the new Minister

231
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,235
to have a blemish.

232
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,445
We'll take advantage of it.

233
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,990
There are people who want
the Minister to have a blemish.

234
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,327
Are you planning to use the Kookmin Party?

235
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,370
Yes.

236
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,874
But even if
all the independent politicians

237
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,209
as well as the Kookmin Party
vote in favor,

238
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,794
it will barely gain a majority vote.

239
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,964
Wouldn't it be too risky?

240
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,592
We will make them have to pass the bill.

241
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,554
You want to make the case public, right?

242
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,514
With the legislative election
coming ahead,

243
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,600
they will keep their ear to the ground.

244
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,354
Mr. Han, please prepare
the press release for reporters.

245
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,856
It can be about suspicions

246
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,192
or assumptions.

247
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,402
Please make sure
there will be sensational headlines.

248
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,654
But it can't cover unconfirmed suspicion.

249
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,573
Assemblyman Jang is lying in bed.

250
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,118
We must move the public opinion.

251
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,661
I'll do anything

252
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,704
I can do.

253
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,054
Assemblywoman Kang.

254
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,516
Have you given up
on the legislative election?

255
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,936
You already know it.

256
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,564
If you have the bill passed
and catch Minister Song and Chairman Sung,

257
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,567
your approval rating might go up,
but you won't win the nomination.

258
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,570
What kind of party leader will nominate
a newly-elected assemblywoman

259
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,698
who exposed the corruption scandal
of a minister?

260
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,035
I know.

261
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,831
It might backfire on them anytime.

262
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,916
I've been with you

263
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,419
since you were elected.

264
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,965
What you wanted to do as an assemblywoman
and things you've told me...

265
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
I remember all of them.

266
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,011
You didn't become an assemblywoman
to capture corrupt officials.

267
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,930
-Rather than--
-I wanted to work

268
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,181
for the weak and minority.

269
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,560
That's why you joined my camp.

270
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,271
There is a limit to what a first-term
assemblywoman can do.

271
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,482
It's something you can do
only when you are reelected.

272
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,652
What if I stand by and watch?

273
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,113
Will that help me get reelected?

274
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,215
Hello.

275
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,348
He's still unconscious.

276
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,560
His condition is getting better,
but he's still unconscious.

277
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,564
I requested banning Chairman Sung
from leaving the country.

278
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,317
Good. We have to stop him.

279
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,152
Minister Song would want

280
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,613
to hide Chairman Sung abroad first.

281
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,283
Now it's time to start the war
using public opinion as a weapon.

282
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,203
First, I will reveal that Minister Song

283
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,246
is involved in attacking Assemblyman Jang.

284
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,374
Ms. Yun, is the press release ready?

285
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,628
Yes. It will be on the news soon.

286
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,265
Ms. Yun is coming late.

287
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,266
I know.

288
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,352
She's never been late before.

289
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,771
And I can't reach Assemblyman Jang.
Is something wrong?

290
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,902
Da-jeong, did you hear from Ms. Yun?

291
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,031
This morning, I got a call that all
his schedule for this week is canceled.

292
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,367
Why? Did something happen?

293
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,327
I don't know.

294
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,999
Well. Mr. Yang.

295
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,921
-Look.
-Last night, Assemblyman Jang Tae-jun got

296
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,216
attacked by an unidentified assailant
and fell into a critical condition.

297
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,177
The police has specified the suspect

298
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,137
and are now tracking him down.

299
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,265
-What...
-An official

300
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,933
-Is it Mr. Jang?
-from the hospital says

301
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,352
Assemblyman Jang is now recovering

302
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,647
from his operation in a hospital room.

303
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,275
He hasn't regained his consciousness yet,

304
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,818
but fortunately the worst is over...

305
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,587
Assemblywoman Kang requested

306
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,589
banning Chairman Sung
from leaving the country.

307
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,469
What do you mean? Why would he be banned?

308
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,014
It's probably because of the news.

309
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,973
News?

310
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,392
Assemblyman Jang was

311
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,894
attacked by unidentified assailants
last night.

312
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,481
He had the operation,
but he's still in a critical condition.

313
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,485
Is Tae-jun alive?

314
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,155
-Pardon?
-Is he alive?

315
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,032
Yes.

316
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,501
Assemblyman Jang
was allegedly investigating

317
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,004
the slush fund scandal between

318
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,173
Minister of Justice Song Hui-seop
and Youngil Group.

319
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,884
On the same day, Assemblywoman
Kang Seon-yeong claimed

320
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,887
that Minister Song was trying to stop
the investigation by attacking him.

321
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,890
She also announced that
she will work on the Independent Counsel

322
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,683
regarding Minister Song's
slush fund scandal.

323
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,643
Did you hear
from the head of security yet?

324
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,812
No, sir. He's not home now.

325
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,150
What is he up to now?

326
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,283
Chairman Sung.

327
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,255
A cop suddenly barged in.

328
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,257
I managed to get away,

329
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,219
but I failed to take
care of Assemblyman Jang.

330
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,514
I'm sorry, Chairman Sung.

331
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,394
You stupid idiot!

332
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,562
You brat!

333
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,527
The police have specified the suspect

334
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,445
and are now tracking him down.

335
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,241
An official from the hospital says

336
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,868
Assemblyman Jang is now recovering

337
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,454
from his operation in a hospital room.

338
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,748
Jang Tae-jun, that jerk.

339
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,084
He's so indestructible.

340
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,670
They are observing his progress
after the operation.

341
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:38,716
Assemblyman Jang was allegedly
investigating the slush fund scandal

342
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,220
between Minister of Justice Song
Hui-seop and Youngil Group.

343
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,932
On the same day,
Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong claimed

344
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,269
that Minister Song was trying to stop
the investigation by attacking him.

345
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,147
She also announced that
she will work on the Independent Counsel

346
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,982
regarding Minister Song's
slush fund scandal.

347
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,108
What are you watching?

348
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,485
-Did you not see this yet?
-She also claims that

349
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,405
since it involves the incumbent
Minister of Justice,

350
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,366
the prosecution can't reveal the truth
by the internal investigation

351
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,243
emphasizing the necessity of...

352
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,579
Do you think Minister Song
is involved in this?

353
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,592
When I reported it to him,
he seemed very serious.

354
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,390
MS. YUN HYE-WON

355
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,893
Do you know anything about it?

356
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,856
No. What would I know?

357
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,651
OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE

358
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,362
Have the car ready.

359
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,031
Yes, sir.

360
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,095
Mr. Seo, it's me.

361
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,349
Check the police station
in charge of Jang Tae-jun's case

362
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,519
and transfer all the investigation data
to the Special Investigation Team.

363
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,145
Okay.

364
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,195
Wait outside.

365
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,449
How did you let this happen?

366
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,619
I guess there was a mistake.

367
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,371
Where is the head of security now?

368
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,374
I told him to lie low for a while.

369
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,293
They won't be able
to find the rest of the guys either.

370
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,173
Once the viper wakes up
from its winter sleep,

371
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,133
it will only get more spiteful.

372
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,593
Do you

373
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,470
want me to stay abroad for now?

374
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,097
Until things get settled.

375
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,099
You can't go abroad.

376
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,061
-What do you mean?
-Assemblywoman Kang requested

377
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,188
banning you from leaving the country.

378
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,858
You're the Minister of Justice.

379
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,317
You can reject the request.

380
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,820
Rejecting the request is like

381
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,240
announcing that you and I are
involved in this.

382
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,617
What do I do then?

383
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,954
Just name any chronic disease
and stay in a hospital.

384
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,831
Keep a low profile.

385
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,344
What...

386
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,930
What is happening now?

387
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,016
Why did you not tell me about this?

388
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,768
We didn't know what would happen,

389
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,313
so we had to keep his condition a secret.

390
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,773
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.

391
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,401
How is this even possible?

392
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,070
Minister Song would try
to cover up the incident.

393
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,489
Please look
into the prosecution's movements.

394
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,117
Ms. Kang is working
on the bill for the Independent Counsel.

395
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,452
They might need your help.

396
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,622
I'll contact the police
and prosecution then.

397
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,541
I'll talk to Ms. Lee
about the Independent Counsel.

398
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,501
Okay. Thank you for your help.

399
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,337
And

400
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,257
stay by his side just for a while.

401
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,885
I will.

402
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,974
You cannot leave him alone
under any circumstances.

403
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,602
Okay. Don't worry.

404
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,687
Are you going somewhere?

405
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,566
I must look into where Mr. Song was
yesterday.

406
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,449
Mr. Song.

407
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,577
-What's going on?
-Chief Choe

408
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,371
is investigating Jang Tae-jun's case.

409
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,207
He already took the case file
from the local police station.

410
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,378
Everyone is causing trouble nowadays.

411
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,673
Now that he can't use the prosecution,
he's chosen another way to attack me.

412
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,508
I get that no one scares him.

413
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,426
But he should never come after me.

414
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,845
-How should I handle this?
-Must you ask?

415
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,473
I'll take away everything
he has left this time.

416
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,147
Sir,

417
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,817
this is the photo taken
by Detective Lee Hyeong-bae

418
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,069
who accompanied Mr. Jang to the scene.

419
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,077
Whose car is this?

420
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,329
To Chairman Sung Yeong-gi
of Youngil Group.

421
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,332
Chairman Sung Yeong-gi?

422
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,545
This photo proves he was
at the scene of attempted murder.

423
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,631
-Who's the other passenger?
-I'm still checking on that.

424
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,844
Keep Assemblywoman Kang updated
on our investigation progress.

425
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,178
Yes, sir.

426
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,685
You're here.

427
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,570
How's Mr. Jang doing?

428
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,157
You don't need to answer that.

429
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,077
Why do you keep ignoring my calls?

430
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:04,333
No, I wasn't ignoring your calls.
Why would I do that?

431
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,631
I came to you
because I believe that you would know.

432
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,719
Where was Mr. Song last night?

433
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,473
Last night? Why do you ask?

434
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,018
I'm sure you know
the purpose of my question.

435
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,897
I'm asking you where Mr. Song was

436
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,691
when Mr. Jang was attacked.

437
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,735
You know, don't you?

438
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,947
Was Mr. Song with Chairman Sung?

439
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,284
Mr. Lee.

440
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,375
Mr. Jang

441
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,253
is still unconscious.

442
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,758
We must reveal the truth
before he regains his consciousness.

443
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,344
Please help us, Mr. Lee.

444
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,729
Don't let him find out
that I'm the one who told you this.

445
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,317
After the press conference last night,

446
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,986
Mr. Song got in
Chairman Sung's car and left.

447
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,780
What are you doing out here?

448
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,198
Minister Song.

449
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,077
I'd like to show you
something interesting.

450
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,746
I shouldn't have all the fun, should I?

451
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,542
-Get in.
-I'm tired. I'll take a rain check.

452
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,918
Do get in.

453
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,505
There are people watching.

454
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,804
All the reporters saw him
getting in the car.

455
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,140
You can check with them.

456
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,609
-Yes, sir.
-Where the heck are you?

457
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm putting gas in the car.

458
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,906
Yes, I'll be there right away.

459
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,991
Okay.

460
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,371
This is all I know.

461
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,790
I hope it's helpful.

462
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,626
-I'll get going now.
-Thank you.

463
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,379
Bye.

464
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,807
Ms. Kang. It's me.

465
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,351
Where are you now?

466
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,061
Chief Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol

467
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,731
told me there was
another passenger at the scene.

468
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,442
I believe that's Mr. Song.

469
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,613
Do you think they really
conspired together to commit murder?

470
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,159
If that's the case, things might have
just gotten easier for us.

471
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,746
Mr. Song or Chairman Sung.

472
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,248
It doesn't matter which one.
We just need to catch one of them.

473
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,625
You have a point,

474
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,544
but the problem is that it's hard
to catch either one of them now.

475
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,005
And there's no evidence
that they were together at the scene.

476
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,258
First,

477
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,719
tell Chief Choe what we know.

478
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,555
Knowing that they were together
at the scene could

479
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,098
give him a clue to solve this case.

480
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,600
Okay.

481
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,102
-I know it's hard, but let's keep going.
-Okay.

482
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,735
Ms. Kang.

483
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,278
Just as you asked,

484
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,572
I came up with the press release

485
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,242
including every suspicion and speculation.

486
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,912
Should I share it with the press?

487
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,043
Mr. Han. You must have
worked hard on this.

488
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:35,878
I'm sorry, but

489
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,214
please scrap this press release.

490
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,346
I was a bit too emotional earlier.

491
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,849
I will do everything I can,

492
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,686
but I will not embarrass myself.

493
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,980
Ms. Kang,

494
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,900
you have never done anything
to embarrass yourself so far.

495
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,903
Thank you, Mr. Han.

496
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,740
It won't be easy,

497
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,535
but let's take the bull by the horns.

498
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,996
Okay.

499
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,090
Kang Seon-yeong speaking.

500
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,760
Yes.

501
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,637
I'll see you there.

502
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,067
How's Tae-jun?

503
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,905
I hope he wakes up soon.

504
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,868
You must be scared
that Mr. Jang might wake up.

505
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,705
What are you trying to imply?

506
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,042
You're still daring when you're cornered.

507
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,003
You are indeed impressive.

508
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,964
I didn't come here for your compliments.

509
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,092
Ms. Kang.

510
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,346
You've done enough now.

511
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,389
If you keep running your mouth like that,

512
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,517
you'll ruin your father,
and you won't be nominated.

513
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,811
As long as you keep your mouth shut,

514
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,773
I will nominate you
for the position you want.

515
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,442
I neither plan to receive help from you

516
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,569
nor stay quiet.

517
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:29,116
You're under the impression
that you can still make a difference.

518
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,494
Haven't you still grasped the situation?

519
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,706
Stop believing the false hope that
Choe Gyeong-cheol might find something

520
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,750
if he investigates the case.

521
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,006
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

522
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,050
Did you find the suspect
who attacked Mr. Jang?

523
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,885
I put out an APB,

524
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,428
but I haven't located him yet.

525
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,180
A mid-level enforcer of a gang

526
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,141
got a job as the head of the security
at Youngil Group overnight.

527
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,018
I'm sure he probably took

528
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,562
some of his underlings to Youngil Group.

529
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,439
We must catch them even if it's just one.

530
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,690
Yes, sir.

531
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,988
We're from the IA
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

532
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,866
Chief Choe Gyeong-cheol
has been suspended from duty.

533
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,662
You must leave the office immediately
as of this moment.

534
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,957
What are you talking about?
He's still under investigation.

535
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,294
According to the Discipline
of Public Prosecutors Act 8.3,

536
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,965
Minister Song Hui-seop has
suspended you from his duties.

537
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,675
Sir.

538
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,510
Put your file on your desk and leave.

539
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,432
CHIEF CHOE GYEONG-CHEOL

540
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,864
-Yes.
-Ms. Kang.

541
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,450
Chief Choe Gyeong-cheol
has been suspended.

542
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,203
The case file was transferred over
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

543
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,872
I'll call you back.

544
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,338
Ms. Kang.

545
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,050
As long as I am the Minister of Justice
in this country,

546
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,719
you won't be able to do a thing.

547
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,304
I mean it.

548
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,347
It's my turn to say something.

549
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,059
If Mr. Jang doesn't regain consciousness,

550
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,312
I don't know what I might do.

551
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,484
I know the nature of the relationship
between you two.

552
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,738
However, that can't be an excuse
for getting so emotional.

553
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,615
Why would I be afraid?

554
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,950
I've already lost so many things.

555
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,887
Damn it. You're the worst son.

556
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,352
You never called. How could you let me
find out through the news?

557
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,978
Get up, you punk.

558
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,773
Your father is here.
You ought to get up and face me.

559
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,401
Why did you become an assemblyman
if you were going to end up like this?

560
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,694
Sir.

561
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,949
You worked so damn hard to get that badge.

562
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,578
Did you go through all that
just to lie in bed at a hospital?

563
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,247
Get up, punk.

564
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,750
Get up! Your father is here.

565
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,045
Get up.

566
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,967
Get up, you punk.

567
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,850
Get up.

568
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,812
Get up, you punk. Get up now.

569
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,566
The Ministry of Justice suspended
Chief Prosecutor Choe Gyeong-cheol

570
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,193
of Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office
from executing his duty.

571
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,445
-Chief Prosecutor Choe...
-The only thing we can do now

572
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,406
is forming the Independent Counsel.

573
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,827
We need at least ten assemblymen
or women to sign the bill for the Counsel.

574
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,539
I'm sure we can find people
from the Kookmin Party to join us.

575
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,208
As a matter of fact,
I met with their chiefs of staff

576
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,627
and looked into if anyone wants to join.

577
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,422
This is the list of the members
who are interested in the bill.

578
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,009
LEE CHEON-GYU
KIM SEONG-HAK

579
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,929
Could you mark assemblymen or women
who haven't made their decisions yet?

580
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,764
I'll meet with them myself.

581
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,642
Okay. I'll make a list and give it to you.

582
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,271
We must do this ourselves now.

583
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,985
Mr. Lee. Hello.
Could you please take a look at this?

584
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:36,614
Hello. We worked so hard to make
this press release. I hope you'll help us.

585
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,948
I'll check it simultaneously...

586
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,660
Find similarities from other accounts.
Take a look at what I marked first.

587
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,162
Mr. Oh Won-sik...

588
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,622
I see. For this?

589
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,666
-Please make five copies.
-Sure.

590
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,418
Could you check this?

591
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,170
Make copies for this, too.

592
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,882
How's it going?

593
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,394
GIL BYEONG-O

594
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,064
Here you go.

595
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,608
-Thank you so much.
-Send us the follow-up files.

596
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,609
Thank you.

597
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,611
AN SANG-CHAN

598
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,988
-Good work.
-thank you.

599
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:18,989
LEE JEONG-SUK

600
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,116
-It's for the Independent Counsel.
-I got the call.

601
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,868
Thank you for joining us.

602
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,787
-I hope the bill gets passed.
-Thank you.

603
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,538
LEE YUN-SEOK

604
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,082
BAEK JONG-SEOK

605
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,375
NO GYEONG-OK

606
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,043
Ms. Kang is preparing

607
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,505
the Independent Counsel
regarding your slush fund, Minister Song.

608
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,132
She already got other assemblymen
and women to join.

609
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,552
I think they will move to form
the Independent Counsel sometime today.

610
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,682
Does she think it's that easy
to form the Independent Counsel?

611
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:45,974
She's ridiculous.

612
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:47,935
Come in.

613
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,734
-Where's the president of Samyeong Bank?
-He's in the interrogation room.

614
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,699
-Go ahead.
-Yes, sir.

615
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,584
WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE
MINISTER SONG HUI-SEOP'S BRIBERY CASE...

616
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,214
Good work.

617
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,425
No, you worked harder than I did.

618
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,847
Ms. Kang.

619
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,599
The press conference is ready.

620
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,863
-What is this?
-I'm from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

621
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,115
Please cooperate.

622
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,451
This is ridiculous.

623
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,871
I can't believe you would stoop this low.

624
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,414
-Seize their files.
-Yes, sir.

625
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,874
-Wait. Hold on.
-Gosh.

626
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,710
-Why are you going in there? Come on.
-Wait.

627
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,128
Hold on a second.

628
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,381
Don't you dare touch my stuff!

629
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Wait.

630
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,178
That's... Come on, man.

631
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,638
-Let go of me.
-Wait.

632
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,682
-That's my personal stuff.
-Let that go.

633
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,142
Come on.

634
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,186
Damn it.

635
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,105
-Wait.
-Hey, pack everything up. Keep packing.

636
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,112
As the prosecution investigates

637
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,824
Assemblywoman Kang who is
accused of bribery to get nominated,

638
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,827
they decided to raid
the assemblywoman's office and house.

639
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,790
It has been made aware that
her father, Kang Seong-yeop,

640
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,835
the president of Samyeong Bank
was involved in the illegal bribery case

641
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,837
of Minister Song's chief of staff,
Oh Won-sik.

642
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,924
The prosecution announced
that they will thoroughly investigate

643
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,676
whether or not the Assemblywoman
bribed other politicians

644
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,179
to get nominated
during the last legislative election.

645
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,974
Fine. Take everything.

646
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,643
Take everything with you.

647
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,152
-Pack everything here.
-Yes, sir.

648
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,381
Mr. Jang.

649
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,383
Mr. Jang.

650
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,845
Doctor.

651
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,691
In addition,
to obtain relevant evidence to the case,

652
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,152
the prosecution decided to raid
the assemblywoman's office and house...

653
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,614
If you want to save your daughter,
just do as I say.

654
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,324
If you do,

655
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,452
both you and your daughter will not
be investigated by the prosecution.

656
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,955
As it has been made aware that...

657
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,207
YUN HYE-WON

658
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,335
Yes.

659
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,549
It has been made aware that
her father, Kang Seong-yeop,

660
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,344
the president of Samyeong Bank
was involved in the illegal bribery case

661
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,596
-of Minister Song's...
-Given the current situation,

662
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,389
forming the Counsel seems impossible.

663
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,351
...whether or not the Assemblywoman
bribed other politicians

664
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,146
to get nominated
during the last legislative election.

665
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,452
Tae-jun.

666
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,334
I was worried sick
that you might not be able to wake up.

667
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,379
I woke up now. So you don't need to worry.

668
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,428
I couldn't do anything.

669
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,348
I don't have any other means

670
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,559
to put pressure on Mr. Song.

671
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,894
I'm sure there's a way.

672
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,397
I only have three months left
until the election.

673
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,024
And both of us weren't nominated.

674
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,278
After we lose our seats in the Assembly,

675
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,448
do you think it will still be possible
to go against Mr. Song?

676
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,452
We have enough time.

677
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,663
How much are we talking about?

678
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,415
I don't know the exact amount,

679
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,834
but I know there are other
borrowed-name accounts than mine.

680
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,878
The total amount

681
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,505
should be around 32 billion won.

682
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,925
There are more borrowed accounts
other than Oh Won-sik's.

683
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,303
We must find evidence for that.

684
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:02,309
Mr. Song probably destroyed
all the documents from the bank.

685
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,771
I doubt there's any evidence...

686
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,695
I asked the caretaker
to give your mom's grave

687
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,573
a little touch-up.

688
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,910
Go take a look.

689
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,793
There might be evidence left.

690
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,964
We can use that
to put pressure on Mr. Song.

691
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,135
Mr. Jang.

692
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,347
The president of Samyeong Bank,
Kang Seong-yeop, who was

693
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,517
under investigation based on
the suspicion of bribing politicians

694
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,520
by forming an illegal fund
admitted to all of the suspicions today.

695
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,897
According to the prosecution,
the bank president

696
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,817
confessed to helping
the chief of staff, Oh Won-sik,

697
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,986
to set up accounts under borrowed names
and raise illegal fund.

698
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,447
-According to the prosecution,
-What happened?

699
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,533
-Kang Seong-yeop
-We'll investigate thoroughly.

700
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,201
-confessed that her daughter,
-Let's go.

701
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,787
Kang Seon-yeong of the Daehan Party,
was not involved at all.

702
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,580
The prosecution plans to investigate

703
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,917
-the process and the scale of operation.
-Mr. Song is trying to end this now.

704
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,752
The president will be indicted
accordingly.

705
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,128
In addition, President Kang

706
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,922
-I must hurry, then.
-expressed

707
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,049
his willingness to cooperate
with the investigation.

708
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,968
It has been confirmed

709
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,388
that the president of Samyeong Bank,
Kang Seong-yeop

710
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,765
had acted alone
in order to prevent the bank

711
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,019
from getting liquidated during
the restructuring financial institutions.

712
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:31,356
Bank President Kang Seong-yeop
helped Oh Won-sik who worked

713
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,943
as the chief of staff for ten years
open accounts under borrowed names.

714
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,654
He admitted to having given
the chief of staff money in return

715
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,323
and confessed to all of his crimes.

716
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,701
He was able to raise the illegal fund

717
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,871
by giving out illegal loans
at the bank branches overseas

718
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,206
and by receiving fees

719
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,334
from individual customers
and corporates as commissions.

720
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,296
Furthermore, I have decided to hold
the press conference today

721
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,714
as the Minister of Justice

722
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,800
because I am responsible for failing
to supervise my staff accordingly

723
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:04,389
and it may be too late,
but I wish to apologize to the people.

724
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,225
I'll thoroughly supervise and manage
my staff to ensure there won't be

725
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,186
-any more unfortunate cases.
-Can you get my clothes?

726
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,022
You shouldn't be moving about yet.

727
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,815
I must do something.

728
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,611
I won't forget my promise to you

729
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:22,157
and will right the judicial system
of our country and defend justice.

730
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,044
This should be enough.

731
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:35,962
Take a seat.

732
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,638
Among the confiscated items from the bank,

733
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,890
I didn't find any files
on you or Chairman Sung.

734
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,311
What do you mean?
Are you sure you checked everything?

735
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,939
Yes, sir. I checked
and confiscated everything

736
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,233
from the bank, his house,
vacation house, and warehouse.

737
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,113
There was nothing from Ms. Kang's office?

738
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,949
No, sir.

739
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,204
The bank president of Samyeong Bank
has my files.

740
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,749
If you clear that up,
it will help our situation greatly.

741
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,838
Was the bank president with Ms. Kang
when you brought him in?

742
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,923
Yes, sir.

743
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,926
Do you remember what they talked about?

744
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,719
They couldn't talk much.

745
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,806
As soon as she arrived, we arrested him.

746
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,310
I asked the caretaker
to give your mom's grave

747
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,229
a little touch-up.

748
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,023
Go take a look.

749
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:42,570
He only told her to take a look
at her mother's grave.

750
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,490
-Her mother?
-Yes.

751
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,454
Where is her mother's grave now?

752
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,339
Bring her in.

753
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,257
Pardon?

754
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,843
Without an arrest warrant--

755
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,845
That doesn't matter right now!
Bring her in now!

756
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:07,887
Yes, sir.

757
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,772
JANG TAE-JUN

758
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,828
You...

759
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,122
You must be awake.

760
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,292
I guess people don't die that easily.

761
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,587
-I'll be there shortly. Wait for me there.
-He released a statement

762
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,214
about the exchange of an illegal fund
between his chief of staff,

763
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,342
Oh Won-sik, and Kang Seong-yeop,
the president of Samyeong Bank.

764
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,096
The Minister of Justice, Song Hui-seop,

765
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,141
was deeply saddened by his failure
to supervise his staff

766
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,768
and promised the public that he would

767
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,063
take better control of his staff
to prevent this from reoccurring.

768
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,358
His statement can be interpreted
that the Minister

769
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,780
was not involved
in the bribery case of his chief of staff.

770
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,468
PARK HUI-YEONG

771
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,808
Hi. You're here.

772
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,812
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

773
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,289
Damn it.

774
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,000
When the blade becomes blunt,

775
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,461
it's bound to cut my own flesh.

776
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,631
You don't seem well at all.

777
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,718
Should I buy you some rice gruel?

778
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,848
How could I take anything from you?
I don't know what it might entail.

779
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,058
I guess you're here to buy some time.

780
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,727
That's no use.

781
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,063
Kang Seon-yeong will be arrested
without a warrant.

782
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,609
It's quite the contrary.
You seem more scared than I am.

783
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:12,280
How could you even think of arresting
an assemblywoman without a warrant?

784
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,366
What's done is already done.
What will you do about it?

785
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,287
The president of Samyeong Bank confessed
to everything. This case is closed.

786
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,457
You can't get evidence
as clear as one's confession.

787
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,718
He told me to hand this to you
when you came.

788
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,189
ACCOUNT HOLDER, ACCOUNT NUMBER

789
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,760
Hey, isn't that Ms. Kang's car?
Turn the car around.

790
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,898
Ms. Kang, please pull over
to the shoulder of the road.

791
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,027
Ms. Kang. Pull over
to shoulder of the road.

792
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,866
Hey, get past her.

793
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,797
Please get out of the car.

794
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,341
PROSECUTOR SEO

795
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,724
-Did you get Kang Seon-yeong?
-I arrested her.

796
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,476
Get the file.

797
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,980
-Hey, search the car.
-Yes, sir.

798
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,793
Sir, there's no file here.

799
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,297
What do you mean, there's no file?

800
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,527
YUN HYE-WON

801
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,281
-Yes.
-We have the file.

802
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,616
Okay.

803
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,289
It seems I have the file now.

804
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,044
Even when you think
you wiped everything clean,

805
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,962
there's a bit of residue left.

806
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,048
Damn it.

807
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,678
If you disclose that to the public,
it will turn the world upside down.

808
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,722
The world ought to be turned
upside down at least once.

809
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,057
Shit.

810
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,023
I will write

811
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,902
your retirement speech.

812
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,970
I can see the end of this long, dark path.

813
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:10,435
I do not know what lies
at the end of this path.

814
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,440
However, do not be afraid.

815
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,527
Take one more step forward.

816
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:26,993
I must charge forward, believing that
there will be a light at the end.

817
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,654
You'll get the Blue House involved?

818
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,239
I hope they will work with us.

819
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,991
It might put you in danger.

820
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,952
Do you think you'll bring me down
with a special hearing?

821
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,454
We can change the target.

822
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,790
He's looking for my bearer bonds.
Bring them to me.

823
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,459
He's trying to chain me here,
so he can go after my turf.

824
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,419
Don't think it's unfair.

825
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,506
It's you who betrayed
the people as well as me.

826
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:26,385
I'm holding this press conference today
to reveal the truth about the suspicions

827
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,887
raised against me.

828
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,096
Do you regret it?

829
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,933
Of course not.

830
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,268
