[The Vendetta of An]

2
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,660
It's getting cold.

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,980
The sooner we get this over with,

4
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,100
the sooner I can go to sleep.

[Episode 3]

6
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,820
Greetings,

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,540
Your Majesty.

8
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,130
I...

9
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,850
I want food.

10
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,290
I've never eaten for a long time.

11
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,850
Don't go.

12
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,060
Don't go.

13
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,340
Don't go!

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,100
Give me food.

15
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,340
Don't go!

16
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,290
Come back!

17
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,570
Come back!

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,010
Give me food!

19
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,690
Give me food!

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,690
Give me...

21
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,100
Give me some warm food.

22
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,500
Something warm.

23
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,260
Something edible.

24
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,540
Come back!

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,260
How long have you been starving him for?

26
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,850
He's a brat.

27
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,380
I cooked and sent him food

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,060
in the beginning,

29
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,280
but he asked

30
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,290
for the golden milk pastry

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,890
so I just ignored him.

32
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,980
Now that I think about it,

33
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,820
it has been two to three days.

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,130
He won't starve to death anyway.

35
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,730
Huai'an.

36
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,410
You first treated him coldly

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,500
before offering him a feast.

38
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,570
Your way of treating an old acquaintance

39
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,730
is quite roundabout.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,690
We are not close.

41
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,130
When I was nine years old,

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,610
we entered the Grand Academy together.

43
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,130
He was the prince.

44
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,450
But every time,

45
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,850
I was the one who got first place.

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,890
Not long after,

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,570
I found

48
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,010
a small snake in my desk drawer.

49
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,780
What do you think happened?

50
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,340
He was the one who put the snake there.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,170
He thought I wouldn't discover the truth

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,010
and even sent me the antidote.

53
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,730
What a schemer.

54
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,730
After I was ten years old,

55
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,540
I no longer saw him.

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,290
Later, he became the emperor

57
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,660
and was kept under Yan Fengshan's thumb for years.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,340
I'm sure

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,580
he has his own ways of survival.

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,490
It's done.

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,900
What a lucky fellow.

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,610
Where are you going?

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,220
Shouldn't I deliver the food to that scoundrel?

64
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,580
I made this meal for you.

65
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,250
For me?

66
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,930
You've been risking your life for me.

67
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,370
Shouldn't I make a meal

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,850
to thank you?

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,100
Come and eat.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,410
Is this my final meal?

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,020
Don't say something so inauspicious.

72
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,700
Even so, it's still worth it.

73
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,610
Your life

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,250
is hanging by a thread.

75
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,780
The new emperor

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,540
is looking for you.

77
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,580
As long as you are still missing,

78
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,370
his throne won't be secure.

79
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,290
Yan Fengshan of the Huben Army

80
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,730
wants to use you to start a war.

81
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,410
When that day comes,

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,050
whether he wins or loses,

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,810
you will still die.

84
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,290
If you leave this place,

85
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,610
the only fate waiting for you

86
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,340
is death.

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,610
You...

88
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,170
You can save my life?

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,810
Only I know of a way.

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,220
What is the price I have to pay?

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,930
You are the bait

92
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,340
I'm using to deal with Yan Fengshan.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm going to kill Yan Fengshan

94
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,170
and wipe out the entire Huben Army.

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,250
I need you

96
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,460
to help me achieve the goal.

97
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,170
Who are you?

98
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,250
It's best that you don't recognize me.

99
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,460
You should also

100
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,610
forget the fact

101
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,580
that you are the emperor.

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,460
I already knew

103
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,340
what kind of person you were

104
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
back in the Grand Academy.

105
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,020
I also know

106
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,490
you have your own way of surviving.

107
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,810
But from today onward,

108
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,780
you will survive

109
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,290
with the rules I set for you.

110
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,980
Otherwise,

111
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,370
you won’t live.

112
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,780
You...

113
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,610
Are you Liu...

114
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,660
That man is dead.

115
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,100
I am your master now.

116
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,700
I am Xie Huai'an.

117
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,560
[Beginning of Winter, water begins to freeze, the earth begins to harden]

118
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,060
[Pheasants enter the water for clams]

119
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,580
When I entered the city,

120
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,890
I saw my younger sister.

121
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,940
Has she been doing well?

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,700
She's doing fine.

123
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,580
Compared to 15 years ago,

124
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,130
everything here

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,820
is still fine.

126
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,420
My master

127
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,700
will be here tomorrow.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,340
Everything

129
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,010
will proceed according to plan.

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,850
All right.

131
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,340
The vendetta of a gentleman

132
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,490
leaves no man standing.

133
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,300
When I received my first month's wage

134
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,980
as a registrar in Huainan,

135
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,220
I hired an artist

136
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,700
to draw these six portraits.

137
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,100
That was my seventh year on the run.

138
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,490
I was afraid

139
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,850
that I might forget these people's faces.

140
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,180
If I want to destroy the Huben Army,

141
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,460
I must first kill these six people.

142
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,820
Pu Nichuan.

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,250
In the 19th year of Qiansheng,

144
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,850
he was Yan Fengshan's scout,

145
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,130
and he infiltrated Tiemo.

146
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,300
When he was trapped,

147
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,940
he waited for reinforcements, but to no avail.

148
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,940
Yan Fengshan deemed him an abandoned pawn.

149
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,220
Since then,

150
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,650
no one knows whether he's dead or alive.

151
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,130
Father!

152
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,980
I know very well if he's dead or alive.

153
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,060
Wei Qianting.

154
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,460
This man is elusive.

155
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,130
His whereabouts are unknown.

156
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,850
I met him seven years ago.

157
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,980
But he should be

158
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,700
buried in

159
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,420
the reed swamps of Nanwei Trough now.

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,250
Yan Fengshan.

161
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,650
He overthrew the deposed emperor

162
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,300
and ruled the imperial court for many years.

163
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,100
People call him

164
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,460
Emperor Yan.

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,220
When it comes to using shadow guards,

166
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,100
Yan Fengshan

167
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,220
is way superior to my father.

168
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,130
That's because he has

169
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,220
a particular person by his side.

170
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,850
The night when my family was annihilated,

171
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,730
he was there as well,

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,060
but I couldn't see his face clearly.

173
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,100
After so many years,

174
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,420
I still haven't found any clues about him.

175
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,850
Many people of the Huben Army

176
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,980
are hiding in the shadows,

177
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,100
but everyone

178
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,180
knows these two people.

179
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,890
Qingyi,

180

who is in charge of surveillance and intelligence.

181
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,580
He possesses the secrets

182
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,180
of many important officials of the imperial court.

183
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,100
Liu Ziyan.

184
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,340
The best assassin of the Huben Army.

185
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,980
He is in charge of killing.

186
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,730
Who should we deal with first?

187
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,460
My uncle, of course.

188
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,180
I've wanted to kill him for so long.

189
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,940
Aren't you the same?

190
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,340
As long as he is still alive,

191
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,220
I can't live in peace.

192
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,340
This day

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,010
will come soon.

[Yulong Ridge]

195
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,340
Are you here to bid farewell?

196
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,220
I'm afraid

197
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,490
this is my last time serving you.

198
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,010
Xiao Wuyang is not an easy target.

199
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,420
If the Huben Army wants to win against him,

200

Why have you been mobilized at this time?

[Liu Ziyan, Huben Member]
My subordinate let someone escape.

204
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,820
We searched for him in the city for half a month,

205
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,730
but he hasn't been found.

206
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,100
That man plays an important role

207

in the future.

208
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,940
I must

209
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,370
attend to it myself.

210
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,820
This is interesting.

211
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,250
It is a serious matter.

212
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,130
Just go.

213

215
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,060

Please be understanding.

217
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,340
I've been

218
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,850
imprisoned in Yulong Ridge for more than a dozen years.

219
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,010
I'm already dead inside.

220
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,370
I'm not picky about my servants.

Ziyan.

222
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,650
One more thing.

223
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,650
Liu Ziwen is your elder brother.

224
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,220
Yan Fengshan wanted

225
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,580
Liu Ziwen dead.

226
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,420
Why did you

227
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,980
do Yan Fengshan's bidding?

228
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,060
There are many things

229
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,460
my brother couldn't tolerate,

230
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,130
but General Fengshan could.

231
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,730
At the Battle of Chen Valley,

232
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,300
I saved a civilian.

233
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,340
His wife died early, and he had to take care

234
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,220
of his parents and children.

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,100
The whole family

236
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,250
made a living through chopping bamboo

237
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,820
and weaving dustpans.

238
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,650
When a war broke out,

239
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,650
they could no longer make a living.

240
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,890
A five-year-old child

241
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,730
sat on a wooden plate

242
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,100
and ate the bamboo dustpan.

243
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,180
The bamboo pricked his bloody mouth and lips.

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,250
He was so pitiful.

245
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,490
However, it's infuriating as well.

246
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,700
Did that family betray you?

247
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,770
I almost

248
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,890
lost my life there.

249
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,250
According to my brother's leadership,

250
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,250
there are things we shouldn't do.

251
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,300
He said

252
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,730
we killed people to save others.

253
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,940
But since that day,

254
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,460
I only kill others

255
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,420
so no one can kill me.

256
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,420
That sounds reasonable.

How much for these vegetables?

260
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,730
You always go to extreme lengths.

261

[Remain Steadfast and Upright]
The capital is ruled by the emperor,

262
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,380
yet you dare kill someone as you please.

263
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,380
The enemies came

264
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,090
and asked for your life.

265
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,250
They even accused my army of harboring you.

266
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,180
How much longer do you need

267

to move on

268
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,380
from the Chen Valley incident?

269
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,490
It's not that I didn't move on,

270
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,290
but I've chosen another path

271
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,810
after that night.

272
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,980
You have a blade in your hand

273
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,220
but you can't see things clearly.

274
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,700
After today,

275
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,010
you are no longer a Huben member.

276

If you make another mistake in the future,

277
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,090
I will kill you myself.

278
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,730
A military command is absolute.

279
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,570
You'd better kill me today.

280

Even if you spare me today,

281
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,460
I might

282
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,460
not spare you in the future.

283
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,810
Our brotherhood

286
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,140
My master bought this place.

287
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,460
It is now private property.

288

You mustn't go inside, mister.

289
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,940
I wanted to visit a familiar place.

290
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,770
I didn't know

291
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,770
that this place had another owner.

292
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,730
Forgive me.

293
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,620
Mister,

294
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,010
did you use to live here?

295
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,140
Yes.

296
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,380
I was

297
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,050
a superintendent

298
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,460
of this residence.

299
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,250
This courtyard
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

300
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,900
must have been exquisite in the past.

301
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,810
I wonder

302
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,420
who the former owner

303
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,180
of this residence was.

304
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,180
Two brothers

305
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,570
lived here.

306
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,940
The elder brother was the owner.

307
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,770
He was highly respected

308
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,810
in Chang'an.

309
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,660
The younger brother

310
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,290
was more or less educated and well-mannered.

311
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,180
He was always following his elder brother.

312
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,660
Look at this pear tree.

313
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,090
When winter passed and spring came,

314
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,570
it'd be full of pear blossoms.

315
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,380
When the sun set,

316
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,980
the courtyard would be bright

317
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,250
and full of guests.

318
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,530
All the officials would be sitting there,

319
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,290
sipping tea and drinking wine.

320
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,140
As for me,

321
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,980
I would play with

322
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,420
my master's two children.

323
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,770
It was so lively.

324
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,620
So how come this residence

325
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,420
is in a state of decline?

326
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,420
Young man, are you

327
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,380
in your twenties...

328
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,620
Anyway, you are still young.

329
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,530
In your life,

330
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,770
there are many things

331
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,810
that you cannot control.

332
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,460
Two days ago,

333
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,180
I remember I left something

334
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,730
in this residence.

335
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,490
Can you do me a favor?

336
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,700
Help yourself.

337
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,420
Thank you.

338
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,200
Uncle!

339
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,180
My father is still breathing!

340
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,370
Find a physician, quickly!

341
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,070
Father!

342
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,180
It seems like

343
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,770
a blade.

344
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,250
When I had hardships,

345
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,940
I dealt with them with this blade.

346
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,380
Now, I'm having another hardship.

347
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,460
So I'm retrieving it

348
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,530
for good luck.

349
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,330
A hardship?

350
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,050
Like killing someone?

351
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,180
Your guess

352
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,290
is quite accurate.

353
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,570
Behave now.

354
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,420
Otherwise,

355
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,380
you'll die a cruel death.

356
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,260
[Lamb Stew with Bread]

357
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,810
Enjoy.

358
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,330
Sir, please come inside.

359
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,490
Sir,

360
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,980
sharing tables is not allowed.

361
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,180
Why don't you

362
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,010
sit inside?

363
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,180
There are many empty seats.

364
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,460
Hey, you.

365
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm talking to you.

366
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,050
Did you not hear me?

367
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,220
Sir.

368
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,700
How did you lose him?

369
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,460
Before leaving Anfu Gate,

370
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,050
at the palace steps,

371
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,530
I was stopped by someone

372
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,090
in a black robe.

373
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,050
He killed and injured 17 of us

374
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,530
and took the deposed emperor away.

375
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,940
According to the people who survived,

376
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,530
they wounded him

377
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,570
in four places, at least, with a blade.

378
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,010
Moreover, the blades were poisoned.

379
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,010
Our men

380
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,220
are planted at all 12 gates of Chang'an.

381
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,460
No one has seen him.

382
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,090
Chang'an might have a million families,

383
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,420
but there aren't many places

384
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,290
that can harbor a martial arts expert.

385
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,050
Besides, he is hurt

386
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,220
and has an important person with him.

387
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,090
Only a few physicians

388
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,900
can treat the poison on our army's blade.

389
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,090
Keep investigating.

390
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,460
Yes, sir.

391
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,420
Master.

392
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,050
Mr. Long.

393
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,140
[Zhu Zhilong]

394
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,380
Every time you send a letter, you tell me how you

395
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,180
endure hardships

396
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,770
and wander in suffering.

397
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,220
Looking at your physique,

398
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,940
it seems like you're doing well.

399
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,140
Master,

400
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,860
Huai'an has nine lives.

401
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,010
He is very well.

402
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,530
On the other hand, I, your disciple,

403
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,220
almost lost my life.

404
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,570
If you died that easily,

405
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,380
it means I've misjudged you

406
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,380
and sent someone useless to protect Huai'an.

407
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,380
I'm fine.

408
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm your disciple after all.

409
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,420
Is he the one?

410
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,530
A fine choice for the puppet.

411
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,860
Identical body size.

412
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,700
Come in.

413
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,180
You still need to wait for a while.

414
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,900
He...

415
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,730
Is very well.

416
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,380
Did he fall sick?

417
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,660
He isn't ill.

418
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,860
He just

419
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,810
can't open his mouth and ingest food or water.

420
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,090
He is only kept alive

421
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,900
by drip-feeding the medicine I concocted.

422
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,620
Why are you doing this?

423
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,010
To raise a new skin

424
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,940
for your appearance.

425
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,140
The Huben Army is looking for you.

426
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,420
From now on,

427
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,620
you can never

428
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,010
show your real face to others.

429
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,090
Otherwise, your life will be in danger

430
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,980
wherever you are.

431
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,140
You need to

432
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,140
forget about yourself.

433
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,860
It's his turn now.

434
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,660
Ye Zheng,

435
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,290
give him a Breath-holding Pill.

436
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,140
No, I...

437
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,380
Wait.

438
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,380
Open your mouth.

439
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,140
Can you wait?

440
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,140
Wait.

441
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,810
This face suits him.

442
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,980
As long as he doesn't speak,

443
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,620
no one will grow suspicious of him.

444
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,490
Changing his face is just the first step.

445
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,620
His movements and behavior

446
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,530
must slowly change

447
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,530
until every move of his

448
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,380
resembles the other person

449
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,460
to complete the transformation.

450
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,700
If the Huben Army knows the deposed emperor is here,

451
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,460
they will surely come here.

452
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,860
In the end,

453
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,460
Yan Fengshan will also appear.

454
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,730
This is my final opportunity.

455
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,220
Don't play with fire and burn yourself.

456
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,660
The Huben Army

457
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,770
might just assassinate you

458
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,050
before you can successfully

459
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,860
lure out Yan Fengshan.

460
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,010
Since the day I returned to Chang'an,

461
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,660
I've braced myself

462
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,660
for death.

463
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,330
Master.

464
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,860
[Deposed Emperor]

465
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,020
[Zhang Mo]

466
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,090
I've looked at

467
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,980
a few residences around here.

468
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,490
This is the most suitable one.

469
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,530
The gate in front can be guarded,

470
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,420
and there's a rear exit.

471
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,660
More importantly,

472
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,980
there are many

473
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,730
delicious restaurants around here.

474
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,290
There's a market north of this place,

475
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,010
and the Tangshui Alley is not far.

476
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,490
There's enough foot traffic here.

477
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,180
Being targeted is not an issue.

478
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,770
The south of this place

479
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,980
is next to

480
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,460
the residents of Chengqing Neighborhood.

481
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,050
It's calm too.

482
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,570
Wonderful.

483
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,010
The owner who pays is satisfied with this place.

484
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,810
What say you, Mo, the pageboy?

485
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,380
Me?

486
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,860
I think

487
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,570
it's not bad.

488
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,290
Your Majesty,

489
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,530
you exposed yourself

490
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,460
with your reaction just now.

491
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:49,940
Remember.

492
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,180
You are now the pageboy, Mo.

493
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,620
All your actions

494
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,090
and behavior

495
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,220
must be that of a particular person.

496
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,170
Your Majesty,

497
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,490
you do look like it now.

498
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,420
Like what?

499
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,900
Like a servant.

500
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,090
I misspoke.

501
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,130
It's fine.

502
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,610
I am a servant.

503
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,650
A prisoner.

504
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,460
Xie and the rest

505
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,820
are doing this for Your Majesty's own good.

506
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,610
No one

507
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,090
in this world

508
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,260
will treat you well for no reason.

509
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,010
Xie Huai'an cares too much

510
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,780
about his own interests in this.

511
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,170
You mustn't tell him about this.

512
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,900
Don't worry.

513
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,170
I'm leaving tomorrow.

514
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,650
You're leaving?

515
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,380
Where to?

516
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,010
Xie said

517
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,170
you had made good progress.

518
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,280
Therefore, I can go home now.

519
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,210
My home is in Huzhou.

520
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,490
Huzhou

521
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,380
is quite far.

522
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,690
My wife

523
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,050
gave birth to a son and a daughter.

524
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,490
We are a family of four.

525
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,090
You are free now.

526
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,690
I envy you.

527
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,530
Young Master,

528
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,820
may I come in?

529
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,380
Come in.

530
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,460
I've avoided a reunion with you

531
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,460
because there were people around us.

532
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,940
He is more observant than others.

533
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,010
It's not a good thing

534
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,740
if he finds out about our past.

535
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,170
I appreciate

536
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,340
your concerns.

537
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,690
On your tenth birthday,

538
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,610
I prepared a pair of shoes,

539
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,610
wishing you

540
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,340
a smooth road ahead.

541
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,340
However...

542
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,460
I was shocked to learn

543
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,860
that you were displaced for years.

544
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,570
I'm fortunate to meet you again.

545
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,010
I've prepared another pair for you.

546
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,740
Young Master.

547
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,860
Zhang Mo,

548
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,090
thank you.

549
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,380
Please let me

550
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,570
put them on for you.

551
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,050
I...

552
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,900
I was your pageboy.

553
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,780
Please allow me

554
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,300
to serve you

555
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,210
one last time.

556
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,340
This path you've chosen

557
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,490
will be full of hardships.

558
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,690
Forgive me

559
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,570
for not being able

560
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,980
to accompany you along the way.

561
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,740
Mo,

562
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,130
your life

563
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,210
should belong to you.

564
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,650
Go back to Huzhou.

565
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,530
Your family

566
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,740
is waiting for you.

567
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,570
If I'm lucky enough to return alive,

568
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,940
remember to prepare a jar of good wine for me

569
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,300
when I pass by Huzhou.

570
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,130
From now on,

571
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,340
you cannot show your real face to others.

572
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,610
You need to

573
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,170
forget about yourself.

574
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,780
You are now the pageboy, Mo.

575
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,780
Your Majesty,

576
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,090
you do look like it now.

577
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,170
Like a servant.

578
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,210
I also know you have your own way

579
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,210
of surviving.

580
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,130
But from today onward,

581
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,530
you must survive

582
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,940
with the rules I set for you.

583
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,740
Otherwise,

584
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,780
you will die.

585
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,010
Give me something warm to eat.

586
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,690
Something edible.

587
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,820
I can go home now.

588
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:43,940
My wife

589
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,210
gave birth to a son and a daughter.

590
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,690
We are a family of four.

591
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,420
You are free now.

592
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,380
Your Majesty,

593
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,900
farewell.

594
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,260
Please be careful from now on, Your Majesty.

595
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,010
Xie is a kind person.

596
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,380
I'm sure he will

597
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,260
give you a good place to be.

598
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,010
Safe journey.

599
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,530
Mo!

600
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,740
Didn't you want me

601
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,090
to be exactly like him?

602
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,460
Take a guess.

603
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,570
Who is the one

604
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,010
lying there now?

605
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,690
Who is it?

606
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,820
You deserve death.

607
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,980
You truly deserve to die.

608
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,050
Mother.

609
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,610
Why did you

610
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,940
prepare so much food?

611
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,170
Because Father is coming back.

612
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,940
Really?

613
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,210
Yes.

614
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,050
Father will soon return from Chang'an.

615
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,090
Father is coming back!

616
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,300
Father is coming back!
