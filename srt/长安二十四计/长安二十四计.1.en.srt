In the 28th year of Qiansheng,

6
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,730
the founding emperor fell ill suddenly

7
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,660
and passed away unexpectedly.

8
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,070
General of Huben Army, Yan Fengshan, governed the imperial court

9
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,420
and threw the government into chaos.

10
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,660
He helped the late emperor's youngest son, Xiao Wenjing, ascend the throne

11
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,950
and killed the feudal lords,

12
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
causing imperial authority to decline.

13
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,210
In the 4th year of Wencheng,

14

the late emperor's eldest son, a feudal lord, Xiao Wuyang,

15
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,680
mobilized troops from the north

to overthrow the tyranny.

17
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
They travelled 1,300 li southward.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,090
With strict military discipline along the way,

19
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,910
all sides submitted to him.

20

Unable to bear the defeat, the deposed emperor, Xiao Wenjing,

26
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,020
burned himself inside Taiji Hall.

28
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,410

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,470
Apparently, the deposed emperor

33
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,420
slipped and fell

34
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,780
on a hanbaiyu marble staircase when he was young.

35
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,570
Because of that,

36
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,130
his upper left molar was chipped.

37
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,570
He also fractured his left leg.

All of these

are recorded in the palace records.

These dead bodies

41
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,130
might be unrecognizable,

42

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,460
The weather is good today.

176
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,530
I'm letting the paddy dry in the sun.

177
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,940
Sure. If you say so.

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,820
I've read

179
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,730
the imperial gazette.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,580
The latest issue

181
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,530
is from a month ago.

182
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,980
It's fine even if it's late.

183
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,420
At least, we know

184
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,820
what is happening out there.

185
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,890
Huainan is

186
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,610
remote and desolate.

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,730
What happens outside

188
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,100
has nothing to do with this place.

189
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,220
The weather is changing.

190
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:27,890
Yes.

191
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,100
Rain is coming from behind the mountain.

192
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,890
Ziya.

193
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,850
Look at this article.

194
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,060
It has been a month

195
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,220
since Xiao Wuyang

196
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,700
attacked Xigu Mountain City.

197
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,460
After passing Xigu Mountain City,

198
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,010
it's only 300 li

199
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,850
from Chang'an.

200
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,890
There's no choke point

201
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,250
in-between to defend against any attack.

202
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,060
I'm sure Chang'an

203
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,100
won't be captured so easily.

204
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,610
The Imperial Guards are in charge

205
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,370
of Chang'an's defense.

206
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,850
The soldiers

207
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,180
are all from noble families.

208
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,850
They have adequate military strength,

209
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,060
but look at General Li.

210
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,940
His name is Li Longjing.

211
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,300
He is a coward.

212
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,100
Chang'an

213
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,650
might have been captured already.

214
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,060
That's impossible.

215
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,100
An imperial envoy has come from Chang'an.

216
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,610
Zhou Mo is probably waiting

217
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,610
at the gates to welcome him

218
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,700
with your proclamation condemning the rebels.

219
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,300
What?

220
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,720
[Huainan]

221
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,220
Sir.

222
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,420
They are so slow, sir.

223
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,650
Are you waiting for your wife?

224
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,530
How fast do you expect them to be?

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,580
You are useless.

226
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,780
[Huainan District Office]

227
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,650
What is it? Is the imperial envoy here?

228
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,180
I wrote a congratulatory article

229
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,300
for the new emperor's ascension.

230
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,060
Help me find it, quickly.

231
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,370
[Zhang Haoran]
There's no congratulatory article here.

232
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,410
Didn't you write to condemn the rebels?

233
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,400
Zhou Mo took it to meet the imperial envoy.

234
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,180
That article must not be submitted.

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,980
One and a half months ago,

236
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,980
Xiao Wuyang led the army

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,010
and captured Xigu Mountain City.

238
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,020
The city

239
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,060
is only 300 li away from Chang'an.

240
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,850
There's no choke point in between to defend against any attack.

241
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,530
I'm sure Chang'an won't be captured

242
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,220
that easily.

243
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,220
It has already been captured.

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,820
The imperial envoy

245
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,730
serves the new emperor.

246
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,780
If Zhou Mo submits the article,

247
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,170
we'll all be dead.

248
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,380
- That's... - Enough.

249
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,260
Look for it, quickly.

250
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,970
When did you write it?

251
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,060
Two years ago.

252
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,380
Two years ago?

253
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,420
Can you predict the future or something?

254
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,730
Found it.

255
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,210
They are here.

256
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,210
Play the music!

257
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,330
Quick, sound the drum.

258
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,380
Why does he look like a eunuch?

259
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,420
Look like a eunuch?

260
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,500
He is a eunuch.

261
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,970
It's my first time seeing one.

262
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,180
Stop talking from now on.

263
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,020
I, the Magistrate of Huainan District, Zhou Mo,

264
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,380
[Huainan]
greet the imperial envoy.

265
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,610
You may stand, Magistrate.

266
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,500
Thank you, Imperial Envoy.

267
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,330
Huainan District is so remote.

268
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,090
I think

269
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,610
I've travelled 70 li of mountainous roads

270
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,570
to arrive here from the county.

271
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,810
Sir,

272
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,970
Huainan might be remote,

273
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,300
but every land here belongs to the emperor.

274
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,730
The people of Huainan

275
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,180
are also blessed by His Majesty's grace.

276
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,300
You have a silver tongue.

277
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,060
Imperial Envoy,

278
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,840
I've prepared

279
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,720
the best inn

280
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,970
in the district town

281
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,660
to give you

282
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,020
a warm welcome.

283
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,730
That's right.

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,810
One more thing.

285
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,550
We have

286
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,450
prepared an article

287
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,730
for you to peruse

288
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,500
when you arrive.

289
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,970
Show me.

290
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,330
Sorry, sir.

291
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,090
Sir,

292
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,000
are you hurt?

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,090
How absurd!

294
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,060
Which...

295
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,500
He's one of our own.

296
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,970
Sorry, Imperial Envoy.

297
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,840
I am the district office's registrar.

298
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,970
I apologize

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,810
for my reckless action.

300
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,810
I'm very sorry.

301
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,380
Sorry.

302
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,970
Sir,

303
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,210
this is the congratulatory article you wrote.

304
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,180
Please show it to the imperial envoy.

305
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,970
Sir.

306
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,300
What a good article.

307
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,180
How impressive.

308
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,870
I've travelled across states and provinces

309
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,540
and received about 80 articles

310
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,970
to congratulate His Majesty's ascension to the throne.

311
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,900
This is the best one yet.

312
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,540
Mr. Zhou, your literary talent is remarkable.

313
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,260
You shouldn't

314
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,180
humble yourself in this desolate place.

315
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,300
When I return to the Capital,

316
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,780
I will put in a good word to His Majesty

317
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,330
for you.

318
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,450
Thank you, sir.

319
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,160
Oh.

320
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,260
Besides informing the world

321
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,690
about the new emperor's ascension to the throne,

322
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,970
I also travelled

323
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,060
to your district

324
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,140
for one more purpose.

325
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,300
Do tell, sir.

326
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,330
Do you have someone called Xie Huai'an
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

327
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,330
in your district?

328
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,540
His Majesty has summoned

329
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,970
Xie Huai'an to the Capital.

330
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,380
I am Xie Huai'an.

331
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,380
The imperial envoy said

332
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,330
your journey to the Capital

333
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,730
would be paid by the district office.

334
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,090
We must ensure a comfortable trip for you

335
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,570
in terms of food and accommodation.

336
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,780
Thank you, sir.

337
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,420
He also said

338
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,210
that when you arrived in Chang'an,

339
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,730
an expectant official from the Imperial Academy called Li

340
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,540
will welcome you.

341
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,330
This man

342
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,850
is famous in the Capital.

343
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,140
He will welcome you in person.

344
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,960
The imperial envoy also said...

345
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,660
He said something else?

346
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,810
His Majesty

347
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,890
is going to meet Huai'an in person

348
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,700
and order him

349
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,850
to do something huge.

350
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,170
The imperial envoy wants you

351
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,890
to depart tomorrow

352
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,540
without any delay.

353
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,980
Huai'an,

354
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,330
you said

355
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,410
you'd be my registrar forever.

356
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,260
Enough. Stop pouring.

357
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,570
He is completely drunk.

358
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,650
It's fine.

359
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,170
I'm going to leave anyway.

360
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,410
Tonight,

361
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,940
just let him drink to his heart's content.

362
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,780
Zhou Mo,

363
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,220
I used to tell you

364
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,020
I'd either

365
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,410
be your registrar forever,

366
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,940
or head straight to the imperial court.

367
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,060
I won't choose any other paths.

368
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,300
Before today,

369
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,060
I thought

370
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,330
I'd stay in Huainan forever.

371
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,850
You are a good superior

372
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,060
and a good buddy of mine.

373
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,810
Being your registrar

374
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,570
isn't that bad.

375
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,460
Sir,

376
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,780
why are you crying?

377
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,020
He sounds so devoted.

378
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,170
My buddy is loyal.

379
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,090
What's wrong with me crying just for a while?

380
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,410
I believe

381
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,410
you will complete His Majesty's task dutifully.

382
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,810
Right?

383
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,410
Both of us

384
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,610
will soon reunite.

385
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,540
Right?

386
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,460
That's right.

387
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,850
But it might not be necessary

388
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,370
to return here just to reunite.

389
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,300
This is a farewell gift.

390
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,810
I don't know if your career as an official

391
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,780
will be smooth in the future.

392
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,610
But if you are

393
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,260
no longer an official one day,

394
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,410
open this letter.

395
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,610
It'll be easier

396
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,810
for us to gather in the future.

397
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,570
All right.

398
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,460
Let's make a toast to Huai'an.

399
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,700
- Sure! - Drink up!

400
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,540
Huai'an, may you soar to great heights.

401
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,020
♪Huainan is good♪

402
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,810
♪A safe haven♪

403
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,570
♪The mountains and rivers stretch on like our affection♪

404
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,790
♪An affectionate person...♪

405
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,610
When you were 17 years old,

406
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,780
you carried

407
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,650
a tattered pack

408
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,030
and came to Huainan,

409
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,890
a remote place,

410
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,090
like a homeless man.

411
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,020
You worked as a registrar for seven years,

412
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,570
and served four magistrates.

413
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,000
When they left,

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,810
they wanted to take you with them but you refused.

415
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,220
All of us knew

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,810
you were destined for great things.

417
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,500
We treated you well

418
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,540
not because we wanted you to help us out

419
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,740
when you achieved success one day,

420
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,570
but we did it out of sincerity.

421
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,130
However,

422
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,020
you are also aloof.

423
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,740
Yes.

424
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,810
But that's who I am.

425
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,220
Careful.

426
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,780
Lie here and count the stars

427
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,810
as your punishment.

428
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,940
Stars!

429
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,540
Stars,

430
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,610
why are you so far away?

431
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,020
You're as far as Chang'an.

432
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,220
Enough already.

433
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,780
Do you know

434
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,540
why I only have two paths to choose from?

435
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,170
Why?

436
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,330
I am a descendant of a condemned official.

437
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,410
15 years ago,

438
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,890
my family was wronged and annihilated.

439
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,060
I got lucky and survived.

440
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,740
Since then, I've been living in hiding.

441
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,330
I slept in the wilderness.

442
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,330
I've lived in the reed swamps.

443
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,890
Had I taken one wrong step

444
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,500
back in the days,

445
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,020
I'd be dead.

446
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,090
Did your family offend

447
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,060
some authoritative figures?

448
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,850
The most authoritative figure of the dynasty.

449
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,940
The leader of Huben Army,

450
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,980
Yan Fengshan.

451
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,130
Yan Fengshan?

452
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,700
His influence spreads across the imperial court.

453
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,570
But times have changed.

454
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,410
Xiao Wuyang

455
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,260
ascended to the throne as a general.

456
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,500
He won't have Yan Fengshan around.

457
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,260
I don't know what he wants me to do,

458
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,940
and I don't know who recommends me.

459
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,410
But this is my opportunity.

460
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,610
I must grasp it.

461
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,370
Huai'an.

462
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,220
Are you trying

463
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,460
to clear your family's name?

464
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,810
Everyone is dead.

465
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,300
There's no use clearing their name.

466
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,020
I'm going to take revenge.

467
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,500
All right.

468
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,060
Go back and rest.

469
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,240
You can sleep for six hours, at least.

470
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,700
We'll send you off at the city gates tomorrow morning.

471
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,810
Sure.

472
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,610
All of you should go back as well.

473
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,370
Sure.

474
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,130
Enough.

475
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,500
Don't be sad.

476
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,090
I'm leaving.

477
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,730
Father!

478
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,600
- Go! - Father!

479
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,010
Father!

480
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,640
Go!

481
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,490
Go!

482
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,210
Move a little.

483
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,490
You came back late

484
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,330
and you're still not sleeping?

485
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,600
The sun is coming up.

486
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,360
I'm not sleeping.

487
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,330
Why are you taking the eggs?

488
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,840
Huai'an is going to the Capital tomorrow.

489
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,250
I want to give him some eggs.

490
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,840
Here,

491
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,230
cook the eggs

492
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,440
so he can take them with him on his way.

493
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,880
The journey to the Capital is long.

494
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,810
The eggs

495
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,290
will turn putrid a few days after they are cooked.

496
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,600
What should we do?

497
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,120
Just give him some fresh eggs.

498
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,640
When he feels like eating them,

499
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,160
he just needs to start a fire, boil some water,

500
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,010
and cook them.

501
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,600
You are right.

502
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,250
As expected of my wife.

503
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,570
Move.

504
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,400
What's wrong?

505
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,770
You have no idea, do you?

506
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,440
The chickens will lay eggs in a while.

507
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,810
We can give Huai'an more.

508
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,570
[Congratulations on Your Majesty's ascension]

509
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,250
[Congratulations on Your Majesty's ascension]

510
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,850
What?

511
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,480
Are you sad to see me go

512
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,680
and want me dead instead?

513
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,570
Go inside.

514
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,880
Sit down.

515
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,720
You've read it?

516
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,200
News is hard to come by in Huainan.

517
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,960
I deduced what happened in Chang'an

518
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,440
by using old imperial gazettes.

519
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,120
But you had already been aware of the changes a long time ago.

520
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,160
And your name, Zhou Mo,

521
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,640
must just be a pseudonym as well.

522
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,330
I am a member of the Huben Army.

523
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,530
Huai'an, I didn't lie to you.

524
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,530
I also didn't lie to Haoran and the rest.

525
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,850
What I have been showing all of you

526
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,120
is my true character.

527
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,640
However, I was a member of the Huben Army

528
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,610
before I met all of you.

529
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,720
General Yan Fengshan saved me.

530
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,960
I pledged my loyalty before him.

531
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,810
When you were talking about your background,

532
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,570
I was shocked.

533
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,250
I didn't expect my buddy

534
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,640
to be a descendant of Liu Ziwen.

535
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,770
Is fate playing a joke on me?

536
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,330
Huai'an.

537
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,010
I might be one of the Huben Army,

538
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,680
but I've never

539
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,770
killed anyone until today.

540
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,570
I didn't expect the first person I would kill

541
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,330
to be my buddy.

542
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,050
This cruel fate.

543
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,770
There must be many shadow guards

544
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,880
in the imperial court.

545
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,610
Indeed.

546
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,960
They are like

547
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,720
a shapeless net

548
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,050
that hangs above the imperial court.

549
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,440
You will never win against them.

550
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,200
This is indeed a cruel joke.

551
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,810
I thought

552
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,090
I'd become a registrar here forever,

553
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,330
but to my surprise...

554
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,250
Forget it.

555
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,840
Here.

556
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,920
Drink this farewell wine.

557
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,310
Forget that we've ever met.

558
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,050
Whether we live or die, we won't have any regrets.

559
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,890
A cup for life

560
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,050
and a cup for death.

561
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,250
Come, Huai'an.

562
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,120
Life

563
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:26,810
for you.

564
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,330
When I was young,

565
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,050
my mother died in the north.

566
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,610
When I was ten years old,

567
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,120
my father died as well.

568
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,090
The whole Huben Army defected and killed him.

569
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,530
I can't die.

570
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,250
I must get revenge on the Huben Army.

571
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,400
I'll kill any Huben soldiers I see

572
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,090
until none of them are left.

573
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,720
I collected the eggs for him.

574
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,810
Are you sure?

575
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,030
I'm sure it was your wife who did that.

576
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,050
I did it.

577
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,120
Huai'an.

578
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,530
We are here to send you off.

579
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,330
What happened?

580
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,880
Zhou Mo.

581
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,570

582
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,290
- Sir! - What happened?

583
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,530
Don't ask.

584
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,090
It's not his fault.

585
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,680
Don't tell anyone.

Don't...

Don't trouble him.

588

We all

589
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,610
have our own reasons.

That's Zhou Mo!

597

Stay away from me

Why did you come back?

Only one person is buried here.

609

It's not a dangerous place.

610
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,880
The real danger is Chang'an,

It seems like you are passing by indeed.

613
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,210
Then, I won't be

I'm going back to Chang'an.

616
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,690
I don't know if I'll leave alive.

617

So, I come to see you

618

619
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,290
Right.

are bound to return one day.

622
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,170
Yes.

623
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,560
Your younger sister

624
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,210
went to Chang'an as well.

625
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,520
She went to study.

626
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,040
Perhaps

627
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,250
she is an imperial scholar now.

628
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,400

629
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,880
Both of you are so far apart.

How did you know?

631
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,480
She has been writing letters to me.

632
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,000
I've also been replying to her letters.

633
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,520
Why wouldn't you reunite with her?

634
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,170
I dare not.

635
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,000
It's best not to reunite with her forever.
