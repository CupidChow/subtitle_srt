there's a physician in Tangshui Alley

Someone with decent skills

Apparently, someone orchestrated it.

The mastermind

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,380
is clever and deeply hidden.

I'm ashamed to say

204
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,210
I haven't found them yet.

Ziyan,

206
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,570
I came all the way to bring you this news,

207
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,600
yet you won't even offer me a cup of tea.

208
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,700
But there's one thing

The deed

is in the hands of a merchant named Yang Chuhao.

He claims to be a merchant,

Too many people died in that house.

It's been abandoned for years.

you must've been a great help to this household.

You're not a sentimental person.

On this path,

I've had no pity for the many who lost their lives.

But Mo was innocent.

One innocent death

what do you care about most in this life?

she just doesn't understand you.

Isn't your head full of revenge?

and throw yourself into this mess again?

350
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,340
So it was you, you rascal.

351
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,690
See?

352
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,490
This is what happens when you go against me.

353
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,340
From now on,

354
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,490
I'm willing to

355
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,380
be a slave, a dog.

356
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,530
You didn't drink the liquor I gave you.

357
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,380
After all,

358
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,680
you were involved in my father's murder.

359
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,740
Yet you saved my life.

360
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,010
I can't repay you

361
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,490
in this lifetime.

362
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,200
I'll repay that in the next.

363
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,460
We're even.

364
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,300
But the promise I made to you,

365
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,490
I never fulfilled.

366
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,420
All my life,

367
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,090
I've been caught in hatred.

368
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,610
And now that I'm old...

369
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,940
Don't repeat my mistakes.

370
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,760
There really are

371
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,420
many beautiful things

372
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,610
in this world.

373
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,610
Lanterns swaying in the wind,

374
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,650
carriages passing by,

375
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,820
and the scent of liquor

376
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,420
from a small tavern.

377
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,370
Say a little less.

378
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,690
You haven't told me

379
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,170
what you said

380
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,570
to the tavern owner.

381
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,170
She actually smiled at me.

382
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,490
Tell me.

383
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,910
I told her

384
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,820
there's something

385
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,530
you can't see or touch,

386
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,010
but it exists between you and her.

387
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,900
It's fate.

388
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,130
She smiled

389
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,210
so beautifully.

390
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,820
Her smile

391
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,260
was

392
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,610
so beautiful.
