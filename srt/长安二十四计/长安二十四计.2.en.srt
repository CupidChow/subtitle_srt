00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,530
of the former court

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,460
to show my defiance of the new emperor.

177
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,490
Yan Fengshan

178
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,220
commands the Huben Army

179
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,610
and held the court in his grip for years.

180
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,420
Xiao Wuyang seized Chang'an

181
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,010
to keep imperial power from slipping away.

182
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,730
Though the Huben Army

183
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,610
has avoided meeting him head-on,

184
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,820
Yan Fengshan still intends

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,250
to set Chang'an aflame

186
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,300
and give Xiao Wuyang no peace.

187
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,180
And I

188
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,180
am a piece of wood they need for that fire.

189
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,890
Academician Li.

190
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,770
I hope you do not mind

191
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,980
that I used your hand to slap

192
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,650
the Imperial Guards in the face.

193
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,300
Not at all.

194
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,730
They

195
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,890
deserved it.

196
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,100
I intended to humiliate that commander.

197
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,250
Even if you hadn't been there, sir,

198
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,530
I would have

199
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,580
found another way

200
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,300
to shame him another day.

201
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,100
That is

202
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,250
how I handle matters.

203
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,890
Assassins!

204
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,820
Protect His Majesty!

205
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,130
Quick, protect His Majesty!

206
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,010
Understood!

207
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,530
Assassins!

208
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,940
Assassins! Protect His Majesty!

209
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,370
The realm is still unsettled.

210
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,610
It's been but a month since His Majesty took the throne,

211
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,980
and already

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,940
a dozen assassination attempts have been made.

213
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,890
No need to panic, though.

214
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,770
Under the Dingtang Sword,

215
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,850
all who come lose their heads.

216
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,660
Your subject,

217
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,940
Xie Huai'an,

218
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,620
greets Your Majesty.

219
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,980
Lift your head.

220
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,220
I asked many people

221
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,140
who could seek someone for me

222
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,330
in this vast world.

223
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,660
They all

224
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,180
recommended you,

225
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,660
so I wished to see for myself

226
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,490
whether you are capable of the task.

227
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,700
These ten essays

228
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,570
were all written for the imperial examination

229
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,700
in the 11th year of the dynasty.

230
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,180
One of them was written by me.

231
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,490
Find it.

232
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,730
As you

233
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,490
command.

234
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,340
[Benevolent Rule]

235
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,260
[He united the lords and steadied the realm, rising as the foremost hegemon]

236
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,540
[The Forceful Rule and the Benevolent Rule]

237
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,420
Your Majesty, I have found

238
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,810
your essay.

239
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,180
It's only been half a stick of incense.

240
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,180
Even if you read ten lines at a glance,

241
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,250
you could only have finished three or four essays.

242
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,380
How did you manage it?

243
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,980
Southerners and northerners differ.

244
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,460
Their wording and phrasing leave traces.

245
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,940
Before Your Majesty turned 20,

246
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,980
you lived long in Chang'an.

247
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,140
Your early learning

248
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,250
came from Grand Secretary Bai Linian,

249
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,250
who was from Wuyue.

250
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,010
Therefore,

251
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,940
Your Majesty's writing

252
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,660
shows southern traits.

253
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,220
Southerners write "lu" as "six,"

254
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,420
"qi" as "stand," and "bei" as "cover."

255
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,460
Northerners write "chen" as "ugly,"

256
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,330
"geng" as "road,"

257
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,620
and "tong" as "reach."

258
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,530
By this measure,

259
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,530
seven of the essays

260
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,530
were written by northerners,

261
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,140
and only three by southerners.

262
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,730
Everyone has words and phrases

263
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,460
they tend to repeat.

264
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,900
"In troubled times,

265
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,380
hearts are easily disturbed,

266
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,940
so virtue alone cannot calm them."
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

267
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,700
I once saw

268
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,660
this line

269
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,620
in a memorial.

270
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,570
That's how I knew.

271
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,290
How could a mere registrar

272
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,420
have access to memorials?

273
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,530
The Memorials Office keeps expired memorials.

274
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,660
They say they are burned

275
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,940
after three months,

276
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,940
but royal writings

277
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,770
are treasured among the people,

278
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,380
so some were secretly sold.

279
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,010
I also

280
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,810
bought some myself.

281
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,940
This level of wit

282
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,660
is not enough

283
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,660
for this mission.

284
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,730
You had better

285
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,090
give me more surprises.

286
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,810
More surprises?

287
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,700
I know I wasn't the only one

288
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,330
commanded to enter the Capital.

289
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,900
Nor was I the first to find

290
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,810
Your Majesty's essay.

291
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,090
The first to do so

292
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,660
is dead now.

293
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,700
In the assassination just now,

294
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,700
the assassins numbered two,

295
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,220
yet Your Majesty

296
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,810
killed three men.

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,050
Your Majesty,

298
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,140
who are you seeking?

299
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,090
Yan Fengshan of the Huben Army

300
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,660
and Xiao Wenjing, the deposed emperor.

301
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,090
I want both their bodies

302
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,090
brought before me.

303
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,050
I will find the deposed emperor,

304
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,660
but Yan Fengshan

305
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,700
is mine.

306
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,860
How dare you haggle with me?

307
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,860
I have wanted to kill him

308
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,290
for 15 years.

309
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,810
Stand at attention!

310
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,900
If someone sees you like this,

311
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,940
what will they think?

312
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,900
Your Majesty, do you care for this realm?

313
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,050
If I did not,

314
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,180
why seize it?

315
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,620
And do you

316
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,900
care for the throne?

317
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,010
Even if I don't,

318
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,420
it is not

319
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,770
for Yan Fengshan to touch.

320
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,460
The deposed emperor is weak-willed.

321
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,900
Yan Fengshan controlled the court for years.

322
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,010
He was long known

323
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,010
as Emperor Yan among the people.

324
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,180
Now that Your Majesty has reclaimed Chang'an,

325
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,770
he will not yield easily.

326
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,980
He abducted your brother.

327
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,860
He will return in force.

328
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,010
Kill Yan Fengshan,

329
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,860
and his head is yours.

330
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,460
If you fail,

331
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,010
your head is mine.

332
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,770
My thanks, Your Majesty.

333
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,250
In my memory, whenever Your Majesty

334
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,660
has something on your mind,

335
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,530
you always take out that flute.

336
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,050
You have just ascended the throne,

337
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,620
yet you look so burdened.

338
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,220
It seems this throne

339
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,980
isn't so important to Your Majesty after all.

340
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,700
Sir.

341
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,940
Sir, please get in the carriage.

342
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,290
It is bitter cold tonight.

343
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,300
Allow us

344
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,400
to escort you out of the Palace City.

345
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,140
No need for a carriage.

346
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,250
But I'd like

347
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,010
to trouble you

348
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,940
to walk with me.

349
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,180
I prefer to go on foot.

350
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,050
Academician Li,

351
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,330
don't you wish to know

352
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,660
why His Majesty summoned me?

353
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,420
That is not for me to ask.

354
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,420
Whatever His Majesty commands,

355
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,460
we obey.

356
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,940
We should not inquire.

357
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,620
The deposed emperor was taken by Yan Fengshan.

358
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,700
His Majesty wishes to...

359
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Have mercy!

360
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,180
You said nothing.

361
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,660
I heard nothing.

362
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,420
Please have mercy.

363
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,810
I just checked the palace registry.

364
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,900
Among all Imperial Academy scholars

365
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,860
permitted to enter the Inner Court,

366
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,530
there is no expectant official surnamed Li.

367
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,660
Chancellor Gao,

368
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,010
we have exchanged messages

369
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,940
for some time now.

370
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,380
We've finally met today.

371
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,090
How long do you intend to keep acting?

372
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,250
Your wit is nearly unearthly.

373
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,620
Be careful, or you will not live long.

374
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,660
Xie Huai'an greets Chancellor Gao.

375
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,200
[Gao Yan]

376
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,620
Where...

377
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,730
where

378
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,810
did I give myself away?

379
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,660
Chancellor Gao,

380
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,330
you did not.

381
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,730
It is simply that I am

382
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,050
too cautious

383
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,610
by nature.

384
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,220
I do not overlook

385
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,050
a single word or sentence.

386
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,180
No need to panic, though.

387
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,050
Under the Dingtang Sword,

388
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,900
all who come lose their heads.

389
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,050
"Under the Dingtang Sword,

390
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,660
all who come lose their heads."

391
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,460
Were you an ordinary Imperial Academy expectant official,

392
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,620
how could you have

393
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,620
shown such pride when faced

394
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,460
with assassins?

395
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,420
The Marquis of Northguard, Gu Yu, recommended

396
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,290
the famed Han Ziling,

397
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,220
while I recommended you.

398
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,530
It seems my judgment was sound.

399
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,860
Han Ziling

400
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,490
only writes fine prose.

401
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,730
He is unlikely to survive

402
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,860
the Dingtang Sword.

403
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,980
You have accepted His Majesty's mission.

404
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,810
How should I assist you?

405
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,380
Chancellor Gao,

406
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,700
haven't you already done so?

407
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,330
How so?

408
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,390
Since there is no Academician Li,

409
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,910
why did that commander

410
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,470
address you as such?

411
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,330
Academician Li.

412
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,420
He is your man, isn't he?

413
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,010
If I require help in the future,

414
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,050
I will seek him out.

415
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,250
To find such a piece of uncut jade

416
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,860
in this freezing night

417
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,980
is worth the cold.

418
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,050
Han Ziling is already

419
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,700
one of the brightest minds in the realm,

420
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,980
yet His Majesty chose this Xie Huai'an.

421
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,620
His days

422
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,730
[Wumei]
are numbered.

423
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,730
We shall see.

424
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,700
After all,

425
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,140
he was chosen by Chancellor Gao,

426
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,940
and Chancellor Gao

427
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,420
has never misjudged a man.

428
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,200
[Buddha Temple]

429
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,940
Wan,

430
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,330
when you wake,

431
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,970
go to the ruined temple

432
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,510
east of the city.

433
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,440
Light the candle

434
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,180
before the Buddha statue,

435
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,570
and a Huben guard

436
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,810
will appear.

437
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,980
This temple

438
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,140
was ruined by war

439
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,380
and fell into this state.

440
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,500
[Qingyi of the Huben Army]

441
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,940
It used to be crowded with worshippers.

442
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,330
Those who came here

443
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,220
all said it was blessed.

444
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,770
You may as well make a wish.

445
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,250
Yang Xuan is dead.

446
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,770
You were his student.

447
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,620
Pray to the Bodhisattva

448
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,810
and the underworld

449
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,420
that he may suffer less

450
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,220
over there.

451
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,810
You've got a fiery temper.

452
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,290
But that's useless,

453
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,090
at least before a Huben guard.

454
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,770
You have never killed anyone, have you?

455
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,090
If not,

456
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,810
there is no need to draw

457
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,770
the dagger in your sleeve.

458
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,330
It cannot harm me.

459
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,010
You knew the Huben Army would come for you,

460
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,660
yet you still came as you were told.

461
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,330
Had you used this chance to flee,

462
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,940
wouldn't that have been better?

463
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,460
Chang'an is full

464
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,380
of Huben shadow guards.

465
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,290
I'd be caught before reaching

466
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,380
the city gate.

467
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,380
Rather than make a fool of myself,

468
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,380
I'd sooner vent my anger

469
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,050
before I die.

470
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,810
I never intended to kill you.

471
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,530
Yang Xuan was the Vice Minister of Revenue,

472
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,530
a third-rank official.

473
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,810
His death means something

474
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,810
to the Huben Army.

475
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,570
As for you,

476
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,940
you're but a lowly painter.

477
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,860
Even if you die in a roadside ditch,

478
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,090
who

479
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,290
will truly care?

480
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,050
Anyway, I invited you here

481
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,900
for a purpose.

482
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,420
You have no value,

483
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,290
but the one

484
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,980
who corresponded with you does.

485
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,290
I want you to tell me

486
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,140
how you

487
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,220
first met him.

488
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,420
We met by chance.

489
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,660
I cannot help you.

490
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,090
No matter.

491
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,050
Met by chance, huh?

492
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,010
I still have patience.

493
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,530
I know you work at the Painting Academy.

494
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,570
And I know

495
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,810
there is a Mr. Yu there

496
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,330
who treats you well.

497
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,120
I

498
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,660
give you two hours.

499
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,860
If you still say the same

500
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,420
after two hours,

501
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,570
the hands of the Huben Army

502
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,180
will reach for Mr. Yu.

503
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,220
This silver needle...

504
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,290
What a clumsy trick.

505
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,900
You have a long way to go.

506
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,700
Someone,

507
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,050
open the door!

508
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,140
Miss Bai Wan?

509
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,730
Is Mr. Yu here?

510
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,860
Master was about to rest.

511
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,530
Miss Bai Wan, why...?

512
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,460
I have urgent business with him.

513
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,860
A life is at stake. Forgive my intrusion!

514
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,050
Miss Bai Wan!

515
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,620
Mr. Yu,

516
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,140
forgive me for disturbing you so late,

517
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,420
but I must speak with you.

518
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,270
[Mr. Yu, chief painter of the Painting Academy]

519
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,570
Why did you come?

520
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,570
Why

521
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,420
did you

522
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,380
come?

523
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,340
If I hadn't,

524
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,490
would you have...?

525
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,300
The Huben guards said

526
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,420
that if you came tonight,

527
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,740
I would have to die.

528
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,050
Why did you come?

529
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,390
When the Huben Army tells you to do something,

530
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,460
you do it.

531
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,300
Why resist?

532
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,420
Sir!

533
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,280
Do not come closer!

534
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,170
I accept my fate.

535
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,010
Mr. Qingyi

536
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,940
asked me to bring you a message.

537
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,130
He said

538
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,610
that before the Huben Army,

539
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,940
one could only obey.

540
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,860
Mr. Yu's death

541
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,010
is the price of your defiance.

542
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,650
Greetings, Mr. Qingyi.

543
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,780
The world is in chaos.

544
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,340
Human lives are worth no more than weeds.

545
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,610
What value does that girl have

546
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,650
that Mr. Yu must die for her?

547
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,940
She knows the one

548
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,980
the entire Huben Army

549
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,130
has been hunting for more than a decade.

550
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,420
She wrote to him.

551
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,940
I once intercepted a messenger.

552
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,650
He killed himself,

553
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,650
and the trail went cold.

554
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,420
Only by killing Mr. Yu

555
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,490
could we frighten her.

556
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,090
Give her two days.

557
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,460
She will write to beg him for help,

558
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,690
and I will have a trail to follow.

559
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,610
Yan Fengshan refused to serve under your father,

560
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,260
so he led the entire Huben Army in rebellion.

561
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,210
The late emperor was too old

562
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,260
to hold him accountable.

563
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,170
He could only let Yan Fengshan's power grow.

564
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,980
Find the men I seek,

565
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,860
and I will avenge the Liu family.

566
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,050
Run!

567
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,610
Father!

568
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,690
Run!

569
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,130
I have returned.

570
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,540
[Ye Zheng]

571
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,340
What you instructed

572
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,740
is done.

573
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,010
Are you badly injured?

574
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,210
To fulfill the mission you assigned,

575
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,420
this is nothing.

576
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,210
Even losing half my life would have been

577
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,010
worth it.

578
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,780
Take this.

579
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,940
Where is he?

580
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,260
Inside.

581
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,140
