1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,332
For freedom

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,432
I would exchange a priceless treasure
for the sensor.

3
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,066
No replacement

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,399
You wouldn't even trade a precious treasure?

5
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,199
No replacement

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,066
What about those two items?

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:27,499
Two valuable items require one sensor that's incredibly cheap outside.

8
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:30,532
This is the highest price I can bear.

9
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,432
Humans, you should be content.

10
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,232
No replacement

11
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,999
Do you know this is a priceless treasure?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,099
How many treasures are there in the entire Ice Prison?

13
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,766
No replacement

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,932
If you cut off my hope of getting out...

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,466
I wouldn't mind cutting off your path to survival.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,999
Do you think I should kill you?

17
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:09,132
Even if you kill me, you won't get access to the sensor.

18
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,866
Besides, you can't kill me.

19
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,832
Okay, okay

20
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:29,799
In that case, I will exchange my most precious treasure with you.

21
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,066
A stone plaque

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,299
Look carefully

23
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:37,399
This is the Beast God Inheritance Token of the Ancestral God Cult, the number one power in the universe.

24
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,599
Beast God Inheritance Token
From the Ancestral God Cult

25
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:44,832
Ancestor religion

26
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,166
It was born at the very beginning of the universe.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,732
We do not vie for cosmic dominance,
nor do we interfere in conflicts.

28
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,499
Absorbing powerful beings from billions of races throughout the universe

29
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,166
However,
they completely adopted an elite strategy.

30
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,466
This resulted in the entire sect having only three or so powerful figures.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,666
The number of members of the Ancestral God Cult is extremely small.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,232
Yet it was able to surpass the six top clans and become the number one power.

33
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,632
The Beast God's Legacy is also known as the highest lineage within the sect.

34
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,266
This inheritance token

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,999
It is the key to your access to the highest lineage of the Ancestral God Cult.

36
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,899
I've thought it through.

37
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,732
make a deal

38
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:19,899
good

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,399
Give me the sensor first so I
can verify its functionality.

40
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,499
You want me

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,532
You've blocked VPNs
; how am I supposed to verify?

42
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,299
The inheritance order hasn't arrived yet.

43
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,632
If I let you connect to the virtual audit now...

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,132
You may send messages to your fellow tribesmen.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,099
Once you've achieved your goal, why would you give me the inheritance token?

46
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,932
You need to hand over the Inheritance Token to me first before I grant you access.

47
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,632
no

48
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,099
What if I give you the Beast God's Legacy and you escape?

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,166
The mighty Lord of the Southern Ice Prison is afraid I'll escape.

50
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,966
If you don't make a decision soon, I'm leaving.

51
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,599
A Beast God Inheritance Token

52
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,132
If you can never leave the ice prison

53
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,532
What's the use?

54
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:27,566
etc.

55
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,199
If you break your promise, I will definitely issue a bounty.

56
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:35,799
May all the powerful beings in the Ice Prison hunt you
down until you die.

57
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,099
Permissions have been granted.

58
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,899
Goodbye

59
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:47,299
The Beast God Inheritance Token will remain with you for a moment.

60
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,099
But it is ultimately a member of my Heavenly Ferocity Clan.

61
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,666
The deal appears to have been reached.

62
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,232
However, the value of the inheritance token is far higher than that of ordinary treasures.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,832
Sisava will not give up easily.

64
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,399
I need to prepare early

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,965
leader

66
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,932
I just received a message from my disciple, Sisawa.

67
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,466
He was imprisoned in the Ice Prison of the Wuhua Secret Realm.

68
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,466
In the absence of resources and guidance from strong individuals

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,066
He has now cultivated to the level of being invincible at the King level.

70
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,066
I want to save my disciple.

71
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:33,199
But facing the Green-Haired Bandit Venerable and the Purple-Haired Bandit Venerable...

72
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,599
Undeterred by the sacrifice of the Beast God's Inheritance Order

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,566
Just for a chance to send a message

74
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,632
Yes, leader.

75
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,132
Since he is an invincible king of my Heavenly Ferocity Clan

76
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,732
Then I'll go myself.

77
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,399
Chief, you go in person

78
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:45,966
this

79
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,932
Sisiva knew
he must be incredibly excited, grateful,
and honored.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,299
I haven't seen that purple cardamom for a long time.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,866
This is the ultimate treasure.

82
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,266
They are a different race

83
00:05:56,567 --> 00:06:01,432
Those who see the Heavenly Wolf Palace are seeing me in person; why do you not kneel to welcome me?

84
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,566
The Sirius Palace is hailed as the Sirius Clan's greatest treasure.

85
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:05,999
Could the person who came be...?

86
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:15,266
Lord Sirius, if you need anything, just call me.

87
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,266
Why oppress my people?

88
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:22,766
When I arrive, they will naturally prostrate themselves in reverence.

89
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:34,966
One member of my Sirius clan is imprisoned in your Ice Prison.

90
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:41,132
Release Sirius Clan member Sisawa and his followers immediately.

91
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:46,466
yes

92
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,899
arccotxv=-1±x2

93
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,999
We're out.

94
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,332
Chief

95
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:18,999
Thank you for saving me, Chief.

96
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:25,632
I'm also releasing one of the humans imprisoned in the Ice Prison; I want to take him with me.

97
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:27,799
Humans

98
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,832
No humans

99
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,766
You dare say no?

100
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,832
You've forgotten that my Mo Xia tribe just came out...

101
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,966
Of course I know there's a human inside.

102
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,166
No

103
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,899
Interesting

104
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,699
Who is this human?

105
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,632
It seems to have quite a history.

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,699
Could it be a super being from the human race?

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,266
We made an agreement with you.

108
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,666
So you'd rather defy me

109
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,632
Of course I'll sabotage what's good for the human race.

110
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:29,366
Hand over that human, or I'll have no choice but to take it.

111
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,432
Just release him.

112
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:45,832
good

113
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,099
Is Sbuwa

114
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,299
The person beside him must be the expert who helped him escape.

115
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,532
He seemed to be the embodiment of the laws of the universe.

116
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,966
Its power should have reached the level of the master of the universe.

117
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:14,866
When the leader arrived

118
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:16,966
Not only must the Beast God's Inheritance Token be returned to its rightful owner.

119
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,566
I'll have to pay with my life.

120
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,999
Human, I recognize you

121
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:30,132
Unexpectedly, a realm lord could rely on the aura of the supreme treasure, Zang Nuo.

122
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:31,566
Pretending to be immortal

123
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,866
My power of primordial laws failed me before that leader.

124
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,699
Your potential seems quite good.

125
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,999
Unfortunately, the faint spark of humanity's prodigy must be extinguished in time.

126
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:33,866
Qianbaohe

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,232
It is Qianbaohe

128
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,632
Chaos City Lord

129
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,666
Since you're here, why don't you show yourself?

130
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,166
Lord of Sirius

131
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:05,566
As the leader of a race, he inexplicably harbored murderous intentions towards my human descendants.

132
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,199
Isn't that a bit too arrogant?

133
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,366
this

134
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,766
It's the teacher's Qianbaohe clone.

135
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:14,866
Chaos City Lord

136
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,532
That human tricked me out of the Beast God's Inheritance Token

137
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,566
You actually want to protect him?

138
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:41,199
Leaving immediately will save your life, Wolf Keiko.

139
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,932
It seems that this Daohe King is indeed a junior you highly value.

140
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,899
I'll give you face today.

141
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,266
Thank you both for taking care of my human descendants for over two thousand years.

142
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,132
The Lord of Wolves only said it verbally.

143
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,732
In front of the teacher, they can only slink away in disgrace.

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,132
However, he was able to see through my identity as a realm lord at a glance.

145
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,566
Being seen through by him is ultimately a major hidden danger.

146
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,599
We need to take precautions early.

147
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,032
Just right

148
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:40,499
It's also somewhat related to the Beast God Inheritance Token you obtained.

149
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,166
I have something to discuss with you.

150
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:48,466
Teacher Er, the True King, also cultivates the Path of the Beast God.

151
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,166
There are actually quite a few powerful individuals who cultivate the Path of the Beast God.

152
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,232
The Seven Swords King is one of them.

153
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,166
Involving the Ancestral God Cult
Only the Beast God

154
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,599
One of the great secrets of the universe is usually kept secret.

155
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,732
Your affairs have never been made public.

156
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,799
The reason for bringing this up now

157
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,532
It's because the True King cultivates the Path of Beast God Fusion in the Warrior Space.

158
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,199
That perfectly matches the Beast God Inheritance Token I obtained.

159
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:16,066
The Seven Sword King received the Beast God Inheritance Token issued by his clan.

160
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,599
With your talent, you should be able to easily receive the gift.

161
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,666
But the true King Yan is different.

162
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,332
He's not as talented as you.

163
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,832
Not enough to enjoy the highest resources of the ethnic group

164
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,699
But if it were entirely up to him

165
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,399
This is probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

166
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:32,832
The teacher needs no further explanation.

167
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,732
I wish to bestow the Beast God Inheritance Token upon Teacher Zhenyan Wang.

168
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,466
You decided so quickly?

169
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:41,999
Have you thought it through?

170
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,366
As long as it can help the teacher

171
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,932
What's wrong with me making a little sacrifice?

172
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,599
You are grateful to your teacher

173
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,399
very good

174
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,732
The official announcement shall prevail.
