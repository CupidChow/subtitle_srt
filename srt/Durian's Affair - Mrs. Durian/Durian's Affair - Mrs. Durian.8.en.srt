(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,649
(Animals were filmed according to guidelines.)

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,709
You are now entering a state of hypnosis.

11
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,409
Okay. What do you see?

12
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,780
Tell me what you see.

13
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,159
(Episode 8)

14
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,459
- Are they awake? - Yes.

15
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,828
What do they eat?

16
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,099
Rice and side dishes.

17
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,030
Today, they ate porridge.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,399
- Are they ill? - No.

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,140
She made it for the chairwoman, but she didn't eat it.

20
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,510
There was a simple way.

21
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,180
Are you okay, ma'am?

22
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,569
What?

23
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,139
Look at me like you adore me.

24
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,409
- I will in the evening. - Now.

25
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,419
Why do you look so sexy today?

26
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm always sexy.

27
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,559
Don't flirt with others.

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,189
That's for people with time and energy.

29
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,629
Even when you do.

30
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,299
You're being cranky again.

31
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,439
I'm being cranky?

32
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,009
It's called love and affection.

33
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,439
I'm going to be late.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Ohyiji's watching.

35
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,270
Don't take it.

36
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,500
(Mr. Han)

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,900
It's Mr. Han.

38
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,810
Hello?

39
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:25,909
Right now?

40
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,110
How bad?

41
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,620
How much?

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Okay.

43
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Is it about Mother?

44
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,490
The phone is turned off.

45
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,000
Who did you call?

46
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,930
The director. His phone's turned off.

47
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,069
- His wife's number was... - Don't.

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,469
Don't call her.

49
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,979
- Hello? - There was a missed call.

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,679
The chairwoman...

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,750
Are you in an ambulance?

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,409
- Yes. - Why?

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,978
There was an accident.

54
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,079
Was she hurt?

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,750
Tell him it's not serious.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,460
Tell him not to inform his wife.

57
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,339
(Emergency Center)

58
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,040
Deung Myung.

59
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,899
Son?

60
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,269
Accidents really do happen in a split second.

61
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm so glad you weren't seriously hurt.

62
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,939
We won't know for a few more days.

63
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,810
You were born with good fortune.

64
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,250
Can I tell Mom?

65
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,850
I left without telling her.

66
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,378
She'll just worry.

67
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,089
She'll worry more if I don't call.

68
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,550
I have three missed calls.

69
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,389
So do I.

70
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,529
Tell her I need to rest.

71
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,699
Tell her she doesn't need to come.

72
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,999
She sprained a ligament in her neck.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,670
She sent us away so she could sleep.

74
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,810
I should've had the porridge.

75
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,040
Then I might have avoided the accident.

76
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,050
Porridge?

77
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,749
Du Ri An had made me millet porridge...

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,550
so I didn't leave on an empty stomach.

79
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,519
It would've taken five minutes to eat.

80
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,490
If I'd been delayed by five minutes,

81
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,759
I wouldn't have been there at that time.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Right.

83
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:36,829
Goodness. It was your luck that was dealt out today.

84
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,500
She made porridge to appease you.

85
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,209
That's not a good thing.

86
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,670
She's very sly,

87
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,540
and she pretends not to be.

88
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,250
She is hardworking.

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,410
It's just that her identity is a mystery.

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,319
- Did you hear about it? - About what?

91
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,119
Their fingerprints are not in the system.

92
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,689
The police ran them.

93
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,189
My gosh. How come?

94
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,359
Is that possible?

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,860
Who? Both of them?

96
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,430
Yes.

97
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,069
Ninety-seven,

98
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
ninety-eight,

99
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,639
ninety-nine, one hundred.

100
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,050
The housekeeper wants you to do this in the room.

101
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:28,889
Maybe they were kidnapped when they were young...

102
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,919
like you had said, Uncle.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,489
Weren't they lying when they said they had lost their memories?

104
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,328
They're not the kind of people to lie.

105
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,990
You barely know them.

106
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,159
Nothing is scarier than people.

107
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,899
Don't be so outright negative.

108
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,528
- You're defending them again. - I'm not.

109
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,300
It means they have no criminal records.

110
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,209
Could it be the truth?

111
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,439
The Joseon thing?

112
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,180
That seems impossible.

113
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,920
- Yes. - They were at a temple.

114
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,049
They cried and laughed like lunatics...

115
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,860
and prayed to the merciful Buddha.

116
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,790
They said the Buddhist prayer.

117
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,329
Was there a temple...

118
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,369
near our cottage?

119
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,568
It would more likely be a hermitage.

120
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,569
An unknown one.

121
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,638
It would've been simple if our cottage had security cameras.

122
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,869
We should install some even now.

123
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,938
Yes, Grandma.

124
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,439
It's not like we'd party with weird people.

125
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,980
If we take them in,

126
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,148
will their memories come back?

127
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,490
There is a way. Hypnosis.

128
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,590
Right?

129
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,059
Right.

130
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,860
Don't psychiatrists rely on that sometimes?

131
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,399
Learning is so much fun, Mother.

132
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,700
It is.

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,340
I must learn fast to speak with my husband.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,980
And then what?

135
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,649
I told you not to get distracted.

136
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,888
Okay.

137
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,019
He must already be betrothed.

138
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,690
Why would he not?

139
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,860
I will keep quiet...

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,929
and just watch from afar.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,629
Do not go back on your word.

142
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,899
It will be harder than you think.

143
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,419
You can go home.

144
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,849
Secretary Ha will be here soon.

145
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,089
Don't you feel more comfortable around me than her?

146
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,090
That's a given.

147
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,389
Take a nap.

148
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,230
I'll keep quiet.

149
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,600
I'll stay up at night if I nap now.

150
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,100
Did they get on your nerves?

151
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,840
Isn't that why you sent them to me?

152
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,639
The Joseon duo.

153
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,210
Well...

154
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,080
They just didn't feel right.

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,379
They are two unknown grown women.

156
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,789
Wouldn't they get on your nerves...

157
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,490
if you still had a husband?

158
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,330
Do you think I'm cold-hearted?

159
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,399
No, I know what you mean.

160
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,200
But...

161
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,470
they're more calm and polite than I thought.

162
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,909
From what I saw...

163
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:42,179
We'll find out in time whether they really aren't sound...

164
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,149
or just pretending.

165
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,758
I won't say this because he's my son,

166
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,299
but your husband really is a one-of-a-kind...

167
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,340
They actually packed food during their lunchtime?

168
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,679
Yes.

169
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,408
Are you all right, ma'am?

170
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,309
We should hope so.

171
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,449
Your first daughter-in-law is here.

172
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,679
Deung Myung's mom?

173
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,919
Yes.

174
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,919
Why is she still here?

175
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,190
Is she that reluctant to leave?

176
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,000
My daughters-in-law are so sweet.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can go home.

178
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't worry. I have my kids.

179
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,909
Okay, then. Goodbye.

180
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,179
This is insane.

181
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,850
Where are you going?

182
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,048
I can't ignore her now.

183
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,259
Darn it. I told her not to come.

184
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,159
Tell her to go home and that I'm asleep.

185
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,779
She's not here. She must've gone.

186
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,120
She does this to annoy me.

187
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,330
It's your first meal of the day. You must be so hungry.

188
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,830
You even went swimming.

189
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,769
I feel a bit hungry now.

190
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,639
- Would you like me to heat it up? - No.

191
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,299
I don't want it too hot.

192
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,249
I'll be in the lounge.

193
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,210
Tell Mother she can call on me at any time.

194
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,059
The writing's too small. I can't read it.

195
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,230
Se Mi said she'd be in the lounge...

196
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,000
and that you can call her at any time.

197
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,730
What's wrong with her?

198
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,299
Tell her to go home...

199
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,440
and to stop annoying me.

200
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,269
Would she listen to me?

201
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,539
She can be quite stubborn.

202
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,950
Call Chi Kang.

203
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,609
Mr. Dan told me to get you...

204
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,620
for dinner.

205
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,719
You should go, then.

206
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,419
He'll treat you to something nice.

207
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,940
Do you like what you see?

208
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,209
Do you want to dress like that?

209
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,039
No. I would not dare.

210
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,320
I do not believe it.

211
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,149
Are they in their right minds?

212
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,549
They are worse than petticoats.

213
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,889
- Do you have a reservation? - Mr. Dan Chi Jung.

214
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,559
Oh, yes. Follow me.

215
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,990
Mr. Dan will be here soon.

216
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,730
This must be like a tavern.

217
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,970
Do you think he called Eon as well?

218
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,529
I wonder.

219
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,470
I wish...

220
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,480
Go on.

221
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,549
I wish I could cook him a hot meal.

222
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,379
Just once.

223
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,279
You will get to.

224
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,190
We are staying with his grandmother, so there will be a chance.

225
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,860
I wonder if he likes the same food.

226
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,759
Whatever you make...

227
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,070
Please sit.

228
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,350
The wine list.

229
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,190
I'll bring it right away.

230
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,489
Have the manager bring my usual Pinot noir.

231
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,490
Yes, sir.

232
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:58,500
- Bring us the tasting course. - Yes, sir.

233
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,570
My mother was in a mild fender bender.

234
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,970
A car accident. She's in the hospital.

235
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,769
"Hospital?"

236
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,580
Is that where physicians tend to people?

237
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,610
Who is it?

238
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,409
Is the chairwoman home?

239
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,179
I'm Director Ju Nam, Deung Myung's maternal uncle.

240
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,389
I see.

241
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,129
Thank you.

242
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
I heard...

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,830
two women were staying here.

244
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,138
I came by to see the chairwoman and to meet them too.

245
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,399
They went out.

246
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,340
Both of them?

247
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:42,809
Yes.

248
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,908
She was very fortunate.

249
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,909
Yes.

250
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
The waiter will pour you some wine.

251
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,289
Ladies first.

252
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,789
Women always come first.

253
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,559
They filled your water glasses first too.

254
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,000
As they pour, it's good manners to hold the glass like this.

255
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,799
It's polite.

256
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,079
Will you be all right?

257
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,759
Look at me.

258
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,359
Do you not want to see your husband's face?

259
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,470
Instead of food,

260
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,700
I wish for your praise.

261
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,839
Do you have none?

262
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,880
None at all?

263
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,019
You are...

264
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,190
an honest, upright man.

265
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,029
That is a praise of sorts.

266
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,000
My cup is empty.

267
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,440
Is that it?

268
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,680
Today, I wish to call you "darling."

269
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,119
My darling. Have a drink too while listening to my praise.

270
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,920
I think this every day when I see you.

271
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,759
You are so beautiful.

272
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,259
Your eyes.

273
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,029
Your nose.

274
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,799
Your lips too.

275
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,239
Everything about you is flawless...

276
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,740
as if you are a doll made by deities.

277
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,670
You are making me blush.

278
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,509
I am telling you the truth.

279
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,750
Are you only going to eat and not drink?

280
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,479
But if Mother finds out...

281
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,390
She is already asleep.

282
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,990
She falls asleep the moment her head touches the pillow.

283
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,430
Finish it.

284
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,980
Would you like another?

285
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
No.

286
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:40,220
I wish to drink tonight.

287
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,359
As your husband,

288
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,289
I need your acknowledgement and praise.

289
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,200
You have the kind of face that I wish to draw.

290
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,609
You are incredibly affectionate.

291
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,410
You have such beautiful, deep eyes.

292
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,079
You stay still whilst asleep as a nobleman should.

293
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,630
You have such slender hands.

294
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,979
They are the typical hands of a scholar.

295
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,839
My fluid is clear as water.

296
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,220
What do you mean?

297
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,690
My semen...

298
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,859
is watery.

299
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,390
It is like water.

300
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,069
I did not know.

301
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,579
I did not intentionally hide it from you to marry you.

302
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,420
If Mother finds out...

303
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,759
I do not know how to tell her.

304
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,359
I cannot produce an heir.

305
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,630
It is truly awful.

306
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,940
How will I face my ancestors?

307
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,619
Enjoy.

308
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,220
Thank you.

309
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:58,819
Cheers.

310
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,099
It sounds nice, doesn't it?

311
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,170
Yes.

312
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,250
You may drink.

313
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,619
"You may drink."

314
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,619
The way you talk is refreshing.

315
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,589
How does it taste?

316
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,089
- It is just... - Is it not bitter for you?

317
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,430
It just tastes like liquor. That is all I taste.

318
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,069
What about you, Ms. Ri An?

319
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,299
The same. That is how it tastes to me too.

320
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,009
Is he still infertile?

321
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,519
Why are you not married yet?

322
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,960
I apologize.

323
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,690
It is good to be interested and curious about someone.

324
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:13,599
I am getting married soon.

325
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,298
My fiancée was supposed to visit tomorrow,

326
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,400
but it's been moved to next week.

327
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,500
We should wait until my mother comes home.

328
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,710
Eat it with your hand.

329
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,910
I heard you made porridge for the chairwoman earlier today.

330
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,309
Millet porridge.

331
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,349
But she did not eat it.

332
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,980
It doesn't matter.

333
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,220
It's the thought that counts.

334
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,690
She's grateful, even though she didn't eat it.

335
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,900
Hold the knife in your right hand and the fork in your left hand.

336
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,440
Cut it into bite-sized pieces.

337
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,649
I heard you mainly ate rice.

338
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,089
Eat meat once in a while too. It's good for you.

339
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,170
How could beef be so tender?

340
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,838
Dear Buddha. Dear deities.

341
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,509
What is this I am eating? Is this truly beef?

342
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,750
I cannot believe it.

343
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,160
Wine is good for you.

344
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,059
I heard it was important for women to always keep warm.

345
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,700
This warms you up.

346
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,680
Have you told the housekeeper that you'd take her out for jajangmyeon?

347
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,450
I have not had the chance to.

348
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,680
What did you do with the money?

349
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,849
I am holding on to it.

350
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,459
What did you learn today? I heard the tutor had come by.

351
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,519
We learned about numbers.

352
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,759
You can't even count?

353
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,240
We learned how to do it today.

354
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,039
Try to remember what happened.

355
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,339
Can you really not recall any bad memories?

356
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,950
Let me tell you this.

357
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,420
Don't tell others that you're from Joseon.

358
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,880
No one would believe you.

359
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,890
I mean, it's just absurd.

360
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,160
And you should change your style first.

361
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,559
Your clothes.

362
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,559
Shall I take you shopping?

363
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,399
I am much obliged to you for your kind words.

364
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,470
Gosh, seriously.

365
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,900
Don't use such old expressions. You really are confusing me.

366
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,309
When you do this, I wonder if you're really from Joseon.

367
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,180
Anyway, tomorrow...

368
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,549
Gosh, I should just turn it off.

369
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,049
(Chi Gam)

370
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,430
Hey, Chi Gam.

371
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,829
Are you calling a hypnotist?

372
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,460
We should go to the center tomorrow.

373
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,630
Text me the address and time.

374
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,299
You're coming too?

375
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,740
- Yes. - Okay.

376
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,519
From now on, just call me by my first name.

377
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,519
I'm on a first-name basis with most of my younger female friends.

378
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,799
Who will go first?

379
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,769
You won't call my name, ever? Do you think you'll never need to?

380
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,440
Perhaps, with time...

381
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,348
(Woo Mi)

382
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,420
Hey, Chi Jung.

383
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,018
Are you home?

384
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,220
You're asking that question again? I told you I got home earlier.

385
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,250
You don't care about me.

386
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,819
I was worried you'd be out and about again at this late hour.

387
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,389
I'm not a party animal.

388
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,430
All right.

389
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,758
- Are you at the hospital? - No, I'm having dinner.

390
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,630
Is your mother really okay?

391
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:51,568
Yes, if there are no post-accident complications.

392
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:53,740
She must not skip her rehabilitation therapy sessions.

393
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,440
- I know. - Who are you having dinner with?

394
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,279
- My family. - All right.

395
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,420
You become a family when you live under the same roof.

396
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,619
That was my fiancée.

397
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,660
I am sorry.

398
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
The ladies' room?

399
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,399
Could you take her to the ladies' room?

400
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,470
Yes, sir.

401
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,650
Only one person can enter at a time.

402
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,650
And your tea will get cold.

403
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,700
Let me...

404
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,170
When will you relax around me?

405
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,670
I'm not the type to make others feel uncomfortable.

406
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,650
With time?

407
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,990
Hello?

408
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,390
It's been a while, Reporter Kang.

409
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,130
He said the man who'd marry me was such a lucky guy.

410
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,258
That's...

411
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,430
It means that he has no interest in marrying me whatsoever.

412
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,268
I'm just a close friend he's known for years.

413
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:32,639
No, that's not true.

414
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,868
It means he thinks he'll be happy to be your husband.

415
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,709
Whatever. I can't figure him out.

416
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,379
His parents are close to us too,

417
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,179
so he wants to be courteous and polite.

418
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,479
He doesn't want to mistreat you in any way.

419
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,319
He had a good upbringing in a great family.

420
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,018
It's not like our family lacks anything.

421
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,989
When your father brought it up yesterday,

422
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,288
Mr. Dan also said it wouldn't be bad to get married young.

423
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:56,059
He said there were more pros than cons.

424
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,230
It'll happen before the end of the year. Wait and see.

425
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:01,529
Don't sulk when he calls you.

426
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,798
Being petty-minded and sulking often...

427
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,670
will tire men out.

428
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,500
Play a sweet wife, his big sister,

429
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,869
a good friend he can talk to, and his little sister at times.

430
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,740
You know what I mean. Right, my smarty-pants?

431
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,180
No, I don't know. It's hard.

432
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,318
And try to cut down on coffee.

433
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,289
Isn't it a hassle to go to the restroom so often?

434
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,220
Hello. Your uncle is in the room.

435
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,990
Which uncle?

436
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,660
Aren't you meeting your uncle?

437
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:31,930
Mr. Ji Won Jong.

438
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,400
Which uncle is here?

439
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,670
Bidang Country Club.

440
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,200
I see.

441
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:41,170
This way, please.

442
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,839
- Let me wash my hands first. - Sure.

443
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,989
My gosh.

444
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,549
Does she think she's in Seochon now? What's with the hanbok?

445
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,569
Do you know her?

446
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,049
- Hello. - Hello.

447
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,589
We met briefly in the parking lot at his place on Sunday.

448
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,519
Where's her table? Do we need to take her to the car?

449
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,950
Who is she?

450
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,329
I'll arrange a meeting with the managing editor soon.

451
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:45,859
Okay.

452
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,410
You must know what "fate" means.

453
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:01,009
- Yes. - Do you believe in fate?

454
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,180
To be honest,

455
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,819
I am not sure.

456
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,119
In my opinion, you, Ms. Du Ri An...

457
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,119
Will you use that name for your resident registration card too?

458
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,360
We'll be your guardians, your guarantors.

459
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,428
Right.

460
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,428
Hurry up and learn some useful skills...

461
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,929
so you can win my mother over.

462
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,829
You're not destined to do housework.

463
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,539
You have the face to be an actress.

464
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,440
My family owns DTV, you know.

465
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,210
Oh, I said I'd talk casually.

466
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,678
In any case, if you impress the chairwoman,

467
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,710
you might be able to get a role in a period drama.

468
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,979
You already made your acting début yesterday,

469
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,019
albeit as an extra.

470
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,420
You wouldn't even need to "act" in a period drama.

471
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,190
Just keep this up and memorize your lines.

472
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,130
- Did she drink? - Just some wine.

473
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:56,829
So Jeo.

474
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,469
Wake up.

475
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,869
What happened?

476
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,269
She fainted in front of the restroom.

477
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,579
- Hello. - Hi.

478
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,980
Get the car ready.

479
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,489
Settle up quickly and bring the car around.

480
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,440
- See you around. - See you.

481
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,710
Follow that car.

482
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,940
That was Ayla, the announcer, right?

483
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,980
You were checking her out after everything?

484
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,579
It's not my problem.

485
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,550
It's not just anyone. It's Ayla.

486
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,750
What's the deal with them?

487
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,489
Is she dating Dan Deung Myung?

488
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,650
Just focus on driving.

489
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,289
So Jeo, wake up.

490
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,860
You're a woman. How embarrassing.

491
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,230
She has a low tolerance for alcohol. The wine wasn't that strong.

492
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,300
Honey...

493
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,300
"Honey?"

494
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,909
Is she really a married woman from Joseon?

495
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,280
Who was that?

496
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Oh, them?

497
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,049
They're staying at my grandmother's house.

498
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,110
Are they your relatives?

499
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,320
- No. - Then why?

500
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
What do you mean?

501
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,219
Your dining companion must be waiting for you.

502
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,860
I came here with my mom.

503
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,960
(Ji Won Jong: Where are you?)

504
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,929
I'm meeting someone here.

505
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:09,900
I'll call you.

506
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,670
Yes. I've arrived.

507
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,340
Already?

508
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,139
Are you in the room?

509
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:20,940
Did you go number two?

510
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:25,649
You should use the restroom at home, not at a place like this.

511
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,019
Unbelievable.

512
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,650
What is it?

513
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,860
I can feel things are working in our favour.

514
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,230
Don't you agree?

515
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,989
I agree.

516
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:12,860
You again...

517
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,699
Why didn't you go home?

518
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,928
How could I go home when you're in this state?

519
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:18,969
What about Ms. Kim?

520
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,099
I told her to go home.

521
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,809
Call a caregiver.

522
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,539
- At this hour? - Then call my housekeeper.

523
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,078
I'll stay with you.

524
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,679
You're being unreasonably stubborn.

525
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:39,419
Just don't mind me, and relax.

526
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,059
It's not because I mind you.

527
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,429
I hate you.

528
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,900
Leave. Call your husband to come.

529
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,170
Is there a security camera?

530
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,738
What if someone saw us?

531
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,670
Why would there be a security camera in a hospital room?

532
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:57,269
Besides, what if people saw us like this?

533
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:00,238
There's nothing wrong with giving my mother-in-law a foot massage.

534
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,510
Is that the only thing you did?

535
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Yes.

536
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,179
I find everything about you lovable.

537
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,650
Even your feet are cute.

538
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,090
I can't believe you were massaging my feet. Seriously.

539
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:12,459
My love and respect...

540
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,360
I don't have the energy to argue with you.

541
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,989
Leave already.

542
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,260
Mother.

543
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,299
Won't you rely on me and make things easier on yourself?

544
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,029
I have other people to rely on.

545
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,598
Once Chi Jung gets married,

546
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,839
I'll be the only one who takes care of you excluding the hired help.

547
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,539
- I have Eun Sung. - Does she love me as much as I do?

548
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:31,839
I'm the only one...

549
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,738
who truly cares and loves you from the bottom of their heart.

550
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,449
But you have an ulterior motive.

551
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,849
Ask anyone on the street...

552
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:41,348
if they think that's normal.

553
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,949
Normal or not,

554
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,989
please know that I'm the only one who sincerely cares about you.

555
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,130
Of course, Chi Kang and Deung Myung love you.

556
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,500
But they don't know the first thing about taking care of you.

557
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,829
Besides, they're too busy to look after you.

558
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,269
Anyway, stop getting on my nerves.

559
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,809
Okay.

560
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,579
I'll make things easier for you. Please don't kick me out.

561
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,880
You must have been shocked.

562
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,719
I could feel my heart sink when I heard the news.

563
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,619
I thanked the deity that your injury was not serious.

564
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:20,760
I also prayed that I wanted to get injured in your place next time.

565
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,489
I'm serious.

566
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:26,900
It's not just flattery.

567
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,239
So Jeo.

568
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,879
- You can carry her, right? - Yes.

569
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Hello.

570
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,719
I'm Ju Nam, the director of the drama, "Master Jung."

571
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,820
This is my assistant director.

572
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,059
I see. I heard a lot about you.

573
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,499
I'm not sure if Deung Myung told you,

574
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,170
but I wanted to talk to her regarding work.

575
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,269
So I followed your car from the restaurant.

576
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,839
Mr. Dan is here.

577
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,639
I see. But...

578
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,439
- as you can see... - Put her on your back or carry her.

579
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
No. Mr. Cho will do that.

580
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,549
I was meaning to say hello to you...

581
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,079
through Deung Myung and Se Mi.

582
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,650
Right. We are in-laws, aren't we?

583
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,400
Thank you.

584
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,159
Don't mention it.

585
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,119
(Timeslip)

586
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,230
(Timeslip)

587
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,459
Deung Myung's love interest?

588
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,369
Yes. After seeing her today, I still think she's perfect for it.

589
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,269
- Right? - Yes.

590
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,510
But I'm not sure if you've heard...

591
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:20,110
Wait. When were you born? Are you...

592
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,578
From what I know, you're a year older than me.

593
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:22,649
Please speak casually to me.

594
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,979
Gosh, but you're my in-law.

595
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,349
I heard roughly about the ladies through Deung Myung and Se Mi.

596
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,980
Can I make the offer to Ms. Kim So Jeo tomorrow?

597
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,359
What did Deung Myung say? He doesn't mind that?

598
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,388
Well, it's my responsibility to shape her for the role.

599
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,630
But still. She must at least know some basics.

600
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,759
I think she'll barely be able to read picture books.

601
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,329
I'll talk to her first and then decide.

602
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,670
Anyway, it'd be good for you if things worked out for her, right?

603
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:46,999
Right.

604
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,639
I need your support too, sir.

605
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:49,808
Well...

606
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,610
Please help her say yes and encourage her.

607
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,880
I have faith that he will make this work for her.

608
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,610
I'm Yoo Ro.

609
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,619
She's perfect for Choi Yi Young.

610
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,920
I bet she has a nice voice too, given her looks.

611
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,019
Right. I didn't hear her voice.

612
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,189
I hope her voice isn't a turn off.

613
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,730
We can help her change her vocalization if we need to.

614
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,658
That's not that easy.

615
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,159
And to do that, it will take time.

616
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,280
Ohyiji, what do you think?

617
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,380
I look sexy, right?

618
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,139
Apply only the toner. Your lotion has a strong smell.

619
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,070
Okay.

620
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,630
Again?

621
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:32,070
(Mother)

622
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:37,809
Yes, Mother.

623
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,579
Why are you still up?

624
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,980
Come to the hospital.

625
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,150
- Pardon? - Se Mi...

626
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,590
is making me uncomfortable.

627
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:48,659
Se Mi must have gone to you.

628
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,260
But she's not welcome here.

629
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:51,889
Hurry here.

630
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Okay?

631
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:58,969
Okay.

632
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,340
Tell her that you'll stay here. Make it happen no matter what.

633
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:02,739
Okay.

634
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,349
She wants me to come because Se Mi is making her uncomfortable.

635
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,820
She could have just called a caregiver.

636
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,550
She's not in critical condition.

637
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,919
Having a stranger around would be uncomfortable for Mother.

638
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,928
But still.

639
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,759
Se Mi went there when no one asked her.

640
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,030
That's because...

641
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,900
Should I go?

642
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,639
Seriously?

643
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,269
She called her daughter-in-law, not her son.

644
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:43,150
She doesn't mind her daughter-in-law not having a good night's sleep.

645
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,889
What are you looking for?

646
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,989
I want to make some honey water.

647
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,730
Ma'am.

648
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,530
I think the housekeeper is washing up.

649
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,239
I did not see it in there.

650
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,539
Would you like one?

651
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,469
I am all right.

652
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,420
Remember the director from earlier?

653
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,519
He wants to cast So Jeo for a role in his upcoming drama.

654
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,119
He wants her to be an actress in it. She'll have the lead role too.

655
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,059
She'll be Deung Myung's love interest.

656
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,959
It's beyond a good chance.

657
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,300
If this works out, she will be Cinderella overnight.

658
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,000
Do you not know "Cinderella?"

659
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,099
She will be a princess.

660
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,769
You know what it's like since you tried it out two days ago.

661
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:46,880
We call these people stars.

662
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,809
Like stars in the sky.

663
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,408
People can only look up to gaze at the stars.

664
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,218
They can neither touch nor take the stars.

665
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:55,079
She'll be a star just like Deung Myung...

666
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,650
as long as the viewers like her.

667
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,590
Is that true?

668
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:02,219
I cannot believe it.

669
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,928
The director plans to come here tomorrow and tell her himself.

670
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,130
Of course, the writer has to approve of it...

671
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,760
and sign off on it too.

672
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,400
But the director thinks she's perfect for this role.

673
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,969
Besides, DTV is producing the drama.

674
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,139
Perhaps, this might be possible.

675
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,269
Then it will be incredible.

676
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,349
Do you have honey here?

677
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:41,159
As I told you over the meal, I thought it would be you.

678
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,030
But So Jeo got the offer first.

679
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:44,928
If this works out and the drama becomes a hit,

680
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,739
she will become rich and famous at the same time.

681
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,968
Is being an actress considered that great of an accomplishment?

682
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,110
Of course.

683
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,210
But both of you need to exercise.

684
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,280
If you don't exercise,

685
00:47:58,281 --> 00:47:59,880
your posture will get messed up as you age.

686
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,179
You're fine for now.

687
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,189
Why do you think my mom doesn't indulge herself with sleeping in...

688
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,420
and goes swimming on an empty stomach at dawn?

689
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,690
To stay in shape and healthy.

690
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,889
Once you lose health, you've lost all.

691
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,059
That's why I exercise every day.

692
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:22,269
He perpetually obsesses over health.

693
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,199
These are my mother's.

694
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,109
What if she gets angry?

695
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,940
Why would she get angry? She's got many clothes.

696
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,379
Let's start tomorrow morning.

697
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,650
We have an exercise room.

698
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:06,050
To be an actress, working out is crucial.

699
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,489
Feel it. It's hard.

700
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,389
I don't have a protruding belly either.

701
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,989
I'll stay here. You should go back home, Se Mi.

702
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,199
Why didn't you call me?

703
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,170
I heard you were here this morning.

704
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,480
Are you trying to make me look like an awful daughter-in-law?

705
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,219
No.

706
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,589
I just assumed that you would know.

707
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,849
I was left out and never got the news.

708
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,050
How would I have known?

709
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,590
Why are you looking at her?

710
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,460
I had been nothing but understanding with you.

711
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:54,730
But how dare you look down on me?

712
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,300
And belittle me?

713
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:59,030
- Gosh, no. - That's exactly what you did.

714
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,299
When our mother-in-law gets sick or injured,

715
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,309
you and I ought to discuss and take care of her.

716
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:04,940
Am I wrong?

717
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,840
No.

718
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,750
I'm sorry.

719
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,319
I just thought Chi Kang would have told you.

720
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,420
Forget it.

721
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,889
Go back home.

722
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,489
Just bring her breakfast tomorrow.

723
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:27,030
Anyway, now that she's here...

724
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:29,558
But I'm here too.

725
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,468
Then why don't you go and sleep at your house tonight?

726
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:32,799
Bring me breakfast.

727
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,440
I can't stomach hospital food.

728
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,070
You're a good cook.

729
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:37,440
I'll go home in the morning,

730
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,170
make breakfast, and bring it to the hospital.

731
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,420
Ms. Jang Se Mi.

732
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,518
Se Mi, I wish you love your mother-in-law for a long time.

733
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:54,760
May it be unwavering too.

734
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:58,190
If you don't exercise, your buttocks will sag.

735
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:01,229
Even if you're old, as long as you have a nice body,

736
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,699
not only will other people find you attractive,

737
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,130
but clothes will also look great on you.

738
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,170
See you at 6:30am.

739
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,460
(Best Deung)

740
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,929
- Hey. - It's pretty late, isn't it?

741
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,039
You were still at dinner?

742
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,170
We just said goodbye for the night.

743
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:46,840
I bet you had drinks.

744
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:49,579
A few.

745
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,110
You know,

746
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,619
there's never been anyone but you, Ayla.

747
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,590
What about you?

748
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,059
Same here.

749
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,559
I can only tell you this now.

750
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,500
But I was worried when you started college.

751
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,340
I was worried that you might go on blind dates...

752
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,409
and date other guys.

753
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,750
So there really hadn't been anyone you really liked?

754
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:29,280
They were all boring.

755
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:31,889
You might find me more boring than those guys.

756
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,130
Does this silence mean you agree?

757
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,860
I can't say what we have is boring or interesting.

758
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:45,170
We have a special relationship.

759
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,300
Our parents are close too.

760
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,909
I met you for the first time when I was seven.

761
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,980
It's almost been 20 years.

762
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,849
You must be sick of me by now.

763
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,949
How could I be? I rarely got to see you.

764
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,119
I don't think I saw you more than ten times when I was in high school.

765
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,829
Ayla.

766
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:16,500
Ayla.

767
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,670
Yes.

768
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,340
I'm comfortable when I'm around you.

769
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:29,679
It was when you were in sixth grade.

770
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,750
I was nine back then.

771
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:34,948
Do you remember how both of our families...

772
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,690
got together at your cottage in Gangneung?

773
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:38,989
Yes.

774
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:43,260
You, your tutor, and I rode the bicycles along the beach.

775
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:46,329
I fell, and the toenail on my big toe got lifted.

776
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,630
Remember what you did?

777
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,440
You pulled out a few strands of hair that came down to your waist,

778
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,309
wrapped my toe with tissue, and tied it up with your hair.

779
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,440
At that moment,

780
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:05,980
I decided to marry you.

781
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,590
What's your answer?

782
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,329
You're like my younger brother.

783
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,699
I need to marry a man.

784
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,300
We need to change how we call each other from now on.

785
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,869
But are honorifics important?

786
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,170
You don't feel like a man.

787
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:33,840
Okay.

788
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:36,750
Goodnight.

789
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,079
Who was the girl in the hanbok?

790
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,750
They're staying with Grandma for the time being.

791
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:47,360
They?

792
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,260
You saw her mother-in-law.

793
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,099
But Director Ju Nam was also there.

794
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:55,699
Why did you hold her?

795
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:57,369
I didn't hold her.

796
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:59,699
She fell toward me.

797
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,369
The atmosphere was a bit strange.

798
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,679
Those guests have nothing to do with me.

799
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,679
Okay.

800
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,619
Are you available for dinner on Friday?

801
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:18,349
Saturday.

802
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,820
I'll make a reservation and text you.

803
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,389
Okay.

804
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,059
You should hang up first.

805
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,860
You'll go back home right away, right?

806
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Yes.

807
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:38,309
Ring

808
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,139
I'm your woman

809
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,150
(Timeslip movie)

810
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,050
Ohyiji.

811
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,989
It's Ohyiji's mom.

812
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:57,690
Look here.

813
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,928
Only people around my age...

814
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:02,199
or close friends can call me Ohjiyi's mom.

815
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,570
Yes, ma'am.

816
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,509
She's older than you.

817
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,110
I pay her.

818
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,809
She should be polite and formal to her employer.

819
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,908
If we're too friendly and tolerate things like that,

820
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,210
she'll cross the line.

821
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,739
Are you having difficulty sleeping?

822
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,469
Should I massage your head?

823
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:22,110
Getting your head massaged makes you sleepy.

824
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:23,909
It's fine.

825
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:28,550
I told you it was fine. I haven't even washed my hair.

826
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,559
Your hair smells fine.

827
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,558
It has a subtle scent.

828
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:41,860
How annoying. You're making me less sleepy.

829
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:45,230
Just close your eyes and enjoy.

830
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,170
What am I supposed to be enjoying?

831
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,469
This feeling.

832
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,539
It'll make you sleepy.

833
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,679
You have a lot of hair.

834
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,250
You also have a nicely shaped head.

835
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,880
It's nice and round.

836
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,190
Is this thing...

837
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:08,489
my daughter-in-law or a big source of trouble?

838
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:10,389
Or is she a psychopath?

839
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,530
But...

840
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,940
it does feel amazing.

841
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:26,940
Get married. There's no need to drag it out.

842
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,178
You're young and very popular.

843
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,949
You must be facing a lot of temptation from all around.

844
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,980
You might accidentally end up with the wrong person.

845
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:35,750
There's no one better than Ayla.

846
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,719
Okay.

847
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,260
Getting married will make you feel stable in many ways.

848
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,599
If you have kids early, you'll be comfortable at an old age.

849
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,900
I guess you'll still be considered middle-aged these days.

850
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:54,369
Ayla will turn 30 next year.

851
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:57,808
Yes. Does Mom agree?

852
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:00,480
Your mom also said you should do it soon if you were going to.

853
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:04,408
I saw Ayla was picked as the top wife material.

854
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:05,579
I saw it on the Internet.

855
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,820
- Yes. - You two look good together.

856
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,750
The only bad thing is her age.

857
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,760
Although dating older women are trendy nowadays...

858
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:16,260
and people don't age like they used to anymore.

859
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,750
You should wake up now.

860
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,690
Are you okay?

861
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,030
It is honey water.

862
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,109
I am deeply ashamed, Mother.

863
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,439
Drinking like that without me there...

864
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,650
could get you in big trouble.

865
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,380
Wear this.

866
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:22,289
The reason all women seem young and toned...

867
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,690
is because of exercise.

868
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,230
You move your body.

869
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,760
I spent all night making this.

870
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,800
How can we wear that?

871
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,109
We cannot show our bare skin.

872
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,440
But this won't work.

873
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:40,880
How can you exercise dressed like that?

874
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,679
- I can. - Me too.

875
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:49,420
If it is impossible,

876
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:51,949
we will go upstairs.

877
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:54,559
Nothing is impossible.

878
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,260
Let's try.

879
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:58,759
Stretching. Pull on your neck first.

880
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,260
That's 2 and 3. Other side.

881
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,868
Hold it and pull it to this side.

882
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,198
One, two.

883
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,699
Bend down like this.

884
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,070
Hold it and stretch your waist.

885
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,868
Stretch to the side.

886
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,169
Two, three.

887
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,808
This exercise will keep your butt and thighs toned.

888
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:18,449
Arms like this. Bend down.

889
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,750
Roll the ball down. There you go.

890
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,190
Okay. There you go.

891
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:42,300
Breathing is important.

892
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:44,408
Your shoulders keep moving with it.

893
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,440
Here.

894
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,449
I'll be right back, Mother.

895
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,749
Do you have to pee?

896
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,159
I went early in the morning.

897
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,229
You should've woken me up. You could've gotten hurt.

898
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:05,828
I didn't injure my leg, you know.

899
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:07,030
But still.

900
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,029
Should I heat up some water?

901
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,130
I'm fine.

902
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,509
How nice would it be for her to act like that...

903
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,710
purely as my daughter-in-law?

904
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:36,190
Goodness!

905
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:55,409
My body feels so refreshed, Mother.

906
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:56,610
It does.

907
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,510
My legs look more toned.

908
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,279
We should quickly wash up.

909
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,320
Yes, Mother.

910
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:08,820
It feels hard, Mother. Goodness.

911
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:11,429
Right, Mother?

912
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,159
I am not sure.

913
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:14,929
I cannot really tell.

914
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,030
Feel my buttocks.

915
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,300
Is that indecent?

916
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:25,139
Sorry, Mother. That was rude of me.

917
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,829
You have not eaten.

918
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:54,238
I'm going to eat at the hospital.

919
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:56,769
Eating with me will make bland hospital food taste better.

920
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:04,348
You need to get a quick consultation at lunchtime,

921
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:05,579
so come with Ms. Ma.

922
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,190
Have a good day.

923
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,199
Really, Mother?

924
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:25,630
Yes.

925
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,069
I have to do it.

926
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,739
They still need to get the writer's approval.

927
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,510
I will leave it to luck. If it works out, I will do my best.

928
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,409
I have already done it before.

929
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,210
And with Eon...

930
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,599
What is wrong, Mother?

931
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,630
I will tell you later after we eat.

932
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:08,480
It's squid jjigae.

933
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,238
You like it, right?

934
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,679
You know I like it.

935
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,809
Why only now?

936
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,519
Why aren't you answering?

937
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:25,260
I explained everything.

938
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,399
Please eat.

939
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,198
I have a friend whose in-laws are from Yeonggwang,

940
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:30,769
so I got you nice dried yellow corvina.

941
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,230
They're not big, though.

942
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:45,309
You'll like this too.

943
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,090
It's seasoned to your taste, right?

944
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:57,960
Should I bring gimbap for lunch?

945
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,589
Do you want me to get indigestion?

946
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,760
You won't get indigestion if you chew it well.

947
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:07,440
Aren't you going to eat?

948
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:09,340
No.

949
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,209
Why?

950
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,869
I like watching you enjoy the food.

951
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,710
Look.

952
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,579
You're just being delusional.

953
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,718
You're mentally ill, but you're mistaking it for weird feelings...

954
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:25,289
I finished confirming it with myself.

955
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,599
Hi, Chi Jung.

956
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:45,539
Hi.

957
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:47,480
Have you had breakfast?

958
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,010
I came to eat hospital food with you.

959
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:51,849
Did you two fight?

960
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,719
- Yes. - Yes. Go ahead and eat.

961
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,619
- You brought more food, right? - Yes.

962
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:59,919
How are you?

963
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,319
Did you get worse overnight?

964
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,760
I feel sore.

965
01:07:06,429 --> 01:07:07,429
What?

966
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,360
I think my family is calling.

967
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,730
Hi, Father.

968
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,340
At this hour?

969
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:17,639
I wonder if something happened.

970
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,010
Se Mi eventually got you.

971
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,449
Got me? What are you saying?

972
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:26,849
She's just putting on a one-woman show.

973
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,250
He called by accident.

974
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:32,519
He asked if you were okay.

975
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,718
You told them? I didn't even get hurt that badly.

976
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:35,820
You made them worry.

977
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,629
How are you feeling?

978
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,868
Just so-so.

979
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:47,098
Did you get some sleep?

980
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:48,440
I slept half of the night.

981
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,609
- Have you had breakfast? - I'm not hungry.

982
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,539
Why aren't you hungry?

983
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,839
You came running because you were worried about me.

984
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,479
Mom. I came running too.

985
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,480
Do we have more rice?

986
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:01,880
We don't.

987
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,190
Get some instant rice, then.

988
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,719
Yes, Mother.

989
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:08,559
Sit down.

990
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:16,100
Did you build the Great Wall?

991
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:17,430
No.

992
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,169
What did I just see then?

993
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,069
I told you it was a one-woman show.

994
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,449
You can get out here.

995
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,560
You were always so kind and loyal.

996
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,800
You became a great man.

997
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,569
In front of you,

998
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,970
I look so lowly and small, Dol Soe.

999
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,359
You don't remember anything.

1000
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,129
Everything is confusing, right?

1001
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:24,369
Mind control.

1002
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,430
You're getting meditation therapy.

1003
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,369
You just have to relax, close your eyes,

1004
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,039
and listen to the doctor.

1005
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,739
Who will go...

1006
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,560
Will you go first?

1007
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,988
(Durian's Affair)

1008
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:25,389
Relax. Your body feels comfortable.

1009
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,629
When I signal by saying "Red sun,"

1010
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,499
you will enter a state of hypnosis.

1011
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,500
Red sun.

1012
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:31,999
You shouldn't ask about people's pasts.

1013
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,329
To see this happen...

1014
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So Jeo.

1015
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,209
Pour me a drink.

1016
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:39,510
You worked hard.

1017
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,109
You need to be healthy.

1018
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,709
Is dinner important right now?

1019
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,809
Dol Soe is in serious condition.

1020
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,850
He may lose his life.

1021
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,478
Is that Ko Woo Mi?

1022
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:50,549
Get me out of the hospital.

1023
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,318
Se Mi is making me so uncomfortable.

1024
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,389
I should've eaten the porridge you had made me before I left.

1025
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,358
I gave our housekeeper a credit card,

1026
01:10:56,359 --> 01:10:58,688
so go with her and buy whatever you need.

1027
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:00,629
- Don't joke around. - It's not a joke.

1028
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:02,729
They say it wakes your romance cells.

1029
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:04,769
That must apply to our feelings too.

1030
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,728
Did you hear from Mr. Dan?

1031
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,299
- Who is it? - Who are you?

1032
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,898
This is Ayla. Who are you?

1033
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,109
I apologize.

1034
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,038
Mr. Dan has a lot of plans in the evening lately.

1035
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:16,578
What is it that you want to say?

1036
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:18,749
I don't know how this will sound,

1037
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,279
but since we've known each other for over 20 years, I'll say it.

1038
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:25,389
- Today's hypnosis... - You are now in the past.

1039
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,549
They've died.

1040
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,760
Who has died?
