00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,183
(Park Ju Mi, Choi Myung Gil)

00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:23,523
(Kim Min Jun, Han Da Gam)

(Lee Da Yeon, Kim Chae Eun, Hwang Mi Na)

6
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,983
(Durian's Affair)

7
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,281
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

8
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:47,512
(in this drama are fictitious.)

9
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:48,583
(Animals were filmed according to guidelines.)

10
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:34,093
(Episode 7)

11
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,903
I will drink first.

12
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,412
May I do that?

13
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:02,293
I am fine.

14
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,373
You are so beautiful.

15
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,243
Just the kind of face I wanted.

16
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,251
What are you doing?

17
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,192
You must feel stuffy in all the clothes.

18
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:08,653
I do not mind.

19
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,123
I find it suffocating.

20
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:14,632
Will you take off my beoseon for me?

21
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,002
Is that not what we do?

22
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:22,101
That was what my servant told me.

23
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,373
You are right.

24
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,012
- But... - Constricted feet...

25
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,813
inhibits blood circulation.

26
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,583
Tonight, our blood must circle our bodies well and freely.

27
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:35,213
That is important.

28
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:46,023
Why are you so stiff?

29
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,792
- Let me. - No.

30
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:53,002
If a grown man cannot even take off a woman's beoseon...

31
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,773
Are you all right?

32
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:10,352
I am fine.

33
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:19,262
Your feet look so delicate.

34
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,331
It is embarrassing.

35
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,072
A married couple is one in spirit and body.

36
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:29,702
You do not need to be embarrassed.

37
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,402
We are alone.

38
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,113
We are...

39
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:39,212
not yet one in spirit or body.

40
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,613
You provoke me as well?

41
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:00,603
Do you not feel hot?

42
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,603
Is it just me?

43
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:06,043
You could open a window.

44
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:16,152
No.

45
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,423
We might catch a cold.

46
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,793
It is better to feel hot.

47
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,033
The chamber pot.

48
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:05,933
It is over there.

49
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:09,033
Do you feel unwell?

50
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,502
Where is it?

51
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,202
It is behind the folding screen.

52
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,442
I need to urinate.

53
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:19,813
That one drink was one too many.

54
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,702
Do you not need to urinate?

55
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,842
I feel the need to quite often.

56
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,651
When will you bathe?

57
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,223
I do not feel like sleeping.

58
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:05,762
Lock the door.

59
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,563
A woman is like cooked food and must always be careful.

60
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,803
My gosh.

61
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,743
Are you still awake?

62
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:27,783
Yes.

63
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:30,752
Will you open the door?

64
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,603
You can speak.

65
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,043
Well...

66
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:00,543
Did you have a drink?

67
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:02,752
Just one.

68
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:06,483
Would you like to go outside?

69
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,993
Where to?

70
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,663
Around the neighbourhood for a walk.

71
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,222
It is dark.

72
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,092
It isn't once you get outside.

73
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,733
It's not midnight yet.

74
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,373
Bring So Jeo too.

75
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,532
I had a drink,

76
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,103
and now I want some fresh air.

77
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:27,913
You might not believe me,

78
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,673
but older women throw themselves at me.

79
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:32,883
I don't like how they throw glances and chat me up.

80
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:39,222
Will you only stay indoors?

81
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,393
What if you go outside and get lost?

82
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,622
He is right, Mother.

83
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,563
We must figure out our surroundings.

84
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:51,263
Did he want just your company?

85
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:52,903
Yours too.

86
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:55,032
Then I will be your bodyguard.

87
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,272
Do not worry.

88
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,902
This is not the time for jokes.

89
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,503
It is not a joke.

90
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:02,272
You are all I have,

91
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:03,572
and I am all you...

92
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,513
I have my husband as well.

93
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,783
Chi Gam.

94
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,622
Ohyiji's dear dad.

95
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:21,133
It's my mom.

96
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,102
Hello, Mother.

97
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:29,033
Yes, we're fine.

98
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,003
I read the wildfire was put out.

99
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,482
Yes. We live in a great country.

100
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,283
Are you warm enough?

101
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:43,783
Yes.

102
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:47,653
Hanbok is layered and surprisingly warm.

103
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,033
It is as bright as day.

104
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,003
There are so many people.

105
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,942
Are they not embarrassed?

106
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,571
Is it because life is better?

107
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,643
Or is it the end of the world?

108
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:26,462
What is it?

109
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,592
It is nothing.

110
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,313
Stand closer to me.

111
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,112
He might come after you if he's too drunk.

112
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,313
Yes.

113
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,423
Where do you work, miss?

114
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,153
I'll keep you company.

115
00:10:57,122 --> 00:11:00,492
It is a rough and fearful place for a young woman to be.

116
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,332
You'll be fine with me.

117
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:05,102
He was just drunk.

118
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,202
There's no breeze. It's just right.

119
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:13,842
The stars in the sky.

120
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,013
Can I not see them because it is so bright?

121
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,643
My gosh.

122
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,183
Why does the night sky look so desolate?

123
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,253
Where are all the stars?

124
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,452
You barely ate dinner. Are you hungry?

125
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,452
I am fine.

126
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,923
You're like a younger sister to me, so I'll speak freely.

127
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,793
Sure.

128
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,533
I am more like your daughter than your sister.

129
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:39,003
You must've digested dinner by now.

130
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,403
When I was your age, as soon as I left the table...

131
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:45,372
There's a convenience store.

132
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,683
Come in.

133
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,122
Come here.

134
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:02,852
Pick what you want.

135
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,092
This is good.

136
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,832
Could you put your card in the scanner?

137
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,643
You pay with that?

138
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,442
Dear heavens.

139
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,283
What is it I am seeing?

140
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:33,683
Every moment, every day is filled with wonder.

141
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,643
It's fine to eat ice cream as you walk.

142
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,383
This food is called "ice cream?"

143
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,212
What a name.

144
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:06,352
How are we acting like beggars?

145
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,153
It'll melt.

146
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:17,862
Something you only expect to see in the winter coats my mouth.

147
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:22,303
Dear deities. What is this I am eating?

148
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:25,702
- It's darn good. - Really?

149
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,072
"Darn good?"

150
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,112
What does that mean?

151
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,643
"Darn good."

152
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,312
Something is very tasty.

153
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,382
I'm so annoyed. What scummy guts.

154
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,452
"Scummy guts?"

155
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:41,592
It means someone is very courageous.

156
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:46,491
Am I wrong?

157
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,592
Not every slang is positive.

158
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,832
Did you spend your whole life in a countryside shack?

159
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,332
I'm so curious.

160
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,503
Over that way is a park.

161
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:09,053
What was your husband like?

162
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,283
Women brag about their husbands disguised as mockery.

163
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,092
I do not remember.

164
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:17,592
You don't remember?

165
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:19,462
No.

166
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,293
Why don't you remember?

167
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,933
It is a sandy path, Mother.

168
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:35,442
This place is quite atmospheric.

169
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:07,842
Are you sure you aren't cold?

170
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,472
It's chilly at night.

171
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,342
I am fine.

172
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,442
So am I.

173
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:16,513
They're walling off.

174
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,352
It's more fun this way.

175
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,033
Did he save his village in his past life?

176
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:36,472
Are there people here who read faces?

177
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:38,403
Listen.

178
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,572
People will find you strange.

179
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,742
Say things naturally. "Do people here read faces?"

180
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,482
No one would believe you're from Joseon.

181
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,683
They aren't face-readers. It's a thing jealous people say.

182
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,252
They wondered if I saved a village during a war,

183
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,452
earning a great blessing.

184
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,452
I'm not saying you should keep quiet.

185
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:01,633
Try to speak normally so others won't find you strange.

186
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:03,262
I will put in some effort.

187
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,602
"I'll try."

188
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,162
I will try.

189
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,232
That's much better.

190
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:16,813
What are they filming here?

191
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,143
Ready, action!

192
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,582
We're filming at the moment. Please be quiet.

193
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:32,492
- What is it? - Over there.

194
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:34,962
- What? - I saw a woman with long hair.

195
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,491
Where did she go?

196
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,862
Who cares? A woman with dishevelled hair...

197
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,102
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,903
Okay, we'll try that again.

199
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,303
Everyone, back to your position.

200
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,941
Who cares? A woman with dishevelled hair...

201
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,282
A woman with dishevelled hair. Dishevelled.

202
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:55,053
Ready, action!

203
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,253
- What is it? - Over there.

204
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,621
- What? - I saw a woman with long hair.

205
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:06,763
Who cares?

206
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,432
- A woman with... - Cut!

207
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,733
- My line. "Where did she go?" - Right, okay.

208
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,232
I'm sorry!

209
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,602
What did you do last night? Did you not get any sleep?

210
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,572
Yes. Practice your lines together, and we'll try again.

211
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:20,243
- Take your time. - It's fun, isn't it?

212
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,212
What are they doing?

213
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:25,283
They're shooting a drama. This is what Deung Myung does.

214
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,982
He shouldn't call himself an actor. He's such an amateur...

215
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,283
compared to Deung Myung.

216
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:33,582
My husband...

217
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,993
I mean, Master Deung Myung's job is...

218
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,792
what that man does?

219
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,862
Yes.

220
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,293
Okay, get ready. Is everyone ready?

221
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:55,172
Those women over there. They're not extras, are they?

222
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:56,743
No.

223
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,983
Ask them if they can play passersby.

224
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:08,223
Okay.

225
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:14,832
The director is wondering if those two ladies could play passersby.

226
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,562
- Those two ladies over there? - Yes.

227
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,862
Okay, one moment.

228
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:19,932
What are they doing?

229
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:24,432
Excuse me. Would you be up for playing passersby?

230
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,902
- The director especially... - You want them to play ghosts?

231
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,671
Well, I wouldn't call them "ghosts."

232
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,841
- No, they can't. - They'll get paid.

233
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,212
It's not about that. Their faces will be on TV.

234
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,652
No, we won't show their faces.

235
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,783
They'll only appear for a brief moment as they walk by.

236
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:43,422
- Which one? - Hold on, please.

237
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,122
Do you want to try it?

238
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:50,331
We need both of you,

239
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,102
but one of you will have to untie your hair.

240
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,832
- How much will you pay them? - We normally pay 100 dollars.

241
00:18:58,342 --> 00:18:59,371
For them, we'll pay 300 dollars.

242
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,372
Just 300 dollars for both of them?

243
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,513
- How about 500 dollars? - Make it 600.

244
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,882
And send the money right away.

245
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:07,953
- But the hair... - Okay, I got it.

246
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:11,921
It's nice to earn some money while you're out for a walk.

247
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:13,122
Besides, 600 dollars is a lot.

248
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,652
So we just have to walk by?

249
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,092
Just like what that woman did earlier.

250
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,092
Let's untie your hair.

251
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:23,862
Sure.

252
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:29,401
Hey, let me help you take the wig off.

253
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,671
Let's go. You got this.

254
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:31,842
This way, please.

255
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,942
You checked the lines we changed toward the end, right?

256
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:36,341
- Just do that part. I'm sorry. - Got it!

257
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,243
Yes, got it! Double-check and make sure!

258
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,682
Stand over here. Yes!

259
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,622
We should do a good job since we already decided to do this.

260
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:46,952
Yes, Mother.

261
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:47,953
Are we good to go?

262
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,352
Okay. Ready, action!

263
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,332
What is it?

264
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,672
Over there.

265
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:05,273
What?

266
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:07,402
I saw some women walk by. They were wearing hanbok dresses.

267
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,772
Who cares...

268
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,213
whether they were wearing hanbok dresses or were completely naked?

269
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:14,081
One of them was wearing her hair down.

270
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,181
Could they be ghosts?

271
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,482
Stop talking nonsense.

272
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,023
I really saw them!

273
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:20,482
Gosh, seriously. Must you ruin the mood like this?

274
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:23,293
Okay! That was good.

275
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,161
All right. Let's move on to the bust shot!

276
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,463
We're moving on to the bust shot!

277
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,053
Is this your first time earning money?

278
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,322
With 600 dollars,

279
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:56,452
you can buy clothes and also some good food.

280
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:57,723
You can buy what you need.

281
00:20:58,563 --> 00:20:59,723
Where?

282
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,632
Tomorrow, I'll have the housekeeper...

283
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,162
Oh, right. You're supposed to go and get fingerprinted.

284
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,131
Make sure others can't see the money.

285
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:10,303
Someone could snatch it up.

286
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:20,111
When I see you two, I can't help but worry.

287
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,553
But at the same time, I feel like you'll be okay.

288
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:23,112
Look at what happened today.

289
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,453
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

290
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,822
It's not easy to earn 600 dollars in less than an hour.

291
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:29,152
Thank you.

292
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:33,193
Do I make you that uncomfortable?

293
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:36,132
Do you feel uncomfortable around me? Or are you just shy?

294
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,932
I feel uncomfortable.

295
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,473
Why? We're all human.

296
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,472
Anyway, it's your lucky day.

297
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:47,872
You're supposed to treat others when you get your first paycheck.

298
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,713
You're supposed to buy a nice meal.

299
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:55,582
- We will. - I'm good.

300
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,013
Just take the housekeeper out for some jajangmyeon.

301
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:00,122
She'll appreciate that.

302
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,022
"Jajangmyeon?"

303
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,122
Again? You don't know what jajangmyeon is?

304
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:07,193
Who'd even believe this?

305
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:15,931
You and your girlfriend celebrated your 1,000th day anniversary.

306
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,703
- Yes. - Then you two will get married.

307
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,772
- I'm not sure about that. - What do you mean?

308
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,072
My mom said...

309
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,743
you never know what could happen until you walk down the aisle.

310
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,642
What do you feel when you feel such attraction?

311
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:29,253
What do I feel?

312
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:31,921
Do you feel sparks from just a touch?

313
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:33,282
We went to school together, so no.

314
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:34,283
But you've been together for 1,000 days.

315
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:35,452
We were classmates.

316
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:38,361
We met again by chance after almost nine years and started dating.

317
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:39,492
When you had no feelings for each other?

318
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,193
It happened naturally. We felt comfortable around each other.

319
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,932
Is feeling comfortable a good thing in romantic relationships?

320
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,432
Yes, it's important.

321
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,733
Are you seeing someone?

322
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,932
- No. - How's it going with Ayla?

323
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,742
- What about her? - Do you have feelings for her?

324
00:22:52,743 --> 00:22:53,871
We're just good friends.

325
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,542
But sometimes, it's more than that.

326
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:57,612
Do you like her merely as a friend or as a woman?

327
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,013
She's my first love. That's for sure.

328
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,453
They say the worst thing a man could do is marry his first love.

329
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,533
We can get all those things with this?

330
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:24,072
Yes, I suppose so.

331
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,743
What a meaningful day today has been.

332
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:30,372
I got a binyeo from my dear husband...

333
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,382
Who knew acting was such a prestigious profession?

334
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:35,013
Exactly.

335
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:37,151
No one looks down on actors.

336
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:39,223
Rather, everyone looks up to them.

337
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:43,023
People must treat Eon very well.

338
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:46,322
I am truly relieved.

339
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:48,662
I feel as though the universe is helping us.

340
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:52,402
I hope the universe always helps Eon too.

341
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:55,602
He has the whole universe helping him, and he has us too.

342
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,043
But what could we even do? How can we help him?

343
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,743
We are like fools. We know nothing.

344
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:05,642
Where there is a will, there is a way.

345
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,922
Anyway, who is this lady?

346
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:13,523
I wonder who she is.

347
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,523
Mother, do you not feel like this is a world...

348
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,063
where women are treated better and have more power than men?

349
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,332
Hey.

350
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,733
I called just in case. You're still up.

351
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,572
- What's up? - What do you mean, "What's up?"

352
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:37,213
- Hello? - Yes.

353
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,543
(Ha Ni)

354
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,213
My gosh. I called you by mistake.

355
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,523
- Okay. - Sorry.

356
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:48,553
Don't worry about it.

357
00:24:51,352 --> 00:24:52,493
Hey, by the way...

358
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,193
Yes.

359
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,862
Did you always have such a nice voice?

360
00:24:58,503 --> 00:24:59,963
Did you call to crack a joke?

361
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,703
I'm not joking. I really misdialled.

362
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:04,473
Okay.

363
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:10,043
(Woo Mi)

364
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:42,142
I suppose I will live a long life.

365
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,582
I chose a skein of thread.

366
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:18,642
Thank you, So Jeo.

367
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:21,313
Thanks to you, I met my son again.

368
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,652
However, he is from a good family and is good-looking.

369
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,922
He is old enough to be married, so he must be engaged to someone.

370
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:35,332
How will you cope with the pain of heartache and overcome it?

371
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,493
If you're uncomfortable, we can sleep in separate rooms.

372
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:12,733
Honestly, I feel bad for you...

373
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,432
as a man.

374
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,803
You've been faithful to me.

375
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:22,212
Unlike other men, you've never philandered around.

376
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:23,313
How do you know that?

377
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:26,513
Women just know these things. Call it women's intuition.

378
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,112
Why are you here?

379
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,612
How long have you been here?

380
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:38,313
Do not tell me you were here all night.

381
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:50,632
I put my hair up with the binyeo you gave me.

382
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:53,563
Now, you are a nobleman...

383
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:55,632
and have a beautiful wife.

384
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:58,372
You must have forgotten all about me.

385
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,672
I have never once forgotten you.

386
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:10,253
I wish to study.

387
00:29:11,112 --> 00:29:12,223
I want to.

388
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:49,953
Try it.

389
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,062
Honey.

390
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:31,132
Your meal is ready.

391
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:37,902
Did you...

392
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:40,803
say something to me...

393
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:44,013
just now?

394
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:46,813
No, I did not.

395
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:49,553
I'm sure I heard you...

396
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:54,822
The housekeeper wants to know if you're going to have breakfast.

397
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:56,092
No.

398
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,023
I mean, yes. I will.

399
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,963
It looks great on you.

400
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:20,642
Mother.

401
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:22,453
Yes.

402
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,822
He wishes to eat with us.

403
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:31,922
I am not hungry.

404
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,822
I had an egg.

405
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,033
The housekeeper cooked eggs for us earlier,

406
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,063
so both my mother-in-law and I are not hungry now.

407
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,713
What was that?

408
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:50,912
I guess I'm hearing things.

409
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,983
But why?

410
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,141
(Bidang Holdings)

411
00:31:55,142 --> 00:31:56,312
This is Chairwoman Baek's office.

412
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,953
Can Mr. Dan come up here when he's out of the meeting?

413
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:00,983
About half an hour?

414
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:03,652
Did Eun Sung kick them out?

415
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:05,321
Yes.

416
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,092
What happened in just a couple of days?

417
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,631
It can't be just about the binyeo.

418
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:11,992
What could've happened...

419
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:14,601
even if they'd stayed with us for a few months?

420
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,703
Seriously? The binyeo was the only reason?

421
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,132
Because you gave it to her?

422
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:22,641
Goodness. She has no reason to feel insecure.

423
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:25,172
Why can't you give it to her? It's not like she needed it.

424
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,512
Besides, their hair is too long. It's too much to look at as well.

425
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,513
Exactly.

426
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,253
No one's perfect.

427
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:35,322
It's fine as long as she's good to you.

428
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,293
She loves you and adores you.

429
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:39,822
That's why she's irritated by such minor things.

430
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:41,822
They must've been hurt.

431
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,632
Please look after them.

432
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:46,033
They'll get fingerprint scans for a background check today.

433
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,362
If there are no issues...

434
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,132
The variety show department director has a brother who's a detective.

435
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:54,543
On the one hand, they are so suspicious.

436
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:56,342
On the other hand,

437
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,912
they don't seem insane. They seem perfectly normal.

438
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,043
They have calming eyes too.

439
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:03,453
What do you think?

440
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:05,213
Actually,

441
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:07,322
I can't figure them out either.

442
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:10,223
But they do seem to need help.

443
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:11,921
She said she wanted to learn.

444
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:13,993
Are you talking about the daughter-in-law, So Jeo?

445
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,132
The mother-in-law.

446
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:17,763
Even her name...

447
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:20,763
We'll know once we run the background checks.

448
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,503
The advisor has something to report to you.

449
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,672
It will not hurt, right?

450
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:32,612
If they question or interrogate us,

451
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:36,852
we should just tell them that we are from Joseon.

452
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:40,253
And what?

453
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,723
They'll just take your fingerprints. You have nothing to worry about.

454
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,293
You look great with the chignon bun.

455
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:53,963
You've been to the folk village, right?

456
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,273
You both haven't been there?

457
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:01,172
No.

458
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:08,912
(Police Station)

459
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:10,682
Here.

460
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:12,483
Let's start with your thumb first.

461
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,722
I see. First, ink your thumb right here.

462
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:19,693
Then stamp it here.

463
00:34:22,432 --> 00:34:23,492
You can do the same.

464
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,431
Yes. With your thumb. That's it.

465
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,032
Then your fourth finger.

466
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,431
Do the same with your left hand.

467
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:32,242
Start here and then finish here.

468
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:34,972
It's the last one.

469
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:36,512
That's it.

470
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,912
All right. That's all.

471
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:43,252
Please wait in the lounge and have some beverages.

472
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,281
- Sure. - Okay.

473
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,523
(Together with the people, warmhearted police)

474
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,593
Mother.

475
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:00,762
You take such good care of your mother-in-law.

476
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,503
Of course. It is my obligation as well as duty.

477
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:09,713
You see, you shouldn't say that around young women, though.

478
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,872
May I ask why?

479
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,213
If they misunderstand you...

480
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,113
Anyway,

481
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,653
things aren't the same anymore. The world has changed.

482
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,602
I'm sorry, ma'am.

483
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,172
Let me get my cell phone.

484
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:38,031
You've been scattered-brained lately.

485
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:39,173
I'm sorry.

486
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:48,182
What are you doing here?

487
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:54,552
Are you going down to the restaurant?

488
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,153
Yes.

489
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:58,153
I brought a boxed meal.

490
00:35:58,452 --> 00:35:59,721
I asked your secretary.

491
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:01,693
I was told you didn't have any appointments outside.

492
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:03,992
Let's go inside.

493
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,162
You can go down and have your meal.

494
00:36:06,403 --> 00:36:07,432
Okay.

495
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:16,242
I need to talk to Secretary Ha over a meal.

496
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:17,872
You can do that after the meal.

497
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:19,383
I will make it quick, ma'am.

498
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:21,443
She'll get indigestion then.

499
00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:29,722
What is this? Why did you come here?

500
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,523
The soup will get cold, Mother.

501
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,153
- What is this? - There's rice on the bottom.

502
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:12,062
Do you expect me to drink it from the container?

503
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,662
I'm afraid it might get cold if I put it in a bowl.

504
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,871
It's clear doenjang soup.

505
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:17,332
Have a sip of that so you don't get indigestion.

506
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:21,443
Have the salad first.

507
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:23,242
I'm not a kid.

508
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:27,912
You're going to eat too?

509
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:29,852
I'll mix it for you.

510
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,822
What were you doing in the restroom?

511
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:38,923
I peed.

512
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,863
You took the boxed meal into the restroom?

513
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,233
I won't eat it.

514
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,132
I didn't take it inside the stall.

515
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,272
I left it next to the basin.

516
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,633
Anyway, it was still in the restroom.

517
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:54,343
Leave.

518
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:57,742
There's not a thing I like about you.

519
00:37:58,813 --> 00:37:59,942
I spent all morning cooking this.

520
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,912
Who told you to do that? Did I ask you to cook for me?

521
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:04,153
I boiled three eggs and minced them.

522
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,851
I didn't buy minced meat. I did it myself.

523
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,222
I don't want to hear it.

524
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:11,023
At least have one bite.

525
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:12,992
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

526
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,563
What a hassle.

527
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:24,903
Don't look at me like that.

528
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:28,472
I told you to stop. Pack your food and leave already.

529
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:32,911
You must be hungry. I know you hate me, but...

530
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:34,242
I don't even hate you now.

531
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:36,752
You just focus on supporting my son and Deung Myung.

532
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:37,753
I'm already doing that.

533
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:39,823
Don't get distracted by your absurd ideas.

534
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,452
I'm your mother-in-law. Must I nag you about this?

535
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:44,622
Must you hear this from me?

536
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:47,622
Now.

537
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:51,093
Gosh.

538
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:01,302
Why are you crying?

539
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:06,082
Why are you crying? It doesn't suit you.

540
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,551
- Because it's upsetting. - Do you think I'm in a good mood?

541
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:11,113
I know that you don't like me,

542
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,153
but can't you just have this meal?

543
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:14,882
I cooked it with all of my heart.

544
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:16,923
I don't want to eat the food that was once in the restroom.

545
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:18,991
You're being unreasonable.

546
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:20,991
Why am I being unreasonable? I never asked you to bring me food.

547
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,193
Why did you?

548
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:24,261
Stop crying.

549
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,363
Are you really going to throw a fit here?

550
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:27,733
Stop crying now.

551
00:39:29,602 --> 00:39:30,903
Ma'am, this arrived for you.

552
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,412
It's from Director Yoon Kyung Hye.

553
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:38,443
I see.

554
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,813
You should adopt one and raise it yourself.

555
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,253
Gosh. You're so softhearted.

556
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:49,423
I don't know why people abandon their dogs.

557
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:50,892
We were talking about abandoned dogs.

558
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:52,823
I wonder that too.

559
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:55,693
- Put it in my car. - Okay.

560
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:57,762
Let's eat now.

561
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:00,262
Gosh. I feel full just by looking at it.

562
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,213
This better be the last time you visit me.

563
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,682
Why aren't you answering me?

564
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,721
Please eat it with a good heart.

565
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:25,052
I had never cursed you out.

566
00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:27,423
- But... - I'll take it if you want to.

567
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,463
If you want to beat me, I'll take that too, boo.

568
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,733
"Boo?"

569
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:35,602
You must be out of your mind.

570
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:40,543
This is love, Mother.

571
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,912
- Really? - Yes.

572
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:47,012
That can't be.

573
00:40:47,013 --> 00:40:50,582
That's why I checked again.

574
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:52,313
- Both of them? - Yes.

575
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,923
What is this? What's going on?

576
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,563
We can't find your fingerprints.

577
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:02,932
How is that possible?

578
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:04,733
Explain that to us.

579
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:06,531
Well, can you ask me...

580
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,563
They must know why. It's their fingerprints.

581
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:16,142
Let's start with this. What's your name?

582
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:21,182
It's Du Ri An.

583
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:25,852
Mr. Dan Chi Jung is here.

584
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:27,323
Tell him to leave.

585
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:31,823
Yes, ma'am.

586
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:35,093
Why did you come inside?

587
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,432
If you ignore me,

588
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:41,762
your secretaries will ignore me more.

589
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:43,573
I'm your adorable youngest son.

590
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:45,301
Do you want me to be belittled?

591
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,971
You're here to ask for favours. I can tell.

592
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,442
I just couldn't stop thinking about you.

593
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:51,173
After spending the entire weekend with me?

594
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:52,782
Have your tea and leave.

595
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:55,182
- Mom. - I'm not listening. Don't.

596
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:56,511
Gosh.

597
00:41:56,512 --> 00:41:59,011
Don't you know I'm very close to the younger chairman of Sehwa?

598
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:00,182
Do you even know the definition of "close?"

599
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:01,822
It means we're good friends.

600
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,722
Don't use words you're unsure of.

601
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:10,563
I was right.

602
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,632
Chairman Choi and I are comfortable around each other...

603
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,262
putting aside our age and experience.

604
00:42:15,003 --> 00:42:18,003
His second child is very good-looking.

605
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:20,043
So he wants to be an actor?

606
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,202
Look. He's really handsome.

607
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,471
Tell him to have an audition through his agency.

608
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:25,912
He doesn't have an agency yet.

609
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:27,741
Can't you call the drama department director?

610
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:29,451
- No. - If you don't want to ask,

611
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:30,753
I'll talk to the director myself.

612
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,383
Just look at him. Do your eyes a favour.

613
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,581
He's so handsome.

614
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,022
I can never believe these pictures.

615
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:38,491
He looks just like this in person too.

616
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:41,762
If he's that handsome, tell him to audition on his own.

617
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,632
We also pull some strings when we need favours.

618
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,503
Ms. Kim called.

619
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:50,972
Their fingerprints are not in the system.

620
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:52,843
What do you mean?

621
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:54,942
- Did their fingerprint wear out? - No.

622
00:42:54,943 --> 00:42:56,713
The police didn't find any prints that matched.

623
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,843
They're not in the system at all.

624
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:01,082
It means their fingerprints were never registered.

625
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:02,813
Shocking.

626
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:04,652
Did they come from North Korea then?

627
00:43:04,653 --> 00:43:06,621
Who would defect from North Korea dressed like that?

628
00:43:06,622 --> 00:43:07,682
Then what is it?

629
00:43:19,503 --> 00:43:21,262
Maybe, they really came from the past.

630
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:24,673
That's what So Jeo said. She said she was from Joseon.

631
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:25,832
She did?

632
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,701
But how is that possible?

633
00:43:27,702 --> 00:43:29,843
If they were from Joseon, how come they lost their memories?

634
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:31,142
Anyway,

635
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:34,213
they aren't criminals.

636
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:35,782
I read this book a long time ago.

637
00:43:36,082 --> 00:43:40,153
This famous monk was left at a small temple when he was young.

638
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:41,781
The old monk who raised him passed away...

639
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:43,522
without registering his resident number.

640
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:46,262
When he was 20, he left the temple, clueless about this.

641
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:48,923
And people thought he was a spy.

642
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:52,903
So they were left at a Buddhist temple at a young age...

643
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:54,802
and happened to lose their memories?

644
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:58,372
No. That doesn't sound right.

645
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:01,503
If so, why did they grow their hair that long?

646
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:03,443
What do you think?

647
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:06,512
I'm not sure.

648
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:08,383
We're not some fortune-tellers.

649
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:11,412
Let's talk at home.

650
00:44:11,613 --> 00:44:13,152
Mom, call the drama department director...

651
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,823
Not a word from you.

652
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:16,323
What if I do speak?

653
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:18,092
Unless you want to be the Joker.

654
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:20,492
Actually, I'm thinking about cutting my mouth a bit.

655
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:22,023
Someone told me that...

656
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,392
- compared to my face, my mouth... - Leave.

657
00:44:26,032 --> 00:44:27,063
Hello.

658
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:38,972
The director just arrived.

659
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:43,581
I saw her briefly,

660
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:44,782
but she was exactly what I was looking for.

661
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:47,282
That's probably because she was wearing a hanbok.

662
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,451
I've been a director long enough.

663
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:51,593
- For the main role? - Yes.

664
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:54,792
She's not staying at an ordinary house.

665
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:56,292
It's Bidang Holdings' chairwoman's house.

666
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,293
I can't barge in there just to see her guest.

667
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,503
Can I meet her at a café around the house?

668
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,672
Are you considering her for Deung Myung's love interest?

669
00:45:03,673 --> 00:45:05,931
Yes. The lead roles have to make a good couple.

670
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:07,102
I think they'll look great together.

671
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:09,372
- No. - Why not?

672
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:12,542
Just let me meet her.

673
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,411
- I'll take care of the rest. - She's a nobody.

674
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:15,812
It will only damage Deung Myung's status.

675
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,713
Do you think he started his career as a top star?

676
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,181
It could be refreshing for the viewers.

677
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:20,652
- Whatever. - Se Mi.

678
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:22,252
Being his mother is more important than being your cousin.

679
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,122
Do you think I would ruin his career?

680
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:26,023
- Don't you know how I am? - I don't.

681
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:27,822
Don't try to convince me.

682
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:29,661
We need to cast the right girl for the female lead,

683
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:31,863
so his role stands out. The drama will succeed too then.

684
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,602
I'm tired of talking about this.

685
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:36,201
Let me just meet with her, so I can feel her out.

686
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:38,602
If you think she's right for this, you will cast her.

687
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:40,342
Why wouldn't I?

688
00:45:40,343 --> 00:45:41,641
No one was born a top star.

689
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:43,142
Take some side dishes before you go.

690
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:45,642
I don't have time to eat at home.

691
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:48,982
If you always eat out, it won't be good for your health.

692
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,411
Your mother called yesterday.

693
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:52,581
She was worried about her only son's well-being.

694
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:54,851
Can you help out your only cousin then?

695
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,122
It will help Deung Myung's character too.

696
00:45:57,793 --> 00:45:59,823
- Is she your type? - What are you talking about?

697
00:46:00,262 --> 00:46:01,722
Deung Myung told me.

698
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,732
The director often looks for their type...

699
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:05,431
instead of finding the right person for the characters.

700
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,762
Gosh. I'm a professional.

701
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:39,363
I wonder if the master is going to visit today.

702
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,233
You must not be so greedy.

703
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:42,932
He is very busy.

704
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:45,173
I am so curious.

705
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:49,173
He asked me if I was interested in working.

706
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:51,242
I wonder what it is about.

707
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:53,543
It must be freshly de-husked rice.

708
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:55,642
Brown and glutinous rice.

709
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,253
Okay.

710
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,753
Can you take out the garlic from the utility room and peel it?

711
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:13,931
(Best Ayla)

712
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:14,963
I should scold you.

713
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:17,133
I got hungry.

714
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,702
Are you on a break?

715
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:22,003
Yes.

716
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,512
Can't you come out for a bit?

717
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:26,843
Outside?

718
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:28,682
Yes.

719
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,552
Did Ayla call you?

720
00:47:34,023 --> 00:47:35,883
We texted. She asked me where we were filming.

721
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:44,193
Here.

722
00:47:44,532 --> 00:47:45,793
Have a few bites at least.

723
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:51,633
I came here at the perfect time.

724
00:47:58,813 --> 00:47:59,982
It must have been our telepathy.

725
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:02,312
I told you not to eat sweets.

726
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:03,653
You'll get addicted to them.

727
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:05,682
It was right there.

728
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:07,182
How's your dad?

729
00:48:07,183 --> 00:48:09,222
He can stop taking anti-inflammatory medicine now.

730
00:48:09,722 --> 00:48:11,322
Actually, my mom asked...

731
00:48:11,323 --> 00:48:13,092
if you could come over someday and have dinner.

732
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:15,063
Dinner isn't important. I should go and see them.

733
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,593
You can take it inside and eat it.

734
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:25,372
- You might get indigestion. - Do I look good?

735
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:26,843
Totally.

736
00:48:27,043 --> 00:48:29,202
Whoever ends up marrying you is a lucky guy.

737
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:37,081
I'll call you after I finish.

738
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,082
Okay.

739
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,692
Let's all get ready.

740
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,133
Okay. We'll start the shoot.

741
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:54,462
Okay. I'll start shooting.

742
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:56,431
Okay. Nice.

743
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:57,472
That's very nice.

744
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:08,812
Just like that.

745
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:09,952
Nice.

746
00:49:10,253 --> 00:49:11,282
Nice shot.

747
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:13,822
Just like that. Okay. Nice.

748
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:15,582
That's good. Okay.

749
00:49:15,823 --> 00:49:18,322
Okay. Nice. Very nice. I like it.

750
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,793
Try being more natural.

751
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:39,673
How tall are you?

752
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:42,543
She asked how tall you were.

753
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:45,983
- Me? - Yes.

754
00:49:46,182 --> 00:49:47,221
I'm 185cm.

755
00:49:47,222 --> 00:49:49,022
You're very handsome in person too.

756
00:49:49,023 --> 00:49:50,092
Thank you.

757
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,922
Please give me an autograph. I'm a fan.

758
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,093
It's an honour.

759
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,121
I guess you've been in Korea for a long time now.

760
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:57,563
Your pronunciation is accurate.

761
00:49:58,633 --> 00:49:59,661
So?

762
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,262
I'm asking you.

763
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:04,003
What role?

764
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:07,943
Hello?

765
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:17,511
The role of Master Jung's mom. His real mom is a nanny.

766
00:50:17,512 --> 00:50:18,652
It's like a historical soap opera.

767
00:50:18,653 --> 00:50:20,323
I wasn't going to do it,

768
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:22,681
- but the script was good. - Do it.

769
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:24,523
I'm worried it might make Deung Myung uncomfortable.

770
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:27,793
It'd be good for him to get close to his future aunt.

771
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:32,391
What's with the sigh? Don't do it if you don't want to.

772
00:50:32,392 --> 00:50:35,331
I'm not the female lead. I'm now a mom.

773
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,573
Taking roles that are older than your actual age looks good.

774
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,003
Should I trust you and do it?

775
00:50:40,343 --> 00:50:41,572
Did you meet Director Ju Nam?

776
00:50:41,573 --> 00:50:43,813
Yes. I heard you were in-laws.

777
00:50:43,943 --> 00:50:45,213
We've never talked.

778
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:51,753
Should I stake out there?

779
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:55,222
I'm talking about in front of Chairwoman Baek's house.

780
00:50:56,793 --> 00:50:59,253
If we can cast the right actor and make a successful drama,

781
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:00,722
it'll be good for DTV.

782
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:03,392
- Right? - Yes.

783
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,903
That's hot. Gosh.

784
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,543
I should've seen her.

785
00:51:13,642 --> 00:51:15,503
- Are you the director? - I'm just curious about...

786
00:51:15,702 --> 00:51:17,012
how perfect she is for the role.

787
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:20,282
- Let's go, then. - Ms. Yoon Sung Hye is coming today.

788
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:21,612
Also, you have dinner plans.

789
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:22,843
Oh, right.

790
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:24,682
Gosh.

791
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:26,523
I'm Ma Young Sin.

792
00:51:26,622 --> 00:51:29,483
Mr. Dan asked me to teach you.

793
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:30,923
I see.

794
00:51:34,762 --> 00:51:36,093
Please be patient with us.

795
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:39,032
We are lacking in many ways.

796
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,832
We do not know anything.

797
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:48,943
We'll learn Korean first.

798
00:51:58,052 --> 00:52:00,653
Goodness. That dog has such good fortune.

799
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:04,793
Ohyiji. Do you want some steamed sweet potatoes?

800
00:52:06,153 --> 00:52:09,023
Do you give her random food when I'm not here?

801
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,862
Of course not. Nothing other than sweet potatoes and salmon.

802
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,702
They're the same as us.

803
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:17,432
If they eat bad food, they'll get sick.

804
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:18,872
Yes, ma'am.

805
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:26,512
You're so pure, ma'am.

806
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:29,951
If it were me, I would teach...

807
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:32,483
those two women how to work...

808
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:33,883
and send them to the US.

809
00:52:34,923 --> 00:52:36,922
I heard the Mexican housekeeper...

810
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:39,923
didn't know how to do anything besides clean.

811
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:44,392
That way, you can save money on paying people.

812
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:47,762
That'd be so comfortable for your father and mother.

813
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:50,872
When you teach them one thing, they seem to learn three or four.

814
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,602
They seem quite smart.

815
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,182
If you teach them for two or three months...

816
00:53:01,642 --> 00:53:03,412
and send them to the house in the US,

817
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:05,552
all you have to do is feed them and clothe them.

818
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:09,423
You should give it another thought.

819
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:15,023
Ohyiji. Let's exercise.

820
00:53:18,063 --> 00:53:20,762
The minister has bad joints.

821
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:23,802
Even if they just push his wheelchair...

822
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:29,273
This is a cell phone. A phone.

823
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:33,483
You can use this to talk to people far away.

824
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:34,911
Here. If you open it,

825
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,612
you can send a text.

826
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,812
You're going to type the Korean we learned today in here.

827
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:42,952
Someone far away can read this letter...

828
00:53:43,023 --> 00:53:44,293
even without meeting them in person.

829
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:55,832
Head to Samsung-dong.

830
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:58,573
- To Chairwoman Baek's? - Yes.

831
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:00,242
Yes, sir.

832
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,313
Is that Chairwoman Baek?

833
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,483
It's her second son.

834
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:18,823
How fascinating.

835
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:20,693
You should read it too.

836
00:54:20,963 --> 00:54:22,693
Mother. It is Ohyiji's...

837
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,693
It is Mister Dan, the one who gave you the binyeo.

838
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:29,932
- He is here? - Yes.

839
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:42,242
- Have you eaten dinner? - Yes.

840
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,252
Would you like some fruit or a drink?

841
00:54:46,253 --> 00:54:47,253
I'm fine.

842
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:49,523
Is Mother coming home late?

843
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,653
If her secretary doesn't call, that means she'll be back late.

844
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:16,043
Did Ms. Ma come by?

845
00:55:16,412 --> 00:55:17,412
Yes.

846
00:55:18,613 --> 00:55:20,122
We learned a lot.

847
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:24,323
Please sit.

848
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,793
I will rinse the rest of the dishes.

849
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:29,463
If you need anything...

850
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,992
Why are you doing the dishes?

851
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:32,862
We ate, so of course I should.

852
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,532
You can use the machine. The dishwasher.

853
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:38,673
I thought doing it by hand would be better.

854
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:40,503
There are not many dishes.

855
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:48,443
It suits you very well.

856
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:51,012
Thank you for everything.

857
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:56,023
Is your bed comfortable?

858
00:55:57,693 --> 00:55:58,722
Yes.

859
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,122
Yesterday,

860
00:56:01,423 --> 00:56:02,793
it must have hurt.

861
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:05,891
As you go through life,

862
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:07,733
unexpected things can happen.

863
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:15,673
- Today... - Chairwoman Baek is almost here.

864
00:56:23,282 --> 00:56:25,813
(Best Deung)

865
00:56:34,863 --> 00:56:37,392
(Best Ayla)

866
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:38,932
Where are you?

867
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:40,932
Are you still...

868
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,613
Did you eat dinner here?

869
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:54,012
No.

870
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,722
You're such an elegant lady.

871
00:57:05,992 --> 00:57:07,492
- You have ramyeon, right? - Yes, sir.

872
00:57:08,063 --> 00:57:09,222
What were you doing until now?

873
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:11,332
Did you not eat dinner together?

874
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:12,732
We met out front.

875
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,503
I'm craving ramyeon after eating dim sum.

876
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:21,273
Take a seat.

877
00:57:21,543 --> 00:57:22,602
How are your fingerprints...

878
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:25,412
not registered?

879
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:29,282
You don't know? Are you from outer space?

880
00:57:31,153 --> 00:57:33,412
You look so fine.

881
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:34,952
We are...

882
00:57:36,023 --> 00:57:38,093
very frustrated as well.

883
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:43,793
How can you lose your memories at the same time?

884
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:47,063
You said you came from Joseon.

885
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:49,532
Is it true?

886
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:54,472
Yes.

887
00:57:57,943 --> 00:57:59,273
I think so.

888
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,443
Tell us what you remember.

889
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,653
I remember a tile-roofed house and a thatched-roof house.

890
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:08,823
I can dimly remember people like me.

891
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:10,182
People dressed in hanbok?

892
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,753
Yes.

893
00:58:12,552 --> 00:58:13,722
In flashes.

894
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:15,023
What about you, young lady?

895
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:19,733
When I woke up, I was in cold water.

896
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,562
There must have been a lunar eclipse.

897
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:23,773
It was so dark.

898
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:27,642
I do not even know how I got out of the water.

899
00:58:27,802 --> 00:58:29,943
No. Tell us what you remember.

900
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,182
The only thing I remember...

901
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:36,883
is that she is my mother-in-law.

902
00:58:45,093 --> 00:58:46,392
What about other family?

903
00:58:47,122 --> 00:58:48,193
I am not sure.

904
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,633
So where is your proof that shows she is your mother-in-law?

905
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:57,302
That is what I naturally call her.

906
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:04,043
We are in the dark too.

907
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:06,843
When I try to recall things,

908
00:59:08,343 --> 00:59:10,213
it feels like my head will explode.

909
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:11,552
It's okay.

910
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:17,552
Please eat.

911
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:26,262
We will learn and practice so we can do our share.

912
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,463
If you are patient with us,

913
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:33,472
we will repay your generosity no matter what.

914
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:36,003
Gosh.

915
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:41,883
You must be tired today. Please get some rest.

916
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,552
You too, Chi Gam.

917
00:59:55,463 --> 00:59:58,063
Il Soo. Please eat.

918
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:06,133
In the past life, was I...

919
01:00:09,202 --> 01:00:12,043
But I definitely heard it. Vividly.

920
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:19,952
I'm leaving. You don't need to see me off.

921
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,262
We seem to have gotten over one hill.

922
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:30,363
Right, Mother?

923
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:37,073
Yes. Talk to you later.

924
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:44,273
- Is Deung Myung not back yet? - No.

925
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:46,613
What do you think about Ayla?

926
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:49,343
- In what way? - As a daughter-in-law.

927
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,813
Isn't it already half decided that she'll be our daughter-in-law?

928
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:54,423
I had lunch at Ayla's house today.

929
01:00:55,023 --> 01:00:56,622
Ayla will be 30 next year.

930
01:00:57,423 --> 01:00:59,622
Do you want them to get married before she turns 30?

931
01:01:19,912 --> 01:01:21,943
My stomach feels better after eating this.

932
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:24,512
Even if it is just millet porridge,

933
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,182
it is different when you make it.

934
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:44,472
Goodness. You scared me.

935
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:49,302
Did you sleep well?

936
01:01:56,043 --> 01:01:57,713
I made millet porridge.

937
01:01:58,113 --> 01:01:59,153
Porridge?

938
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:01,022
Why?

939
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:03,323
It seemed you were leaving on an empty stomach.

940
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:08,363
I don't eat carbohydrates.

941
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:11,762
Take this.

942
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,633
You're productive.

943
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:20,273
Don't throw away the porridge. It's food.

944
01:02:20,673 --> 01:02:23,202
Yes. I will eat it.

945
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,931
Does she go to work this early in the morning?

946
01:02:50,932 --> 01:02:52,673
She goes swimming to exercise.

947
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,302
By swimming, do you mean in the water?

948
01:02:56,543 --> 01:02:57,573
Yes.

949
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:01,642
Where is she swimming...

950
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,443
at this hour?

951
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:05,983
It is not even summer.

952
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:12,523
Are you okay?

953
01:03:42,753 --> 01:03:46,153
(Durian's Affair)

954
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,661
Ohyiji. How do I look?

955
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:48,722
I'm sexy, right?

956
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,633
- That car upfront. - Is it an ambulance?

957
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,161
Why are you so sexy today?

958
01:03:57,162 --> 01:03:58,172
I'm always sexy.

959
01:03:58,173 --> 01:03:59,572
Look at me like you adore me.

960
01:03:59,573 --> 01:04:00,573
Really, Mother?

961
01:04:00,574 --> 01:04:02,343
Mr. Dan asked me to bring you two.

962
01:04:02,543 --> 01:04:03,902
As your husband,

963
01:04:03,903 --> 01:04:06,712
I need your acknowledgement and praise.

964
01:04:06,713 --> 01:04:08,641
What do you mean?

965
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:09,642
I did not know.

966
01:04:09,643 --> 01:04:11,812
Did you not hide that and marry me?

967
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:14,121
- Are you calling a hypnotist? - You're coming too?

968
01:04:14,122 --> 01:04:15,851
Could it be true?

969
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,292
- Joseon? - That's right.

970
01:04:17,293 --> 01:04:20,392
We met shortly on Sunday in the parking lot, right?

971
01:04:21,923 --> 01:04:24,391
You are now entering a state of hypnosis.

972
01:04:24,392 --> 01:04:26,132
Okay. What do you see?

973
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:27,331
Tell me what you see.

974
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:28,462
She is hardworking.

975
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:30,362
It's just that her identity is a mystery.

976
01:04:30,363 --> 01:04:32,172
Did you hear? There's no security camera?

977
01:04:32,173 --> 01:04:33,402
What if someone saw?

978
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,173
Why would there be a camera in a hospital room?

979
01:04:35,242 --> 01:04:38,672
Se Mi, I wish you love your mother-in-law for a long time.

980
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:39,713
May it be unwavering too.

981
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:40,742
This is Mother's.

982
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,081
Let's start tomorrow morning. We have an exercise room.

983
01:04:43,082 --> 01:04:45,212
His soul has a deep desire for health.

984
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:46,213
Wear this.

985
01:04:46,214 --> 01:04:48,652
All women have young and toned bodies.

986
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:50,622
It is called exercise. You move your body.

987
01:04:52,823 --> 01:04:55,122
Is she really a married woman from Joseon?
