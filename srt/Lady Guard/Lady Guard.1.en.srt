1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,980
Next!

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:17,590
Wait wait.

3
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,250
Hurry

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,590
Forward

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:23,650
Next

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,480
Sara Pan

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Aren't you going to take a panoramic view?

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm just looking for a deadly weapon.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,200
No one can kill your little tits.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,280
Do not mess with me

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,140
Next

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,500
Your tits are so small

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,880
Try it

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,030
what's it for

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,210
I don't know, ma'am.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,090
Forward!

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,170
open your bag

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,860
You make me work every day.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,020
All the people in line

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,440
open your suitcases

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,040
Good morning sir

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,110
You called me?

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,490
yes estelle

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,970
She is going to replace Rimundo.

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,110
Meryl is Estelle

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,430
I will be a shadow to her

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,690
Well

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,310
Before coming here, this was my first deployment.

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,830
Very fresh!

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Don't call me sister anymore...

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,360
just estelle

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,370
Do you know Merril?

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,910
you will learn a lot from her

34
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,870
She's just a baby face but she's already a veteran.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
and your wake

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
Take good care of Merrill

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,580
Do not be jealous

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Sister Estelle seems kind.

39
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,890
You are a sister now.

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,270
Come here!

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,320
Estelle, introduce me to your new partner.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
This is Merrill

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,540
Our new lady on duty

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,500
Is it necessary for security guards?

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,300
it's only you who are ugly

46
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,600
Oh

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,520
Come on

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,260
We bring together the best people.

49
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,920
so that the life of the rider is not hard.

50
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,130
Hey, what are you doing?

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,410
We're just looking around

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,140
Damn!

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,480
Even the packs of people

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,960
You guys want to go to the airport.

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,880
Come on, we'll be back.

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Don't report to us

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Are you kidding me

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,710
oh boss

59
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,510
Good day

60
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,970
Merrill is our new security guard.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,360
Is there a problem here?

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,360
Why is the umbrella open?

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,080
Boss, it's not because I didn't wrap it properly so...

64
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,900
Then he goes back to the basement.

65
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,350
Why don't you clean up before you bring this in?

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,080
Yes Boss

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,060
Estelle fix that

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,270
fix your work

69
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,340
Why didn't anyone report?

70
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,120
No

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,040
give me another chance

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,200
As far as I can tell, it's just a part of life.

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
If they report me to the police

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,640
it will be automatic

75
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,720
They won't have any problem

76
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,110
Come with me

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,020
Hey

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,900
How is Meryl?

79
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,860
she looks sad

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,020
Yes of course

81
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,260
like she was having an affair

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,540
tell us the truth

83
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,220
What is she doing here?

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,940
It doesn't matter

85
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,080
Isn't that Odie coming to your office?

86
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,020
You know what you have to do.

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,120
Just keep an eye on her and see if she has anything else up her sleeve.

88
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,610
And for you, don't I have anything left in store?

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,080
What should she show?

90
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:07,790
janice

91
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,500
The question is

92
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,440
What would be something grateful enough?

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
To get out of my life

94
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,940
There

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,320
That's not enough

96
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,550
You're not funny anymore.

97
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,850
you get angry so fast

98
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,520
I'm still mad at you

99
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,260
Don't worry,

100
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,860
My wife is the only one who can understand me.

101
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,930
But you know she doesn't like it.

102
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,980
How is your house?

103
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
it's overtime

104
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
Good luck!

105
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,640
Hopefully I can work overtime too.

106
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,680
That would have been a waste of money.

107
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,020
Well then

108
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,930
Are you guys ready?

109
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,560
You know, this is just the beginning of our new salary!

110
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,800
The minimum bet is 100 dollars.

111
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,160
Oh Lord...

112
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,280
It's a huge amount

113
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,720
You're still on your new salary.

114
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,540
The return seems to be great

115
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,870
Don't worry about that

116
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,970
What will he do

117
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,690
You were rushing before

118
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,330
It is dangerous. Maybe you can't get up again

119
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,730
Let 'me help you

120
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
We are going to Venice

121
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,180
Estelle, take care of this.

122
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,180
Count all your money before putting it in the safe.

123
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,740
Nice shoes

124
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,640
They will look good in the shopping center.

125
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,000
Leave

126
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

127
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,520
You look pretty today,

128
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,800
But aren't you going to give up?

129
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,440
What if they find out that you cheated on me?

130
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,080
And everyone is here to try my food!

131
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,120
Cindy, can't we just leave them alone?

132
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,620
so they can't eat their own food

133
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,610
It doesn't take time

134
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,530
Why is that the case?

135
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,010
Who do you like

136
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,440
Here

137
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,780
Here you have.

138
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,380
What do you want?

139
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,120
You like many things, don't you?

140
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,730
Who's that boy

141
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,930
That stupid Estel

142
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,470
Why didn't I let him in?

143
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,640
he already entered

144
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,110
what is your problem janus

145
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,420
Remember Merrill gave me the job.

146
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,240
So I think he was under my control

147
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,590
Do you know how big your penis is?

148
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,490
You just need to add one bullet to hit him in the face.

149
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,210
So what, so they can both stab me!

150
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,210
That?!

151
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,430
Did I say it's easy for one person?

152
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,150
To hit your dick!?

153
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,970
damn criminal

154
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,920
I can not be calm

155
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,760
Yeah

156
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,020
What else can I do?

157
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,890
Anything

158
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,660
Are you sure about Merrill?

159
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,790
Yes ma'am.

160
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,940
Whatever it is...

161
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,700
I told you before that everything was under control.

162
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,000
You just need to do a few things here.

163
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,500
Make sure there are no knives or deadly weapons.

164
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,340
Did you know?

165
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,780
If we lose now, they might get angry.

166
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,940
Many have won here.

167
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,160
But more people lost

168
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,140
Their salaries are like packages in the warehouse.

169
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,700
It's easy for them, but not so easy for us.

170
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,160
WHO?

171
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,000
good to us

172
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,180
Janus said we can't have too much money in the world.

173
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,740
we should be controlled

174
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,840
Merrill

175
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,100
this is mario

176
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,630
And this on Cindy

177
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,490
They are the bankers in this calling game.

178
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,050
At the GoParcel branch

179
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,570
Only them? Nobody else ?

180
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,510
There is more

181
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,110
Get ready with your ties

182
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,030
Mario, are you ready?

183
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,870
Ready

184
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,610
What are you waiting for

185
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,510
Let me tie all your ties

186
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,210
Ok let it go

187
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,990
Blue red yellow

188
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,200
One more thing

189
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,880
Make sure no one has a cell phone or camera on them.

190
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
It is difficult to report things to the administrator.

191
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,980
especially if it's the police

192
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,660
and make sure no one else can get in either

193
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,480
What happens when our bosses arrive?

194
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,710
That won't happen yet

195
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,150
But just in case

196
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,610
You should miss the call to Cindy immediately.

197
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,490
She knows what that means.

198
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,050
They will be on alert

199
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,190
and they will appear behind your back

200
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,590
How about these CCTVs?

201
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,280
That won't do.

202
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,140
We will put a cover on each one of them,

203
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,140
so Janus can see it when he comes in the morning

204
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,720
Is that clear enough for you to understand?

205
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,560
Copy

206
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,480
We are ordering mobile phones from Shaplala.

207
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
And then what's next?

208
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
Will we have new things?

209
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,560
my boyfriend has an online class

210
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,620
This is my boyfriend!

211
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,280
Who is your boyfriend?

212
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,500
Don't worry about that.

213
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,340
It was Junjun.

214
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,620
Mister,

215
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,240
Did you talk to the seller?

216
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:51,880
Yeah

217
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,070
The screenshot he sent me is correct.

218
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,370
you are the ones who stole

219
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,370
and replaced our packages

220
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:02,690
Mister

221
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,110
Give us 5-7 business days

222
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,010
We will investigate what happened to his cell phone.

223
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:10,930
Are you sure?

224
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,350
After seven days,

225
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,350
My girlfriend and I are separating!

226
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,270
Who is that?!

227
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,230
Calm down guys...

228
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,190
Take it easy!?

229
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,710
You're not listening!!

230
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,730
Excuse me sir

231
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,110
Stand

232
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,430
Here

233
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:33,770
Hey

234
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,450
Have we already lost?

235
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:35,690
No

236
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,250
It was a close game

237
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,660
Let me see

238
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,940
Come on

239
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,400
I will win!

240
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,990
Hey, you guys are really close.

241
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,550
You lost?

242
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,230
One more time

243
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,990
good night boss

244
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,260
What did you bring today?

245
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,600
Nothing

246
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,940
Just a side control

247
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,840
Why are you so surprised?

248
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,360
It's just a secondary check, right?

249
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,020
I do not have time for that

250
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:32,880
Hey!

251
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,180
come in boss

252
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,210
Boss

253
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,590
Your wedding ring doesn't look good

254
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,120
Don't be stupid Estela

255
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,600
What do you think of my wedding ring?

256
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,570
First of all

257
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,160
it's no use

258
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,960
Because I'm hiding the fact that I'm single.

259
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,960
really boss

260
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,480
Yeah

261
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,720
Do you think you are handsome?

262
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,580
You are single?!

263
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,880
Oh Lord!

264
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,060
Am I playing with your mind or are you really like that when you're single?

265
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,420
Look at me...

266
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,620
What kind of person is your boss?

267
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,120
Is he sexy and handsome?

268
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,620
No way!!

269
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,500
it's hard to be alone

270
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,880
and cools easily

271
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,860
when it's cold

272
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,560
Don't get me wrong, I'm used to being alone.

273
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,300
Boss!

274
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,200
Can you do that?

275
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,880
If you can make it happen

276
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,460
You can replace Estelle

277
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,940
She's the one who makes things worse.

278
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,760
Not just for girls

279
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:57,860
Strange

280
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:01,960
Boss

281
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,660
It seems that your secondary visitor is late.

282
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:07,500
Yeah

283
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,380
Why are you still here

284
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,800
I have a lot of work to do today.

285
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Come on, let me help you!

286
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,680
There is no need for that...

287
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,100
let me go to your brother

288
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,700
You can count on my support

289
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,480
What happened there

290
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,820
It was just a site visit.

291
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,580
Did you suspect something?

292
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Maybe we should tell the boss

293
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,120
Here, so we can have a little fun.

294
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,400
Fun?

295
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Are you rich now or do you have money to save to fulfill your dream of building a downtown office building?

296
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,800
It's getting difficult and I could be fired.

297
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,300
That will not happen

298
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,460
Leave it alone

299
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,640
You're right

300
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,240
Sister just leave it

301
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,650
Odee is just a step away

302
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,650
Really sister

303
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,650
Do not believe him

304
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,890
Come on. We will start as soon as possible.

305
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,430
Minimum bet, 500

306
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,470
Well

307
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,170
I'm going home

308
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,910
you are losing money

309
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,370
One more

310
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,010
It is still early

311
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,650
You lost

312
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,280
that is white

313
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,260
It's next to it, repeat.

314
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,060
Why is it repeated?!

315
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,470
Is that even a repeat!?

316
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,470
Fuck!

317
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,810
You guys are scamming me out of my money!!

318
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,850
Are you really stupid or what?

319
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,790
That was already white!!!

320
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,050
Isn't it supposed to repeat if it's on its side???

321
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,670
Idiot, come back and pay me

322
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,670
Although I only have 1000 yen left

323
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,950
What kind of idiot are you?

324
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,090
Let's play?

325
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,190
Or did someone beat us?

326
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,130
Go home

327
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,370
your trap

328
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,290
Come here

329
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:38,810
let's just go

330
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,850
What do you want from this?

331
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,030
What is happening?

332
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,250
Let me go!

333
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,690
That's a fucking illegal business.

334
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,570
Get out of my way

335
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,260
Hide

336
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,730
You reported the email to me

337
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,130
Don't be ashamed, Jun.

338
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,910
Yes sir. I'm sorry

339
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,530
Why are you apologizing?

340
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,490
Who is your accomplice?

341
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,660
Admit it!

342
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,380
Or else we'll call the police.

343
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,860
Who was?!

344
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,220
The guard...

345
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,820
it's estel

346
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,800
Boss wait a minute

347
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,340
Jun doesn't know what he said.

348
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,120
he did not tell me anything

349
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,030
they are teaching you

350
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,160
not deny

351
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,110
You're not done yet.

352
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,270
What did he say?

353
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,970
Merrill!

354
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,230
Sister, admit it now.

355
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,090
Tell the boss the truth

356
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:03,980
Well

357
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,180
I will tell

358
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:11,370
We've been using a warehouse to gamble.

359
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,530
What kind of game is that?

360
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,500
calling game

361
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,540
We play with employees who want to buy and waste their money

362
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,120
Boss, Janos and I are here to see you.

363
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,270
If you want we can look at the vault in this office.

364
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,870
All our money is there.

365
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,520
here boss

366
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,260
Wait a minute

367
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,840
Why should I open the vault?

368
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,920
Isn't that an invasion of privacy?

369
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:48,900
That is still property of that office.

370
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,880
Now if no one hides from us

371
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,720
What are you hiding

372
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,320
Estelle, what the fuck?

373
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,020
What kind of gambling operation are you talking about?

374
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,020
I don't know how to play this game.

375
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,000
Well...

376
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,260
You can go home now

377
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Open it

378
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,210
Nothing

379
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,870
What are you saying Estelle?

380
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,650
Boss please believe me

381
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,050
Everything I said is true.

382
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,490
Meryl help us

383
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,550
Sister

384
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,930
I do not know what you're talking about.

385
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,490
Get out of here, Espe!

386
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,650
Before the police catch me again

387
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,030
Go out

388
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,180
Janos

389
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,180
Forgive us

390
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,320
let's talk outside

391
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,060
Do not worry sir

392
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,020
Everything is under my control

393
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,140
Know

394
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,910
You know, Estelle is very funny.

395
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,510
Look at her! she's just a clown

396
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,170
We're about to get caught by your boss.

397
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,050
And she even broke his car.

398
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,680
What do you think?

399
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,300
Cindy is right.

400
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,800
I will make more money without Estelle

401
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,580
But there was an idea

402
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,620
I lied to June, I just scared her.

403
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,240
And she told him that she would leave herself and Estelle.

404
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,460
How much did you lose last night in the color game?

405
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,040
10 thousand

406
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,680
if she doesn't follow me

407
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,300
she will lose a job

408
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,280
Or get hit by people playing

409
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,860
At least

410
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,720
She earned 40k from my account.

411
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,460
Because I knew Estelle would fall

412
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,780
If you don't give me your money back I'll make it look like a lie.

413
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,060
Are you happy with what you did?

414
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,020
You're trying to trick us!

415
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,730
What do we know about each other?!

416
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,430
Janos already told the truth

417
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,570
and now he's even pushing to do overtime

418
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,370
What the hell are you talking about?

419
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,630
You believe that damn liar!

420
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,420
Sir, I have a package for you.

421
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,600
Parcel ?

422
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:29,860
Yeah

423
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,300
But there is no order

424
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,880
no idea

425
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm in.

426
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,380
Even if you don't know what to do, you're still bad!
