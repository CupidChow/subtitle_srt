I told you to get some alcohol!

They won't even let me buy on credit. At least give me money!

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,480
You bitch! Why don't you go make money, then?

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,580
Quit school and make money!

12

Are you crazy?

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,130
Why would I pay for alcohol for an alcoholic? Never!

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,180
She told me to abort you.

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,960
Hey, I had to say that, then! You were more important, then.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,440
Was I important?

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,670
She was a high schooler then.

41
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,390
How could I tell her to have you?

42
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,310
Of course, I'm so glad we have you now, Jin Hee.

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,790
I understand you 100%!

44

I would've been like you, too, if I had a hopeless friend like you.

You're so thoughtful.

Why are you being so serious?

61

My colleague's friend launched this app, so she installed it for me.

You'll be aging alone!

70
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,890
I won't age. Why would I? I still got it!

71
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,350
Maybe you got it too much.

72
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,780
Right? I still got it, don't I?

73
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,480
I guess I shouldn't get old yet.

I didn't even get to see that man's face.

That man? Who?

76
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,190
What man?

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,230
The jerk who got you pregnant and ran!

78
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,550
He's probably sleeping well right now.

79
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,420
Thinking about that makes my stomach churn.

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,360
The most painful death still won't be enough for him!

81
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,980
I can't even do anything because I've never seen him!

82
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,460
F***ing hell!

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,460
Just wait until I meet him.

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,510
I'll make sure he can't even sit, lie down, or stand!

85
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,810
I'll grab his balls, smash them,

86
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,870
put them in his mouth, pull out his eyeballs,

87
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,600
and stuff them in his ears!

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,690
Well, no.

89
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,500
No, it's probably better to f*** him up after flipping things upside down.

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,370
Yes.

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,310
I f*** up my friend's dad, too. I can do the same to him.

92
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,170
Should I just hit him with a hammer?

93
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,620
Or should I grind him up with a millstone?

94
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,260
Where's the hammer? Where is it?

95
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,400
When did you put everything away?

96
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,130
Should we have some tea?

97
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,980
Yes, Aunt.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,930
Look at how the look of your eyeballs changed.

99
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,050
My gosh.

100
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,420
What do you mean, "eyeballs"?

101
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,730
Speak prettily with your pretty mouth!

102
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,630

Aren't you going home?

104
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,790
Jin Hee, is this the tea?

105
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,920
This is it. Right?

106
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,370
No, it isn't. Let me get it for you.

107
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,590
I would've prepared it earlier if you told me you were leaving early.

108
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,870
I still don't know a lot of places within my neighborhood.

109
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,070
So I'll commute on foot for a while.

110
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,320
Hold on! Hold on!

111
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,450
Eat another one.

112
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,310
I'm so proud of you.

113
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,460
Whom do you resemble that you're so diligent and pretty?

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,210
What I know for sure is that I don't resemble Mom!

115
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,260
You're right. Definitely not her.

116
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,720
You guys are talking about me, aren't you?

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,210
- Yes!
- Yes!

118
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,050
What are they doing this early?

119
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,290
How many glasses did I have?

120
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,190
Aunt, let's grab dinner this weekend. I'll call you.

121
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,970
Okay. You don't have to if you're busy.

122
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,460
- Okay. I'll get going!
- Okay!

123
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
Have a good day!

124
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,120
How much longer is she going to be in bed?

125
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,040
Hey!

126
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,450
Wow, this is a really old house.

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,500
Does someone still live there?

128
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,680
- Excuse me!
- Move!

129
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
Move!

130
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,040
Go up there quickly!

131
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,080
I'll go ahead and check.

132
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,380
Hello, Team 3 Leader.

Are you on your way to work?

135
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,290
Yes.

136
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,620
Is she Ms. Lee Na Gyeong, by chance?

137
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,750
From the special protection case?

138
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,650
Yes, she does this whenever she doesn't get attention.

139
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,410
She makes a scene by calling the reporters, too.

140
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,140
Excuse me.

141
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,830
Excuse me.

142
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,740
I got her! I got her!

143
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,450
Let's take her down safely!

144
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,390
Please carry her!

145
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,410
- Hop in!
- Get in the car.

146
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,340
- Let's go.
- Get in.

147
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,940
Please move!

148
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,790
- Step aside!
- Move!

149
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,680
Move!

150
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,200
It went through. Right?

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,320
Thank you!

152
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,850
Fighting!

153
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,210
Are you not interested in going back?

154
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,320
This is something I've been curious about for a while.

155
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,000
You know?

156
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,810
How come you're...

157
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,910
so simple about everything?

158
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,540
Huh?

159
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,940
It's not hard.

160
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,400
It's not that it's really easy, either.

161
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,350
Do you want to know?

162
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,820
Oh, he wasn't curious. He was roasting me.

163
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,070
- Hey.
- I won't.

164
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,960
I won't ask questions like that. Okay?

165
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,910
I'll get going. Carry on!

166
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,930
Look at this! Look at this! This is kind of fun.

Not you.

170
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,440
Isn't he too young?

171
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,020
But I can handle it.

172
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,400
So cute.

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,930
Did you get this app for Dr. Park, too?

184
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,500
Yes. Why?

185
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,280
You should've told me!

186
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,000
I really don't understand.

187
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,690
I filed a lawsuit against Ms. Na Gyeong Ran's son just now!

188
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,610
I just couldn't let it slide!

189
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,300
We must show that justice is still alive for a scoundrel like him!

190
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,730
You did well, Dr. Park! You're the best!

191
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,730
- Nice!
- Of course! Justice needs to stay alive!

192
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,520
He was really scary. That's so great!

193
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,370
Yes!

194
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,610
Also, the police will call you to interview you as material witnesses.

195
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,490
Make sure to answer it

196
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,600
and take turns for the interview so it doesn't affect our patients.

197
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,880
- Yes!
- Yes!

198
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,280
Great!

199
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,170
How very proper!

200
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,980
Nice!

201
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,750
Please bring me some tea.

202
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,720
Yes, Doctor!

203
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,000
- I'll delete this app.
- Why?

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,420
I liked Dr. Park's profile!

205
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,620
You said you canceled!

206
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,890
- I feel so icky!
- I get paid based on the number of people!

207
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,240
You named me as the person who recommended it.

208
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,600
- Ms. Jeong!
- Ms. Jeong!

209
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,550
Well, Mr. Yoo. Are you on this, too?

210
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,930
No, my dad...

211
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,820
You can't get family trees messed up like this!

212
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,650
Okay, okay, okay! Instead of doing this here,

213
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,560
let's talk over some tea!

214
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,930
What tea?

215
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,100
Once we start talking...

216
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
- Good work.
- Good work, sir!

217
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,240
Good work.

218
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,730
W-We're getting some blood sausage soup.

219
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,140
Do you not eat stuff like that?

220
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,030
Pardon?

221
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,580
M-Me?

222
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,310
We're having soju, too.

223
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,320
Deal.

224
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,980
I mean, I'd like to.

225
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,500
Go get changed, then, and...

226
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,070
Yes!

227
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,850
Sir, we're here!

228
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,740
- Welcome!
- Hello.

229
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,940
All right.

230
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,970
Here we go...

231
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,730
Okay.

232
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,770
Well, why don't you have a glass, too?

233
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,460
Chief Eun can't drink, can he?

234
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,840
Well, let's raise our glasses first.

235
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,570
Cheers!

236
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,430
How do you like the job?

237
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
Do you like it okay?

238
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,420
Can I be honest?

239
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,970
Geez, she's so annoying.

240
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,850
Come on, Captain Jang!

241
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,010
Hold on.

242
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,550
Let's sync up first.

243
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,480
You followed me!

244
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,920
You got off the bus with me, too!

245
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,400
Seriously, you crazy bitch!

246
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,330
You acted suspiciously first! Why are you cussing at me?

247
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,150
What's going on?

248
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,950
Ms. Lee, calm down and look at me.

249
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you recognize me?

250
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,740
Yes, yes! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

251
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,200
Who are you, lady? Do you know this crazy bitch?

252
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,760
There must've been a misunderstanding.

253
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,800
It's because she's sick. Please understand and leave.

254
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,830
Stay home if you're sick! Why are you roaming around?

255
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,610
I'm sorry! Please just let it go.

256
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,000
Is this bitch your daughter, by chance?

257
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,700
Yes! She's my daughter. So what?

258
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,680
Huh?

259
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,340
Are you serious right now...

260
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,380
Just get lost, you crazy bastard! Seriously...

261
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,710
What do we do? What do we do?

262
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,850
What awful luck is this!

263
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,270
It's okay, it's okay.

264
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,350
You must've been scared.

265
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,670
It's okay.

266
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,070
I think it's unfair!

267
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:31,690
Look. To be honest, I'm not really sure what I did so wrong.

268
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,120
As a police officer and as a citizen,

269
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,710
I just did what I was supposed to do, but—

270
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,050
Team Leader, should we switch seats...

271
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,490
Hold on! Is it our fault, then?

272
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,040
We find it unfair, too!

273
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,160
But still...

274
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,180
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,130
What did you say? I can't hear you!

276
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,580
I said I'm sorry!

277
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,330
Yes, I went too far by sending the anonymous letter.

278
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,580
It's because I don't know how to stay in my lane, but!

279
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,730
But the ones who need to be blamed the most...

280
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,820
is them. Right there.

281
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,310
Huh? That's where the HQ is.

282
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,230
That's right!

283
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,370
Team Leader Kim?

284
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,890
Officer Jo, you're smart!

285
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,620
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

286
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,060
She still acts superior.

287
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,870
I'm telling you. She is annoying.

288
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,040
Do you think you're not annoying, then?

289
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,540
Me?

290
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,310
Did you know I'm older than you?

291
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,890
Oh, really?

292
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,240
I didn't know! Because you're so childish.

293
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,940
Hey! I...

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,750
like you.

295
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,330
Why?

296
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,710
I still don't like you so much.

297
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,980
Team Leader, how about we switch seats?

298
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,810
But if you like me...

299
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,020
Cheers.

300
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,140
You're my type.

301
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,050
- Unni.
- I admit it.

302
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,580
Team Leader Kim!

303
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,840
Why are you like, "Chief Eun, Chief Eun" to Chief Eun,

304
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,030
but why do you always call me "Team Leader Kim"?

305
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,810
Team Leader Kim? Does it always have to be like that?

306
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,050
Why do you treat me differently?

307
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,260
Keep it consistent!

308
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,890
Team Leader Kim sounds better than Team Leader Eun. Right?

309
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,820
Team Leader Kim? Team Leader Kim!

310
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,760
Cheers to Team Leader Kim.

311
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,110
Wow, you can't hold liquor.

312
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,440
I haven't even started yet.

313
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,470
By the way, Officer Oh.

314
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,450
Did you know we're the same age?

315
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,830
Probably?

316
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,380
Are we friends from now on, then?

317
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,210
Really? Are we really friends?

318
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,720
There's no turning back!

319
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,310
Let's raise glasses as friends.

320
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,020
- Let's go to a karaoke bar!
- Karaoke bar?

321
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,430
Geez, I haven't been to one in forever!

322
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,580
Did you want to come with us?

323
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,300
You should just let your teammates

324
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,890
- have fun on their own sometimes!
- You're not so quick.

325
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,970
I take back that I said I like you earlier.

326
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,370
I'm not quick? I'm extremely quick.

327
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,470
Okay, okay! Let's drink our last glass and move on to the next round.

328
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,820
Kim Jin Hee is known for being quick!

329
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,810
How could you try to go to a karaoke bar without me?

330
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,910
Wait, hold on!

331
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,820
Be careful and come quickly.

332
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,150
I approve of you!

333
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,220
Well, whether you approve or not...

334
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,190
Careful!

335
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,640
Let's go.

336
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,540
Wait! Hold on, hold on!

337
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,030
Huh? What's going on?

338
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,500
Give me your hand.

339
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,610
- My hand?
- Yes.

340
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,340
Well...

341
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,890
Go straight for 50 meters.

342
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,540
Turn right on the first street.

343
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,830
The first, second, third, and fourth one is the official residence.

344
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,400
You'll know when you get there.

345
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,690
You'd think, "I need to put this key in here."

346
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,620
All right, then.

347
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,060
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

348
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,430
- Carry on.
- Hold on!

349
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,540
I approve of you!

350
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,590
Well, it's not that! Wait...

351
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,400
Let's go. Let's go.

352
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Gosh, I'm dying right now!

353
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,370
I think I'm going to collapse!

354
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,580
Is this it? Huh?

355
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,320
Wait, gosh!

356
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,190
My back!

357
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,280
♫ Hey, babe... ♫

358
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,160
What's this? Gosh...

359
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,200
♫ I'm so quick, I know everything ♫

360
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,820
Geez, hold on!

361
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,750
It hurts! Gosh!

362
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,240

00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:38,680
Of course. You're supposed to talk to people in person.

545
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,970
I shouldn't have gotten lured into stuff like this!

546
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,970
Should I delete it for you?

547
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,380
How do you delete—

548
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,340
Here.

549
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,120
Delete.

550
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,100
I wasted too much time on an illusion like this!

551
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,230
I should've read a few lines in a book instead!

552
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:15,440
I forgot that I'm a high-minded person for a moment.

553
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,620
Of course. You're so high-minded.

554
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,400
Ms. Kim,

555
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,860
this has to stay a secret.

556
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,260
Of course, Dr. Park.

557
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,150
Try to listen to Ms. Lee Kang Sook when she talks.

558
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,360
You just need to say, "Yes, yes."

559
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,250
And don't compliment Ms. Jang Eun Shim's daughter-in-law!

560
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,450
Why don't you know how to read the air?

561
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,110
I got so scared.

562
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,390
Why?

563
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,050
You know...

564
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,950
Dr. Park told me...

565
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,430
[Love for me]

566
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,360
Is he seriously out of his mind?

567
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,640
What is it?

568
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,240
Is something going on?

569
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,990
Don't stop me today.

570
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,190
I'll delete this.

571
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,670
Ms. Kim! Try to hold back!

572
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,330
- Well—
- Don't stop me!

573
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,600
- Please.
- Why should I hold back?

574
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,080
Is he out of his mind?

575
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,890
I'm sure he did it without realizing it.

576
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,700
Unni, Unni! Please...

577
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,330
No. No! Delete it!

578
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,000
Hey, Kim Jin Hee! Come out. We're drinking.

579
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,910
I don't care! Just leave early and come out!

580
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,410
Jin Hee!

581
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,340
What? Did you come, too, Aunt?

582
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,630
You should've told me! I would've come sooner!

583
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,100
I know you're busy.

584
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,380
What would you like? Let's get more.

585
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,600
I want broth. Should we have a mussel soup?

586
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,840
A mussel soup, please!

587
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,900
Why aren't you going home already?

588
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm here to fill in for you!

589
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,950
Why do you ignore your mom's calls?

590
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,740
When did I ignore her? I said I'd be late.

591
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,960
Tell me, Mom.

592
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,830
You ignored me!

593
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,600
She's drunk right now.

594
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,050
Stop playing your daughter.

595
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,680
Oh! Chief!

596
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,330
My gosh, it's so nice to see you!

597
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,890
Are you on your way home?

598
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,820
- Yes.
- He said he's going home.

599
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,620
He said he is. Mom!

600
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,390
- No, no.
- He's on his way home.

601
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,000
He needs to go home.

602
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,750
Have a seat here.

603
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,080
Excuse me!

604
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,610
Another soju glass, please!

605
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,820
- Well, I—
- Mom.

606
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,540
He might have another plan. Why are you doing this?

607
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,630
- Chief.
- Yes.

608
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,510
Do you have a plan?

609
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,260
Well, no, I don't, but—

610
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,490
He said he doesn't!

611
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,810
Say hello, everyone.

612
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,280
This is Jin Hee's boss.

613
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,940
Eun Jae Won. Right?

614
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,370
- Yes, that's right.
- Nice to meet you.

615
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,710
I'm Kim Mi Jeong. Jin Hee's aunt.

616
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,120
Yes.

617
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,100
I'm Kim Jin Soo.

618
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,680
- Nice to meet you.
- He's Jin Hee's first love.

619
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,140
Jin Hee got dumped! Totally!

620
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,380
Mom, drink some water. Try to sober up.

621
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,800
- Have some.
- Yes.

622
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,100
We have to drink together on a day like this.

623
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,480
Are you celebrating something?

624
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,180
No, I feel unbelievably lonely today.

625
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,380
We should drink, then.

626
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,260
Cheers!

627
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,910
Chief! You're disappointing me so much!

628
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,270
Pardon? Why?

629
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,510
You're supposed to look at the other person when you drink!

630
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,820
You have to pace yourself.

631
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,640
- I see...
- Slowly like this.

632
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,000
I knew he looked familiar!

633
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,940
He's Jin Hee's guy from the police academy. Right?

634
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,410
- Aunt.
- No?

635
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,910
Right! I saw him in the photos!

636
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,320
Right, right?

637
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,780
That guy from the police academy!

638
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,260
I knew it!

639
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,060
I never called you that guy.

640
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,590
Mom and Aunt are just saying that.

641
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,920
I never called you that, Senior.

642
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,660
For some reason, the moment I saw you,

643
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,870
I felt so comfortable with you.

644
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,560
That was because you were that guy from the police academy.

645
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,470
Come to think of it, you're a similar type as the men my daughter dated.

646
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,750
Yes, yes.

647
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,320
Mom?

648
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,570
- That's right!
- Aunt!

649
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,910
It's true!

650
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,720
Including the son of a bitch, Jin Soo.

651
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,590
Gosh, are you okay?

652
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,500
Yes.

653
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,600
Here.

654
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,410
Thank you.

655
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,140
Chief.

656
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,660
By chance, do you have an older brother or a cousin?

657
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,450
- Mom!
- Hey, Kim Eun Mi!

658
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:05,060
I can do two years older at the oldest and ten years younger at the youngest.

659
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,660
She's just joking!

660
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,100
You don't have to take it seriously.

661
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,690
What do you mean? I'm dead serious.

662
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,440
That's enough! Mom.

663
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,500
You should play in your territory.

664
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,380
Don't invade mine.

665
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,560
Territory, my foot.

666
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,830
No matter how much you run, you're still on my palm.

667
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,590
You think you're the only one with a palm? I have one, too.

668
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,700
Just don't do it if I tell you not to.

669
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,430
Thank you.

670
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,500
Let me see your palm. Is it bigger than mine?

671
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,430
Let me see, let me see!

672
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,500
If you don't mind me drinking soda, should we clank glasses?

673
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,490
- Let's.
- Nice to meet you.

674
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,110
Cheers!

675
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,330
You're on my palm.

676
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,370
Drink up.

677
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,580
Geez. Someone's passed out drunk again!

678
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,470
Do they think the park is their living room?

679
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,630
Excuse me!

680
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,830
What everyone was fearing ended up happening.

681
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,700
A scared citizen who was requesting help

682
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,760
ended up being found as a cold dead body like this.

683
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,890
EJC Broadcasting Company wishes the victim rests in peace

684
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,200
and sincerely hopes for her family to find comfort.

685
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,700
- Is it murder?
- It's being investigated.

686
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,930
Why do you let us wait here instead of going in?

687
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,770
Tell us what's going on right now.

688
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,360
Please, just once!

689
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,960
Thanks for your hard work. Long time no see.

690
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,200
Anyway, this will be a headache.

691
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,920
What's the deal, anyway?

692
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,650
Anyway...

693
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,920
How could this happen?

694
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,280
A baseball hat and a hoodie.

695
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:19,340
The one who saved the victim in the desperate situation wasn't the police but a fellow citizen.

696
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,310
The police dismissed the victim's request for special protection twice.

697
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,280
They were unfriendly when I made the request already.

698
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,500
They said I can't because there's no evidence.

699
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,800
They didn't believe me as if I were lying.

700
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,210
The police can't be like that!

701
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,920
I am so scared.

702
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,390
Whose side are the police on, exactly?

703
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,670
Gosh! How did that young thing end up that way?

704
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,710
I can't imagine how her parents feel. I feel terrible.

705
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,250
I can't even imagine!

706
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,790
Imagining sending my child away like that—

707
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,390
Why would you imagine that!

708
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,420
I'll rip off that mouth of yours!

709
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,010
The police are being criticized regarding the special protection—

710
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,260
It's okay.

711
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,860
Coffee? Do you want some?

712
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,280
Well, yes.

713
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,280
Thank you.

714
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,180
What are you doing?

715
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,150
Mom, should we get a CCTV?

716
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,710
Don't you know how much that costs?

717
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,860
We'll pay for it in installments.

718
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,870
Don't spend money on unnecessary things!

719
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,240
Do you have that much money sitting around?

720
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,800
Why do I feel so upset?

721
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,210
Of course, you feel that way.

722
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,540
You even helped her and talked to her.

723
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,230
How about you? Are you okay?

724
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,150
What if you get criticized again?

725
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,710
I don't even work there anymore.

726
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,090
Okay.

727
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,320
Mom,

728
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,090
you're sure the culprit didn't see you that day. Right?

729
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,700
Of course! I attacked from behind

730
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,640
and ran away without looking back.

731
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,110
I feel so terrible for her.

732
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,900
Isn't he taking an upskirt photo?

733
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,850
Who?

734
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,500
I don't know. It's hard to tell.

735
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,410
Maybe not.

736
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,110
- My gosh!
- Are you okay—

737
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,880
What are you doing?

738
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,640
See? See?

739
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,610
Team Leader!

740
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,050
Excuse me.

741
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,270
I'm Team Leader Kim Jin Hee of Namchon Police Station.

742
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,700
Could I have a look at your phone?

743
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,220
May I ask what this is about?

744
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,260
I'll explain after checking.

745
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,790
It'd only take a second.

746
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm sorry. My bus is here.

747
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,770
Show me your phone first.

748
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,050
Then I'll let you go.

749
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,510
I don't want to! Why would you look at my phone—

750
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,960
You should come with us, then.

751
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,900
How many times do I have to tell you?

752
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:55,000
I was hit without even knowing why!

753
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,610
That's why you should show me your phone.

754
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:02,830
It'd be over if you just showed it to me. Why won't you?

755
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:10,070
By chance, is there a reason you can't show us your phone?

756
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,190
Excuse me, sir.

757
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,200
What if you just show it to me?

758
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,990
Could you do that?

759
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,600
Well...

760
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,560
Okay, then.

761
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,420
Thank you!

762
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,990
There's nothing on it, as you said.

763
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,850
I'm sorry.

764
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,370
Tell her to apologize formally.

765
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,060
Who does she think I am?

766
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,610
Excuse me for a sec.

767
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,760
There's nothing on it.

768
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,570
Maybe he already deleted it. I'm sure—

769
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,550
Let him go.

770
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:09,360
By the way, he wants you to apologize to him.

771
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,750
Just apologize. That's the right thing to do in this case.

772
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,380
Are you sure there's really nothing on it?

773
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,610
I'm sorry.

774
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,700
I'll use the bathroom for a second.

775
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,560
Yes, it's on the second floor.

776
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,670
- Hello!
- Hello!

777
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,220
Aunt!

778
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,170
We're finally saying hello properly!

779
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,850
Nice to meet you. Jin Hee's doing well. Right?

780
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,340
What's all this?

781
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,770
Jin Hee's grandma sent these to share with everyone at the police station.

782
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,070
Look at all this!

783
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,650
When did she prepare all this?

784
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:16,910
Thank you!

785
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,770
She grew these herself.

786
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,220
- Wow!
- They're sweet. Have them for dessert.

787
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,340
They're so precious.

788
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,740
There's so much. Gosh!

789
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,670
Have some desserts afterward, too. They're fruits.

790
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,550
Ma'am, could you come to the counseling office?

791
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,480
Could I wash my hands first?

792
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,950
- Yes!
- I have food on my hands.

793
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,880
- Yes, go ahead.
- Isn't it sweet?

794
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,690
It's so good!

795
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,070
So sweet! Try some!

796
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,610
Mom.

797
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,910
What's going on?

798
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,160
- I told you Park Sang Goo sued him. Right?
- Yes.

799
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,410
I'd be interviewed as a witness, but Chief Eun

800
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,540
said he'd let me be interviewed here instead.

801
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,730
Isn't he such a nice person?

802
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,700
It's so good.

803
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:24,420
Why don't you have some with us?

804
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,300
No thanks, I'm busy.

805
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,400
You have no idea. There's blood everywhere.

806
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,160
I think God helped you by getting you demoted then.

807
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,620
Why do I feel so uneasy about this?

808
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,900
I feel like something will happen soon.

809
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,910
Oh, Noona! Cop noona!

810
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,210
Oh, hello.

811
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,900
You know, the security light?

812
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,920
The security light?

813
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,960
Hold on, Tae Gyeong. What about it?

814
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,790
It's okay right now, but it flickers sometimes.

815
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:29,430
It shut off and didn't come on for hours last time.

816
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:31,890
Oh, really?

817
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,560
I'll ask them to have a look at it again.

818
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,450
Thank you for letting me know.

819
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,170
Thank you. Take care!

820
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,410
Yes.

821
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,820
Okay! Yes.

822
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,190
I'm Kim Jin Hee of Team 2!

823
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,360
I'm in the residential area near Jangmi Villa!

824
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,680
Behind the Daehan Bank!

825
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,230
Please send a police car here!

826
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,700
I'll keep the phone on!

827
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,600
Who the hell are you?

828
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,230
Who are you, you bastard!

829
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,410
♫ Want to be free ♫

830
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:57,150
♫ I want to imagine my life without you ♫

831
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,990
♫ I want to fly ♫

832
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,440
[Not Others]

833
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,020
Why do you always come back injured?

834
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,810
That's why you have such poor reflexes.

835
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,390
You think I'm a joke, don't you?

836
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,990
- A little.
- Hey!

837
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,310
But I very much prefer it that way.

838
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,030
Don't you remember, by chance?

839
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,580
I'm not sure how I'm feeling, either.

840
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,060
What kind of man is he, anyway?

841
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,410
He's so annoying, but I get curious if I don't see him.

842
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,210
We found a suspect for that case.

843
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,930
Follow my mom around for a while.

844
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,050
He might be a suspect in the murder in our neighborhood!

845
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:36,650
♫ I was just dreaming, that's all ♫
