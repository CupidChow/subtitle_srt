♫ Since I met you, I laughed because of you ♫

359
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:06,586
And that bastard transferred to a different school

360
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,576
and the girl was left alone. It's a common story.

The blood sausage is so good!

364
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,956
The liver is better.

365
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,056
What are you saying? Blood sausage is the best.

366
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:25,506
Since then, I've always been her roommate.

367
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:28,866
Your younger brother is so cute.

368
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,870
Is that so?

369
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,916
Let's go, Brother.

370
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:42,660
She never had anyone else but me.

371
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,416
You can't be serious.

372
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,960
Why did you live like that?

373
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,356
What the!

374
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:01,636
What? Why didn't the alarm go off?

375
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,986
Why haven't you left?

376
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:29,846
Well...

377
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:33,586
I-I took the day off.

378
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,576
- All of a sudden?
- Yes.

379
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,516
It just worked out that way.

380
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:43,516
Hey, hey, hey! Should we hang out in the evening, then?

381
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:47,296
Let's get food and watch the movie we didn't get to watch.

382
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,236
I have a plan.

383
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:50,556
With whom?

384
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,596
It's someone you don't know.

385
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:54,376
Are you going out in the afternoon?

386
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,566
Why?

387
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:57,376
I wanted to start the washer before I went.

388
00:24:57,376 --> 00:25:00,896
I want you to hang the laundry if you go out late.

389
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:02,546
Okay.

390
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,556
"Okay."

391
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:08,556
Seriously.

392
00:25:33,056 --> 00:25:37,016
How strange. Why do my panties keep going missing?

393
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,946
Hey! Did you chew it up?

394
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:45,506
How strange.

Did you do laundry yesterday?

400
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:01,826
You should've looked first!

401
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,626
Why are you taking it out? Just wash it again.

402
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:07,346
These are colored, and these are white!

403
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:10,576
Just wash it and use the lint remover!

404
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,466
You don't care about water and electricity bills, do you?

405
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:15,386
Forget it. I'll hang them. Go to work.

406
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:17,116
Come on! I'll do it!

407
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:20,216
- I said I'll do it!
- I'll do it...

Wait, sir!

409
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:05,836
Don't look at it and just hang it next to you.

- No, you go.

You go down.

You were...

443
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:50,836
out of hazelnut coffee yesterday. Did you get more?

444
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,186
Of course!
