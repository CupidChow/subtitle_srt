00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,360
Huh? Why are you home?

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,500
You said you'd be home late after meeting a friend.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,840
I wanted to do the dishes first because there was so much.

00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,440

You date someone else.

Why do you always take flowers from him?

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,570
He gives them to me, though. Am I supposed to toss them?

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,290
I think that guy likes you.

Isn't he a nice guy?

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,420
So what if he is?

Don't think about anything else

112
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,810

You have to rest more. You have to.

118
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,700
No, I already took four days off.

The moment he finds out about us,

123
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,490
I have to either quit my job or say goodbye to you.

124
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,540
I don't want to do either.

125
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,100
So don't cross the line.

127
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,720

This smells so good, Ms. Kim.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,640
What did you do on your trip exactly that you're in that condition?

136
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,730
Maybe you have the flu.

137
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,950
This is no good.

138
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,720
I'll give this to Dr. Park.

139
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,600

Ms. Kim.

148
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,080
I was...

149
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,720
contemplating whether I should say this or not.

150
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,250
But I can't help it.

151
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,000
I need to make this clear once.

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,690
Make what clear?

153
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,600
The bridge of love.

154
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,820
Sang Goo of my life.

155
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,490
No.

156
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,870
It's "the emergency exit of my life."

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,480
Listen to me carefully, Ms. Kim.

158
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,010
I'm the director of the hospital

159
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,100
and you're...

160
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,660
Ms. Kim.

161
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,150
- Pardon?
- Let's call it quits.

162
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,850
I won't say anymore.

163
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,880
I'll say no to this.

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
I think you already know why.

165
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,060
Can't believe you said, "Sang Goo of my life."

166
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,460
Why don't you just let everyone know?

167
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,600
Geez, she's making it so hard to work together.

168
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,400
I turned the switch on. It's bed No. 8.

169
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,470
What's wrong?

170
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,030
A was B's ex-boyfriend

171
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,490
and he's been stalking B constantly, even after splitting up.

172
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,550
The police said they've been searching for him as the most probable suspect for B's murder.

173
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,260
It turns out the victim of the assault,

174
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,910
a woman in her 40s, had rescued B from A in the past once.

175
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,000
The case is closed.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,560
Woosook Patrol Division is partying right now.

177
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,440
Their chief constable even gave everyone a bonus.

178
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,700
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

179
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,020
Why are you jealous of that?

180
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,190
I'm more jealous of getting promoted.

181
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,710
We could've caught him.

182
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,550
I guess I'm a tiny bit jealous.

183
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,830
Because it was our jurisdiction.

184
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,980
Mr. Eun.

185
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,370
Let's have a team dinner tonight.

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,610
We couldn't get together due to being on alert and whatnot.

187
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,740
Yes. Let's do it unless there's something on the schedule.

188
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,890
Huh? I haven't seen this person in a while.

189
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,550
After doing a search and seizure of the suspect's phone,

190
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,160
A watched the video of the victim saving B multiple times

191
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,510
and figured out the victim's daily route.

192
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,740
This footage was broadcasted in order to find the victim...

193
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,420
Yes, this is Eun Jae Won.

194
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,290
The police are currently protecting the victim's identity and restricting the contact...

195
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,940
- Hello, Chief—
- You punk, come here immediately!

196
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,370
You bastard. What did my mom do to you exactly? You!

197
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,170
You punk. Do you know how difficult it was to take down these articles?

198
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,010
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,800
I heard your mother was the victim that day.

200
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,820
Yes.

201
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,710
Why do I have to hear about this from another department?

202
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,380
Eun Jae Won, your chief constable, was even the one who signed your mother's testimony.

203
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,170
He was just trying to make it easy for my mom and me.

204
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,390
I told you not to get close to Eun Jae Won.

205
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,630
That's my business.

206
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,680
You punk. After being sent off for a few months,

207
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,440
you can't even tell poop apart from soybean paste.

208
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,540
How many times did I tell you to stay put quietly?

209
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,570
Don't act out, Kim Jin Hee. Just don't.

210
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,440
If you want to come back in a year as planned.

211
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,640
Aren't you going to answer me?

212
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,570
Yes, sir.

213
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,630
There's an HQ reunion today. Make sure to come.

214
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,790
You have to show your face more at times like this.

215
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,690
Our team is having dinner tonight, too.

216
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,080
So what?

217
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,220
We're having a team dinner, too. That comes first.

218
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,780
You'd be seeing them for less than a year. Why care about them?

219
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,310
Move. Geez.

220
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,450
[Mom]
Did you try calling Eun Jae Won?

221
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,590
I gave him hell.

222
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,730
He wouldn't have listened if I had talked nicely.

223
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,050
He needs to be beaten up a bit.

224
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,610
He still has a long way to go.

225
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,690
By the way,

226
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,910
what did Senior Eun do that was so terrible?

227
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,220
Hey, you...

228
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,210
He behaved poorly. Very poorly.

229
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,410
He thought nothing of his seniors.

230
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,200
He should be given hell just for that.

231
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,220
I'm sorry, but I think I need to excuse myself.

232
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,360
While I'm at it, I'll take her with me as well.

233
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,420
- Get up.
- Leave, okay? Leave.

234
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,460
- Enjoy your meal.
- Let's eat.

235
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,150
Yes, Mother. I'm waiting outside right now.

236
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,670
I'll be right there.

237
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,150
Young Hoon.

238
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,990
- I'll be right there—
- Young Hoon, it's Auntie.

239
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,200
Hey, come on. I'll be right there. Okay.

240
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,200
Hey, why did you have to say that?

241
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,210
- You knew they'd give you hell.
- Isn't that the taxi?

242
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,200
- I was worried—
- Get in.

243
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,060
- Go now. Young Hoon is waiting.
- Okay.

244
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,590
I'm off.

245
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,900
- See you.
- Call me later.

246
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,250
Okay, bye.

247
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,910
What time are you coming home?

248
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,640
[What time are you coming home?]

249
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,790
I know I gave birth to her, but she's really something.

250
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,430
Do you want to come by if you haven't had dinner?

251
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,550
Let's eat together.

252
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,840
Oppa, turn the car around. Let's have dinner.

253
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,700
Why? Where are we going?

254
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,180
You're not feeling well. Just get something delivered to your home.

255
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,490
Oppa, I had physical therapy from head to toe.

256
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Let's stop by the flower shop first.

257
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,990
- I'm here.
- Hey! Welcome!

258
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,330
Come here, come here.

259
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,180
Here.

260
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,300
Okay. Drink some first.

261
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,110
My turn.

262
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,100
Have some, too, Captain.

263
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,870
No, no, I have to be on support duty.

264
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,830
Drink quickly, and let's have fun.

265
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,950
Pardon? You've been on support duties a lot.

266
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,020
Today, too? Aren't you tired?

267
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,660
Why would I be tired? I'm just getting started.

268
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,010
I have to pay for my youngest's education

269
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,840
and I have to marry off my oldest...

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,330
I have to get purses for my wife, too.

271
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,930
Wow, I'm so touched.

272
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,690
Give me another glass.

273
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,600
Of course.

274
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,070
Where's Chief, by the way?

275
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,440
He's not feeling well. He went home already.

276
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,070
So you have to have fun on behalf of him today.

277
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,800
Drink quickly.

278
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,920
Okay. Go, go.

279
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,520
♫ Nothing is going on with me ♫

280
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,020
♫ There was nothing between us from the get-go ♫

281
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,960
♫ Can't you just let me go like that? ♫

282
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,340
♫ You have to forget about me ♫

283
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,350
♫ I know it won't be easy to do that ♫

284
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:19,620
♫ Why does my heart break from knowing you? ♫

285
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
How tall are you?

286
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,990
Pardon?

287
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,100
How tall are you?

288
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,400
173cm!

289
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,010
Why?

290
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,300
It's nothing. I was curious.

291
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:39,400
♫ Don't you cling onto me ever again ♫

292
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,880
♫ I have forgotten all about love ♫

293
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,360
Team Leader Kim! Team Leader Kim! Team Leader Kim!

294
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,870
Team Leader Kim! Team Leader Kim!

295
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,970
I picked them for you, Mi Jeong.

296
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,850
I heard you like white roses.

297
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,690
How could you barge in like this?

298
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,380
Because you're the most precious and my only friend in the world.

299
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,400
I just ought to...

300
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,860
You didn't have to say hello to me.

301
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,360
You should've just kept dating. You'll break up soon, anyway.

302
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,110
If so, why do you even eat? You'd be eating again anyway.

303
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,470
How is that the same as eating?

304
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,370
I wanted to make sure...

305
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,190
I get your approval as Eun Mi's boyfriend.

306
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,460
Formally.

307
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,700
How do you trust a man who ran away because he feared his parents?

308
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,540
Right! Do your parents know you're back together with Eun Mi?

309
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,740
See?

310
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,240
See how he can't answer?

311
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Do you get it now?

312
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,570
You're done the moment his parents find out.

313
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,400
You should at least know that, dummy.

314
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,610
That's not going to happen.

315
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,120
We haven't been in touch for over a decade.

316
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,850
Why haven't you told me that?

317
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,110
Cutting ties with parents isn't something to brag about.

318
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,690
Okay. Let's have her eat dinner.

319
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,840
It's way past mealtime.

320
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,030
What would you like?

321
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,540
Excuse me.

322
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,210
Don't people call you clueless?

323
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,670
Me?

324
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,420
No, I've never been told that.

325
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,250
Not at all.

326
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,050
This one. I want this and this together.

327
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,750
This?

328
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,560
Senior!

329
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,130
Hey!

330
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,990
Chief Constable!

331
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,720
Eun! Jae! Won!

332
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,150
Huh? There he is.

333
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,650
Would you like some beer with me?

334
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,980
Why are you taking your socks off?

335
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,080
They feel stuffy.

336
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,900
Don't be like that and go home.

337
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll get you a taxi.

338
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,050
No, I'm not going.

339
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,850
Hey!

340
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,960
Senior.

341
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,990
Seriously.

342
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,940
Geez.

343
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,090
He's so handsome.

344
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,520
But he's so mean to me with a face like this.

345
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,400
Why didn't you come to the team dinner?

346
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,560
Because I had a lot to do.

347
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,700
You're lying.

348
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,590
I mean it.

349
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,310
You got a call from the HQ today, didn't you?

350
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,970
What did they say to you, exactly?

351
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,720
Why won't you answer me?

352
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,580
I came because I was worried.

353
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,980
Gosh, seriously.

354
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,770
How did you end up...

355
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,590
getting ostracized by your seniors?

356
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,540
Even I survived while being called a lunatic. Why did you...

357
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,340
Senior, I'm...

358
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,390
a selfish person.

359
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,090
So my mom and I come first.

360
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:08,370
So even if I act like I don't know you later,

361
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,150
don't speak badly of me.

362
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,120
Okay?

363
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,310
No one blames you for living like that.

364
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,580
It's natural. Be selfish.

365
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,130
You mean it. Right?

366
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,520
You're drunk.

367
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,070
Get up.

368
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,170
Let's go. I'll take you home.

369
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,380
Why are you lying down there?

370
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,700
I partied on behalf of you tonight.

371
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,890
I must've burned 30,000 calories, at least.

372
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,930
I need to rest.

373
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,300
No, no, get up.

374
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,950
- Leave. You can't sleep here—
- Gosh!

375
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,960
It's not even your house.

376
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,180
The official residence is for the employees.

377
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,750
What? Were you still here?

378
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,540
You should've woken me up.

379
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,780
I'll take a shower first.

380
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,360
Hey.

381
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,500
Hey, Kim Jin Hee. Your mother is calling.

382
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Your mother is calling, I said.

383
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,740
The customer is not available.

384
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,840
Fine.

385
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,660
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

386
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,780
Oppa.

387
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,430
Can I visit your place today?

388
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,220
I'm leaving.

389
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,050
Hello.

390
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,990
Team Leader, you're wearing the same outfit as yesterday.

391
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,220
Didn't you go home?

392
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,710
No, I couldn't because I was so drunk last night.

393
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,410
Did you sleep at an inn or something?

394
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,110
No, we have the official residence. Why stay at an inn?

395
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,330
You stayed at the official residence?

396
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,400
Yes. I'll go get changed.

397
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,750
Y-Yes.

398
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,410
There's the official residence. Why spend money?

399
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,740
Don't you agree, Captain Jang?

400
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,120
Hello.

401
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,540
- Hello.
- Good morning.

402
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,880
Did you hear?

403
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,720
The park murderer.

404
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,610
He confessed.

405
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,770
It's totally game over.

406
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,780
Really? When?

407
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,870
While being questioned last night.

408
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,820
That's great.

409
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,380
We don't have to suffer anymore.

410
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,940
Team Leader Kim.

411
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,640
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

412
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,980
Hey, hey! It's the cops.

413
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,390
Shit. We got caught again.

414
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,520
She's pregnant!

415
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,840
She's a slut!

416
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,620
Are you okay?

417
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,380
Get up.

418
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,750
Gong Ga Eul?

419
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,070
Hey.

420
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,330
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

421
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,180
Hey.

422
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,020
Do your parents know?

423
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,540
What the hell?

424
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,150
Hold on.

425
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,290
Call me anytime if you need help.

426
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,830
Gosh, they're like squirrels.

427
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,860
Good work. Aren't they fast?

428
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,190
They're so fast.

429
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,750
What an amazing view.

430
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,930
Have you lived here long?

431
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,180
It hasn't been long.

432
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,230
Have a seat. I'll go get changed.

433
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,400
Can I look around?

434
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,080
Of course. But don't go in that room.

435
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,070
It's a bit of a mess in there.

436
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

437
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,710
Oppa, can I look inside your fridge?

438
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,170
Yes, go ahead.

439
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,450
Oppa, let's have some fruit.

440
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,030
Oppa.

441
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,500
You're not married, by chance, are you?

442
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,870
Why would you ask such a thing?

443
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,070
Of course not.

444
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,470
How about kids?

445
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,800
I don't have any.

446
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,360
Who cooked the food in the fridge, then?

447
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,880
Did you make them or get them from a store?

448
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,520
Never mind.

449
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,640
You probably have a private life, too.

450
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,060
Can I take the galbijjim in the fridge?

451
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,500
You want to? Take it. I'll wrap it up for you.

452
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,770
I like scallion kimchi, too.

453
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,900
I'd love it if you enjoy them at home. I'll wrap everything up for you.

454
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,960
Take them with you and enjoy them together.

455
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,380
Here.

456
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,890
You threw away my business card earlier.

457
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,250
How can I help you?

458
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,400
Lend me some money.

459
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,410
What? What did you say?

460
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,140
I'll get a part-time job and pay you back.

461
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,410
What will you spend it on?

462
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,460
I don't have a place to stay.

463
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,630
Those bitches told the school.

464
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,950
So my family knows everything.

465
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,220
What the heck?

466
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,640
Who are you?

467
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,520
Who are you, Ahjumma?

468
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,510
Say hello. She's the owner of this house.

469
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,320
Hi, how are you?

470
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,850
How do you think I am?

471
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,480
My daughter didn't come home without calling

472
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,980
and she suddenly showed up with a stranger.

473
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,530
Isn't that galbijjim?

474
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,230
Hey. I'll heat it up for you. Wait.

475
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,340
Are you pregnant?

476
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,360
How did you know?

477
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,910
You weren't supposed to tell her.

478
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,250
It's okay.

479
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,910
She got herself in trouble and had me in high school, too.

480
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,000
You little...

481
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,610
Gosh.

482
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,560
How far along are you?

483
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,730
Does your boyfriend know?

484
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,780
Eat a lot.

485
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,890
You can't eat anything for several months once you get morning sickness.

486
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,930
Really?

487
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,760
Wouldn't the baby get hungry if I can't eat anything?

488
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,920
It takes all the remaining nutrition in your body.

489
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,290
It sucks it all out.

490
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,990
Does it hurt a lot when you give birth?

491
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,420
You know the menstrual pain you get?

492
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,530
It's about 20 times worse than that.

493
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,860
No, maybe 25 times worse.

494
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,590
Mom.

495
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,570
You think it's over once you give birth?

496
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,190
The stitches hurt so badly.

497
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,750
You can't even sit still.

498
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,120
- Mom.
- Don't get me started with breastfeeding.

499
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,850
You can't even sleep because you have to breastfeed every two hours.

500
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,530
I had to check her diaper every hour because she was sensitive.

501
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,610
Imagine if the baby gets a fever.

502
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,130
Wow, it drives you crazy. It really does.

503
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,710
They cry all night, so you can't sleep.

504
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,400
I cried with her. I was bawling.

505
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,710
I wasn't really that sensitive.

506
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,640
Didn't you hate her?

507
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,820
I think I'd hate mine so much.

508
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,940
Why would you? They're precious.

509
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,800
They're precious enough to forget the pain and how sick and tired you are.

510
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,600
It's true.

511
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,850
Although she's torturing me by being annoying now.

512
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,660
Were you really scared, too?

513
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,220
How could you not be?

514
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,980
I had to give birth and raise the baby alone.

515
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,580
It was really scary.

516
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,960
I'm not alone.

517
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,220
- Really?
- I have a boyfriend.

518
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,220
We'll raise the baby together.

519
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,540
You're better off than me.

520
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,320
Sounds heavenly.

521
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,730
You have the baby's dad, too.

522
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,630
Hey, Ms. Annoying.

523
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,930
Where is she going to sleep?

524
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,110
I'm a bit sensitive.

525
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,520
I can't sleep when someone else is around.

526
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,510
Okay, fine.

527
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,840
Sleep in the living room.

528
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,030
How dare you crawl in here?

529
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,630
You're so petty.

530
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,370
Keep the door open.

531
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,750
It gets stuffy.

532
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,590
Just leave her.

533
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,880
Let her cry all she wants.

534
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,530
- But still—
- She must be so scared and worried.

535
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,100
She has to cry, at least.

536
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:43,300
♫ The moment I first held you in my arms. I remember then ♫

537
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,270
♫ Very small ♫

538
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,060
Mom.

539
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,230
If it was that scary,

540
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,110
how did you decide to give birth to me?

541
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,350
Crazy bitch. Why ask me that?

542
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,780
♫ Like a dream with you ♫

543
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,020
♫ Like a dream with you ♫

544
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,940
♫ I'll hold you one more time ♫

545
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:25,890
♫ As if we'll meet tomorrow again ♫

546
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:32,700
♫ Good night, good night, good night ♫

547
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:40,180
♫ Good night, good night, good night ♫

548
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,150
What a bitch.

549
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,610
She finished our galbijjim, and she left without saying bye.

550
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,200
Wait for me.

551
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,950
Why are you leaving at this hour?

552
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,930
Because I feel like it. Okay?

553
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,650
What are you doing?

554
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,680
Move.

555
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,160
What are you doing?

556
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,920
It's nothing.

557
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,300
Mom.

558
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,820
What?

559
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,100
You know...

560
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,800
the culprit.

561
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,660
You've seen him a couple of times. Right?

562
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,310
Do you remember how tall he was?

563
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,090
Geez, it's so awful. Don't even bring it up.

564
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,040
Sorry.

565
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,350
Hey, Kim Jin Hee.

566
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,090
Hey!

567
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,110
What's with you?

568
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,170
Are you still upset?

569
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,950
Why would you avoid him? You won't even say hello.

570
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,460
Do you really still think that I was in danger

571
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,570
because he couldn't protect me?

572
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,470
- It's not like that.
- What is it, then?

573
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,330
- I'm just—
- Just what?

574
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,480
I'm embarrassed.

575
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,980
Okay.

576
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,930
Mom. Mom?

577
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,460
By the way, did you hear the rumor?

578
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,310
Our building was sold, apparently.

579
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,380
Did the owner change, then?

580
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,680
I guess you didn't know.

581
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,440
It's a young woman, and I heard she's extremely rude.

582
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,830
She's unbelievably mean, they say.

583
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,430
Did the pediatrician on the second floor move out without renewing the lease

584
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,590
because they got kicked out?

585
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,250
What do we do?

586
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,160
I know. Dr. Park isn't so easygoing, either.

587
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
He can't just let other people win.

588
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,620
I know.

589
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,300
Ms. Kim Mi Jeong.

590
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,150
Hey, call me after the appointment.

591
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,570
Okay.

592
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,750
Let's take the X-ray first. Follow me.

593
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,120
- By the way—
- Yes, do you need something?

594
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,440
Who said the building owner is so horrible?

595
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,880
You see this. Right?

596
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,020
Where things are attached here.

597
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,600
That's the inflamed area.

598
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,110
What caused it? I don't even use my shoulders that much.

599
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,720
It's due to aging.

600
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,230
Pardon? Aging?

601
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,700
Yes. Take a shot before you leave.

602
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,050
I'll prescribe you medicine, too.

603
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,190
Well, I'm just here to get it checked out today.

604
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,040
You have to treat it as soon as possible to recover well.

605
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,130
Well, I'll come next time and—

606
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,050
What happened to the car I scratched?

607
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,660
I didn't get to apologize because I was out of it then.

608
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,210
I'm sorry.

609
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:52,670
I'd be happy to pay for the repair if you send me the bill.

610
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,580
Where did you park today? You couldn't have

611
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,720
parked at the designated spot again.

612
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,210
That's up to me.

613
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,450
How is that up to you?

614
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,090
Those spots are for the renters of the building.

615
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,470
Because I'm the owner of this building.

616
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:12,150
What is it? Now that you saw that awful, mean, and young woman in person,

617
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,110
are you flustered?

618
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,320
Reckless and audacious.

619
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,900
What a dream combination.

620
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,810
It's truly a shame.

621
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,280
Excuse me. Are you serious right now?

622
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,200
Be treated once a week for four weeks for now.

623
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,840
You get a free physical therapy session if you take 10.

624
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,570
Also, there's no discount for the landlord.

625
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,800
You can't be serious.

626
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,650
I won't come back here, then!

627
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,540
What an imprudent person.

628
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,640
What brings you here?

629
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,960
Your mom gave me permission to come here.

630
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
I have something to tell you.

631
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,880
What is it about—

632
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,820
I fully understand...

633
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,950
why you got angry at me.

634
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,490
I would've been like that, too.

635
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,890
My heart was crushed, too. I'm sure it was worse for you.

636
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,980
I understand completely.

637
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,450
I was actually grateful that you got so angry.

638
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:25,620
She must feel so secure having a daughter like you.

639
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,620
So I'm trying to say everything is okay.

640
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,390
I came here to tell you that.

641
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,850
Go inside now.

642
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,650
I'll leave now.

643
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,460
Take care.

644
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,150
He called me "reckless and audacious."

645
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,490
Isn't he crazy?

646
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,960
Seriously, he has no self-awareness.

647
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,130
How do you put up with him?

648
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,810
How did it go?

649
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,320
Yeah. It went well.

650
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,710
You don't have to worry.

651
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,020
That's great. By the way, Oppa,

652
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,020
do you have a lot of free time?

653
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,690
What? Free time?

654
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,110
You know I do.

655
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,620
Why?

656
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,390
Could you bring ice cream to the hospital, then?

657
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,230
Mi Jeong is here.

658
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,190
I want to share it with my coworkers, too.

659
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,780
Call me when you get here. I'll come down.

660
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,540
Get us the expensive and tasty kind.

661
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,660
Okay, got it.

662
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,470
"Expensive and tasty kind."

663
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,100
Whoa! That must be her boyfriend.

664
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,260
How sweet.

665
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,990
Eun Mi.

666
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,450
Here.

667
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,040
Thank you. We'll enjoy it.

668
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,730
Go inside now.

669
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,320
Oppa.

670
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,810
What is it? Do you need something else?

671
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,060
You'd better be good to me.

672
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,080
Y-Yes, I will.

673
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,780
This place hasn't changed since 10 years ago.

674
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,260
This was renovated.

675
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,950
That's the official residence, right?

676
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,830
The boiler used to break all the time.

677
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,430
They changed it last year. It's fine now.

678
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,630
Are you not interested in getting married yet?

679
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,580
Hey, don't you even have a girlfriend?

680
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,430
Gosh, I sent you down here to relax.

681
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,780
You've really been doing nothing but relaxing.

682
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,840
Do you want to come in?

683
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,280
No, I should go.

684
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,010
I noticed that you haven't brought a resignation letter in a while.

685
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,750
So I came by to check in with you.

686
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,810
Hang in there no matter what.

687
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,220
You know what I mean. Right?

688
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,990
I understand why you came here,

689
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:29,930
but I'm not staying here because I changed my mind.

690
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,410
I'm still looking for a reason why I should be a cop.

691
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,960
Okay, I hope you find the reason.

692
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,560
Go inside.

693
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,520
Get home safely, Senior.

694
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,020
Okay.

695
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,530
What are you doing?

696
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,380
I left my socks here. So...

697
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,560
How much did you hear?

698
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,280
The boiler?

699
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,600
You heard everything.

700
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,100
Senior,

701
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,260
the reason why you became a cop is so obvious.

702
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,220
You're too virtuous.

703
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,270
You have to have a materialistic reason.

704
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,100
My reason is to protect my job security.

705
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,530
You need a reason like that to stay even if you were mistreated.

706
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,550
But you're too stiff like this.

707
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,560
Like this.

708
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,810
You know what I mean. Right?

709
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,990
I'm trying so hard. You still won't tell me

710
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,140
why you got fired?

711
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,750
Why did you become a cop, then?

712
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,500
Is job security the only reason?

713
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,360
If I tell you, will you tell me, too?

714
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,820
Let's hear it first.

715
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,630
Okay.

716
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,680
When I was in middle school, I planned to hang out with my friend.

717
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,500
What was I doing? Anyway, I was having one of those really hectic days.

718
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,540
I had so much to do, but Mom came home late

719
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,450
and kept telling me about nothing but men.

720
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,700
This guy did this, and that guy did that.

721
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:35,440
So I was like, "What kind of mom only talks about men?" to her.

722
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,110
I swear to God. I was just expressing annoyance.

723
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,550
But my mom...

724
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,840
I'm home.

725
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,910
Hey, you're home.

726
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:06,000
She was so proud of her precious

727
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,270
pretty hair, but she...

728
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:11,300
cut it short.

729
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,560
Because of the comment I made without thinking...

730
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,110
I don't know why she cared so much about that.

731
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,790
But...

732
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,400
I know...

733
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,640
what her hair...

734
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,210
meant to my mom.

735
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:36,220
It had a huge impact on me.

736
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,270
So I wanted to be good to her, too.

737
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:43,810
I wanted to be enormously supportive of her

738
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:49,510
and protect her as long as I can.

739
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,140
So I studied crazy hard.

740
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,490
And the police academy came up as one of the schools I could go to.

741
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,990
I heard the government was paying for the tuition.

742
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,300
I'd be guaranteed a permanent post after graduation and a pension when I retire.

743
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,030
I didn't think twice about it.

744
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,620
That's how I came all the way here.

745
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,090
There.

746
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,860
It's your turn now, Senior.

747
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,490
Your junior is waiting.

748
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,760
I just...

749
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,680
don't have anything like that.

750
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,880
It's because...

751
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,200
- I'm a son of a bitch.
- Gosh.

752
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,440
You're so unbelievably frustrating.

753
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,250
Goodness, geez. Both your mouth and heart are closed off.

754
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,860
Those are closed off, too.

755
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,050
When will you open those?

756
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,070
What's in there? It's about to rot at this rate.

757
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,590
Hey, you should go home now.

758
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:59,980
Free yourself a bit, please.

759
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,000
Do you need help with that?

760
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,470
I"m really good at stuff like that.

761
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,320
Aren't you going home?

762
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,920
The police academy's idol.

763
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,550
You think your teammates don't know you're doing this. Right?

764
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,110
Everyone knows.

765
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:22,790
They do, and they're worried about you.

766
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,760
Why do you make the people who like you worry?

767
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,310
You can loosen up...

768
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,480
a bit with them.

769
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,020
Don't you think?

770
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,570
So, she didn't come home again?

771
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,610
No.

772
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:52,510
Why don't you drink something refreshing before you go?

773
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,520
I have some time before going to work.

774
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,600
Can I?

775
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,180
Yeah.

776
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,770
By the way,

777
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:16,270
I think we made a mistake.

778
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,620
About what?

779
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:23,960
You called me instead of Jin Hee to the police station that day.

780
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,660
That was the issue from the beginning.

781
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,170
Why do you think I called you there?

782
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,490
Huh?

783
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,550
Oppa, the culprit was walking around aggressively there.

784
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:39,020
Why would I call my daughter to come to such a dangerous place?

785
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,400
I know she's reckless and a cop, but still.

786
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,490
Why?

787
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,340
Are you scared?

788
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:58,580
Or are you disappointed since it means I'm okay if you're in danger?

789
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,780
No. You did the right thing.

790
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,720
If something dangerous or life-threatening happens to you,

791
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,860
make sure to always call me.

792
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,360
Don't ever call Jin Hee. Okay?

793
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,130
Promise.

794
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,580
Come on.

795
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,620
Wait, Eun Mi.

796
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,390
I mean, wait, Eun—

797
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:37,430
♫ Something felt different somehow ♫

798
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,460
♫ Your face is still sweet and friendly ♫

799
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,210
♫ Your discreet smile ♫

800
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,550
Jin Hee!

801
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,400
When did you come home?

802
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,390
Have fun.

803
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:54,190
Don't you dare stay out without calling me again!

804
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,010
That little...

805
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,820
Oppa.

806
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,740
Let's finish it off.

807
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:04,020
♫ Please tell me ♫

808
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,290
♫ Say you love me ♫

809
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,870
I'm so embarrassed.

810
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:10,790
I'm so embarrassed.

811
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,120
It's okay. It happens.

812
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,440
Oppa, put your hand down.

813
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,430
N-No, I feel s-so embarrassed right now.

814
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,280
♫ K-K-Kiss me, L-L-Love me ♫

815
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,320
Tae Gyeong, are you there already?

816
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,660
Order any pasta for me. I'll be right there.

817
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,900
Hey, I can't have lunch with you. There's an emergency.

818
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,200
What emergency?

819
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,770
It's such a mess.

820
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,570
I'm not sure if I should tell you or not.

821
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,110
Hey, keep your mouth shut if you are going to say that.

822
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,540
What is it? You're making me worry.

823
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,320
It has to do with your mom, too. You should know about it.

824
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,960
It has to do with my mom?

825
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,940
The suspect of the park murder changed his testimony.

826
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,150
He's saying he's not the culprit.

827
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,970
He said he didn't kill her.

828
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,000
That means the real culprit is out there.

829
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,540
What's with this case, anyway?

830
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:41,270
Let go of me, you bitch.

831
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:44,330
Do you want to fight properly, you bitch?

832
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,550
Come inside, you loser!

833
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,430
Hey!

834
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,390
Let go.

835
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,220
Hey, bitch!

836
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,030
♫ Want to be free ♫

837
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:30,910
♫ I want to imagine my life without you ♫

838
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,610
♫ I want to fly ♫

839
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,700
[Not Others]

840
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,500
You seduced my innocent Oppa and destroyed my family.

841
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
What a joke.

842
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,990
So what if you don't approve of us?

843
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,310
Excessive force? You can't be serious.

844
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,010
Captain Cha is in a very bad position.

845
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,250
He's your teammate, Team Leader Kim.

846
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,980
Makes sure to find evidence to prove Captain Cha's innocence.

847
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,560
Let's find the eyewitness.

848
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,100
Did you notice anything other than the face?

849
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,880
- The ears.
- Isn't this a hearing aid?

850
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,620
This is the lost object from the park murder scene. Right?

851
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,280
Shouldn't we reinvestigate if he isn't the real culprit?

852
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,950
It also means my mom could still be in danger.

853
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,830
Mom...

854
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:08,690
♫ I know everything, I was just dreaming... ♫
