00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,570
The case was already transferred, as I understand.

360
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,830
The grandmother called 911 late at night.

361
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,580
She said the boy wasn't breathing.

362
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,170
Thankfully he made it,

363
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,340
but the problem is that she keeps blaming herself for it.

364
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,510
She kept insisting on going home,

365
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:49,710
but the hospital is lying to her, saying that he's in critical condition to hold on to him.

366
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,750
What are you trying to tell us?

367
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,140
Help me.

368
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,130
There's apparently no evidence, but I keep thinking...

369
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,430
we're neglecting the culprit's dashcam.

370
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,610
Dashcam?

371
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,360
Yes, dashcam.

372
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,280
You said Chief Eun is taking care of it.

373
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,750
Yes, he went to the HQ to request it today.

374
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,990
He did, apparently.

375
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,800
Did he?

376
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,760
That's good to hear.

377
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll go check the hospital record, then—

378
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,350
Officer Jo?

379
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,420
I checked with the hospital. They're sending the record to the HQ right away.

380
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,680
He did, apparently.

381
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:10,700
Wow, this is what it really means to be ostracized.

382
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,490
I've never been ostracized like this before.

383
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,190
It's all done, then.

384
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,190
As long as we secure the dashcam.

385
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,380
Gosh, we still need to get the evidence out of it.

386
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,550
We're back to zero if we don't.

387
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,510
There's a drunk person causing a disturbance at 11-2 Namchon Road.

388
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,000
We'll get going.

389
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,860
- See you.
- We'll be right back.

390
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,120
Corporal Cha!

391
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,380
Wow, my team is the best!

392
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,690
So freaking cool!

393
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,930
How could they be so perfectly in sync?

394
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,830
Wow! I was so impressed just now!

395
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,900
They're so tight that I can't even penetrate!

396
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,240
Wow, shit.

397
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,920
I got to hand it to them!

398
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,010
Wow!

399
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,170
Wow! I was so surprised! Wow!

400
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,070
Get comfortable.

401
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,470
Hon, what eye cream do you use?

402
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,600
Where's your lipstick from?

403
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,580
It's all expensive stuff. Right?

404
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,540
Come out! Where are you?

405
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,260
Who's screaming like that?

406
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,460
So barbaric!

407
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,690
Come out, I said!

408
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,320
What to do...

409
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,220
Who's this?

410
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,550
What's this?

411
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,630
- Did you call the police?
- Yes!

412
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,740
You sound like that bastard.

413
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,040
The one who beats his mother and son.

414
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,090
Is it you?

415
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:20,210
Hey, are you happy now that you tore apart my happy family?

416
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,040
How dare you frame me without evidence?

417
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,710
Is it okay to beat people if there's no evidence?

418
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,290
How impressive.

419
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,040
It's that bastard!

420
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,830
Did you see me beating them?

421
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,380
Yes. I saw you beating them.

422
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,590
Why? Don't you believe me?

423
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,780
Why not?

424
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,380
Did you really see it?

425
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,610
Are you scared?

426
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,400
Why did you do that, then?

427
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,430
You're less than a cockroach.

428
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,830
That's right.

429
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,000
You got the wrong idea.

430
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,780
I'm not some brute who beats people.

431
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,080
Geez, my gosh!

432
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,770
What do you call someone who beats his mom and kid secretly?

433
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,920
A loser?

434
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,580
Are you serious right now?

435
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,000
Y-You...

436
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,630
You started it first.

437
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,220
Hey!

438

Everyone, stop! What are you doing?

- Stop!
- What are you doing?

- Yes!

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,590

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,940
[Mom]

540
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:46,400
♫ The moment I first held you in my arms. I remember then ♫

541
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,600
Mom.

542
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,600
Go find your mom!

543
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,210
I don't need any of this!

544
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Enough is enough, seriously!

545
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,210
What?

546
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,830
Hey!

547
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,560
Is it time to get beaten again?

548
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,040
- Is it time to beat you again?
- Stop, I said!

549
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
I'm craving a cigarette again.

550
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,600
My mouth is drying.

551
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,900
Do you want me to get you some?

552
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,690
Yes. Let me just smoke one.

553
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,580
Okay, wait here. I'll go get them quickly.

554
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,740
♫ Goodnight, goodnight ♫

555
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,760
[Call: Mom]

556
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,550
♫ Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye ♫

557
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:25,020
♫ Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye ♫

558
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,230
Well, Chief is resting right now.

559
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,060
Please don't go in for 30 minutes.

560
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,100
It's raining.

561
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,930
- I didn't bring an umbrella.
- Gosh...

562
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,170
Who cares. I like how refreshing it feels.

563
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,380
Right? It's raining so satisfyingly.

564
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,410
Let's see.

565
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,390
Thank you.

566
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,410
Mom!

567
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,800
Are you here to pick me up?

568
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,560
Seriously!

569
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,420
Let's go in!

570
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,220
- Are you crazy?
- So cold!

571
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,360
Why didn't you...

572
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,640
take a taxi or get an umbrella?

573
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,780
The plastic umbrella was 1,000 won when I was a kid.

574
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,310
I didn't buy it because it was expensive.

575
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,040
It's 3,000 or 6,000 won these days.

576
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,670
Am I crazy? I can't afford that!

577
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,690
If you catch a cold, you will spend several times more than that.

578
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:20,430
Hey! I don't catch a cold because I'm a bad bitch!

579
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,430
Bring me my underwear. So cold...

580
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,580
Oh-ho, Kim Jin Hee!

581
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,210
Move. Let me add more of this.

582
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,740
Gosh! I love it.

583
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:00,780
The water's cooled.

584
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,330
No, no, no! It's perfect right now.

585
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,600
No, it's cold.

586
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,650
I said it's okay! You're seriously so stubborn.

587
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,110
Do you feel it?

588
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,400
- Hey.
- Huh?

589
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,810
I didn't know I was supposed to bring you an umbrella.

590
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,670
I grew up like that as a kid, too.

591
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,600
But you know how you showed up with an umbrella earlier?

592
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,610
I was so unbelievably happy.

593
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,190
Thank you.

594
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,610
It's fine.

595
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,570
You waited for me with bathwater instead.

596
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,470
Hey! It's hot!

597
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,080
Turn it off right now.

598
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,600
This isn't hot! It needs to be hotter so you don't catch a cold.

599
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,020
It's really hot right now! Totally.

600
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,340
This isn't hot at all!

601
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,050
- Hey! Hey!
- It's hot! It's hot!

602
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,870
It's so hot! So hot!

603
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,240
So hot! So hot! Okay, okay!

604
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,800
Are you trying to kill me tonight?

605
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,660
- Come here.
- My gosh, my gosh!

606
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,260
You're all wet! Come in! Come in!

607
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,580
Come in, come in!

608
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,790
Look at all this dead skin!

609
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,620
It's hot, it's hot!

610
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,570
Seriously, stop!

611
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,540
Mom! Separate the wet towel!

612
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,530
Don't put it in the laundry hamper!

613
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,130
Mom!

614
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,880
Mom?

615
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,650
What's this?

616
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,420
Where did she run to now?

617
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,360
She was supposed to clean in here!

618
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,320
- Hello?
- Where are you?

619
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,730
I went to the convenience store nearby.

620
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,980
Mom.

621
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,690
Mom?

622
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,740
Are you crazy...

623
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,360
Mom, what's wrong? Did something happen?

624
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,350
No, it's Mi Jeong.

625
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,070
You seriously scared me!

626
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,360
Surprise! Jin Hee!

627
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,140
Hang up! Let's talk at home.

628
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,280
You're like a goblin.

629
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,970
You should've called first!

630
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,680
Don't show up randomly and scare me like this!

631
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,410
I find it so fun to scare the crap out of you!

632
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,870
What? Did you get a new car again?

633
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,650
How much does this one cost?

634
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:09,390
Hey, is Jin Hee okay? I heard she works somewhere else now.

635
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,120
How come you never ask me how I've been first?

636
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,680
Are you really my friend?

637
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,490
Of course! I raised her by changing her diapers!

638
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,010
Hey, Jin Hee would've been my daughter if it wasn't for you!

639
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,140
Jin Hee! Aunt is here! Goodness, goodness...

640
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,370
Really? It's okay, it's okay! It's okay, it's okay.

641
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,530
Should we eat now, Jin Hee?

642
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,530
Jin Hee, Grandma's here!

643
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,420
- I should check her diaper first!
- Let's eat.

644
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:50,260
Did you cry? Yes.

645
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,650
My Jin Hee. Let's change your diaper.

646
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,950
- My Jin Hee, did you miss me?
- Goodness, my sweetie!

647
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,290
I missed you, too, Jin Hee!

648
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,760
Gosh, so cute! Gosh, so cute!

649
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,240
Gosh, you're so good! You're so good!

650
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,840
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!

651
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,010
- Peek-a-boo!
- Goodness, my puppy.

652
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,450
[Mom]
Grandma, you already cultivated the field?

653
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,060
Why? I was going to do it for you!

654
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,250
I can't make my puppy suffer like that!

655
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,130
Just eat and sleep all you want when you come.

656
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,300
How about me?

657
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,800
I don't care if you sleep or stuff your face!

658
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,790
I told you not to send money. Why do you keep doing it?

659
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,960
You don't even make that much.

660
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,450
Seriously...

661
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,750
I'll come next month!

662
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,630
Don't go out so much and just stay at home!

663
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,480
Gosh, you brat! Listen to her!

664
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,360
Oh, Grandma!

665
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,440
Yes, my puppy!

666
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,060
I'll bring your favorites, monaka and buckwheat crepe, and visit you next month!

667
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,520
See you next month!

668
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,440
Don't spend money! It's okay!

669
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,220
Hang up now! The phone bill will be expensive!

670
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,060
Okay, Grandma!

671
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,710
- Okay!
- I'll call you again, Mother. Talk to you later.

672
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,410
Bye, Grandma—

673
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,810
She always hangs up as soon as she's done.

674
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,990
I guess she likes being out in the country.

675
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,980
She's not interested in coming to Seoul.

676
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,980
She likes walking on dirt and farming.

677
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,410
Right? By the way,

678
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,200
why did you travel for so long?

679
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,290
I was dying to see you!

680
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,120
Really?

681
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,210
Yes!

682
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,960
You're the best, my Jin Hee!

683
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,120
I was dying to see you, too, my baby!

684
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,920
What did you do? Don't you have any pictures?

685
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,020
- Let's see.
- Do you want to see them?

686
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,320
Golly, golly, gosh! You guys are so unbelievable!

687
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,120
Hey! Are you my friend or her friend?

688
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,940
- What's she saying?
- What's she saying?

689
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,510
Wait...

690
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,500
Are you jealous by chance?

691
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,600
Leave her alone. It's because I'm her only friend.

692
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,940
- What's wrong with her?
- You've got to be kidding me.

693
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,730
- It's so nice.
- I have tons of friends you don't know about!

694
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,810
Hey!

695
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,250
Hey.

696
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,500
By the way, your mom still has it. A young man followed her.

697
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,340
What?

698
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,230
How did you even see that?

699
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,770
Seriously...

700
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,100
A man followed me even though I went out looking like this!

701
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,850
I was going to acknowledge him in 30 seconds,

702
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:32,080
but that's when she showed up like a goblin.

703
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,130
So it was over.

704
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,360
What do we do with your mom's flirtatious side?

705
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,050
What did he look like?

706
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,540
He was just a kid.

707
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,910
He was wearing a hat, jeans, and a hoodie. Right?

708
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,130
You looked pretty carefully.

709
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,820
Sounds like you were interested in him.

710
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,920
You think I'm like you?

711
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,750
Who'd know it's me? No one!

712
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,170
Mom!

713
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,520
A baseball cap and a hoodie.

714
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,070
Senior?

715
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,980
What are you doing?

716
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,380
No, right?

717
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,550
You can't be doing this here because...

718
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:03,650
the procedure's taking too long. Right?

719
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:07,480
It's all for the safety of the neighborhood...

720
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,870
Have you been doing this here every night since then, by chance?

721
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,520
When I go to work tomorrow,

722
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,170
I'll switch with the other team and revise the patrol checklist.

723
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,250
The borough office will repair it the day after tomorrow.

724
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,800
I just need to do this until then.

725
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,200
Okay, I'll do it tomorrow, then.

726
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,370
Yes, Senior.

727
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,810
Was evidence found?

728
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,180
That's a relief.

729
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,540
Yes.

730
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,400
Yes, thank you for working so late.

731
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,930
What evidence?

732
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,620
The dashcam.

733
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,120
- They found evidence of abuse.
- Wow!

734
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,490
Wow! That's amazing!

735
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:25,420
Wow, I'm so glad. That son of a bitch! I knew it! Wow!

736
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,130
That's so great! This means...

737
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:30,370
we can separate the old lady and child from him. Right?

738
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,360
We'd better.

739
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,400
Wow!

740
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,160
But still...

741
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,000
Looks like you still get along with the seniors.

742
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,590
They even call you like this.

743
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,620
Well...

744
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,240
What?

745
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,220
You told me not to be defiant.

746
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,910
By chance, were you afraid I'd get fired, too—

747
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,930
Yes, that's right. I was afraid you'd get fired.

748
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:16,850
Our station will be in disaster again, then.

749
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,520
We'd get a penalty and get a poor evaluation rating, too.

750
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,800
That's why you shouldn't be defiant. Okay?

751
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,770
Your job here from now on is...

752
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,660
Don't think, cause trouble, and...

753
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,730
That's right.

754
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,570
just breathe.

755
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,040
Yes, that's right.

756
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,080
Just play it safe and leave.

757
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,940
Don't...

758
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,670
hurt the teammates for no reason.

759
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,510
Yes, yes.

760
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:53,920
Even if my teammates ostracize me,

761
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,900
I'll do my best to be a f***ing family-like team leader.

762
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,140
Hey, why...

763
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,810
do you always talk like that? You're making me nervous.

764
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,090
Why? What's wrong with the way I talk?

765
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:16,100
"Family-like." People say that a lot.

766
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:35,510
[Epilogue]

767
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,400
My gosh! Run!

768
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,780
♫ Want to be free ♫

769
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:40,570
♫ I want to imagine my life without you ♫

770
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:44,100
[Not Others]

771
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,310
Are you not interested in going back?

772
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,220
Why are you so simple-minded about everything?

773
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,400
What's this? Is it you, Mom?

774
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,390
Do you see the 12 upvotes for me?

775
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,780
Is he out of his mind?

776
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,270
Since you and I are both older—

777
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,260
Stop right there!

778
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,900
We have to drink together on a day like this.

779
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,830
- Officer Oppa!
- What the heck!

780
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,990
It'd be over if you just showed me the phone. Why won't you?

781
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,750
Why does it keep bothering me?

782
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,580
You're sure the culprit didn't see you then, right?

783
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,480
♫ I can't cut it off ♫

784
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,630
♫ I know it all ♫
