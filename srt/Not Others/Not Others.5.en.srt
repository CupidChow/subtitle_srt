8
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:52,343
Is it fun to seduce your friend's brother and sleep with him?

9
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,503
Why do you care what I do with your brother?

10
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,233
You crazy bitch! How dare you?

11
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:59,613
Hey! My parents fell ill because of you!

12
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:00,743
My family is ruined!

13
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,383
I'm about to get transferred because of you!

14
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:05,713
You're getting transferred? To where?

15
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,273
Why do you want to know that?

16
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:10,883
Is it because you're upset you can't leech off him anymore?

17
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:12,193
Bullshit!

18
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:15,333
- We couldn't even do it!
- Step on her!

Who are you, you bastard?

Hold on, hold on, hold on!

Hey, Kim Jin Hee.

Oh? Chief Eun is bleeding!

Oh my god! His nose is bleeding, too!

38
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,563
Tilt your head slowly.

39
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,723
Does anyone have a tissue?

40
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:42,513
Here, here, here, here.

41
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,883
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

42
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:47,003
I'm okay. Please let me go.

43
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:49,123
Huh? Don't be like that. Let's go to the hospital!

44
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:50,863

What's going on?

47
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:59,473
His nose is okay, but...

48

Chief Eun!

What are you doing?

50
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:04,993
His shoulder was dislocated.

51
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:08,043
That means his shoulder fell out. Right?

52
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:09,203
Hold him from behind.

53
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:13,953
Yes, yes! Gosh! What happened during backup?

54
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:15,333
Hold on!

55
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,903
He needs to go to the hospital. How dare you touch him?

56
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:21,763
I told you not to touch him! You're not even a doctor!

57
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:24,233
I'm a doctor!

58
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,223
Please move.

59
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,393
Okay.

Okay. Slowly. Try rotating slowly.

63

Okay.

64

Does it feel uncomfortable?

65
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,243
No, I'm okay.

66
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:05,463
Take an MRI at the hospital tomorrow since you never know.

- No.

Thank you for treating him,

72
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,403
but you haven't explained anything yet.

73
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,113
What do you want me to explain?

74
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,683
Why did you run away as soon as you saw me?

75
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:30,193
Well, it's because I was flustered without realizing it.

76
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:33,383
Why did you get flustered if you didn't do anything wrong?

77
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:35,553
You chased me so scarily.

78
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,253
Of course, I-I'd get flustered!

79
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:41,993
- Scary? Who is? Me?
- Hey, hey.

A woman was murdered in the neighborhood recently.

85
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,153
Team Leader has a mother, too.

86
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:08,323
She probably was overly sensitive about the incident.

87
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:09,733
It's the same as it was before.

88
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,613
Not to mention he has no criminal record,

89
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,733
he hasn't even gotten a speeding or parking ticket.

90
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,653
He was looking at my apartment.

91
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:19,953
What can we do with that?

92
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,523
You know better than anyone that we can't do anything about it.

93
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:29,143
By the way, are you sure that he was looking at your apartment?

94
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,003
Are you sure?

95
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:41,133
Let him go. Apologize, too.

96
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,063
The thing is...

97
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:46,103
I told you not to do anything to harm my teammates.

98
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:56,523
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,953
I think there was a misunderstanding.

100
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:05,913
Please accept her apology and try to calm down.

101
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:11,463
You two are suffering so much because of one reckless person.

102
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:14,993
We're okay. You're the one who suffered.

103
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:17,933
I can leave now, then. Right?

104
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,583
Yes!

105
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,613
Don't you find him strange?

106
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:35,323
Come on, Team Leader Kim! It ended well. Let's not get started again.

107
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:36,713
You can leave now.

108
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,823
Take Chief Eun with you on your way back, too.

109
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:44,183
Look at him! He's sitting in the car trying to drive in that state!

110
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:47,463
Gosh! Seriously...

111
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,953
It's okay. Stop following me.

112
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,483
I know you're sorry. You can leave now.

113
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:01,443
Let me just come with you.

114
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,713
It's because I feel uncomfortable! Please leave!

115
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,973
This is the fastest way home for me!

116
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,843
Why do you keep working all day and night?

117
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,713
Even machines break if you keep using them.

118
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:13,783
It's none of your business—

119
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,353
That's why you have such poor reflexes.

120
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,733
If only you were as athletic as you used to be,

121
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:22,393
you would've dodged easily.

122
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,803
It's my fault that I got injured?

123
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,033
Because I'm not athletic anymore?

124
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:31,633
Overworking causes stress and all sorts of illnesses.

125
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,373
How come you're so shameless?

126
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,003
No, you've always been shameless.

127
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:39,613
I forgot for a second.

128
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,793
You know more about me than I thought.

129
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,473
Do you think I'm the only one who thinks that?

130
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:44,833
Everyone who knew you thought that.

131
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:49,033
A dummy like you can't be out in the world.

132
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,033
Aren't you coming?

133
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,023
Isn't this it?

134
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,783
I'm saying you were that infamous.

135
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,383
I'm not the only one who thought that.

136
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,283
Hey!

137
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,673
You're going to the hospital tomorrow. Right?

138
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,153
Do you want me to come with you?

139
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,753
Why would you? What for?

140
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,423
I was just saying. I didn't know what else to say.

141
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,133
Leave.

142
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,203
Yes, yes!

143
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,423
What now?

144
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:50,483
Should I help you inside a bit?

145
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:52,703
I assume you'd find things difficult.

146
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:56,043
Go if you have nothing to say. Stop saying nonsense.

147
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,793
Rest up, then!

148
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:24,263
He was looking at our apartment.

149
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,483
It doesn't feel right.

150
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,640
You're home.

151
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,073
When did you get home?

152
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,643
A while ago.

153
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,273
Nothing happened coming home, right?

154
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:07,473
No? Should something have happened?

155
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,510
Never mind.

156
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Mom, could you massage here for a moment?

157
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,273
Do a hot press. We have a hot press pack.

158
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:31,003
Come on! It just needs to be massaged briefly.

159
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:36,093
Hey. I'm sick of massaging people at the hospital.

160
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,703
Do I have to do it at home, too?

161
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:40,700
I don't want to.

162
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,873
Am I just anyone?

163
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:47,480
You're still not me.

164
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:53,233
Fine. Just step on me, then.

165
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,173
Gosh, you're so annoying!

166
00:10:56,173 --> 00:11:00,363
Mom! Can't you do it properly?

167
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,000
Huh?

168
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,443
Gosh, seriously!

169
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:11,363
You're probably fine now. I...

170
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:15,220
touched the core. Shoo!

171
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,323
Hey!

172
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,530
Why can't I do the wave?

173
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:38,743
- Good work.
- We're back!

174
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,993
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

175
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,373

Doesn't he look like the doctor we saw last night?

178
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:58,603
Come on! His chin is much shorter.

179
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,893
- Really?
- Yes.

180
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,153
- Team Leader Kim.
- Yes?

181
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:09,313
They say the security light didn't malfunction when they checked after repair.

182
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,413
Why does it flicker from time to time, then?

183
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,483
They said they'd have a look at it again.

184
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,843

185
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:18,233
Okay, thank you.

186
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:24,303
Oh, about our lunch today...

187
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,303
Chief?

188
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,293
Wait...

189
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:36,643
What happened to your arm?

190
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,383
How about your face...

191
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,123
What did the doctor say? Are you okay?

192
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,623
What hospital?

193
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,303
When did you get injured?

194
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:45,563
It's nothing.

195
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:49,593
The ligament got stretched a bit. I'll be taking this off soon.

196
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:53,513
Did you know, Captain Cha?

197
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,143
Yes.

198
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:58,953
He did a night duty with the Chief yesterday.

199
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,563
Well...

200
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:04,193
T-T-The thing is...

201
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:10,193
There was a very small f-f-fight. Whoa...

202
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:12,423
Then, why didn't you mention it in the daily report?

203
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:15,503
Why did you omit something like that? You never know what'd happen!

204
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,663
She's right!

205
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:21,143
Because it really was nothing. I'm really okay.

206
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:23,133
Yes, it's because he's okay!

207
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:26,093

Of course!

209
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:35,033
Aren't you going to be honest with me?

210
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,663
Well...

211
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:44,083
- Team Leader Kim.
- Stay out of this, Chief. Yes?

212
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:49,303
To be honest, I hit him without realizing it.

213
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:50,973
Hit him?

214
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:53,353
His shoulder?

215
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:56,473
No, I hit his face, but—

216
00:13:56,473 --> 00:14:00,193
You mean you hit his face, too?

217
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:04,283
Not just his shoulder?

218
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:07,753
But you didn't go to the hospital right away, either?

219
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:10,223
Captain Jang, it's not worth getting so angry about.

220
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,133
It was just a mistake.

221
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,273
Captain Cha!

222
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,113
And Team Leader Kim.

223
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:21,243
Each of you should write a status report on this.

224
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,973
Include the 5Ws and get everything right.

225
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:29,673
I don't think it's necessary to make a status report on this...

226
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:34,033

273
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:03,413

He was definitely looking at our place.

314
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,163
Don't you actually think that, too?

315
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:31,783
Weren't you nice to me because I followed you around and looked easy?

316
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,223
That's why you're running away!

317
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:36,033

00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:05,313
You think I would? You dummy!

326
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:14,013

327
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,573
Stop crying and tell me!

328
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:28,383

00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,403
Okay. Let's.

333
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:25,403
Can I talk to you for a moment?

334
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:27,383
About what?

335
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:33,963
Where are you, Mom? I'm about to get off work.

336
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,483
I have a plan.

337
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,253
All of a sudden?

338
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:39,703
Yes, talk to you later.

339
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:48,233
Well, so...

340
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:51,363
I spent my whole life studying and working,

341
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:54,073
but I suddenly realized that

342
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:56,983
I was 48 years old.

343
00:24:56,983 --> 00:25:01,373
I was like, "What am I doing?" So I quit, and I'm taking a break.

344
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:05,363
Senior said he'd get me a job at a hospital.

345
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:08,033
And I said no.

346
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:12,383
But I'm still grateful that he thought about me as a junior.

347
00:25:12,383 --> 00:25:15,253
So I stopped by to say hello and...

348
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:24,893
I'm sorry. It's not a fun story, is it?

349
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:30,363
So what's the point you're trying to make?

350
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:34,933
You came to see Dr. Park, and you saw me by chance?

351
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,003
Have you not been doing well, by chance?

352
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:45,523
- What?
- Since we broke up.

353
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:52,473
If that's the case, could you tell me how you've been?

354
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,753
You haven't heard anything about me?

355
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:03,143
Couldn't you have found out if you wanted to?

356
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:08,523
What I know is that you had moved and you were doing well.

357
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:12,203
You took the GED, you got a job,

358
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,133
and you met a nice man, too.

359
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:18,343
And?

360
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,113
That's all I know.

361
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,753
I was glad that you met someone nice.

362
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:28,003
I thought it was great, but...

363
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:35,503
Looks like you don't know I have a daughter.

364
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,633
- You have a daughter?
- Yes.

365
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,373
She's turning 30 next year.

366
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:42,443
Oh! I didn't know that.

367
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,783
She must be pretty if she resembles you.

368
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,253
- She's not pretty.
- Huh?

369
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,413
She looks like you.

370
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:50,963
What?

371
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,863
I tried not to tell you,

372
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,813
but I'm suddenly feeling mean.

373
00:26:56,813 --> 00:27:01,543
Looks like you lived comfortably while I was struggling.

374
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:07,413
S-S-So...

375
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:11,403
S-S-She's my daughter?

376
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,863
Hey! Talk properly!

377
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:21,013
How dare you try to take credit? She's not your daughter!

378
00:27:56,873 --> 00:27:58,733
Mom!

379
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:09,713
I had to write a report that was basically a written apology.

380
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:11,743
Why did you beat a random person up, then?

381
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:13,393
It wasn't a random person!

382
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:16,133
He ran away, and he attacked me first, too!

383
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:17,743
I'm talking about that weirdo I mentioned before.

384
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:21,873
Stop talking about weirdos! It's annoying!

385
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:25,933
Who is it, anyway?

386
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,933
Is it a patient?

387
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,403
What?

388
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:34,503
By the way, why do you keep visiting me without even calling?

389
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:38,323
I said the neighborhood is dangerous these days.

390
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:41,783
This is where that happened between you and that guy, too.

391
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,413
Hey! You're making me feel all unsettled.

392
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:47,993
Also, why would you worry about me, of all people?

393
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,603
You're a bother. Stop following me around.

394
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:54,963
Oh! Noona!

395
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:57,333
- Hello!
- Oh, hi.

396
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,393
Hello.

397
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,513
Do you know me?

398
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:03,553
No, since you're with Noona.

399
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:04,993
He works part-time at the internet cafe here.

400
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,983
I requested repair for the security light.

401
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:09,493
Let me know if it breaks again.

402
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:11,513
Oh, okay.

403
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:14,313
- I'm leaving, Oppa!
- Okay, get home safely!

404
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:15,963
See you. Bye!

405
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,683
See you later, Part-timer.

406
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:20,053
Yes, go home.

407
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,273
Why are you staring?

408
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:27,543
Do you know me?

409
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:32,253
Yes. You said I made a stinking face.

410
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,343
I'll see you around.

411
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,093
Let's go, Mom.

412
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:52,733
We have food at home. Right?

413
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:54,443
Yes.

414
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,703
Prepare it as soon as we get home, so I can eat right away.

415
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:02,233
I'll go see Tae Gyeong after I walk you home.

416
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,413
You want me to go home and eat alone?

417
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:10,003
You just need to heat up the stew.

418
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:12,953
Why are you so irritated?

419
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,213
You always stuff your face.

420
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,343
You don't care if I starve or not!

421
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:21,683
I already cook all the time.

422
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:24,123
Do I have to present it to you now?

423
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,923
Seriously! How could a mom be so selfish?

424
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:29,843
She only cares about herself! Shit!

425
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:33,503
We have a suspect for the case now.

426
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:35,983
It's the victim's ex-boyfriend.

427
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:39,153
- Are you sure?
- He disappeared as soon as she died.

428
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:41,833
He committed sex crimes before, too.

429
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:45,543
Could you send me a photo of him?

430
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,303
Why? Do you want to arrest him and get promoted?

431
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:52,243
Why do you want to take my prize so badly?

432
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,823
Well...

433
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,493
The thing is...

434
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:01,053
I'm sorry.

435
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,663
I know this is hard, Jin Hee.

436
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:07,103
There's even a murder case as soon as you go there.

437
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:09,613
Tae Gyeong, the thing is...

438
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:12,093
Do you get along with Senior Eun Jae Won?

439
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:14,083
I heard he's a poisonous snake.

440
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:20,573
Well, now that we spent time together,

441
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:23,443
he's more like how he was at the police academy.

442
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,993
I guess he feels comfortable with you since he knows you.

443
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:28,443
What do you mean? He nags at me all the time!

444
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:30,773
He reunited with his easy target again.

445
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:33,033
Is he still extremely handsome?

446
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:35,503
Hey!

447
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:39,823
He's not exactly "extremely handsome."

448
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:42,963
Hey! He was an idol at the police academy! Come on!

449
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:46,763
It's got to be someone as good-looking as Kim Jin Soo, at least.

450
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,743
I have always wondered.

451
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,743
It's true.

452
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,273
What is?

453
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,643
That Jin Soo is getting in your way in life.

454
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:03,193
What time did you come home last night?

455
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:05,153
Around 2:00 a.m.?

456
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:12,333
Try to come home around midnight, at least! Please!

457
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,723
Let's eat.

458
00:32:19,873 --> 00:32:21,403
Night duty?

459
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:24,033
Yes. I leave in the evening.

460
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,533
When do you go home, by the way?

461
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:29,023
I think I'll stay for three or four days.

462
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:33,973
Hey! This is great.

463
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:37,903
I want you to follow my mom for a while.

464
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,063
Ahjumma?

465
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:41,563
Yeah.

466
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:44,323
When she gets off work and if she needs to go out at night,

467
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,613
you just need to accompany her.

468
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,033
- What will you treat me to?
- Huh?

469
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:53,683
Seriously...

470
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:56,733
Be thankful that I'm providing lodging and food!

471
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:59,533
Instead, I have no freedom! I have to write, too!

472
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:02,533
Why don't you have freedom? Why do you have no time to write?

473
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:06,533
You're free when my mom works, and you're free when I'm off duty, too!

474
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,063
Isn't Ahjumma seeing anyone lately?

475
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:11,973
No, no.

476
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:14,663
Are you going to or not?

477
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:16,783
Are you going to or not?

478
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,903
How about gamjatang?

479
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,863
- Soju! Soju!
- Yes, yes!

480
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:27,113
No, how about pork belly?

481
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:29,523
Pork belly sounds great!

482
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:32,273
Aren't you coming, Ms. Kim?

483
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,833
I forgot something. I'll see you there.

484
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,163
Okay!

485
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:03,993
What am I doing? So annoying.

486
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:30,923
Do you want to have dinner together?

487
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:32,593
Why would I?

488
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:37,613
Well, if you don't want dinner, do you want to drink?

489
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:39,893
Why would I do that?

490
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:45,123
Of course! There's no way she stopped dating!

491
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:51,933
Try this. Okay.

492
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,983
Try this, too.

493
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:58,693
And this one, too.

494
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,943
What a dumbass. He hasn't changed at all.

495
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:05,043
So frustrating.

496
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,563
You're annoying. Stop.

497
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:11,783
Do you think I'm still a high schooler?

498
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:14,103
Oh, I'm sorry.

499
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:19,683
I keep wanting to feed you and buy stuff for you.

500
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,193
I'm living very well now.

501
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:26,133
If you feel that guilty, just compensate me with money.

502
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:27,703
Should I?

503
00:35:27,703 --> 00:35:30,323
I have a lot of money. I have nothing to spend it on.

504
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:32,453
Do you want to die?

505
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:35,303
You want to make up for my lost time with money?

506
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,683
No.

507
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:43,353
I'm just saying I'd like to if I could.

508
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:55,913
Did you know I ran away from home after transferring?

509
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:57,373
To see you.

510
00:35:57,373 --> 00:36:00,293
You're lying! Everyone knows how cowardly you are.

511
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:02,233
I'm serious.

512
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:05,703
But I got caught at the bus terminal.

513
00:36:05,703 --> 00:36:08,423
I got beat up by my father with a golf club.

514
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:09,863
He said if I ran away again,

515
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:13,903
he'd find you and punish you, too.

516
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:16,773
So I just gave up on everything.

517
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,103
I just studied...

518
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,593
and worked. I just...

519
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:29,643
went on for 30 years like that.

520
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:38,503
The moment I saw you again...

521
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,433
Oppa!

522
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:47,003
I didn't care about anything else.

523
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:49,043
I could only see you.

524
00:36:56,433 --> 00:37:02,183
I kept regretting leaving you behind.

525
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:05,983
So what are you trying to say? Don't beat around the bush and get to it.

526
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,293
I...

527
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:19,873
What are you doing here?

528
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,903
Hello.

529
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,403
What are you doing here?

530
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:27,123
There was a gathering. I saw you on my way out. But...

531
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:29,883
it sounded like you were talking to someone I know.

532
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:33,553
I finished eating and was about to leave. Let's go!

533
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:37,203
I'm her friend, Kim Mi Jeong.

534
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:38,783
I'm sorry, but what's your name?

535
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:42,613
What do you care? We have nothing going on here!

536
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:45,353
Park...

537
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,223
Let's go!

538
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,213
Doesn't your name have the letter "Hong" in it?

539
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:52,753
Yes, it does.

- Let's leave for now and—
- Would you mind talking to me?

543
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:06,393
It'll just take a moment.

544
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:08,553
What are you doing?

545

Hey!

Where's a hammer?

547
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:29,273
Why isn't there a hammer in this bathroom?

Look at you!

551

You showed up in 30 years and got beaten up.

552
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:59,813
Should I tell you what you're feeling right now?

553
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,443
You're just pitying yourself. It's not me.

554
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:06,413
You just miss your old self because you never got to do anything.

00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:09,663
Do you think so?

556
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:12,583
We were done when we were in high school.

I'm not the same anymore

558
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,643

00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:39,153
it means it's likely that he's not bad.

722
00:50:39,153 --> 00:50:41,493
I'm suddenly curious about this man.

723
00:50:41,493 --> 00:50:43,973
Hey! Seriously...

724
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:01,993
What?

725
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:05,613
Captain Jang asked me to tell you something.

726
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:07,413
I'd be seeing her at work. What's it about?

727
00:51:07,413 --> 00:51:10,523
No, she won't be at work today.

728
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,193
Well...

729
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:16,113
I think I need to go inside.

730
00:51:16,113 --> 00:51:18,943
It'd be weird to say it here.

731
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:25,243
I'll just relay her message, then.

732
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:32,603
Is our station full of daredevils or something?

733
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:34,203
He's so idiotic!

734
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:36,553
Does he think he's—

735
00:51:46,143 --> 00:51:48,203
Isn't it his loss if there're any side effects?

736
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:50,233
Why does he treat his body like that?

737
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,563
He thinks he could just ignore the doctor!

738
00:51:52,563 --> 00:51:54,153
The doctor told him to rest fully,

739
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,663
but why did he remove that sling?

740
00:51:55,663 --> 00:51:57,043
What is he, Superman?

741
00:51:57,043 --> 00:52:00,533
Why did he go to the scene in that condition? He shouldn't have come to work—

742
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:06,833
She says not to come in.

743
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:13,203
That was the message Captain Jang wanted me to relay.

744
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:20,653
Captain Jang said that?

745
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:22,133
Idiotic?

746
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:24,533
- Superhuman?
- Superman.

747
00:52:24,533 --> 00:52:26,353
Su...

748
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,383
I'll ask Captain Jang.

749
00:52:30,383 --> 00:52:31,783
Okay!

750
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:37,533
- You think I'm easy, don't you?
- Well...

751
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:43,823
A little.

752
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:45,703
A little?

753
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,053
Maybe a little more than that.

754
00:52:47,053 --> 00:52:49,163
- Hey!
- In any case,

755
00:52:49,163 --> 00:52:52,453
Captain Jang wants you to rest today, no matter what.

756
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:54,893
While you're resting, you should clean a bit, too.

757
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:57,973
Look how messy it is in here...

758
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:02,883
What's this? Wow.

759
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:06,133
You're decorating with the color green...

760
00:53:10,223 --> 00:53:12,273
I should get going.

761
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:15,423
Rest up, sir!

762
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:23,903
But I much prefer you like this.

763
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:28,533
You were really annoying when you were just a poser.

764
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:29,873
Hey, come here. Seriously...

765
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,743
Rest up, sir!

766
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:38,733
I mean, seriously...

767
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:41,993
Seriously, what's wrong with her?

768
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:49,653
Yes.

769
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:53,753
Dr. Park, we'll go home now!

770
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:54,793
Oh, okay.

771
00:53:54,793 --> 00:53:57,993
- Thank you for today!
- See you tomorrow!

772
00:53:57,993 --> 00:53:59,973
Ms. Kim?

773
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:05,833
Could we talk for a second?

774
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:09,683
- Take care!
- We'll get going!

775
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:15,933
Menopause Clinic's party member?

776
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:20,073
Yes, we can provide consultations regarding

777
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:23,753
issues related to aging, such as slow metabolism,

778
00:54:23,753 --> 00:54:26,843
diet, and various menopause-related conditions

779
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:29,273
and we'll use medications, too.

780
00:54:29,273 --> 00:54:36,203
So why are you telling me about someone else's menopause clinic?

781
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:42,013
They think you'd be perfect for its promotion.

782
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:43,873
No need to think too much about it.

783
00:54:43,873 --> 00:54:46,453
Just think of it as hospitals helping each other.

784
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,533
You'd make friends,

785
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:52,043
and you can enjoy your midlife, too!

786
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:56,043
I'm not that old yet.

787
00:54:57,273 --> 00:54:59,433
But you'll get there soon.

788
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,453
What do you mean, get there soon?

789
00:55:03,283 --> 00:55:04,523
I have a long way to go!

790
00:55:04,523 --> 00:55:07,193
Just think of it as preparing for the future and—

791
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:09,563
I'm saying I don't want to!

792
00:55:09,563 --> 00:55:11,263
Ms. Kim.

793
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:14,473
Why are you suddenly acting hysterical?

794
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:16,113
By chance...

795
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,393
are you menopausal?

796
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:34,093
I really appreciate the thought,

797
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:40,513
but I'm still full of energy.

If I join them,

801
00:55:54,023 --> 00:55:57,313
I'm sure I'd be a nuisance.

802
00:55:59,613 --> 00:56:02,723

00:57:13,823 --> 00:57:15,753
I totally forgot about you all this time.

808
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:18,173
I've met countless men so far.

809
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:21,103
And my daughter looks nothing like you!

810
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:23,373
I lied that she looked like you because I got angry.

811
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,983
She's just like me in every possible way.

812
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,743
She has nothing to do with you. So stop coming here!

813
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:30,993
I'm glad. Yes. She should resemble you.

814
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:33,433
She can't resemble me.

815
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:37,643
What are you trying to do with me right now?

816
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:42,503
As long as you're okay, I want to keep seeing you.

817
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,303
I don't want to!

818
00:57:44,303 --> 00:57:47,233
Can't we just see each other?

819
00:57:47,233 --> 00:57:50,683
If you feel uncomfortable, we can just be friends.

820
00:57:52,223 --> 00:57:53,523

821
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:55,583

I want to see you like that, at least.

827

00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,043

T-T-The thing is...

00:58:36,933 --> 00:58:40,213
You're the one who's been following my mom, aren't you?

838
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:45,363
You were staring at our apartment last time, too. Right?

839
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:50,223
Geez! Look at him! Look how he's shaking his hand!

840
00:58:50,223 --> 00:58:51,533
I was right!

841
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:54,213
No, no, no! He wasn't looking at our apartment.

842
00:58:54,213 --> 00:58:55,363
He was looking at me—

843
00:58:55,363 --> 00:58:58,063
I know! Why did he look at you? What was he trying to do?

844
00:58:58,063 --> 00:59:00,723
Well, Jin Hee! You're completely mistaken right now—

845
00:59:00,723 --> 00:59:02,053
Step aside, Mom.

846
00:59:02,053 --> 00:59:04,703
He could be the murder suspect in our neighborhood.
