The bathroom is over there.

8
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:54,246
Hey, Park Ji Eun. You said there's no one home.

9
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:57,206
- What are those sneakers?
- They're my brother's.

10
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,416
You can just ignore him.

11
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,526
Did you have a brother?

12
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,336
- Yeah.
- I bet he's really ugly.

13
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:06,766
Who are you?

14
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,706
She'll just use the bathroom and leave. Don't tell Mom, Park Jin Hong.

15
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:12,786
Did you drink?

16
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:35,936
I won't tell Mother.

17
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,796
Don't just bring anyone home.

18
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:41,856
How about you? Do you even have friends to bring? You petty jerk.

19
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:46,106
You're a high school student. Why would you drink?

20
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,146
I'm sorry, Oppa.

21
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:51,026
I'll come when I'm sober next time.

22
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53,226
Well, I'm not telling you to come back—

23
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,206
He's so serious all the time.

24
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:56,616
He's so annoying.

25
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,136
Hey, let's go.

26
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,856
Hey, don't party too much and come home early.

27
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:03,416
You, too. Don't be out too late.

28
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,746
It's dangerous.

29
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,286
Yes, I won't.

30
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,856

Can I come back tomorrow?

33

37
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:14,586
Long time no see, Park Ji Eun.

38
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,636
Hold on.

39
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,276
Is it you, Kim Eun Mi?

40
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,616
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:24,336
How dare you hang out when no one's home?

42
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,206
Oppa gave me the passcode.

43
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,876
What?

44
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,956
You little. What do you have against my family?

45
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,526
Let go of me. Let go while I'm being nice.

46
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:37,686
You degenerate loser. How could you ruin my family like this?

47
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,966
You never had a fight with me without your minions, huh?

48
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:43,586
Should we give it a go today?

- Come on in, you dumbass!

00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,536
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

54
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,586
You have no thoughts, do you?

55
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:14,386
You can't do this in your right mind after you destroy a family.

56
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:19,436
Ji Eun, we decided carefully, too.

57
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:22,936
Whatever. I can't approve. Never.

58
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:25,246
Give me a break.

59
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:27,446
So what if you don't approve?

60
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:30,666
Oppa and I have already built the Great Wall of China

(It means they have been intimate)

62

What? You really have no shame.

63
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,876
Why did you change so much?

64
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,986
You must've struggled a lot.

65
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:43,836
I almost didn't recognize you.

66
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:50,536
Try giving birth. See if this doesn't happen to you.

67
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,946
Looks like you don't even have a child.

68
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,966
Did you give birth, too?

69
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,256
- How old?
- He's in the 9th grade. Why ask?

70
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,346
So the picture of the boy in that room was—

71
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:03,486
Yes, it's of my nephew. Ji Eun's son.

72
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,436
Is that so?

73
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:09,286
Hey, that's good to hear. My daughter is 29.

74
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,746
Looks like you didn't know.

75
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:34,796
By chance, when you were in high school—

76
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:42,486
You two are really out of your minds.

77
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,376
My goodness, seriously...

78
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,306
Are you leaving already?

79
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:56,276
Come early tomorrow so we can talk.

80
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:59,016
Early? Where?

81
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:01,796
I said we're making wintertime kimchi at my place tomorrow.

82
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,956
Yeah, right.

83
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:07,316
You're really out of it, aren't you?

84
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,826
Are you okay?

85
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:26,486
You said you cut ties with your family.

86
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,936
I guess you didn't with Ji Eun.

87
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:34,896
She helped me out a lot.

88
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,536
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:41,296
I couldn't tell you because I know you two don't get along.

90
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,106
I'll go home. Give me a ride.

91
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,536
Hey!

92
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:09,656
Why are you out?

93
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:11,886
Hey, you came.

94
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,626
Hello.

95
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,516
Hello...

96
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:24,396
Oppa, good luck tomorrow.

97
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:25,916
Rest up, and see you the day after.

98
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,686
Okay, I'll call you.

99
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:28,756
Let's go in.

100
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,706
Mom, go inside first.

101
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:33,596
I need to talk to Ahjussi a bit.

102
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,426
About what?

103
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:39,576
You don't have to know. Go in.

104
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,306
What was it?

105
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:51,136
Huh?

106
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,536
What was it about? Huh?

107
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:56,606
I was just asking for his phone number.

108
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:59,036
You got his number?

109
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,736
Yeah.

110
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,386
Please don't tell Mom.

111
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:07,296
The person who got arrested may not be the real culprit, apparently.

112
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,006
If he's not the real culprit,

113
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:11,496
you mean you haven't caught the culprit yet?

114
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:16,436
So I'd like to ask you to take care of Mom one more time.

115
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:21,016
Of course. Of course, I will. You didn't have to ask me that.

116
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:24,226
But is it okay not to tell her—

117
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:25,836
If we say the real culprit is out there,

118
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:28,696
she won't just sit still and do nothing.

119
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:32,326
You're right. She'd definitely be like that.

120
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,896
I'm not supposed to reveal this information, either.

121
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:38,806
So make sure to keep it a secret.

122
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,956
Okay, I promise.

123
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:44,876
I'll keep it a secret and stay by her side, too.

124
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:53,176
You make sure to stay by his side, okay?

125
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:56,116
Never, ever be apart from him.

126
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:58,486
Anywhere. Anytime. Never-ending. Never die.

127
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:02,596
Never, ever. Make sure to stay by his side. Okay?

128
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:04,446
What's with you now?

129
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,836
Hey.

130
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:09,406
I have free time tomorrow. Let's go shopping.

131
00:09:09,406 --> 00:09:11,306
What if Ahjussi comes tomorrow?

132
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:13,936
- He won't.
- So what will you do if he does?

133
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,976
He can't.

134
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,686
He came.

135
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,566
I called her and told her I couldn't come.

136
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:38,036
I'm sure she flipped out, knowing her personality.

137
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,876
You're more important to me. What am I supposed to do?

138
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,336
- Don't you feel uncomfortable?
- About what?

139
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,446
My relationship with Ji Eun.

140
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:49,736
It puts you in a difficult position.

141
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:55,196
There's nothing else that matters to me more than you anymore.

142
00:09:55,196 --> 00:10:02,466
So I don't want you to worry about me or the issues caused because of me.

143
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,096
Are you still worried?

144
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,866
Even after I said all this?

145
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,716
Okay.

146
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:16,116
As long as you're not struggling. I won't worry anymore.

147
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,306
I'll only count on you.

148
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,036
Tell me.

149
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:32,726
Why did the chief constable interview the murder suspect?

150
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:36,546
And why did the team leader book the interview?

151
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,546
Won't you say something?

152
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,166
I heard the suspect changed his statement.

153
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,386
I came to confirm that.

154
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:46,076
Why would you confirm that?

155
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:48,156
It's the lawyer's job to prove it.

156
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:50,876
But can't you check just this once?

157
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:54,706
I think the man in the CCTV footage has a different height.

158
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:58,326
I understand you're doing this because this case concerns your mother.

159
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:02,726
But that suspect was sued by the late Lee Na Kyeong twice.

160
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:05,656
One was for sexual assault, and the other was for stalking.

161
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:10,126
And she died while she was under special protection because of stalking.

162
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,196
No matter how you candy-coat it,

163
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:15,096
he's the prime suspect and the target for prosecution.

164
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:20,026
And he even stalked and assaulted your mother, who rescued Lee Na Kyeong.

165
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,176
He even confessed, too.

166
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,936
Why are you keeping your mouth shut?

167
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:28,816
What? Is your junior right about everything

168
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,606
and we're supposed to believe what she says again?

169
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:33,356
Please check the voice recording.

170
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:36,756
There must be a recording of his conversation during the visit.

171
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,186
You want us to just listen to the recording?

172
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:40,066
You have nothing to talk about with us?

173
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,506
Sir.

174
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,386
Why are you doing this, Chief Constable Eun?

175
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,786
Do you want to do this again?

176
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,066
Having you come in about stuff like this again?

177
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,396
Senior, let's drop it now.

178
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,746
What did the suspect say?

179
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:18,446
Can't you tell me, too?

180
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,646
He said he met the real culprit.

181
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:32,106
After the victim died, he went to the park where she was murdered every night.

182
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:03,046
It was definitely Na Kyeong's. It was her favorite lip balm.

183
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,396
Those initials.

184
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:09,866
But why did he have Na Kyeong's? I found it so strange.

185
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:13,786
So I followed him.

186
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,186
But without a trace...

187
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,676
He's the culprit. He killed Na Kyeong

188
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,656
and took her lip balm, too.

189
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:29,866
Did you notice anything other than his face?

190
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,566
His ears.

191
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,576
I looked it up because I didn't know what it was at first.

192
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,916
He was...

193
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,476
wearing a hearing aid.

194
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,506
Hearing aid?

195
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,496
It's likely it's someone who is hearing-impaired.

196
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:52,056
I would think so.

197
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:56,246
Why did he confess, then?

198
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,256
At first,

199
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:01,726
I denied it.

200
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:05,226
But as I kept talking,

201
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:10,626
it made sense that she died because of me.

202
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:14,156
It's true that I met her before she died,

203
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:16,866
and it's true that we had a scuffle,

204
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:21,096
and she ended up dying after leaving home and going to the park.

205
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:24,636
And I said I didn't kill her later, but no one believed me.

206
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:29,596
I really didn't do it.

207
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:34,096
I was just in love with her. That's all.

208
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,786
There's nothing we can be sure about.

209
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:43,006
We just know that he might not be the culprit now.

210
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:46,786
But if he's not the real culprit by a slim chance,

211
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,616
shouldn't we re-investigate?

212
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:51,446
It's for his own justice and—

213
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:54,366
It also means my mom might still be in danger.

214
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,796
Right. That matters the most.

215
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,216
If we focus on that—

216
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,356
Jin Hee!

217
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,236
Hey, Tae Gyeong.

218
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,706
Senior, hello.

219
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,556
I'm Im Tae Gyeong.

220
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,626
I'm not sure if you remember me.

221
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:12,426
I remember. You're Team Leader Kim's classmate.

222
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:13,756
I'm glad I ran into you.

223
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:16,626
I felt bad because I might not be able to say goodbye to you.

224
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,776
Don't mention it.

225
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,496
Excessive force? You can't be serious.

226
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:23,456
If it isn't one, it's the other.

227
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,526
Excessive force?

228
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,306
Our police station?

229
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,176
What? I thought that's why you came.

230
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,606
I thought that's why you came with Senior.

231
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:45,536
It should be around here somewhere.

232
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,386
It's a blind spot for the CCTV.

233
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:51,936
Cars can't come in, and there's no eyewitness?

234
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:54,396
Try to remember the situation.

235
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:57,316
You have to remember as accurately as possible.

236
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:02,066
Well, I came out because I received a report about illegal dumping.

237
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:05,946
She knocked me over and beat me up out of the blue.

238
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,806
I blocked her like this and this.

239
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:10,136
How could I remember all of that?

240
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,026
How about assault?

241
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:15,166
Did you not assault her at all?

242
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:19,426
I don't know. I might've hit her...

243
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:22,796
while I was defending myself.

244
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:30,396
But I never hit her willfully. Not even once.

245
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:34,116
I can swear it on my children, Chief Eun.

246
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:37,506
I never did that, even once.

247
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,526
Did you only bring kimchi?

248
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:52,086
You should've made some boiled pork, too.

249
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,696
You don't get to eat any.

250
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:01,396
Why not? I like your kimchi.

251
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:06,456
Your last scallion kimchi. I ate that with rice and nothing else.

252
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,756
Let's go. I'll get you a taxi.

253
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,206
Will you keep doing this?

254
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:13,636
You'll ignore everything I say?

255
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:15,966
Let's talk outside.

256
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,646
Talk here.

257
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:20,776
What can't we talk about in front of this bitch?

258
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:28,406
Go ahead.

259
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:37,366
Call me before you come over from now on.

260
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:40,746
What?

261
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:44,396
I'll change the passcode for the door.

262
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,596
Oppa, look at her.

263
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,606
She's the first woman...

264
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:10,386
I ever chose for myself, Ji Eun.

265
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:18,616
You want me to be happy, too. Right?

266
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,996
You've got to be kidding me right now.

267
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,976
Hey.

268
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,456
You must be with him because of his assets.

269
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:39,826
You stand no chance.

270
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:42,256
Neither you nor your daughter won't get any.

271
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,086
Hey.

272
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,316
Let's try to be cordial, at least.

273
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:48,976
You can say whatever to me,

274
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:51,796
but how dare you bring up my daughter?

275
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:54,156
Don't forget what you said just now.

276
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:56,316
You said, "My daughter," okay?

277
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:58,666
Yes! She's my daughter.

278
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,036
Don't you forget it.

279
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,496
What do we do?

280
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:14,486
Captain Cha is in a really bad position.

281
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:19,196
You believe him 100%, right?

282
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:21,876
How could I work with him if I didn't trust him?

283
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,676
Things will get crazy busy for a while.

284
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:29,856
We have to worry about Captain Cha's case and confirm the culprit, too.

285
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,426
Let's do this.

286
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:34,276
I'll work on confirming the culprit.

287
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:37,426
So you should just focus on Captain Cha's case.

288
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,456
- Pardon?
- If it's regarding one's family,

289
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:42,776
a third party should engage instead.

290
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:44,106
But still—

291
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,716
And one of us should remain back.

292
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:48,896
I think that should be you.

293
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,776
He's your teammate, Team Leader Kim.

294
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,226
Make sure to find...

295
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:57,756
the proof that Captain Cha is innocent.

296
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,476
Thank you in advance.

297
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:07,706
I'm in your care.

298
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:11,686
If you can't check the CCTV, there are only two options.

299
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:14,606
You either persuade the person who sued him

300
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,066
or find an eyewitness.

301
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:21,986
Get out. Get out. Get out.

302
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,786
Get out. Get out. Get out!

303
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,496
Bring the warrant!

304
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:28,796
How dare you just bring the police ID and tell me to think about it?

305
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,516
I'm sorry, but we'd appreciate it if you rethink it just once.

306
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:34,626
What you just told us is different from your testimony.

307
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:38,086
What did you say? Are you saying I lied?

308
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,966
- It's not like that—
- I'm sorry.

309
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:42,376
- What's this now?
- Team Leader.

310
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,636
Hello, I'm Team Leader Kim Jin Hee of Namchon Police Station.

311
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:48,296
I apologize if you felt uncomfortable, Ma'am.

312
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:49,976
Uncomfortable?

313
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,486
Do you think that's all I felt?

314
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,396
The moment I got beaten,

315
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:57,626
I saw the light flashing in front of my eyes!

316
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:59,226
Is that so?

317
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,476
I know it's difficult, but if you could

318
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,326
explain the situation again,

319
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:08,496
Seriously! That police officer called Cha or whatever

320
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:12,906
grabbed me by the collar and... Seriously...

321
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,236
It's Captain Cha Soon Cheol.

322
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:15,466
What did you say?

323
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,506
The name of the person you sued is

324
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:20,936
not "Cha or whatever."

325
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:24,706
Do I have to even remember the name of the person who beat me?

326
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,126
What are you looking at?

327
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,386
Are you having fun?

328
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:35,726
If you remember anything else other than what you testified,

329
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,966
could you please call this number?

330
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:42,806
Captain Cha was so flustered that he didn't remember everything, either.

331
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:47,116
We'll make sure nothing happens to you, even if your testimony changes.

332
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:49,846
Thank you in advance, Ma'am.

333
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:54,086
- Thank you in advance.
- Thank you in advance.

334
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:06,896
Senior Officer Oh. Officer Jo.

335
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:07,896
- Yes.
- Yes.

336
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:09,736
Let's look.

337
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:11,806
For the eyewitness.

338
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:20,016
- Who's this?
- Hello.

339
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,016
I'm Officer Oh Young Min of Namchon Police Station.

340
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:24,386
- There was an assault case nearby—
- I don't know anything.

341
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,806
Yes, got it.

342
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,276
Hello, I'm from Namchon Police Station.

343
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:30,856
Could you cooperate for a moment?

344
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:32,286
I don't know.

345
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,046
- Who's this?
- Hello.

346
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:38,766
I'm Team Leader Kim Jin Hee of Team No. 2 of Namchon Police Station.

347
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:42,836
By chance, three days ago, around 2:00 in the morning—

348
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:45,216
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

349
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:49,776
I'm not so sure.

350
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:52,356
I didn't see it.

351
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,836
- Who's this?
- Hello.

352
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:59,096
I'm Team Leader Kim Jin Hee of Team No. 2 of Namchon Police Station.

353
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:02,126
- I don't know anything.
- No, no, just a moment...

354
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:10,016
I don't really know.

355
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:13,516
I don't know. I didn't see it.

Who's this?

357
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,996
This is a problem.

358
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:45,926
No one would testify because they might get harassed.

359
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,366
What do we do about Captain Cha?

360
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,686
Hold on, Officer Oh.

00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:58,406

- Do you see something?

363
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,416
There's one here, too.

364

When did she do all this...

- Hello.

Hello.

368
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,116
Dr. Park, let's have some tea.

369
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:53,526
Do you want coffee? Old-fashioned coffee?

370
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,876
It's on me.

371
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:58,586
There's still a lot of time. Take your time and think about it.

372

Yes.

Ms. Kim.

374
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:13,116
We're having a conversation right now.

375
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:16,136
I'm making coffee right now.

376
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,656
You know, too. Right?

Hanwool Clinic.

378
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:27,826
Of course.

379
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,476
I talked to the head of the nursing department yesterday regarding a patient.

380
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:37,306
Yes, I'm thinking of recommending Dr. Park as a doctor there.

381
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,436
Do you want to work in this neighborhood?

382
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:48,226
I wonder if he could adjust to a new neighborhood.

383
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:50,636
He was so shy in school that

384
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,396
he couldn't even look at a woman directly.

385
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:56,676
I wonder if he could treat patients properly.

386
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:05,596
What if I introduced you to them,

387
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:08,956
but they blame me for your poor performance because of shyness?

388
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,526
I was just a student then.

389
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:12,056
I've worked as a doctor for years now.

390
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:15,566
Right? That's the right answer.

391
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:21,286
Well, if I get to work there,

392
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:24,866
I'll make sure not to inconvenience you in any way.

393
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:28,376
Of course, of course.

394
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:35,206
Will you really accept the job?

395
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:39,806
Yes. I've been thinking, but it won't be bad if it's in the neighborhood.

396
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:44,086
Do you have to? You haven't been on a break for that long.

397
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:47,546
You were lying about being rich, weren't you?

398
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:49,546
That's when I was living by myself.

399
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:52,886
I need to make more to live a fun life with you for a long time.

400
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,916
I used to think money was useless

401
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,576
once I died and I should spend it all, but I changed my mind.

402
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:00,226
Now I have someone to spend money with.

403
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:02,616
You. I'm talking about you.

404
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:06,616
Yes. Make a lot of money.

405
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:07,806

411
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,376
Yes, the meat was so great.

Why do you act like you do?

436
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:45,336
It's because I was glad to see you.

I finally got to meet that mean bitch whom I've only heard about for 30 years.

Even though you lived horribly, you look better than I thought.

Did she say that?

441
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,016
You were infamous. I guess you didn't know.

442
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:03,096
I was famous for being pretty, and you were for being mean.

443
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:05,366
You'd better shut your trap.

444
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,286
You seduced my innocent brother and destroyed our family.

445
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:10,046
Park Jin Hong was innocent?

446
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:13,136

- Mom.
- Jin Hee, you must be hungry.

Hi, my daughter.

00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:30,236
Yes. What should I do?

451
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,696
Should I help with serving?

452
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:33,406
Or should I fill the fridge with drinks?

00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:35,506
No. Just go in with Mom and eat.

- Well...

00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:48,906
- I'm Park—
- Park Ji Eun.

459
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:51,026
We were friends in high school.

460
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:52,736
Oh, really?

461
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:55,286
Hello, Aunt.
(She uses the word "aunt" that refers to maternal aunt)

462
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:59,296
I've never met Mom's high school friend other than Aunt Mi Jeong.

463
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,326
Aunt?

464
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:02,676
Yes, you're aunt if you're Mom's friend.

465
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,306
What was she like in high school?

466
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,816
She was a total disaster, wasn't she?

467
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:12,236
She was mean, a bad student, and she partied a lot.

468
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:13,826
You're talking about yourself.

469
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,286
Go inside now. I'll be right there.

470
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:16,376
Yes, go inside.

471
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:17,926
I'll see you next time, Aunt.

472
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:20,586
It was nice meeting you.

473
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,286
Hey.

474
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:26,506
Why aren't you leaving?

475
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:28,656
How come she looks exactly like Jin Hong?

476
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,096
- Are you crazy?
- Something wrong with your eyes?

477
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,406
Does she know about my brother, too?

478
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:33,626
Of course, she does.

479
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:37,206
We shared everything you made, including the scallion kimchi.

480
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:40,586
Why do you keep eating that, anyway?

481
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:43,136
She ate it, too?

482
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:44,176
Did she like it?

483
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,116
She's not picky with food. Okay?

484
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:50,306
How about her education? Did you send her to college, too?

485
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:54,556
Jin Hee is a police executive. A lieutenant.

486
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,116
She was really good at studying.

487
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:57,346
At the top of her class all the time.

488
00:30:57,346 --> 00:31:00,566
You should've made her a doctor like her dad if she was good at studying.

489
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,916
Shut up and leave. Okay?

490
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:07,506
I'll cut your lips, steam half, and deep fry the other half.

491
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:11,936
Hey.

492
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,786
By the way, why I'm I "Aunt?"

493
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,426
Why do you care?

494
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:19,346
It's not like you'd see her again.

495
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,656
Leave, I said.

496
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,956
I told you to leave.

497
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:34,816
Leave!

498
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,766
I'll give you my business card.

499
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:41,616
You can even text me if you remember anything.

500
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:42,976
Thank you.

501
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,986
Thank you in advance.

502
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,386
I'll give you my business card.

503
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:50,476
I'm available 24-7.

504
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,716
- Please make sure to contact me.
- Okay.

505
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,636
Thank you for your time.

506
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:00,186
Hello, I'm a police officer.

507
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:02,156
Could you please... No, no, no.

508
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:04,506
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

509
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,116
Hold on, sir.

510
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:07,816
Sir!

511
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:10,976
Sir!

512
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,956
What time is it right now?

513
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:28,846
Mom.

514
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,516
Mom.

515
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:39,316
Hey, Mom. Where are you? Did you get home safely?

516
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,946
You're with Ahjussi?

517
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:45,056
Okay.

518
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,506
I'll be a bit late.

519
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:50,466
How did you feel after getting the shot?

520
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:53,706
I was okay for three or four days, but it hurt more afterward.

521
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,546
I was thinking of switching hospitals,

522
00:32:55,546 --> 00:32:57,166
but I wanted to know why, at least.

523
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,956
What's the reason?

524
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:02,076
I told you last time.

525
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:04,566
You constantly need physical therapy and treatment.

526
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:08,046
Since you're regressing so severely—

527
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,706
R-Regress?

528
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:13,286
You saw the X-ray last time.

529
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,546
Your joints got worn out.

530
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:20,176
You're still young. What did you do with your shoulders?

531
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:24,296
I really didn't do much.

532
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:30,286
I washed a large pot for bone broth once a day like this and...

533
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:32,116
Gosh, it hurts.

534
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,276
And...

535
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,086
And I don't do much else.

536
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:42,046
I lift 50kg of meat that's drained of blood twice a day.

537
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:47,636
I'll prescribe you medicine. Please pick that up.

538
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:50,296
Take a shot and have a physical therapy session.

539
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,306
Another shot?

540
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:56,986
Yes. The syringe will be this big today.

541
00:33:56,986 --> 00:34:00,776
Doctor, please don't give me a shot.

542
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:02,766
Please don't give me a shot.

543
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:04,086
I don't want it.

544
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:06,456
Please just let me not take it.

545
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:08,376
Just give me the medicine.

546
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:09,876
Hello.

547
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:14,806
It's regarding the illegal dumping case from that street.

548
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,776
- Please contact me.
- Yes, got it.

549
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,816
Thank you.

550
00:34:34,016 --> 00:34:35,496
Aunt.

551
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:38,356
Do you remember me?

552
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,646
Yes, of course. I remember.

553
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:43,986
Do you work in this neighborhood?

554
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:47,246
Yes, at Namchon Police Station. It's past that five-way intersection.

555
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:49,086
I see.

556
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:51,676
Thank you.

557
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,866
Oh, do you want something?

558
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:54,886
Do you want some fruit?

559
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,406
Not at all.

560
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:58,796
Where are you going to? Should I help you carry these?

561
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,026
No, it's okay. You'll get tired while on duty.

562
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:03,336
It's okay. This is nothing.

563
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:06,456
Which way are you going? This way?

564
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,506
Could you carry them to the bus station, then?

565
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:13,496
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

566
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:15,326
This way.

567
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:23,096
- Come this way.
- Okay.

568
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,596
I heard you were a very good student.

569
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,416
Pardon? No, not at all.

570
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,286
I just studied hard. But I was lucky.

571
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:38,566
Lucky, my foot. It's because you're impressive.

572
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:41,646
I looked up the police academy because of you, and I was shocked.

573
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:44,716
Your scores need to be really high to make the cut.

574
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:47,726
Did you look that up because of me?

575
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:51,406
Yeah, I was just curious.

576
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:55,256
I was so proud of you that you grew up so well.

577
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:58,166
Thank you.

578
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,626
I'll get going now.

579
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,796
It was nice to see you, Aunt.

580
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:02,766
Oh, hold on.

581
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,526
I'll give you some pocket money—

582
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,476
No, no, no. I get in trouble if we accept that.

583
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:10,266
Is that so? Right, right.

584
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,506
Get home safely.

585
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,806
- See you again, Aunt.
- Okay.

586
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,216
Aunt?

587
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:46,756
The case is being sent to the Prosecutors' Office in two days.

588
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:51,116
But we haven't found an eyewitness or persuaded the plaintiff, either.

589
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:55,306
We still have two days left.

590
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:57,376
Let's do our best...

591
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,096
and give up when it comes to it.

592
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,966
What are you saying? I haven't given up. Okay?

593
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:06,856
I just need an idea.

594
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,416
I know you're tired,

595
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,826
but I'll count on you a little longer.

596
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:16,446
I need to go somewhere early tomorrow.

597
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:20,066
Did you find anything?

598
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,886
Do you think what he said is really true?

599
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:28,876
I don't know anything for sure yet.

600
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:32,756
But I'll let you know once things get sorted out.

601
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:36,486
Okay.

602
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:39,466
Go inside. I'll get going.

603
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,056
Should I walk you home?

604
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:50,256
It's okay.

605
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,226
Senior.

606
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:54,646
Yeah?

607
00:37:57,106 --> 00:38:01,536
You've always been right.

608
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:08,266
You've never been wrong.

609
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:11,486
At least to me.

610
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:13,606
You probably didn't know,

611
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,956
but I mean it.

612
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:18,006
I'm not lying.

613
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:42,556
This is it.

614
00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:50,206
Phone number...

615
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,526
It must be somewhere.

616
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:28,386
Are you out of your mind?

617
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,956
You know the situation in the residential area.

618
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:35,946
If you prohibit parking and stopping here,

619
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:38,636
what about people like me, who live paycheck to paycheck driving?

620
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,336
Have you been parking here all this time?

621
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:45,906
Yes, as you can see, where else can I park?

622
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:49,076
So every day, without skipping a day,

623
00:40:49,076 --> 00:40:50,866
you've been parking here. Right?

624
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:55,946
Yes. So please understand my situation. Please?

625
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:01,426
- What are you doing?
- Where have you been all this time?

626
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,666
- Thank you. I love you.
- What are you doing?

627
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:07,006
I-I won't do anything else.

628
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,356
I just need the memory card from your dash cam.

629
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:14,476
Pardon?

630
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:21,096
November 3rd...

631
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:22,976
It's here.

632
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:30,286
Go back, go back.

633
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:34,386
2:00 in the morning. Right?

634
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:38,046
Stop.

635
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:51,416
- I found it.
- Huh?

636
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,086
Huh? Did you find something?

637
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:54,646
Gosh.

638
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:57,786
Is this it? It is, right?

639
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,306
Huh?

640
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:03,866
Which one is you?

641
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:06,556
Why do they look so similar?

642
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:09,356
T-This is me.

643
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:12,846
N-No, is this it?

644
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:16,356
Gosh, don't you know which one's your body?

645
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,916
He's getting beat up. He's getting beat up. He's getting beat up.

646
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,766
You got beat up!

647
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:38,446
He got beat up.

648
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:41,706
Team Leader Kim. I mean, Ms. Team Leader Kim. Thank you so much.

649
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:43,516
I'll never forget you did this for me.

650
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:46,606
Team Leader, you're the best!

651
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,966
You did great.

652
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:52,096
You saw that. Right?

653
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:55,086
What's better evidence than this? Right?

654
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:56,726
What's better evidence than this?

655
00:42:56,726 --> 00:43:00,606
It's an assault report. Castle Rock Internet Cafe, 15-2, Namchon-dong.

656
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:02,246
Pardon?

657
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,966
Let go, I said!

658
00:43:03,966 --> 00:43:05,846
- Listen to Mom.
- Leave!

659
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:07,606
What will you do?

660
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:09,126
Over here. Help.

661
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:10,866
We need to go.

662
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:12,296
Unni.

663
00:43:12,296 --> 00:43:15,916
Please let go and explain what's going on.

664
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,066
Are you okay?

665
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:18,546
Did you call the police?

666
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:22,286
Yes, I reported you because you put Ga Eul in danger. So what?

667
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:24,666
Let me check your ID, please.

668
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,656
I'm her mom.

669
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:29,906
I'm here to pick up my daughter, who ran away from home.

670
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:32,436
I said I don't want to go to the hospital.

671
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:34,146
Be quiet, please!

672
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:35,856
Ma'am.

673
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:39,166
Let's have a seat and talk instead.

674
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:43,676
Submit a complaint or whatever.

675
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:45,646
I'll appear in court.

676
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:49,326
But I want you to just let us go today.

677
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,266
Try seeing Ga Eul one more time.

678
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:55,706
I'll report you for sexual assault.

679
00:43:55,706 --> 00:43:59,526
What do you mean, sexual assault? We did it together.

680
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:02,876
And we'll keep the baby, too.

681
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,826
Yes, I-I'll raise the baby.

682
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:06,846
I'll take all responsibilities, so—

683
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:08,566
Mom.

684
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:13,076
Mother, please don't be violent. Let's talk instead.

685
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,686
Why don't you tell me?

686
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:22,196
Do you think it makes sense for a high school student to give birth?

687
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:25,636
Her mom gave birth to her when she was in high school, too.

688
00:44:25,636 --> 00:44:28,696
Why can't I do the same?

689
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,216
She must've been out of her mind.

690
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:40,346
Let's go.

691
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:42,486
Ga Eul. Ma'am. Well...

692
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:44,606
Let go.

693
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:46,206
Ga Eul.

694
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:48,936
Don't touch my daughter!

695
00:44:56,256 --> 00:44:58,126
Let's go.

696
00:45:29,856 --> 00:45:32,886
What? What? What? What?

697
00:45:32,886 --> 00:45:35,176
You've never seen someone whose mom gave birth in high school?

698
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:37,116
Well...

699
00:45:38,186 --> 00:45:41,346
Yes, I've never seen one in person.

700
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,926
What do you think?

701
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:51,486
Your mother is so impressive in many ways.

702
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:17,736
That bastard...

703
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,336
Pardon?

704
00:46:47,116 --> 00:46:48,456
Mom, you're home.

705
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:50,926
You're home early.

706
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:53,316
Hello.

707
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:55,466
We brought side dishes. They're heavy.

708
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:57,676
- Come on in, Oppa.
- Okay.

709
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,226
Here.

710
00:47:04,226 --> 00:47:05,766
Wow, looks so good.

711
00:47:05,766 --> 00:47:07,106
- Right?
- Yeah.

712
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:09,496
Eat as much as you want. I'll get you more.

713
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:14,356
I'm so glad you like the same food as your mom.

714
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:16,816
Wow, I can't take this anymore.

715
00:47:16,816 --> 00:47:21,816
How dare you bring those here and talk about how she likes it or not?

716
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:24,436
Do you think she's easy?

717
00:47:24,436 --> 00:47:26,636
Do you think I'm a joke?

718
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,236
P-Pardon?

719
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:30,966
What's wrong with you now?

720
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,666
Mom.

721
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:36,666
He's seeing another woman.

722
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,146
He's a two-timer.

723
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:42,926
What?

724
00:47:46,326 --> 00:47:48,646
What's with you? Are you cheating now?

725
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,736
Speak clearly.

726
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:54,376
I-I-I don't know what she's talking about.

727
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:57,226
I really don't know—

728
00:47:57,226 --> 00:48:00,276
Are you saying she's lying right now?

729
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:03,986
Wow, he keeps lying about it.

730
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:05,606
I saw it myself.

731
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:08,816
She's someone you know even.

732
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:13,366
Aunt Ji Eun.

733
00:48:22,376 --> 00:48:24,036
By chance...

734
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,896
is it that Ji Eun?

735
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:28,496
Yes!

736
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:31,246
Your friend, Aunt Ji Eun.

737
00:48:31,246 --> 00:48:33,246
W-What?

738
00:48:47,656 --> 00:48:49,326
Wait...

739
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:52,866
Do you find it funny right now?

740
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,686
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

741
00:48:54,686 --> 00:48:56,326
I couldn't help it...

742
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:57,526
Mom.

743
00:48:57,526 --> 00:49:01,456
I'm sorry. What do we do?

744
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:04,466
Well...

745
00:49:04,466 --> 00:49:05,966
Park Ji Eun.

746
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:08,226
Park Jin Hong.

747
00:49:08,226 --> 00:49:12,606
Aunt Ji Eun is my younger sister, Jin Hee.

748
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:19,616
She must be in shock. I feel terrible. What do I do?

749
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,480
Oh my goodness!

750
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:27,666
Why do you suddenly talk to me casually, by the way?

751
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:30,266
Well, I'm sorry.

752
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:35,136
I found it funny and cute, so...

753
00:49:38,816 --> 00:49:40,976
So cute.

754
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,156
Where did that go, anyway?

755
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:58,016
If it fell, there should be glass pieces.

756
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:03,546
Gosh, I don't get it for the life of me.

757
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:26,376
I hate that bitch,

758
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:28,456
but her daughter is cute.

759
00:50:28,456 --> 00:50:31,486
Where did she come from, anyway?

760
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:35,986
I mean...

761
00:50:35,986 --> 00:50:38,606
What am I supposed to call that person, then?

762
00:50:38,606 --> 00:50:41,056
She's not Imo at this point.
(Maternal aunt)

763
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:43,266
But calling her Gomo is—
(Paternal aunt)

764
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:45,736
Gomo, my foot.

765
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:48,186
Just call her Ahjumma.

766
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:51,516
Who cares if she's Imo or Gomo? They're just titles.

767
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,176
How could I do that? It's kind of...

768
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:58,266
It just doesn't feel right. It's somehow...

769
00:50:58,266 --> 00:50:59,406
Yes, that's it.

770
00:50:59,406 --> 00:51:06,106
It's like I just received a really complicated DIY furniture piece without the instructions.

771
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:13,336
I could just look at the photo and take a guess even without the instructions.

772
00:51:14,626 --> 00:51:17,586
You still need the instructions in addition to the photo.

773
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:22,266
Do you live life according to the instructions?

774
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:25,326
Things turn out even without stuff like that.

775
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:26,976
It can't just turn out.

776
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:29,426
It needs to turn out the right way.

777
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:33,116
You live in such a boring way.

778
00:51:33,116 --> 00:51:35,756
How about you? Are you having fun?

779
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:38,876
Because you didn't live according to the instructions?

780
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:41,316
You know this saying. Right?

781
00:51:41,316 --> 00:51:45,556
"Right now, wrong then."

782
00:51:45,556 --> 00:51:47,596
Isn't it the other way around?

783
00:51:48,236 --> 00:51:50,656
Is it? Anyway.

784
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:56,286
Meeting Jin Hong and giving birth to you when I was a kid

785
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:59,616
was something I deserved to be beaten to death for then.

786
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,626
But now everyone tells me

787
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:04,926
that I lived well.

788
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:07,446
That it's a great thing that I kept you.

789
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:11,966
So I really hated Ji Eun back then.

790
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:16,666
But since I started again with Jin Hong,

791
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,816
I think without Ji Eun,

792
00:52:20,816 --> 00:52:23,736
I might not have met Oppa.

793
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:27,056
And I wonder if I would've had you, too.

794
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:30,876
If life has...

795
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:34,726
rules like instructions

796
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:39,716
and if some keep following the rules and some keep failing,

797
00:52:39,716 --> 00:52:44,026
how are you supposed to live if you keep failing? You know what I mean?

798
00:52:49,976 --> 00:52:51,166
You're right.

799
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,876
Right?

800
00:52:52,876 --> 00:52:55,386
Do you need the instructions?

801
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:57,176
You still need one.

802
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:59,216
You little.

803
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:08,396
Can I see you right now?

804
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:12,526
Mom, I'll step out for a second.

805
00:53:15,566 --> 00:53:17,496
Right.

806
00:53:17,496 --> 00:53:22,526
I think Ga Eul will end up being dragged to the hospital.

807
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:26,556
It turns out her mom is really something.

[Wolsan Police Station]

809
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:38,416
So these are the things that were found at the park murder crime scene?

810
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,026
Yes.

811
00:53:41,776 --> 00:53:43,886
Isn't that a hearing aid?

812
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:47,746
It is. It's a micro hearing aid.

813
00:53:51,716 --> 00:53:52,906
Do you still need more time?

814
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:54,886
No, we're finishing up.

815
00:53:54,886 --> 00:53:56,026
We'll be right out. Sorry.

816
00:53:56,026 --> 00:53:58,766
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

817
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,296
It has something written on it. Like numbers.

818
00:54:15,026 --> 00:54:17,656
Is it like a serial number?

819
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:21,746
I'll take a photo of it up close.

820
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:24,436
Find out if the serial number can get us anything.

821
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:25,946
Okay.

822
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,476
And don't tell the teammates.

823
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:35,556
It'd be good if we catch the culprit with everyone jumping in,

824
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:37,326
- but if we don't—
- Yes.

825
00:54:37,326 --> 00:54:40,266
All of us will go to hell.

826
00:54:40,266 --> 00:54:41,996
I know. Of course.

827
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:45,436
I'll get busy. I'll be away from the station a lot, too.

828
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:48,376
Fill in my spot for me.

829
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,726
Okay.

830
00:55:02,586 --> 00:55:06,496
I think Ga Eul will end up being dragged to the hospital.

831
00:55:06,496 --> 00:55:08,566
Hey, Ga Eul.

832
00:55:11,046 --> 00:55:13,566
Can't you say hello, at least?

833
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:34,066

00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:46,686

Ga Eul, what are you doing here?

844
00:57:42,136 --> 00:57:48,166
You already have a boyfriend who comes whenever you call. I'm jealous.
