181
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,358
Just be honest.

182
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:40,428
The pain from not drinking was worse than the pain from the surgery. Right?

183
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:43,408
Of course. That's the joy of my life.

184
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,698
When are we going out next week?

185
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:47,078
- Let's do karaoke.
- Let's do Friday. Friday.

186
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:49,148
We'll enjoy Friday leisurely.

187
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,858
Karaoke.

188
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,218
Ms. Kim,

189
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:59,728
Dr. Park is starting his job at Hanwool Hospital next week.

190
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:02,678
Is the preparation going well?

191
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:06,868
Why don't you ask him yourself?

192
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:13,318
I'm asking because he seems to care about your schedule more than his.

193
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:19,568
Please ask him to be on schedule for his first day at work this time.

194
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:27,838
Oppa.

195
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,508
Yes.

196
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:30,938
Me, too.

197
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:33,258
Why would you say that...

198
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,898
How frivolous.

199
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:39,428
No, Dr. Park keeps asking me to tell you...

200
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,808
Who parked here, anyway?

201
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:02,538
Oh? It must be the senior brothers!

202
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,598
Who are they?

203
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,948
The ones who worked here before you came.

204
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,088
You finally found your purpose.

205
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,418
Guys!

206
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:17,508
You came.

207
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:19,978
It's been forever. How have you been?

208
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:22,718
You punk. You changed now that you're a sergeant.

209
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:25,438
I know. You look great.

210
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,508
Thank you.

211
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:29,968
Well...

212
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:33,448
Say hello. It's Team Leader Kim Jin Hee of Team 2.

213
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,008
They're our old teammates.

214
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:39,398
They came by after hearing about Sergeant Oh and Corporal Jo's promotion.

215
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:42,258
Nice to meet you.

216
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,558
I'll let you catch up, then.

217
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,508
How come you haven't come by once?

218
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:54,438
Chief didn't let us because it'd make the new team leader uncomfortable.

219
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:57,088
He defended her whenever she was brought up.

220
00:12:57,088 --> 00:13:00,358
He was criticized for only caring for his police academy junior.

221
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:07,148
I guess Senior Jae Won's juniors got in trouble because of bribery.

222
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:10,348
But he insisted on defending them.

223
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:12,688
He said it was impossible, and they wouldn't do that.

224
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,588
But it all turned out to be true?

225
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:17,848
Yes! What's even crazier and infuriating is that

226
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,948
the juniors said they accepted the bribes

227
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:24,008
because Jae Won told them to. They totally threw him under the bus.

228
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,888
He almost got fired for accepting bribes.

229
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:31,188
The seniors saved him by giving him the constable position.

230
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:36,878
But he didn't say a word of apology or gratitude to them.

231
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,768
Check yesterday's crime report from District 2 again.

232
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:55,188
It doesn't match the plaintiff's testimony.

233
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:56,768
Okay.

234
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:09,968
Ms. Kim, are you feeling okay?

235
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,268
I'm okay.

236
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,888
That's good to hear.

237
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,968
Looks like Ms. Seong isn't coming today.

238
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:20,798
Yes. She's busy with something.

239
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:23,528
Should we tell her?

240
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:26,428
What is it? Is something going on?

241
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:29,798
Your daughter is a police officer. Right?

242
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,508
If that's the case...

243
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,748
since your daughter is a police officer,

244
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:39,148
can't she say something at the police station?

245
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:40,878
Yes.

246
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,078
It's a matter of making a living.

247
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:49,318
A police officer putting in a word would be much better than us doing it.

248
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:54,188
Of course. Ae Ja likes men, and she is so flirtatious,

249
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:56,528
but she's been suppressing all that.

250
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:00,198
Goodness, she suffered her whole life because of her son.

251
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,588
I thought he was finally making money, but he's in that mess now.

252
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,318
It must be so devastating to her.

253
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:09,978
She stopped eating. She won't eat anything.

254
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:12,678
I wouldn't be able to, either.

255
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,068
Just tell her to consult a lawyer.

256
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:26,168
A lawyer would be a lot more helpful than me.

257
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,588
I know it puts you in a difficult position,

258
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:31,238
but I feel bad for the old ladies.

259
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:34,738
You don't have to do anything. Just be there during the investigation—

260
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:37,858
I normally try to do you favors,

261
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:39,818
but not this time.

262
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:42,478
I said you just need to be there.

263
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:44,498
You don't have to do anything.

264
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:47,248
Why would I go if I won't do anything?

265
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:51,028
Okay.

266
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,348
You didn't hear anything from me.

267
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:55,138
Okay.

268
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:59,058
Geez. Gosh.

269
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,508
Here. I got it, I got it.

270
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,428
It's okay. We just need to wash it.

271
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,408
This is your shirt.

272
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:10,818
It's okay. I can just wash it.

273
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:17,908
Did you notice you're starting to sound like Jin Hong?

274
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:26,288
Whenever I'm with you, my danger detector must automatically get upgraded.

275
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:28,098
Seriously.

276
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:31,228
What gathering did he have to go to today?

277
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:34,768
He's starting his job at the hospital next week.

278
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:37,318
He's drinking with the seniors there.

279
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:40,468
His jobless life is over now.

280
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:47,608
Mom.

281
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,028
We have one day left now.

282
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:52,588
What are you talking about?

283
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,498
What do you think?

284
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:58,508
You're no longer prohibited from drinking.

285
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:03,888
If so, what should we eat first?

286
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,878
Should we get tteokbokki?

287
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:08,108
Tteokbokki? Okay, let's eat that for the first round.

288
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,878
And for the second round, fried chicken. Fried chicken.

289
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:15,278
Gosh, we're just choosing drinking snacks. Why am I so happy?

290
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,198
What should we decimate first?

291
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,008
We'll have soju and beer first.

292
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,718
You have to start with soju and beer.

293
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:23,058
We'll move on to soju and...

294
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:26,838
But this is your first day. Don't overdo it. Just drink one bottle each.

295
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,038
You're so cruel.

296
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:29,658
How could I just stop drinking?

297
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:30,968
We need to get beer for the second round, too.

298
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,738
Beer is beer, and soju is soju.

299
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:35,838
Oppa, are you going somewhere?

300
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,248
Ahjussi, are you coming with us?

301
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:39,878
But you can't eat spicy food, Ahjussi.

302
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:55,158
Well, is she your daughter, Dr. Park?

303
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,588
Father, how did you find me here?

304
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:59,038
My gosh, what do we do?

305
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,638
Ahjussi? Ahjussi?

306
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:12,648
Your father is old now.

307
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,648
He's not the same anymore.

308
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:18,248
We don't expect you to do a lot for us.

309
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:20,598
Let's see each other, at least.

310
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:24,668
What did Ji Eun do to deserve this? She's stuck in the middle.

311
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,228
Don't blame her for this.

312
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:31,868
Come home this weekend.

313
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,178
Let's have dinner together.

314
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:37,168
Yes. Your daughter, too.

315
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,448
It's Jin Hee. Right?

316
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:42,078
Let us meet her, too.

317
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:45,938
Jin Hee's mom. Bring her, too.

318
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,028
What are you thinking?

319
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:51,108
We should at least see them once.

320
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:54,068
It's overdue, but you should have a wedding.

321
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:57,828
You have a daughter, too. That's the right thing to do.

322
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:02,038
Since we met earlier, it would've been nice to introduce ourselves, too.

323
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:04,118
Why would you separate them like that?

324
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:05,618
I heard they're going out to eat.

325
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:07,808
They must feel so uncomfortable.

326
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:11,308
How could they eat properly after seeing us?

327
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:13,138
Cheers.

328
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,978
- This is it.
- Soju is best with tteokbokki.

329
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,178
Should I make another soju cocktail?

330
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:23,208
No. Your stomach will explode.

331
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,138
Let's eat this first and think about it later.

332
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,358
That'd be good. Right?

333
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,148
Of course.

334
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,458
How do you feel after seeing those two today?

335
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,748
What do you want me to say?

336
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:37,668
Good. Bad.

337
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:40,368
Didn't feel anything. Not so good.

338
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,818
Better than expected. Stuff like that.

339
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,858
I was just kind of surprised.

340
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,928
I didn't think they'd show up in front of our house.

341
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,608
Weren't you surprised?

342
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,398
I was.

343
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:55,318
Maybe I was preparing for it without realizing it while seeing Oppa.

344
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:59,598
I felt calmer than I expected.

345
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,388
You know, that grandpa—

346
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:10,868
Isn't he really scary looking?

347
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:13,088
It's my first time seeing his face, too.

348
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,218
I've only talked to the lady next to him.

349
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:16,388
About what?

350
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,798
It wasn't anything pleasant.

351
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,978
They moved in a hurry because they thought I'd ruin their son.

352
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:29,278
Wow, did they splash water on you and slap your face like in a drama

353
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:31,428
and said, "Get away from my son?"

354
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,628
"How much do you want?" stuff like that, too?

355
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:35,928
That would've been fun.

356
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:41,588
Thinking about it, maybe Jin Hong's family moved...

357
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,928
because Park Ji Eun snitched on us.

358
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:47,758
Ji Eun... I mean...

359
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:50,868
Anyway, is she rich?

360
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,198
Probably.

361
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:54,588
I knew it. That was some generous pocket money.

362
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,278
- She gave you pocket money?
- Yeah.

363
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:59,318
How much?

364
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:00,938
Two hundred thousand won?

365
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,298
Did you spend it?

366
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:05,778
How could I?

367
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:07,308
I'll give it back to her.

368
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,658
Why would you give it back? Just spend it.

369
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:13,528
- Or split it with me.
- No, I feel too uncomfortable spending it.

370
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:20,148
Let's end this here cleanly for the second round.

371
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,578
- Fried rice, please.
- Fried rice, please.

372
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:26,228
Oppa.

373
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:27,748
Hey.

374
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:31,008
- Did you get tasty food and have fun?
- Yeah.

375
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,798
Oh, I need to stop by somewhere.

376
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:36,678
- Where?
- You don't have to know.

377
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:46,018
He went to Jin Hee's work?

378
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:48,198
Your father did?

379
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:54,438
I explained and said he couldn't do that from now on.

380
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,318
Why didn't she say anything?

381
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,208
And what else did he say?

382
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,798
You can ignore the rest.

383
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:05,668
I told you about Jin Hee because I thought you should know, too.

384
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,808
Just tell me.

385
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:11,888
He already met her. How could I just ignore that?

386
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:20,968
They invited you to a family dinner at the house.

387
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:23,088
Both you and Jin Hee.

388
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,438
What if I say no?

389
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:31,258
Would that cause problems?

390
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:33,738
Just think of you and Jin Hee.

391
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,588
I'll take care of the rest.

392
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:40,628
Let's face them, Oppa.

393
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,248
I think it'd only end that way.

394
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:45,018
You don't really have to.

395
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:49,578
I don't want to see them at their home.

396
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:50,808
I'll see them outside.

397
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:53,868
And I'll see Ahjumma before Ahjussi.

398
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,188
Okay. Let's go together.

399
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,718
There's a side of me...

400
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:07,978
I don't want you to see.

401
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,928
I'll go alone.

402
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:52,558
Why is he allowing himself to be treated that way?

403
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:26,928
Where are you, Senior?

404
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:29,388
I'm at home because I'm on break.

405
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,048
I called to see if everything was okay.

406
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,508
Yes, everything's okay.

407
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:36,468
I do have something to say.

408
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,148
Would you like to get drinks this evening—

409
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:39,368
I'm working late tonight.

410
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:42,228
Yes, got it.

411
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,148
Hang up.

412
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:45,748
Yes, sir.

413
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,708
I was always badmouthing him behind his back.

414
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,848
Why does he have to be so cool?

415
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,918
I'm so embarrassed.

416
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:43,378
Mom is having dinner with Ahjussi.

417
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:45,248
I'm here to see you.

418
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:48,188
You saw Grandpa and Grandma. Right?

419
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:50,738
You have no idea how happy they are.

420
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:53,648
They've been living like hermits in a big house,

421
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:56,648
but they can't stop talking about you lately.

422
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:58,818
They're so full of energy.

423
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,498
I'm so grateful to you, Jin Hee.

424
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,458
I didn't even do anything.

425
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:06,758
You've done enough being born and turning out so well.

426
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:09,028
You've done plenty.

427
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:14,368
Since we're on the topic...

428
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,768
could you help us?

429
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:19,198
With what?

430
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:23,288
You know. Your mom and dad getting married.

431
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:26,098
So I'm asking you...

432
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:31,548
to persuade your mom so we can keep seeing each other as a family.

433
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:37,418
I think we can switch...

434
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:26,098
Would you like to get drinks this evening—

435
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,750
[Team Leader Kim Jin Hee]

436
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:52,778
Ms. Kim.

437
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:56,078
Why don't you leave after lunch?

438
00:27:56,078 --> 00:27:58,258
I ordered yours, too.

439
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:00,118
I'll eat after I come back.

440
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:03,348
I have too much adrenaline that...

441
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,858
I have no appetite.

442
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,868
You're all dead.

443
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:19,028
- Amazing.
- As for me...

444
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:24,598
I can do it anytime if you want.

445
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:28,528
Because I want to live with you so much.

446
00:28:28,528 --> 00:28:30,578
But, Eun Mi,

447
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:34,698
you don't have to get tossed around because that's what my parents want.

448
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:39,468
I don't want to be married that way.

449
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:47,568
We'll take care of the home, furnishing, and wedding venue.

450
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:51,578
You don't have to speak or spend money.

451
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:56,808
I'm not suggesting living with us. Don't worry about that unnecessarily.

452
00:28:56,808 --> 00:29:00,228
You don't have to sell the apartment you live in.

453
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:01,568
Just rent it out and—

454
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,048
Because we might break up, and I might need to move back there?

455
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:09,648
Looks like you never thought I wouldn't marry Jin Hong.

456
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,688
You have no reason not to.

457
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:13,708
You two have a child together

458
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,398
and no one is opposed to it.

459
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:18,898
But shouldn't she change her last name?

460
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:21,638
She's a Park. Why is she living as a Kim?

461
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:24,208
She's a Kim because she's my daughter.

462
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,038
Where were you when I gave birth and raised her?

463
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:28,928
I didn't know back then.

464
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:34,038
Even if you did, you wouldn't have even looked at my daughter and me.

465
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,708
It's because you're upset Jin Hong is

466
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,408
loafing around and getting old alone.

467
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,478
What?

468
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:43,148
Loafing around?

469
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,018
Why should my daughter...

470
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:48,588
My daughter, whom I raised alone while working my ass off.

471
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,168
Why should Kim Jin Hee, not Park Jin Hee...

472
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:55,358
be sacrificed to patch the Park family together?

473
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:58,698
Even Jin Hong can't do anything with her because she's my daughter.

474
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:02,588
You're holding yourself back very well.

475
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:06,648
You would've slapped me a few times already back then.

476
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,678
Yes.

477
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:13,988
I did the wrong thing.

478
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:19,608
It's because I only cared about my child, then.

479
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:22,138
Forgive me. Okay?

480
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,808
Get married.

481
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:30,168
Let's have you and Jin Hee become one family with us.

482
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:34,388
I'll be in touch again.

483
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:39,688
If you really want to,

484
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,198
I'll do it myself.

485
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:43,138
You can give me your hair.

486
00:30:43,138 --> 00:30:47,078
It'd be more accurate if I did it because I'm a police officer.

487
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:52,558
Did I offend you by chance?

488
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:57,138
But you have to be precise with things like this—

489
00:30:57,138 --> 00:31:02,378
Yes, I don't feel all that great.

490
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:05,788
But I'll still do it

491
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:08,548
to prove it for my mom.

492
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:15,008
Thank you for your cooperation all this time.

493
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:18,258
This was officially your last treatment.

494
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,878
Really? Is it really over?

495
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,868
You know you still need to be careful. Right?

496
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:25,698
Remember that your joints aren't young anymore.

497
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,698
Try to exercise sometimes, too.

498
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:30,318
I know, I know. Since I've been in so much pain,

499
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:33,648
I realized it's better to exercise even though I don't feel like it.

500
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:42,318
The end. I can leave now. Right?

501
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,458
Wait...

502
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,518
May I ask you a question?

503
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:49,878
Yes.

504
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,208
Four days ago,

505
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:56,268
when I went to the restaurant...

506
00:31:56,268 --> 00:31:58,278
- You're back.
- Yes.

507
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:00,408
Enjoy.

508
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:03,798
Thank you.

509
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:07,528
Excuse me.

510
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:09,138
Yes?

511
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:14,678
There are four ribs in here.

512
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,368
Doesn't it normally come with three?

513
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:20,658
They must've made a mistake in the kitchen.

514
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:26,158
Well, my boss told the kitchen to add an extra one.

515
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:28,478
Enjoy.

516
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:37,988
Why did you tell them to add an extra rib?

517
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,508
Did you feel sorry for me?

518
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:42,118
No.

519
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:45,588
Well...

520
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,038
My gosh.

521
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,648
You've got to be kidding me.

522
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:00,928
I had to endure that for giving him another rib.

523
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,068
I always give extra to the regulars.

524
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:05,978
Why didn't you just say that, then?

525
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:08,068
I couldn't think of that then...

526
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:10,538
Gosh, so annoying.

527
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,198
Hey.

528
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:17,908
By chance, do you...

529
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:23,518
either pity Dr. Park or like him—

530
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,638
Are you crazy?

531
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:34,078
I'm offended.

532
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:40,568
Give me a hot press. Warm me up.

533
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:45,728
What? You're seriously considering marriage?

534
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,138
I'm not that serious about it.

535
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,618
I'm just giving it a thought.

536
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:53,498
When I almost died after getting stabbed,

537
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,558
I've never seen Jin Hee crying so much.

538
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,228
It wasn't just you. I noticed it, too.

539
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:04,098
I had this thought then.

540
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:06,628
"If I die like this,

541
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,408
Jin Hee would be so lonely."

542
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:15,208
Fortunately, I thought she'd be okay since there are you and Mom, but

543
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:22,048
I was also very glad that Oppa showed up.

544
00:34:22,048 --> 00:34:24,658
Because Jin Hee would have another person on her side.

545
00:34:24,658 --> 00:34:28,848
But her so-called grandfather and grandmother showed up

546
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:32,118
and liked her and wanted her.

547
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:35,078
Since Jin Hee's different than me,

548
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:38,108
since she grew up with a lot of love,

549
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:43,358
she could be loved by them a lot, too.

550
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:46,608
You're right about that.

551
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,148
I should wait and see...

552
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,648
if they really changed

553
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:54,628
and if they can be on Jin Hee's side.

554
00:34:57,568 --> 00:34:59,698
But I really...

555
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,498
I don't know if this is right.

556
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:07,168
Getting married because of Jin Hee...

557
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:09,038
Is that okay to do?

558
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:16,568
Here they are.

559
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:24,438
Hello, I'm Kim Jin Hee.

560
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:25,788
Welcome, Jin Hee.

561
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:29,078
My gosh, I finally get to see you.

562
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:34,558
Gosh, nice to see you.

563
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:38,228
Gosh, I'm so thankful and proud of you.

564
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:40,988
Welcome. It's nice to see you.

565
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,768
Dad, say hello to Eun Mi, too.

566
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,828
She's Jin Hee's mom.

567
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:50,128
I get to see you like this.

568
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,608
I didn't think this would happen.

569
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:56,128
It's been over 30 years.

570
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,138
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Eun Mi.

571
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,568
Have a seat. Have a seat.

572
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:04,778
Let's sit.

573
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:06,578
Let's sit.

574
00:36:12,418 --> 00:36:17,488
Are you not interested in studying more?

575
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:20,828
You got great scores in school.

576
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:23,838
Don't be surprised.

577
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,598
Of course, I should look into it. You're my bloodline.

578
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:32,638
I didn't study with my brain. I did it with tenacity, sitting on my bottom.

579
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:36,288
When it comes to studying, our brain is useless

580
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:39,858
unless you have the tenacity to sit and keep it going.

581
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,338
I can't believe I'm seeing Dad smiling.

582
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:44,288
That must be the power of a granddaughter.

583
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:49,118
I still want you to think about it.

584
00:36:49,118 --> 00:36:52,428
You're still young. You can study abroad, too.

585
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:55,498
You can study anything you want.

586
00:36:55,498 --> 00:36:58,108
Becoming a doctor would be the best,

587
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,998
but becoming a professor isn't bad, either.

588
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:03,448
You should at least get a doctor's degree.

589
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:04,658
Since you're full of spirit—

590
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:07,008
She chose her profession herself.

591
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,328
You need to respect it.

592
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:13,228
He's saying that for her benefit.

593
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:16,818
It's not like we can't support her, either.

594
00:37:17,928 --> 00:37:20,588
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

595
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:25,328
No, I know you're saying that, for my sake.

596
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,868
But I'm satisfied with where I am now.

597
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:30,088
Don't just say no like that.

598
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:33,478
It's okay, even if it takes time. Just think about it.

599
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:35,728
Mother.

600
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:40,878
She's smart, but it appears she didn't finish her studies because of money.

601
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:44,388
I just think it's unfortunate.

602
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,628
Money isn't the reason she didn't continue her studies.

603
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:50,358
She's right. You're taking it too far this time.

604
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:53,668
It's not the same as educating her with chump change.

605
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:57,378
How come you're so selfish? Think from her perspective, too.

606
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,638
Your mother is right.

607
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:00,768
It's not too late to—

608
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,998
That's enough, you two.

609
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:05,758
Why are you stopping us? What did we do?

610
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:08,448
Be satisfied with what you've done to Ji Eun and me.

611
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:10,768
Don't do that to Jin Hee.

612
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:13,078
So are you guys struggling right now?

613
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,588
Ji Eun married into a proper family

614
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:17,868
and you became a doctor.

615
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:21,748
I did a good job raising my children.

616
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,568
Jin Hee, wait outside.

617
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:28,958
Okay.

618
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:32,828
How dare you tell her to leave?

619
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,738
What a rude woman you are.

620
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:39,128
How dare you tell your child to leave in front of us?

621
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:41,928
Because it wouldn't be a pretty sight, Ahjussi.

622
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,648
Look at this ignorant woman...

623
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:47,708
- Father.
- Father.

624
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,798
I'm ignorant, and your family is very rude.

625
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:54,178
I considered marrying for the sake of my daughter.

626
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:55,478
But I refuse.

627
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:58,978
I don't want you two to have my daughter as your granddaughter.

628
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:01,328
You'd make her suffocate to death.

629
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:04,038
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

630
00:39:04,038 --> 00:39:05,448
Take care.

631
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:07,118
Let's get out of here.

632
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:09,678
- H-H-How dare you—
- Dr. Park.

633
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,528
Catch Jin Hee. Catch her.

634
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:12,628
Ji Eun.

635
00:39:12,628 --> 00:39:14,978
That's enough!

636
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:20,518
You're so unbelievably sickening and embarrassing.

637
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:22,578
Dad, because of your stubbornness and obsession,

638
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:25,598
your son cut ties with you, and didn't see him for almost a decade.

639
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:27,238
But you're still doing this?

640
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:31,738
Must you control every aspect of our lives to feel satisfied?

641
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:36,228
You can just let it go for Oppa's sake, even if you're not satisfied.

642
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:39,988
This might be his last chance to start a family.

643
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:42,808
How could you ruin it like this?

644
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:45,838
When did we control your lives, anyway?

645
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:47,108
Didn't you?

646
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:49,388
Why did you hire someone to do a background check?

647
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,668
How could you treat Jin Hee the same way you treat us?

648
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:55,168
I was looking out for my son because I was worried about him.

649
00:39:55,168 --> 00:39:57,868
How is that the wrong thing to do?

650
00:39:57,868 --> 00:39:59,758
Of course, you don't know.

651
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:02,888
Going too far with it can suffocate someone.

652
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:06,658
Ji Eun said you changed.

653
00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:10,728
I was so stupid to feel hopeful, even for a moment.

654
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:13,728
It'd be better to continue to not see each other from now on.

655
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:17,078
Don't ever demand to see Jin Hee and Eun Mi.

656
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:19,838
Don't even go anywhere near them.

657
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,578
I won't be seeing you two, either.

658
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:23,808
Be well.

659
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,578
Dr. Park. Hey, D-Dr...

660
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:28,288
I feel the same way.

661
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:31,318
Don't look for me for a while.

662
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:56,008
Those old-timers. They always have to ruin things this way.

663
00:40:56,008 --> 00:41:00,358
I apologize. Don't be upset, Jin Hee and Eun Mi.

664
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,878
But still, Dad was in the process of giving Jin Hee an inheritance.

665
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:07,198
He was looking to set up a trust, too.

666
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,818
They did it the wrong way, but they were sincere.

667
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:14,488
Why are those miserly people so generous to Jin Hee?

668
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:17,538
Do they feel it in their blood or something?

669
00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:20,058
They're not that easy.

670
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:25,348
It's because the DNA test proved that she was their granddaughter.

671
00:41:27,378 --> 00:41:29,668
They did what?

672
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:32,808
They did a DNA test?

673
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:34,218
What?

674
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:37,108
Did you not tell your mom?

675
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:44,408
I mean, Father said he'd check, and Jin Hee—

676
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:04,948
Stop right there.

677
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:11,228
Why didn't you tell me that the old man visited you

678
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,298
at the station, and you did the DNA test?

679
00:42:19,228 --> 00:42:20,808
How could I tell you?

680
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:23,258
It meant they were suspicious of you.

681
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:26,388
It would've hurt your sense of pride.

682
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:30,718
Were you getting hurt instead so you wouldn't hurt me?

683
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:33,598
I didn't get hurt. Why would I—

684
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:36,228
What did I tell you when you mentioned the goldfish poop?

685
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:38,528
I told you not to hurt on your own and tell me.

686
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:41,508
Why are you getting hurt and being responsible for everything?

687
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:44,978
I said I didn't get hurt.

688
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:49,108
I just thought they might want to do that in their shoes.

689
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:53,078
I cared more about protecting you. I didn't mind it myself.

690
00:42:54,228 --> 00:42:58,008
Did you experience more than I did or did I experience more?

691
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,168
If you felt hurt 100%, it would've been only 10% for me.

692
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:03,668
Just let it go, please.

693
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:07,318
I said I didn't get hurt. Why do you keep saying I did?

694
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,198
Why are you so sure that I felt hurt?

695
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:12,168
I'm not the same as you.

696
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:15,108
Didn't you expect this much when they showed up?

697
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:16,668
I did.

698
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:19,578
I don't mind sacrificing some hair.

699
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:21,468
Same with today.

700
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:23,908
I was expecting a worse soap opera situation,

701
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:27,158
but it wasn't as bad as I expected.

702
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:30,998
But what were you expecting and imagining?

703
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:34,268
You're the one who got hurt already 100%.

704
00:43:34,268 --> 00:43:37,008
Why do you keep insisting that I got hurt?

705
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:40,838
Leave. Leave.

706
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:43,028
- Leave where?
- I don't know. Just go anywhere.

707
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:45,478
Why all of a sudden?

708
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:48,388
Well, why are you doing this?

709
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:51,028
You don't even know how I feel. How dare you...

710
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,238

Why is she suddenly being overprotective of me?

00:45:46,008 --> 00:45:49,438
Because she nearly experienced death.

723
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:54,538
She must've had a lot of thoughts at that moment.

Since you witnessed her almost dying,

727
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:08,868
you don't feel hurt about most things and laugh it off

728

You're going backpacking?

890
00:59:10,658 --> 00:59:12,908
Are you crazy? You won't be by my side, anyway.

891
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:15,428
- Get out of the way.
- It's not like you'd live with me forever.

892
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:18,538
I should be letting her go first. Right?

893
00:59:18,538 --> 00:59:20,808
Because I'm an adult and her mom.

894
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,868
♫ I know everything ♫

895
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:25,640
♫ Hey, look at me ♫
