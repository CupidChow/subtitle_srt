00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,140
I said we didn't have a fight.

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,940
We just had different opinions watching TV.

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,550
Hey, do you take the remote control first if someone has a different opinion?

12
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,790
Do you think I took it for no reason?

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,350
Shut up.

14
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,760
How dare you keep fighting in front of your mom?

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,210
Just punish us instead.

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,700

Look at you.

You're serving alcohol to minors.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,460
The makgeoli you drink on the mountain isn't alcohol. It's medicine.

- Coffee's okay. Right?
- Yes.

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,030
Thank you.

56
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,240
How nice.

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,930
Did you sleep okay?

58
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,210
I slept too well.

That's good to hear.

60

No.

Look at me while you talk to me.

66

Let's just...

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,330
think of it as an accident.

69
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,790
That'd be better for you, too.

70
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,130

75
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,070
That's why you were so into me last night.

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,450

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,540
No, together, please.

Let's treat the visitors to tasty food like she used to,

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,820
and we'll chat a lot like she would've. Okay?

90
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,590
Let's.

91
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,660
Hey, where's Mom's funeral photo?

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,640
I gave it to the workers.

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,380
It'll be here soon.

94
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,510
Done.

95
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm sorry for your loss.

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,700
Thank you.

97
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,290
Well, how did you know I was here?

98
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,870
What do you mean, how?

99
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,210
We went to the hospital, but you weren't there.

100
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,780
So we asked.

101
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,010
You're the lady with a good personality with an expensive car.

102
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,000
Were you Ms. Kim's family?

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
Yes.

104
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,820
Ms. Kim Mi Jeong and Ms. Kim aren't family. Right?

105
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,840
Why are they chief mourners together if they're not family?

106
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,900
You can do that for your friend, too.

107
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,230
But I didn't think her daughter would do that, too.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,840
Thank you.

109
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,330
Didn't you get off work early to come here?

110
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,940
Not at all.

111
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,790
- Enjoy.
- Yes.

112
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,810
Thank you.

113
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,820
I'll be staying in Seoul for a while.

114
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,190
Why? Do you have work?

115
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,040
No, we broke up.

116
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,520
It sounds like you break up three or four times a year.

117
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,780
How many times have you broken up with her?

118
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,090
It's for real this time.

119
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,980
Who'd believe that?

120
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,470
But looking at you, I realize the world

121
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,760
doesn't care that Grandma died.

122
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,870
Huh? Tae Gyeong is here.

123
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,070
Tae Gyeong?

124
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,300
Tae Gyeong.

125
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,790
Hey, what about Young Hoon? I thought you'd come tomorrow.

126
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,100
That Hyungnim is here, too.

127
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,760
Hello.

128
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,560
Hello.

129
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,740
I'll come back early in the morning.

130
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,180
Yes, that'd be better.

131
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,450
The chief mourners should get some sleep.

132
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,820
There will be more mourners tomorrow.

133
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,690
There will be more than today?

134
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,640
The second day is always like that.

135
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,720
It was like that with both of my parents.

136
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,590
You have to take care of yourself at times like this.

137
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,730
Cry if you want to.

138
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,940
If you hold it in, it becomes an illness.

139
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,460
- Yes.
- Let's go.

140
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,650
Call me if something comes up during the night.

141
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,910
Thank you for coming.

142
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,360
See you, Jin Hong.

143
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,920
What an obvious thing to say as a doctor.

144
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,700
Why is he friendly suddenly? It's not like him.

145
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,070
He's always been friendly to the patients.

146
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,570
He only yells at me.

147
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,030
So you'd really do as Sis said?

148
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,720
What's the problem, Uncle?

149
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,260
We're doing it according to her will.

150
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,160
I know she said it in the will, but this isn't right.

151
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,230
Her direct family is alive.

152
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,560
But why would she give the inheritance to strangers?

153
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,430
It wasn't enough that she raised them, and she left them money, too?

154
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,510
Maybe she had dementia in her last days.

155
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,980
Watch what you say, Uncle.

156
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,260
Same with the chief mourner duty. I would've done it if you called me first.

157
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,880
Do you know what my cousin said when he came?

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,160
This is so embarrassing.

159
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,680
The children are supposed to be chief mourners.

160
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,060
They're not even her children. Why are they the chief mourners?

161
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,440
Do they share blood or flesh?

162
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Honey, calm down.

163
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,010
Mi Jeong, don't be like that and help us out.

164
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,180
It's because we're struggling so much.

165
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,000
What have you been doing all this time that you are suddenly struggling?

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,570
What?

167
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,700
She went to the countryside because she was sick a long time ago.

168
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,600
You never visited her or called her.

169
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,490
Why suddenly care about the bloodline,

170
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,850
and why did your life get difficult?

171
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,800
Was she holding your money?

172
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,970
What thieves you are.

173
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,640
My gosh, listen to this woman.

174
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,080
- How dare you—
- Hey.

175
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,850
Did you go crazy because you're getting money?

176
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,670
Do you think you have the right to that money?

177
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,980
Yeah...

178
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,330
She's been giving Mom 200,000 or 300,000 won as pocket money for 20 years.

179
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,130
She gave her at least 10,000 won when she was struggling.

180
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,050
She gave her presents, took her on vacations,

181
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,420
and took her to the hospital, too.

Does she still not have the right, Uncle?

183
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,500
She cared about someone who was not even family.

184
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,900
Why didn't she care about her own brother? Huh? Why? Why?

185
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,750
I was never sad that Grandma and I didn't share blood.

186
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,940
Because she cherished me as someone more than that.

188
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,290
She's gone.

I guess they're in a rush, too.

I see. We're getting a new team leader, then?

202

Thank you so much, everyone.

206

The reason I can't get it together is because I lived with my mom for too long.

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,600
I'll—

362
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,420
I-I'll come with you.

363
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,100
Do you need something?

364
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,930
No.

365
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,330
You need a workout outfit and shoes first.

366
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,870
What's wrong? I can dress up when I work out.

367
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,900
Let's go, Oppa.

368
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,930
Anyway, let's take it easy since it's the first day.

369
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,030
I'll be totally intense with it.

370
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,230
Why do you like intense stuff so much? In these shoes?

371
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,270
Don't worry, don't worry. You know me.

372
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,040
- See you later.
- See you later.

373
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,920
Good luck.

374
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,540
Gong Ga Eul.

375
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,380
What are you doing?

376
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,370
Did you run away from home again?

377
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,190
- No.
- What are you doing here, then?

378
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,600
Do you have a sanitary pad, by chance?

379
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,720
Wait in the bathroom. I'll get it for you.

380
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I just don't have extra ones.

381
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,810
Just give me two.

382
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,370
Okay. Wait here.

383
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,150
Hold on. I'll get them for you.

384
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,450
Give me your bag.

385
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,800
Come whenever you need them.

386
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,040
Thank you.

387
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,930
You're much nicer than that Unni

388
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,640
and you're so sensitive, too.

389
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,380
Hey.

390
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,830
- It's for the pads.
- My goodness.

391
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,820
- How about me?
- Thank you.

392
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,590
Hey, Gong Ga Eul.

393
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,990
You're okay. Right?

394
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,260
What's she saying? So annoying.

395
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,240
How strange.

396
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,560
Why am I not excited at all?

397
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,470
Returning to the HQ was all I was focusing on.

398
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,340
So whenever I felt drained,

399
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,570
I endured everything, thinking it would be fine if I returned to the HQ.

400
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,550
But why do I feel so drained?

401
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,210
I feel like I'm in a swamp.

402
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,900
Probably because it's not what you expected.

403
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,300
You thought you'd be here for a year, but it's happening sooner.

404
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,510
You're not ready yet.

405
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,080
Not ready yet?

406
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,870
You don't have to relay what Section Chief said again.

407
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,330
"Hero complex" and "Don't get caught up?"

408
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,380
I can manage myself. You know I can.

409
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,320
He's so bad at comforting someone.

410
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,810
What? What's this now?

411
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,370
Did the Section Chief say something else?

412
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,920
You've been doing well.

413
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,360
And you'll be fine.

414
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,340
This is not bad.

415
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,330
Hold still for a moment.

416
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,250
Don't look at me like that.

417
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,000
Pardon?

418
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,100
Hold on. Hold on.

419
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,810
Let's go and take an X-ray.

420
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,710
Watch the steps.

421
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,570
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

422
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,890
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

423
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,530
Thank you.

424
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,940
Your back isn't the problem.

425
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,570
It started from your neck.

426
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,350
What are you doing? What will you do?

427
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,490
Wow, look how stiff your shoulders are. They're rock-hard.

428
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,250
That's why you should exercise every day.

429
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,450
This isn't a young person's body.

430
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,030
You started exercising a few days ago. Quit lecturing.

431
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,400
Everything happens in a chain reaction.

432
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,370
Because you have no muscles, your shoulders are supporting instead.

433
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,100
And since your shoulders are stiff, your back gets stiff, too.

434
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,440
That's why you have pain all the way to the lower back.

435
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,350
How is she? Is she okay?

436
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,460
She's okay. She just sprained her back.

437
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,670
Don't move too much.

438
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,830
- Okay.
- Be careful.

439
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,010
Yes, see you.

440
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,100
- My gosh.
- Hello.

441
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,190
Come on in.

442
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,230
- Aunt.
- Hey.

443
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,340
- We're leaving.
- See you.

444
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,580
Bye.

445
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,820
Gosh, isn't she addicted to fitness now?

446
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,260
How could she get into it so quickly?

447
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,690
She'll quit soon.

448
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,500
She's always been like this.

449
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,440
- Right? It won't last long. Right?
- I'm 100% sure.

450
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,140
Your mom said you're okay. Are you really?

451
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,010
I'm okay. She's an expert. I should trust her.

452
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,530
I couldn't move yesterday,

453
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,280
but I can move around today.

454
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,520
You should've been careful.

455
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,660
I made bone broth for you. I'll heat it up quickly.

456
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,610
Oh, nice!

457
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,890
Rouen Cathedral is one of the most beautiful buildings in France.

458
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,440
Rouen Cathedral is located in the Northwestern part of France...

459
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,840
Aren't you tired? Have a seat.

460
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay.

461
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,300
[Rouen Cathedral]

462
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,620
I meant you should sit on the sofa.

463
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,820
This is fine.

464
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,050
What are you watching?

465
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,360
Do you want to travel?

466
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,270
Huh? No, how could I go there? I'm just watching.

467
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,050
Why not? You can go if you want.

468
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,930
It's hard for Mom to get out of work.

469
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,560
I can't go on my own, either.

470
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,210
Why? Are you scared to travel alone?

471
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,980
No.

472
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,350
I'm not scared.

473
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,660
Why can't you go alone, then?

474
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,140
Are you okay?

475
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,340
Why are you going in there?

476
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,670
I came here to have another look at it.

477
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,040
I was wondering why this was here at first.

478
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,060
But now I know why you put this up here.

479
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,010
What?

480
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,280
I'm taking tomorrow off.

481
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,700
Let me.

482
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,460
What?

483
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,210
We provide tour guides for landmarks in each country.

484
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,160
And there are individual tour guides, too.

485
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,660
It won't be difficult to travel at all.

486
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,190
So, can I choose my own lodging instead of this one?

487
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,490
There's a fee if you choose your own.

488
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:59,600
You can stay at an affordable place if you get everything as a package.

489
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,280
♫ Let's keep the same pace and walk along together ♫

490
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,790

507
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:09,140
♫ You were by my side in the shiny moments ♫

508
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,830
Look at you.

509
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,760
I told you to walk carefully. Are you feeling better now?

510
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,060
You probably didn't drink.

511
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,000
Why are you blushing so much?

512
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,850
What is all that?

513
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,420
I'm going on a trip, Mom.

514
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,970
When?

515
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,950
- Within a month.
- Geez.

516
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,800
Hey, we should've planned together.

517
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,110
You can't just schedule it like that.

518
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,470
I'm going on my own.

519
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,260
I'm backpacking all over the world.

520
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,680
For how long?

521
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,830
- A year.
- Are you crazy?

522
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,520
I told you not to move out. But now you're running away to abroad?

523
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,670
I'm not running away. I'll be traveling, Mom.

524
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,340
That's the same thing.

525
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,150
Moving out is permanent, but I'll come back home after traveling.

526
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,550
I'll be back.

527
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,280
You won't be by my side, anyway.

528
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,460
A year? Are you serious? You can't!

529
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:41,390
Mom, do you know what happened to me in the past few months?

530
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,560
I got demoted.

531
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,480
Jin Hong showed up.

532
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,270
You went through an ordeal.

533
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,170
My so-called blood relatives suddenly showed up.

534
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,040
And Grandma passed away.

535
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,460
I thought...

536
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,330
I had handled all those things well and moved on.

537
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,030
But...

538
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,990
it turns out I didn't.

539
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:12,580
I was just hanging in there without even knowing how to.

540
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,020
You told me when you were giving me physical therapy.

541
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,310
That everything is a chain reaction.

542
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,290
That everything gets damaged because I have no muscles to withstand the weight.

543
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,590
That you have to fix everything in the beginning so things don't break down.

544
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,430
You're going backpacking?

545
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,510
All over the world?

546
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,080
Yes.

547
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,610
Is that too much?

548
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,690
You've never been outside the country on your own.

549
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,060
Will you really be okay?

550
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,970
Exactly. That's why I want to do it on my own.

551
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,950
Leave.

552
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,510
You can.

553
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,460
You're more than qualified to enjoy yourself.

554
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,320
I fully support you.

555
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,560
I'm on your side, no matter what.

556
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,100
So...

557
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,050
I have to let go of Jin Hee...

558
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,600
so she can let go of me, too.

559
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,110
That's the right thing to do. Right?

560
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,280
For me to let her go first?

561
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,780
Because I'm an adult

562
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,820
and her mom.

563
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,570
Yes.

564
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,450
That's probably right.

565
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,420
By chance,

566
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,730
even if...

567
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,230
you're not satisfied with Jin Hee at some point,

568
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,520
let's say she's going through the puberty stage

569
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,160
that she went through without acting out.

570
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,250
Let's tolerate, forgive, and wait for her.

571
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,030
And in the end, she'll come around and be by our side again.

572
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,440
She'd do even better without me.

573
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,220
Of course. She's Kim Eun Mi's daughter.

574
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,060
How come you don't suggest living together these days?

575
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,220
Have you given up?

576
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,220
No, I'm waiting.

577
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,070
Although I don't know when that will be.

578
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,820
You know, I think...

579
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,640
it'd be ideal if we could see each other whenever we want.

580
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,680
Isn't it nice to miss someone?

581
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,880
But...

582
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,200
if I still feel lonely, even though

583
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,190
I spend every day with you,

584
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,200
I won't be able to stand that.

585
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,830
If you do that to me, I'll kill you.

586
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,190
Why are we going in that direction now?

587
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,710
I'm telling you never to be too sure about our relationship.

588
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,310
No one knows what'll happen.

589
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:36,220
All right. I won't guarantee anything.

590
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,460
Each day,

591
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,600
Day after day, I'll just...

592
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,100
like you, adore you, and be happy.

593
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,450
I'll live that way.

594
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,420
Cheers?

595
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,610
Cheers.

596
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,870
What are you doing?

597
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,750
I'm studying.

598
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,370
Why are you studying when you're going on a trip?

599
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,320
You just go straight up.

600
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,750
What? Spain?

601
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,390
What should we eat here today, Unni?

602
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,610
Why don't you get something sweet?

603
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,370
- That's right.
- Hello.

604
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,600
Ms. Kim. Ms. Kim's daughter.

605
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,560
Yes, yes.

606
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,750
We'll buy you coffee. Join us.

607
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,240
No, it's okay.

608
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,140
We go to this cafe often.

609
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,050
We're regulars. Just come with us.

610
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,940
They have amazing coffee.

611
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,450
Shall we, then? Why don't you treat us?

612
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,140
I will.

613
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,990
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

614
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,390
Would you like to order?

615
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,890
Well, do you like something sweet or nutty?

616
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,470
What's she saying?

617
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,600
We're choosing beans right now.

618
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,110
Oh, I see.

619
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,410
One decaf iced Americano.

620
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,260
Three light roast coffee.

621
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,430
One Einspanner. And a croffle, too.

622
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,650
Put everything on this card.

623
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,980
Wow, Unni, you're so cool.

624
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,430
- Let's have a seat.
- Sure.

625
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,590
Here you go.

626
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,040
I want to try this.

627
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,910
Here you go.

628
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,850
Is it tasty?

629
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,060
The coffee's so good.

630
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,730
Try it. Try it.

631
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,340
Try this one.

632
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,320
A pretty person needs to do it. It's not for everyone.

633
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,720
It's so tasty.

634
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,210
Okay, okay.

635
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,460
Is it that tasty?

636
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,720
Daughter, this is tasty.

637
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,990
Yes, yes.

638
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,820
It's corn.

639
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,260
You have to have them together.

640
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,780
That's the right thing to do. Right?

641
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,120
For me to let her go first?

642
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,450
Because I'm an adult...

643
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,640
and her mom.

644
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,820
Yes. That's probably right.

645
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,170
Should I button up or down?

646
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,320
Here.

647
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,130
Yes. Let's switch spots.

648
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,770
Huh? Do we have to?

649
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,210
Yes, I have to stand there because I'm her granddaughter.

650
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,670
It has to be the daughter.

651
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,020
Mom.

652
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,980
Let's get started now.

653
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,380
One, two, three.

654
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,960
Let's go one more time.

655
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,740
- One, two, three.
- Say kimchi.

656
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,580
Let's say grandma.

657
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,810
Grandma.

658
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,700
Nice. Let's take another one.

659
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,030
One, two, three.

660
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,920
Jin Hee.

661
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,640
[Jin Agu]

662
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,870
Here.

663
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,130
Ta-da.

664
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,490
You, too? Gosh. Thank you, Aunt.

665
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,650
Spend the money wholeheartedly.

666
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,010
Let me know if you need more.

667
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,290
Yes, you have to sleep somewhere nice.

668
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,710
I'm sure you'll eat well.

669
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,660
What are you guys talking about?

670
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,460
Don't you know what backpacking is?

671
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,610
She's saying she wants to suffer.

672
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,550
Just let her be.

673
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,380
But still. She's going abroad alone for the first time.

674
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,990
Don't be so uptight.

675
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,810
I'm sure she's already worried.

676
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,610
I'll be strict about it.

677
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,450
Use it conservatively

678
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,280
and if you run out, make money yourself.

679
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,020
Okay, I really won't call you. Okay?

680
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,220
Ahjussi. Aunt. Thank you.

681
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,120
I'll use it really well.

682
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,330
Okay.

683
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,340
Here it is, here it is.

684
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,500
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

685
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,060
- It's huge.
- Wow.

686
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,770
This is boneless agujjim, right?

687
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,240
I'll have fried chicken first.

688
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,320
Let me get it for you.

689
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,680
I'll do it for you.

690
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,760
- Okay.
- Jin Hee, you have to stay in touch.

691
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,310
I hate "No news is good news." Okay?

692
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,310
Aunt, I'll make a travel blog before I go.

693
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,150
You can hear updates from me there.

694
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,400
- That's for keeping a journal and posting photos. Right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

695
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,220
I love that.

696
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,710
Send me the link to the blog, too.

697
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,940
Of course. Make comments. Okay?

698
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,870
Should we all sleep in one room tonight?

699
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,370
We won't be seeing her for a year.

700
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,930
It's an early morning flight, apparently.

701
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,470
She's staying at a hotel near the airport and leaving from there.

702
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,070
Really?

703
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,130
We should've seen each other sooner, then.

704
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,770
It's so sad. My baby.

705
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,140
I've been...

706
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,330
feeling very anxious lately.

707
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,430
You probably didn't know.

708
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,090
You've been anxious?

709
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,380
About what?

710
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,550
I felt impatient for no reason.

711
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,500
What if...

712
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,810
I die suddenly?

713
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,600
Die alone like Grandma while you're not around.

714
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,190
You said you wanted to look cool and die alone.

715
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,540
You said that's your way.

716
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,820
You said that's the death you want.

717
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,270
It was all bull crap.

718
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,190
I was blabbering without even living long enough.

719
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,080

00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,970
[Not Others]

897
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,870
♫ I want to reimagine my forgotten dreams ♫

898
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:45,610
♫ Since I met you, because of you, I laughed and cried ♫

899
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:53,430
♫ Sometimes I think I want to get away from you ♫

900
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,940
[Thank you for enjoying "Not Others"]

901
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,100
[The end]

902
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,680
♫ The connection between you and I can't be broken ♫
