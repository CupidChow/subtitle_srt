00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,026
You can't be serious right now!

182
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,426
Forget it. No need to talk more. Just come in.

183
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:42,916
Let's talk in person for now!

184
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,346
Just come in, and we'll see what happens!

185
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:47,336
My gosh, I was robbed at my own home.

186
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:50,016
But my boss can't even say a word of comfort.

187
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:54,686
I was just a lowly worker who has to work no matter what. I had no idea.

188
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,706
Robbed?

189
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,246
- Huh?
- Was she robbed?

190
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,376
- Did they steal anything?
- I don't know.

191
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:04,036
My gosh, how clumsy.

192
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,566
Although you barely give me a raise,

193
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,986
I stayed because of loyalty toward the hospital and patients.

194
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,226
I shouldn't have done that!

195
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:11,936
I should've just gone with the better offer.

196
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:13,606
Stop, Ms. Kim!

197
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:16,366
Fine! You're just taking a day off, then.

198
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,656
Take a day off?

199
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:19,656
- Let's go, Unni!
- See you tomorrow.

200
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:23,846
I'd like to express my deepest regret—

201
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,896
Where are you going? Won't you get treated?

202
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:28,026
We're going! Ms. Kim isn't even here.

203
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:29,976
Is she not coming in tomorrow, either? That would be bad.

204
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:33,726
- Ladies! Wait for me!
- I'm sure she'll be in.

205
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,456
There's Ms. Yoo, too!

206
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,616
Ms. Kim isn't here.

207
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:42,396
Gosh, seriously!

208
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,126
I'll go talk to the tenants in the building—

209
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:46,436
No, no, no!

210
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,416
You should just sit down and relax.

211
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,566
Hey, you should go instead.

212
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:54,536
She lives here! It'd be easier for her to do it.

213
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,926
Have a seat. Have a seat!

214
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:56,906
I can just—

215
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,256
No, just rest!

216

What would you like?

217
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,166
- I'll be right back, then.
- Okay.

218
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:06,696
There's nothing, Unni.

219
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,346
- Because of the smell—
- Hello.

220
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,296
- Yes.
- I'm from the police.

221
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:12,846
May I ask you a few questions?

222
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,416
I heard a thief broke in. Was anything stolen?

223
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:19,266
By the way, you look familiar, Officer.

224
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:21,396
- Huh?
- Well...

225
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,626

Oh! I see.

227
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:31,866
W-What did they steal, exactly?

228
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,826
Panties.

229
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,356
P-Panties? My gosh!

230
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:39,196
- My goodness!
- How embarrassing! Unbelievable.

231
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:42,356
So you came home just now, correct?

232
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:44,186
Yes.

233
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,646
I didn't really see anything.

234
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:47,956
I can just go back in. Right?

235
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,376
Yes, thank you!

Hello, there was a burglary in the building.

Oh, I see!

241
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,356
That's why it was so noisy.

242
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,286
Let me ask just a few things.

243
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:14,896
By the way, could I see your ID if you're an officer?

244
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,276
Oh, yes.

245
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,546

Were you home the entire time, by chance?

I didn't leave the house since I was expecting a package.

252
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:49,196
Well, did you hear any noise, by chance?

Someone running on the stairs or—

254
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,806
Maybe I did hear that.

00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:34,576
I wanted to drink outside! What's this, anyway?

359
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,256
Geez! It just doesn't feel right.

360
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,056
Have a sense of shame.

361
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,576
It's a small neighborhood.

362
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:42,406
There are more people who work at the police station.

363
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:49,866
Today was such an eventful day.

364
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:52,796
I'm going through all sorts of things in life.

365
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:55,296
Anyway, you're so impressive, Mom.

366
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:58,446
Most people would be too scared to be back home.

367
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:02,336
But you're drinking soju like this instead.

368
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:04,846
There'd be no settlement whatsoever.

369
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:06,306
I'll take it to the end!

370
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:07,706
Of course.

371
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:10,786
Hey, if the culprit is so clear,

372
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:13,876
the trial will happen quickly, too. Right?

373
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,496
It'd probably still take a few months.

374
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:18,836
Really?

375
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:23,146
That pervert will be in jail in the meantime, then!

376
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,336
What are you looking at?

377
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:50,226
Can't believe you wear panties like this at your age.

378
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:52,536
You can't even act your age.

379
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:56,006
Shut it. You're the one who stole an old maid's panties.

380
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:58,326
Good luck with your trial, you bastard!

381
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:00,956
Don't even think about reaching a settlement.

382
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,976
Ma'am!

383
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,516
You don't seem to know.

384
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:17,676
Lady, a first offender like me...

385
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,846
He's a first offender, and he won't run away?

386
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:25,856
He'll just be fined because it's a summary offense?

387
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,726
How does that make any sense?

388
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,576
That's the law for simple burglary.

389
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:32,536
But he'd definitely have a record and—

390
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:35,336
Did you say simple burglary just now?

391
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,146
How is this simple burglary?

392
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:39,936
He stole my panties! It's a sex crime!

393
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:40,886
Be quiet!

394
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:44,456
That's the law! We don't get to decide! Mom!

395
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,736
I'm angry, too!

396
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:55,806
What are you thinking about right now? Mom.

397
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,616
Mom?

398
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:02,976
Ma'am, don't do anything. Okay?

399
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:05,596
- Got it?
- Got it.

400
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,606
Go back in.

401
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:09,956
I'll go to work.

402
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:15,406
Mom! You're okay. Right?

403
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:18,746
You're dead, you son of a bitch.

404
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:26,216
Who is it?

405
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,316
A package delivery.

406
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,636
I didn't order any packages.

407
00:26:33,636 --> 00:26:35,766
These are for Jangmi Villa, No. 201.

408
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:36,726
Huh?

409
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,736
Anyway, there are delivery fees for these.

410
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,396
Two thousand won for each. Ten thousand won in total.

411
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:42,646
Well, 10,000 won?

412
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:45,516
- Yes.
- Hold on a sec.

413
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:40,196
Ma'am! Open the door!

414
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:43,366
Ma'am, I know you're in there. Come out.

415
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,206
Ma'am!

416
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,256
Ma'am!

417
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,256
What's this about?

418
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:54,676
These. You sent these, didn't you?

419
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:55,676
What are they?

420
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,596
Don't act innocent! You sent all these to me!

421
00:27:58,596 --> 00:27:59,956
Why would I do that?

422
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:02,796
Don't you know? You're trying to screw me over!

423
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:04,986
What are you talking about?

424
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:07,596
Also, they aren't even my style!

425
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,106
How hideous. My gosh!

426
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,326
Stop lying! They're obviously your style!

427
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:13,126
Open the door. Open it!

428
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,526
Won't you open it?

429
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,636
Open it! Open!

430
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,276
How dare you touch me?

431
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:20,946
My gosh! How dare you touch me?

432
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,236
What?

433
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:24,526
What is it?

434
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:27,676
W-What did I do?

435
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:30,736
I'll report you for breaking and entering, threatening, and sexual harassment.

436
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:33,276
You know what aggravating circumstance is. Right?

437
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,876
Hey, just keep talking!

438
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:39,966
How dare a disgusting pervert try to talk to an innocent citizen?

439
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:46,336
You're the pervert! You perverted woman!

440
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:52,086
Did you really have to go this far?

441
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:56,256
Mom, that mister is shaking some panties.

442
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:58,306
My gosh! Should I report him for you?

443
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,546
Could you please?

444
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,666
Hello.

445
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:12,916
Are you okay?

446
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,306
Thank you, Eun Ji's mom.

447
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:16,226
I'm okay. You can just go in.

448
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:18,776
He'll be doing this for a while. Don't worry about it.

449
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:21,586
Okay! Let's go, Eun Ji.

450
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:36,636
[Pervert]

451
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,686
Who was that?

452
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,316
Was it your husband?

453
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:45,236
Yes, play hard to get when you can.

454
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:49,686
Men definitely need to be teased.

455
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:55,886
Could he just die off after being teased?

456
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:57,726
Of course!

457
00:29:57,726 --> 00:30:00,056
When I was a kid,

458
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:05,196
at the neighborhood watermill...

459
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:08,236
Why won't he come out?

460
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:09,916
Who's this?

461
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,936
You scared me.

462
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:16,216
Don't you know you can't pile up stuff like this on the stairs?

463
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:21,086
Well, I didn't order these!

464
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,536
It's the mister who shook some panties.

465
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,816
N-N-No!

466
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,026
- Okay! I'll bring them inside!
- Gosh!

467
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,246
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

468
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:36,416
My gosh, what's all this?

469
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:40,186
My gosh! Are they all panties?

470
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:43,536
Good god! Disgusting! So disgusting!

471
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:48,326
Put them away quickly!

472
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,816
He really is a pervert! Gosh!

473
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:54,006
They aren't mine!

474
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:59,936
The teenagers who've been robbing senior centers were arrested.

475
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,346
Hello!

476
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,176
Hello!

477
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,516
- Welcome.
- Hello!

478
00:31:05,516 --> 00:31:08,156
- Ma'am, we'll have three stir-fried pork and...
- What was it?

479
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:10,036
- I'll have beef radish soup.
- One of those, please.

480
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,076
Yes!

481
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:15,656
They stole about 10 million won in cash.

482
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:20,026
The police charged them with special larceny.

483
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,016
Next story.

484
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:25,846
We received a video of a brave citizen who saved a victim

485
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:28,686
[Brave citizen saves a stalking victim]
...who was denied special protection by the police.

486
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,046
Let's watch it together.

487
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:33,806
This is CCTV footage from the street where the incident occurred.

488
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:38,026
The culprit is trying to drag the victim down the street.

489
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:43,096
That's when a citizen showed up attacking the culprit with a plastic bag.

490
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:48,166
While the culprit collapsed, the citizen safely evacuated the scene with the victim.

491
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:51,436
Our broadcasting station will award this citizen

492
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:55,076
with an award and a reward as soon as we find them.

493
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:58,536
We'll be waiting for reports from the viewers.

494
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:01,986
Thank you!

495
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:27,026
I'm getting coffee. Do you want one?

496
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:35,096
Senior.

497
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:42,016
I thought I should bring this up with you first.

498
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:46,396
The reason you don't like me.

499
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:49,166
I can understand it emotionally,

500
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:52,646
but I don't find it rationally justified.

501
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:57,766
Also, you were someone who couldn't stand it when something was irrational.

502
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,226
That's why I want to ask you.

503
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:01,106
Did I...

504
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,376
do something wrong?

505
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,906
You should've just filed a report.

506
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,066
Why did you file an anonymous complaint?

507
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:20,616
Do you only have that kind of question?

508
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,666
Yes.

509
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:25,556
I'm upset my teammates got demoted, and...

510
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,296
I find it unfair.

511
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,806
They said nothing was resolved after reporting multiple times.

512
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:33,716
The girl continued to get abused.

513
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:37,616
Have you thought about why it didn't get resolved after reporting?

514
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,376
I'm sure there was a reason, but—

515
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,466
But?

516
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:44,386
I don't think anything could be an excuse.

517
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:48,926
Have you ever seen the abused girl's body?

518
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:57,386
You ate too much soup. You'll end up with a gut!

519
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:34,336
I'll check the key patrol area one more time.

520
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:36,886
The current patrol area is

521
00:34:36,886 --> 00:34:40,016
500 meters radius from the victim's home.

522
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,916
We'll expand it to 800 meters radius.

523
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:48,050
I want all of you to check again individually.

524
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:13,746
G-Go back to sleep!

525
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:16,026
It's still patrol hours.

526
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,026
- Excuse me, Team Leader.
- Yes?

527
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:25,826
Can we talk for a second?

528
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,296
Right now?

529
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,396
What are you doing?

530
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:35,396
You came.

531
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:38,586
I asked what you were doing.

532
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,756
What's all this, anyway?

533
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,396
My head hurts.

534
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:52,456
Y-Your head?

535
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,006
Why this time?

536
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,916
Kim Jin Hee! What are you doing?

537
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,646
My head hurts.

538
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:06,366
You should be lying down if it hurts!

539
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:09,726
Why did you have to make a mess in the room?

540
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:13,176
I'm organizing things one by one.

541
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:17,416
Hey! When will you put all this stuff away, anyway?

542
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:19,406
Mom.

543
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,186
What does it mean to live?

544
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,906
Do you not know, either?

545
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:33,086
Come here, then. Let's organize together.

546
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:54,146
Mom!

547
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,156
Mom?

548
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,196
Where are you going?

549
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,456
Well, I need...

550
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,626
something urgently, and I forgot.

551
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:04,740
Come in here.

552
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,446
But why?

553
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:16,706
This isn't right...

554
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:20,116
Why are you doing this now?

555
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:22,106
Come in here.

556
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,166
This...

557
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,316
This isn't right!

558
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:31,146
♫ Go ahead and keep trying to hide it ♫

559
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:33,476
♫ Hey, babe ♫

560
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:36,016
Is it secure? Have a look.

561
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:38,716
It's fine. It was fine before.

562
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:42,196
No, have a close look! What if this falls?

563
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,326
It was secure before, too.

564
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:47,196
No. What if it falls and hits your head?

565
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:50,446
One, two, three!

566
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:53,826
Seriously! Why can't you time it? We were supposed to lift it! Come out!

567
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:56,246
Hey, you said, "One, two," and...

568
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:58,416
I said move!

569
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:02,416
♫ Let's get it on and on, baby ♫

570
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,826
I already cleaned it the other day.

571
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,226
♫ Your voice is driving me crazy ♫

572
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:10,210
♫ Please tell me ♫

573
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:14,846
♫ Say you love me ♫

574
00:38:14,846 --> 00:38:17,966
♫ It's such a lovely night, baby ♫

575
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,896
♫ What a wonderful night ♫

576
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:24,906
♫ Before this night is gone, kiss me ♫

577
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:27,396
Mom, turn the light on.

578
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:29,686
It worked!

579
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,026
It's done?

580
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:33,766
Yeah. It's all done!

581
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,576
♫ Ki, ki, kiss me ♫

582
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:39,536
- It's done?
- Yes, it's all done now.

583
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:41,856
All done?

584
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:43,206
All done.

585
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:44,936
- Really?
- Yeah.

586
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:46,466
Seriously? Really? Seriously?

587
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:49,216
Gosh, it's clean! So clean!

588
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:51,556
It's so satisfying!

589
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:08,606
gosh, are you feeling better now?

590
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:11,796
Thank you!

591
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:16,776
Huh? Did you use my laptop?

592
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:19,866
Yeah, I used it briefly because the panties were cheap.

593
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,696
1,000 won isn't just cheap.

594
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:25,386
Gosh, but you have to pay for shipping no matter what.

595
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:29,336
Maybe the battery ran out.

596
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:31,116
You think?

597
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:35,376
Go get some batteries.

598
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:42,726
Mom, it's been less than five minutes since I finished cleaning.

599
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:45,756
Might as well get them. It'll take 10 minutes.

600
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:47,616
What do you mean, "might as well"?

601
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:48,816
You go get them!

602
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:51,776
You think I did nothing? Huh?

603
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:53,776
I couldn't even rest after work because you were flipping out!

604
00:39:53,776 --> 00:39:55,546
I'm exhausted from following you around!

605
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:58,886
I cleaned the whole house for you. You call that flipping out?

606
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:00,086
How could you say that?

607
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:01,666
You cleaned the whole house?

608
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,046
Do I live here alone? Don't you make messes?

609
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:05,406
No, I don't!

610
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:08,046
I always clean up because of you.

611
00:40:08,046 --> 00:40:10,476
Forget it! I don't have to watch the TV.

612
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,926
Go ahead and just sell it!

613
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,406
Come out!

614
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:24,396
Where are you going?

615
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:26,896
You told me to go get batteries.

616
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:29,206
- Hey!
- What?

617
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:31,486
Get a popsicle, too.

618
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:33,006
And fruit leather, too.

619
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:35,616
Fruit leather, my foot.

620
00:40:54,336 --> 00:40:56,026
Okay!

621
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,716
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom!

622
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:14,906
Amazing, isn't it?

623
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,386
Huh?

624
00:41:25,156 --> 00:41:26,956
Here you go.

625
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:30,146
Goodbye, pervert!

626
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:12,586
Senior.

627
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:20,986
We received a complaint from the girl's mother.

628
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:22,216
A complaint?

629
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:24,336
The child's abuser did?

630
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,106
Yes.

631
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:28,586
She said we overreacted.

632
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:31,536
I guess she filed a complaint at the audit office herself.

633
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:33,826
The HQ told us not to do anything since

634
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:36,606
they're changing the person in charge.

635
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:39,436
We kept going there because we received reports,

636
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:42,766
but there was nothing we could do. That's what I'm saying.

637
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:47,076
My teammates didn't do anything wrong, either.

638
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:49,646
I'm upset my teammates got demoted, and...

639
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:51,856
I find it unfair.

640
00:42:51,856 --> 00:42:54,936
I only thought from the victim's perspective.

641
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:59,396
I should've thought it three times over, but I did only twice.

642
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:05,216
But...

643
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,886
still...

644
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:11,526
If it were me, I would've tried to find a different solution.

645
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,626
You shouldn't have become a cop.

646
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,576
I said that to you in the police academy, too.

647
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:21,066
I think I told you when you were commissioned a lieutenant and came to the patrol division.

648
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,086
I remember it.

649
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:28,146
That you're someone who never should've become a cop.

650
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:34,606
Your job is to stay here like a wallflower and leave after a year.

651
00:43:34,606 --> 00:43:37,456
Don't cause any trouble, and do as you're told.

652
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:39,526
Don't even think. Just breathe.

653
00:43:39,526 --> 00:43:41,206
Got it?

654
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:46,646
I don't want to.

655
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:48,186
What?

656
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:52,946
I'll leave when I have to, but not like this.

657
00:43:55,136 --> 00:44:00,066
Think about it. Why do I have to be humiliated whenever I see you?

658
00:44:00,066 --> 00:44:01,716
- Kim Jin Hee.
- Should I just go for it, then?

659
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:03,376
- I'm not sure what'll happen, though.
- Hey!

660
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:05,726
I'll do...

661
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,426
my best to be defiant for a year, then.

662
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:11,126
Sir.

663
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:14,546
I hope you look forward to it.

664
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:29,126
I'll start the therapy session.

665
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:30,916
Okay.

666
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:44,356
Your hands are so strong.

667
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:49,386
You must be good at massaging other things, too.

668
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:54,366
Do you mean it?

669
00:44:57,256 --> 00:45:00,836
M-Massage lower, too.

670
00:45:02,496 --> 00:45:04,536
Gosh! Right there.

671
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:09,526
A little lower would be nicer.

672
00:45:14,776 --> 00:45:16,766
Oh, gosh!

673
00:45:17,886 --> 00:45:22,176
It'd be nice if you went just a bit lower.

674
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,166
- Lower?
- Yes.

675
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:33,686
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on!

676
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:35,366
Here?

677
00:45:36,846 --> 00:45:38,576
Or...

678
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:40,666
how about here?

679
00:45:51,306 --> 00:45:52,376
What?

680
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:55,126
- What's going on?
- Huh?

681
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:58,856
What's going on?

682
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:17,216
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

683
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:23,936
Get dressed and come out.

684
00:46:24,796 --> 00:46:27,926
Ma'am, well...

685
00:46:27,926 --> 00:46:31,016
W-When should I come back?

686
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:32,966
Before it hurts.

687
00:46:34,016 --> 00:46:35,886
See you.

688
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:41,336
I'll do it even stronger next time.

689
00:46:48,216 --> 00:46:50,396
You haven't been here in a while!

690
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:51,856
Are your legs okay?

691
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,846
I'm okay, too!

692
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:05,016
I'll do my best to be defiant, sir.

693
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:08,916
I hope you look forward to it.

694
00:47:14,986 --> 00:47:17,016
I must've been crazy.

695
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:18,816
Why did I do that?

696
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:23,996
Make sure to be quiet and spare yourself as much as possible!

697
00:47:23,996 --> 00:47:27,086
You'd better do well.

698
00:47:27,086 --> 00:47:31,196
A year could easily become two or three years!

699
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:36,736
I got chills just now!

700
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,376
No.

701
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:40,466
No, no, no.

702
00:47:43,756 --> 00:47:46,886
And we were told to patrol around the special protection

703
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:49,656
requestor's home even more.

704
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:52,316
I know it's a lot, but please take extra care.

705
00:47:52,316 --> 00:47:54,476
Yes, got it.

706
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:56,036
That's everything.

707
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:57,606
Excuse me.

708
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:00,956
Yes?

709
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:02,566
This is about our patrol partners.

710
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:06,116
I'd like to take turns and partner with everyone for a week.

711
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,556
That'd be possible, right?

712
00:48:07,556 --> 00:48:08,946
I'm not sure.

713
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:13,076
Well, we all already have a partner.

714
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:14,726
Sir?

715
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:19,196
Well, the team members' opinions matter.

716
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,016
Discuss among yourselves and decide.

717
00:48:21,016 --> 00:48:22,286
Of course, we should.

718
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,086
Captain Cha,

00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:27,276

720
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:34,376
I'm not sure.

721
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,716
I had promised I'd assist Team No. 3 for a while.

722
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,916
- Wow, how did I forget that?
- Pardon?

723
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:47,156
W-When did you promise that?

724
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:49,016
Sergeant Oh, could you—

725
00:48:49,016 --> 00:48:51,396
We'll go patrolling now.

726
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:54,426
- Good day.
- We'll be back.

00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:01,096
Team Leader Kim.

728
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:02,526
Yes?

729
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:04,416
Let's go.

730
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:11,026
This patient definitely told me he'd do manual therapy.

731
00:49:11,026 --> 00:49:15,750
But why do patients always cancel it whenever they have a session with you?

732
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:20,206
Well, why did he do that?

733
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:25,466
It's probably...

734
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:27,816
because you said something.

735
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:30,486
I didn't say anything. I just did the physical therapy.

736
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:32,576
How did you do the physical therapy, anyway?

737
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:33,766
I did it well.

738
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:35,776
Ms. Kim!

739
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,506
Should I go and...

740
00:49:41,506 --> 00:49:44,996
ask him why he doesn't want...

741
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:50,396
the manual therapy discreetly?

742
00:49:51,036 --> 00:49:54,176
Ask discreetly?

743
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:57,166
But he might be annoyed.

744
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,906
Why?

745
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:00,256
Why would he be annoyed?

746
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:04,226
Why wouldn't he be when we keep asking the same question?

747
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:07,606
He might have a situation he can't talk about.

748
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:15,336
I'll just give up on this one patient and ask him right now!

749
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:17,366
It's okay!

750
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:21,376
One can change their mind.

751
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:25,876
Or I could ask him later, too.

752
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:31,566
Would you?

753
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,526
Would that be better?

754
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:38,966
I'll just leave now, then.

755
00:50:44,406 --> 00:50:47,766

756
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:50,366
It's always unsettling.

761

00:51:04,596 --> 00:51:06,426

- I love it!

763
00:51:06,426 --> 00:51:09,366
I'll take anything. I can eat all of it!

That's why I deserve a reward.

- It's all over. Give it a rest.

Oh! That's what it was. I remember.

00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:40,206
I even put cocoa powder in milk for you afterward.

825
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:43,396
I put the cocoa powder in myself. When did you do that?

826
