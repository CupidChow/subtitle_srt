Ouch! I said it hurts!

8
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,240
Geez, who did you get your coarse hair from?

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,850
Who else could it be? I resemble you.

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,510
That makes no sense.

11
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,570
How could this hair resemble yours?

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,410
Jin Hee! Let's play!

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh, hello. Can I play with Jin Hee?

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,080
Wait just a bit. I'll be right there.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,460
Not him. He's too nice.

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,560
What's wrong with nice?

17
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,970
Listen to me carefully.

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,060
If a man is too nice and he does everything you ask for,

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,480
he'd end up making you do everything.

Not at all. Welcome.

25

Oppa, this is mine.

Hey.

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,410
So you rented the car that early in the morning and drove?

35
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,510
You probably didn't get any sleep.

36

Aren't you tired?

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,740

- Pardon?

- There are yachts, too. My gosh.

Why are you asking me that?

The one who started it needs to tell me.

64
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,880
No need to worry. Just think of him as a sugar daddy.

65
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,880
He said he stayed up all night researching restaurants and tour spots.

66
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,530
To spend money.

That's enough. It's not even a big deal.

69

You should've just had a drink with her in Seoul if you wanted to make up with her.

72

Why did you have to come all the way here and cause trouble?

Who's the one who wanted to enjoy things two days in advance?

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,910
I have to just let her win right now. Right?

78
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,760
Isn't it obvious?

Gosh. Yacht, my foot. Just take one alone.

- I'm hungry.

What should we eat?

84
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,520
There's a place I found.

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,120
I want red-banded lobsters.

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,790
- Red-banded lobsters?
- I want meat.

87
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,570

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,420
Okay.

92
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,410
What? We're having red-banded lobsters.

93
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,340
Oppa, what would you like?

94
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,460
Galbi or red-banded lobsters?

95
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,410
Let's have red-banded lobsters. Looks like she found a place.

96
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,440
I don't want to peel all those.

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,810
I said I was hungry.

98
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,260
I'll peel them for you.

99
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,360
Aren't you going to eat?

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,240
You go ahead.

101
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,020
Oh, yeah.

102
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,250
How come you're not eating, Oppa? Have some.

103
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,910
I'm okay. Help yourself.

104
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,660
Come on.

105
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,280

106
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,290
Well...

107
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,810
Do you not like lobster, by chance?

108
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,310
I-It's not that.

109
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,410
Actually, I'm allergic to shellfish.

110
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,330
Shellfish?

111
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,410
So you can't eat shrimp, crab, lobster, and stuff like that?

112
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,540
Why did you suggest coming here if you can't even eat it?

113
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,200
I'm here to peel the lobsters for you.

114
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,830
Seriously...

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,830
Over here.

116
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,620
This has no shrimp or crab in it, right?

117
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,070
I mentioned the allergy.

118
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,930
Of course, there's none of that.

119
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,110
Enjoy.

120
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,330
Wow, it's so nice and spicy.

121
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,390
Try some.

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,570
Okay...

123
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,940
Wow! This is it.

124
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,500
- It's tasty.
- Isn't it?

125
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,680
Hey. It'd be a waste to eat it like this.

126
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,340
- Let's get soju.
- No.

127
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,820
You want to get drunk even before unpacking?

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,100
So what if we get drunk? We're on vacation.

129
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,350
Get drunk later if you want to.

130
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,900
I found a bar for us.

131
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,330
You already planned it all out.

132
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,020
I'll save it for tonight, then.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,760
What's wrong, Oppa? Is it spicy?

134
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,940
Huh? No, no. It's not too bad.

135
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,610
Looks like it's too spicy for you.

136
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,990
Try putting the broth in the rice. It'd be a lot better.

137
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,170
Mom.

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,830
Are they out of their mind?

139
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,530
They should've checked properly if we had mentioned the allergy.

140
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,360
The chef was basically a kid. I should've twisted his neck.

141
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,660
Seriously...

142
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,190
It's okay, Oppa.

143
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,980
The doctor said it was a relief we came early.

144
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,260
You'll be okay soon.

145
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,560
Also, since I work at the hospital,

146
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,170
stuff like this is considered nothing. I've seen it all.

147
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,010
You're better than I thought.

148
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,750
Am I really okay?

149
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,770
It's so upsetting.

150
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,810
I didn't want you to see me like this.

151
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,310
Why didn't you tell me?

152
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,250
Why did you say to go there to peel the lobsters you can't even eat?

153
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,580
I know. Why did I do that?

154
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,060
I should've prepared for the worst.

155
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,100
Get up.

156
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,620
Let's leave now.

157
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,940
I have a favor to ask, Eun Mi.

158
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,450
I really don't want Jin Hee to see me like this.

159
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,810
Could you get me a mask?

160
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,080
A mask.

161
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,940
Okay, wait just a moment.

162
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,620
You can pay at the reception, Ma'am.

163
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,880
Oppa.

164
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,760
I'll step out for a second.

165
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,230
Are you sure you're okay?

166
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,610
Yes.

167
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,980
Go have fun.

168
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,560
What?

169
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,380
Go have fun.

170
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,100
See you later.

171
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,890
Can we just leave him?

172
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,270
He can't drink even if he comes.

173
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,840
Let's just drink by ourselves.

174
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,850
- Let's go.
- Okay!

175
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,010
The three of us can do that thing.

176
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,800
The thing we didn't get to do last time.

177
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,670
You mean a girl group?

178
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,530
This isn't good.

179
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,120
You guys should go without me.

180
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
What?

181
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,170
He sure is making me worry.

182
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,220
Well, you can't do that...

183
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,980
Mom. Mo—

184
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,910
How could she be so selfish?

185
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,020
I'm crazy for being happy just for a second.

186
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,850
And him, too.

187
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,370
Why did he create a situation like this?

188
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,320
We wouldn't have gone there if he said he was allergic from the beginning.

189
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,290
And why did he have to join our trip?

190
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,940
Doesn't he feel uncomfortable with me? Does he know me?

191
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,800
Hey, say something.

192
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Can you understand my mom and that man?

193
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,460
You know...

194
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,390
Since you ruined my much-awaited rest and

195
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,620
things aren't working out for you,

196
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,770
it makes me so happy.

197
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,320
I guess life is fair.

198
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,830
What goes around comes around.

199
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,800
Justice prevails.

200
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,460
Come empty, return empty.

201
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,450
Shut up, or I'll send you the bill for 1.8 million won.

202
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,640
I think Ahjumma already forgot she had a fight with you.

203
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,760
Her head is completely occupied with him.

204
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,750
Hey, how could she possibly forget that?

205
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,050
I'm saying it felt like it was my fault!

206
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,400
I don't want to be treated like goldfish poop by him, too!

207
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,230
I hurt her feelings so much.

208
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,580
You know how she is.

209
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,280
Give me a break.

210
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,040
There's no way she could forget that.

211
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,100
It's so funny.

212
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,260
Don't laugh?

213
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,700
Oppa, Oppa... d-did you hear that?

214
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,050
Are you sleepy? Tired?

215
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,630
No.

216
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,160
It's past 10:30.

217
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,650
They're coming back late.

218
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,800
It's an unfamiliar area, too.

219
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,940
She's with Jin Soo. Don't worry.

220
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,810
What's Jin Soo like?

221
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,680
He seems to have a good personality.

222
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,620
He's basically family.

223
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,890
Family?

224
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,470
I've known him since Jin Hee was in kindergarten.

225
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,160
He stays with us instead of staying with his parents whenever he's in Seoul.

226
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,280
He's more comfortable with us.

227
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,910
It's always been like that.

228
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,440
By the way, you're concerned about Jin Hee a lot.

229
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,810
Of course.

230
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,890
She's your daughter.

231
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,930
I see.

232
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,560
By the way, why did you follow us here?

233
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,060
Look at you... Look at you.

234
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,810
How can you sleep when I'm next to you?

235
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,510
So it didn't become an open investigation. Right?

236
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,860
The victim's ex-boyfriend remains the suspect, too.

237
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,370
Got it. Thank you, Senior.

238
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
Of course, I'm doing well.

239
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,900
I need to get going. I'll talk to you again.

240
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,320
Senior.

241
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,430
Hello?

242
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,090
What?

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,430
Why won't he say anything?

244
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,780
- Hello?
- Are you drunk?

245
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,230
What?

246
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Senior!

247
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,020
Hello!

248
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,540
Your junior was upset.

249
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,710
So I drank a bit.

250
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,450
Let's talk later. Hang up.

251
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,990
Huh?

252
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,030
You're drunk.

253
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,180
Let's talk when you're sober. Bye.

254
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,810
Wow!

255
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,120
When you were drunk out of your mind,

256
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,700
I suffered so much because of you.

257
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,620
But you're ignoring me like this?

258
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,130
That's enough—

259
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,990
You know...

260
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,070
I... dragged your huge body

261
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,340
and I looked for the key among a bunch of other keys with my tiny hands...

262
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,120
I should've just left you on the street...

263
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,770
Hey.

264
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,610
I'm letting it slide because you're Eun Jae Won.

265
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,370
You need to know that, Senior.

266
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,020
Why did you do that to me, by the way?

267
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,710
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,180
I'll tell her to call you when she's sober.

269
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,250
- Hello?
- Well, hello.

270
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,710
I've seen you twice.

271
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,650
I'm Kim Jin Soo.

272
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,120
Oh, yes, I remember. Hello.

273
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,770
Why did you do that to me then?

274
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,420
Hey, hey, hey! You jerk!

275
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,310
- I'm sorry.
- What did I do wrong, exactly?

276
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,450
- I was talking...
- Where are you going?

277
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,110
Do you want to shower first?

278
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,310
- If it's urgent—
- I'll call back later.

279
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,290
I'll hang up now.

280
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,910
I can tell there's something going on.

281
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,310
Dad! Make it look pretty! Do it again!

282
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,820
One, two, three!

283
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,780
We should go see the big lighthouse and take the cable car.

284
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,210
Just do the cable car. And we'll drive along the coast.

285
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,620
I want to enjoy myself leisurely.

286
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,050
I canceled all the plans I made for days because of you.

287
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,340
I don't want to walk!

288
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,220
What's the point of wearing pretty clothes for photos?

289
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,920
You only packed sneakers. Who packed them?

290
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,180
Who brings high heels on a trip?

291
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,930
You have to dress to go with sneakers. Your feet will hurt.

292
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,680
Hey, that's enough. Forget about everything.

293
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,630
Let's split up if we're going to be this way. Jin Soo!

294
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,850
Oh, he left early in the morning.

295
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,390
Whatever! We're still splitting up.

296
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,070
Are you serious right now?

297
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,110
I'm not sure about that, either.

298
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,370
What do you think, then, Oppa?

299
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,340
- Huh?
- You're not sure about splitting up.

300
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,070
Which side are you on?

301
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,210
What?

302
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,720
He's obviously on your side.

303
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,290
Why would you even ask that?

304
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,600
I looked into it, too.

305
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,410
Going to the lighthouse first is efficient.

306
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,930
- What?
- And we can take the cable car

307
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,990
and drive along the coast, too.

308
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,640
Sir, what are you doing right now?

309
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,260
Pardon?

310
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,570
How could he be so bad at reading the air?

311
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,980
Mom!

312
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,820
Mom!

313
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,370
Tell me.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,300
I'm not going!

315
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm not!

316
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,800
Pretend like you're holding the lighthouse.

317
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,500
Like you're holding it.

318
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,980
No, like this.

319
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,090
Oh, on the palm?

320
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,430
Look over here. I'll take a photo of you.

321
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,910
Okay.

322
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,930
Okay.

323
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,260
One, two.

324
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,160
Okay.

325
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,600
One...

326
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,750
♫ I was thinking of listening more ♫

327
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,710
♫ But I can't stand it. I'm crazy, yeah. ♫

328
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,650
♫ Stand by, my eyes are focused ♫

329
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,750
I'll take one from here.

330
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,110
One—

331
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,400
♫ Hey, look at me ♫

332
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,460
♫ Let's get it on and on, baby. Let's get it on ♫

333
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,170
♫ Your voice is driving me crazy. Please tell me ♫

334
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,830
Oppa, you should take photos from down there.

335
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,020
Okay.

336
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,160
♫ I said you love me now, baby. What a wonderful night ♫

337
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,620
Look over here! One, two...

338
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,860
Send this to me.

339
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,850
How about this one?

340
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,470
♫ K-K-Kiss me. L-L-Love ♫

341
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,610
This is my favorite.

342
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,080
Won't you take photos with him, by the way?

343
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,030
Will you take them for us?

344
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,220
Take selfies.

345
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,990
I don't like him as much as I thought.

346
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,930
We have nothing in common, including diet and lifestyle.

347
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,780
Are you saying that now?

348
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,070
Hey, he goes to bed at 10:00.

349
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,870
And he wakes up at 4:00 in the morning.

350
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,340
I asked him what he does so early.

351
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,170
He apparently reads.

352
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,060
He works out and drinks tea.

353
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,990
Isn't he like the least fun person?

354
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,410
And why is he so servile?

355
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,520
He was a dork when he was a kid,

356
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,220
but I liked how feisty he was.

357
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,530
Why did you even bring him if you hadn't checked him out first?

358
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,610
I know.

359
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,500
Why did I bring him here, anyway?

360
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,950
Hey...

361
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,100
This is no fun.

362
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Let's go on the cable car.

363
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,680
No, no, no.

364
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,230
There's a hidden beach if you go a little further.

365
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,910
If you go up there,

366
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,660
you'll see a view that'd make you forgive him for everything.

367
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,950
Your heart will feel like... Wow!

368
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,510
Wow! What a view!

369
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,760
It's not the same as this!

370
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,770
- Here.
- Mom.

371
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,800
I'll take nice photos of you there.

372
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,930
We just need to go a little further.

373
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,760
Done. Let's say we saw it.

374
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,320
Why do you keep leaning?

375
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,370
Did you drink already?

376
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,270
The bathroom must be on the first floor. Right?

377
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,720
I need to get in line. Do you want to go without me?

378
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,130
We need to go together.

379
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,900
Oppa.

380
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,920
Oppa! What are you doing?

381
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,480
No, it's nothing.

382
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,060
What is it? Do you need something?

383
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,880
Never mind.

384
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,170
Do you want some coffee or something?

385
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,940
I'll go get it. What would you like?

386
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,340
Looks like the line is moving fast.

387
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,570
You can drink it in the cable car.

388
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,720
- No. You can't drink in there.
- Honey, wake up!

389
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,460
- Is that so?
- Somebody, please help!

390
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,650
- Hold on.
- What's wrong!

391
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,010
What do we do?

392
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,880
What's going on?

393
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,990
Mom.

394
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,750
Honey, Honey, what's wrong? Wake up!

395
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,530
Please help!

396
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,740
Wake up!

397
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,900
Step aside! Step aside.

398
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,680
Step aside.

399
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,400
What is it, Oppa?

400
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,380
I think it's CVA.
[CVA: Cerebral Vascular Accident]

401
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,460
CVA? A stroke?

402
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,410
Somebody, please call 911.

403
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,030
I can do it.

404
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,710
I'm at the cable car station at Yeosu Marine Park. There's an emergency patient.

405
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,330
- It's a stroke.
- He's showing symptoms of a stroke.

406
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,670
A doctor is giving him emergency treatment at the scene. Please hurry.

407
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,560
Looks like the tongue is okay. How's the pulse?

408
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,850
It's too slow.

409
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,250
- Honey!
- You can't give him water.

410
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,970
Does he take blood pressure medicine by chance?

411
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,560
Yes, he has high blood pressure.

412
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,840
I noticed he was strange earlier, too.

413
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,860
Sir, can you hear me?

414
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,320
Try blinking if you can!

415
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
Honey!

416
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,910
Good job! You have to stay awake.

417
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,330
You can't fall asleep even if you get sleepy.

418
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,710
No, you can't massage him.

419
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,790
Just raise his body temperature with the blanket.

420
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,120
Listen to me carefully, Ma'am.

421
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,190
What you can do now is to keep talking to him

422
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,150
so he doesn't black out. You can do that. Right?

423
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,600
Yes, I can do it.

424
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,530
Honey! Wake up, Honey.

425
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,460
Open your eyes, please.

426
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,310
It's improving.

427
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,950
You're doing great, sir.

428
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,910
Hang in there just a little longer.

429
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,440
Honey! Open your eyes!

430
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,320
Nice!

431
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm so tired.

432
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,800
Thank you so much.

433
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,830
Thank you.

434
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,290
It's such a relief that we had you at the scene.

435
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,810
I'll exchange your tickets. Take the ride now.

436
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,320
If you take it now, you'll see the sunset.

437
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,260
Really?

438
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,520
Thank you so much.

439
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much!

440
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,480
Thank you!

441
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,230
Mom, let's take it right now.

442
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,800
I don't want to. I'm tired. I can't.

443
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,250
My heart is racing.

444
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,730
We came this far. Do you just want to leave?

445
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,580
I'll give you a piggyback ride if you're tired.

446
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,690
Yes, let's take it.

447
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,440
We came this far. Let's go.

448
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,050
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,610
Hey!

450
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,660
Didn't you see us working our butt off to save someone just now?

451
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,240
How could you suggest taking the ride instead of taking a break?

452
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,440
Because she said we'd catch the sunset if we take it now.

453
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,630
And you'd feel better if you saw a nice view—

454
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,320
Yes, it's because this is our only chance.

455
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,440
I'm okay. We can just—

456
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,010
Were you born to be a fool?

457
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,920
Or don't you know how to read the air?

458
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,920
Well, Eun Mi.

459
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,130
Eun Mi!

460
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,100
Eun Mi!

461
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,810
What's wrong with her?

462
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,740
I guess I'm sorry.

463
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,410
I'm really sorry!

464
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,690
I'm so freaking sorry. Okay?

465
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,590
Could you tell me if I did anything wrong?

466
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,940
So I can fix it.

467
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,300
Is it because I've been making you tired since yesterday?

468
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,770
Oppa.

469
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,490
- Tell me.
- Why did you come here?

470
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,790
You must've known it'd be difficult and uncomfortable.

471
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,400
But why did you tag along?

472
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,170
How about you? Why did you bring me here?

473
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,940
Me? To seduce you.

474
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,800
But why do you keep caring about Jin Hee?

475
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,140
My daughter has nothing to do with you.

476
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,600
Why are you trying to become close to her?

477
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,200
If you can't take a hint even after warning you multiple times,

478
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,580
you can't date me. Don't you think?

479
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,550
I'm sorry.

480
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,300
I didn't think through things.

481
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,940
No, I put you two in a difficult position.

482
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm sorry.

483
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,430
Eun Mi, I'm sorry.

484
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,540
You're right.

485
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,730
I apologize.

486
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,400
It won't ever happen again.

487
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,980
Do you want to stop by a souvenir store tomorrow?

488
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,010
There's a place Jin Soo recommended.

489
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,020
Sure, whatever.

490
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,160
Did you two fight?

491
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,570
What are we, kids? Why would we fight?

492
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,670
If you're worried about me, you don't have to be.

493
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,380
Did I ever worry about you while dating?

494
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,600
That's why I said, "If." Didn't I?

495
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,570
I don't know about the rest, but I won't let you be called a goldfish poop again.

496
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,070
I'm sorry I let you hear about

497
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,370
the goldfish poop.

498
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,170
I apologize.

499
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,570
It's okay.

500
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,300
I was fine because...

501
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,350
you pulled out all those women's hair, then.

502
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,600
Is that so?

503
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,300
It's your turn to apologize now.

504
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,470
What?

505
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,910
Apologize.

506
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,620
That's why you came here.

507
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,660
Go ahead and apologize.

508
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,200
I won't ever do that again.

510
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,490
Okay, I accept.

511
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,530
And one more thing.

512
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,680
Don't jump the gun.

513
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,700
He has nothing to do with you.

514
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,360
If it turns out he's okay,

515
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,090
he'll just be my boyfriend.

516
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:53,370
So don't jump the gun and hate him or feel uncomfortable.

517
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,150
Okay.

518
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,870
Okay.

519
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
Let's go.

520
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,310
This is the CCTV footage from the bus stop you requested.

521
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,320
I hope this helps.

522
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,810
Is he dumb?

523
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,030
Why is he letting her beat him if he didn't do anything wrong?

524
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,030
What did you want to talk about?

525
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,420
Give me your hands.

526
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,890
Starting now, I'll...

527
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,990
seduce you, too.

528
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,260
Good luck with that, you fool.

529
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,830
What a dumbass.

530
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,270
You came out early.

531
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,890
Why so early...

532
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,660
Oh, you're here to see the sunrise.

533
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,750
Yes.

534
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
See you back inside, then.

535
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,660
Excuse me.

536
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,500
I was thinking about why I feel so uncomfortable and conflicted.

537
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,370
I think we started off on the wrong foot.

538
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,520
Both you and I.

539
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,600
I was focusing too much on the fact that you were Mom's first love.

540
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,560
The past is just the past.

541
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,410
So I'll focus on the present from now on to keep things simple.

542
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,150
What would you like me to do?

543
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,850

00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:52,020
Don't forget to call when you get home, too. Okay?

723
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,580
Okay, don't worry.

724
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,480
Oh, right. I got a tablet at the conference.

725
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,610
I already have one. Do you need one?

726
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,440
Give it to me. Jin Hee needs one.

727
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,310
She only has a laptop because she's not interested in stuff like that.

728
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,510
Really?

729
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,990
But shouldn't you call her and ask?

730
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,040
She might not like it.

731
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,830
Hold on.

732
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,650
How could I take that? I don't want it.

733
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,740
You accepted everything from my old boyfriends.

734
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,730
Why don't you want this one?

735
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,140
Are you discriminating against him?

736
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,290
Why? Again?

737
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,300
What?

738
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,030
Hey, say that again.

739
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,100
I accepted them because I won't ever see those guys again. Once you cut them off, it's over.

740
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,550
But it's not like that with Ahjussi. How could I accept that?

741
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,900
Hey, I'm with that Ahjussi right now.

742
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,350
You said you were going to see Aunt.

743
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,070
He's driving me there right now.

744
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,000
- Am I on speakerphone, by chance?
- Exactly.

745
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,990
Hang up now.

746
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,980
You heard that. Right?

747
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,870
She's refusing so clearly.

748
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,750
Goodness, I got rejected.

749
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,840
Oh, hello, Boss.

750
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,430
Oh, welcome, Ma'am.

751
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,250
- Hey.
- That way, please.

752
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,040
- That way?
- Yes, yes.

753
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,200
Got it.

754
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,850
This is sea breeze mugwort tea. It's apparently great for women.

755
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,410
I got a box for Mom, too.

756
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,270
Wow, who picked this?

757
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,880
It couldn't have been you.

758
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,270
What?

759
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,150
- What is it?
- How about this one?

760
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,570
I heard it's good for women.

761
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,170
Mugwort tea?

762
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,320
You know, the thing is—

763
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,500
It was Jin Hee, wasn't it?

764
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,520
Goodness, there's no way you have a good taste like this.

765
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,220
Mi Jeong, the thing is—

766
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,670
Did you make up with Jin Hee?

767
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,350
Of course, I did.

768
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,620
How?

769
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,940
What did you say? Tell me.

770
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,790
I just said,

771
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,400
"Hey. Apologize. Shit."

772
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,790
I told you to apologize first, didn't I?

773
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,290
I'm her mom, though.

774
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,960
My gosh. When will you grow up?

775
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,690
I'm seriously so frustrated!

776
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,060
Why are you flipping out? I said I apologized.

777
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,530
Seriously.

778
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,650
I'm sorry, Senior.

779
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,500
- Did you cause trouble behind my back again?
- Pardon?

780
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,510
Well, no, no.

781
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,740
I was just drunk.

782
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:34,420
I didn't remember because Jin Soo took off without telling me.

783
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,070
I sent you a file. Open that first.

784
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,240
Let's talk while looking at it.

785
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,600
He's the suspect in the park murder. Is he the one you saw?

786
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,350
Mom!

787
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,670
Yes, I think so.

788
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,580
First of all,

789
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,990
let's request witness protection for your mother first.

790
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,060
Hold on.

791
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,550
That means I'll have to expose my mom.

792
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,850
Wouldn't she be in greater danger, then?

793
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,250
Ms. Lee Na Kyeong ended up that way while under witness protection, too.

794
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,770
There's always an exception.

795
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:39,480
We're requesting witness protection to reduce the chance.

796
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,460
I just...

797
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,800
want you to trust me and rest easy.

798
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,640
And if necessary,

799
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,490
I'll make sure to protect her even if I have to risk my life.

800
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,170
No.

801
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,310
I won't expose her.

802
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,750
Someone is always by her side right now.

803
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,870
And she has me, too.

804
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,310
Let's do this, then.

805
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:17,180
I'll meet your mother tomorrow.

806
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,270
I'll ask her what she thinks and let her decide.

807
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,970
What do you think?

808
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,690
I don't think that's a good idea, either.

809
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,570
If we tell her that directly...

810
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,360
Senior, I'll keep things this way for now.

811
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,530
You were being considerate. I'm sorry.

812
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:52,830
It's not like I don't trust you. You know that. Right?

813
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,020
Do you want some beer?

814
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,720
I'm sorry, I drank until I almost puked in Yeosu.

815
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,450
Even Jin Soo said he hasn't seen me that drunk in a long time.

816
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,710
That I was so wasted.

817
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:12,540
Why did he go on a trip with you and run away?

818
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:17,080
Oh, he went there for work. He wasn't on the trip.

819
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,720
He went there for work?

820
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,960
Yes, I went on a trip with Mom.

821
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:27,130
Why did he talk like that, then?

822
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,270
Like "that"? What did he say?

823
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,370
He asked if you'd shower—

824
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,940
- Never mind.
- Pardon?

825
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,480
Senior!

826
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,380
Are you okay?

827
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,710
Senior! Wait for me!

828
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,660
Leave! Leave!

829
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,980
Are you embarrassed?

830
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,360
Isn't that Jin Hee and the Police Academy Oppa?

831
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,020
- Just leave!
- Are you all right?

832
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:58,210
Isn't that Chief Eun a foolish type, too?

833
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,710
What do you mean, "too"? Is there another fool like him?

834
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,140
I confirmed in Yeosu.

835
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,620
Park Jin Hong is the fool to end all fools.

836
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,830
He proved that so diligently for three days.

837
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,310
You...

838
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,540
You!

839
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,150
Mi Jeong, hey. I was really going to tell you, but...

840
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,820
I'll try dating him!

841
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,690
I'll be in a relationship with him!

842
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,450
Jin Hee said she doesn't care, either.

843
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,400
Mi Jeong!

844
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,860
Just cut me some slack!

845
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,170
Let me date someone like I used to.

846
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,640
Let go.

847
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,540
Hey, Kim Mi Jeong!

848
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,410
Hey! You...

849
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,490
Hey, I'm on my way home.

850
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,710
Goodness, you shouldn't have had a fight.

851
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,680
Where are you? I'll be right there.

852
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,330
It's okay. I'm almost home.

853
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,510
Let's keep talking on the phone until you get home.

854
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,700
It's okay.

855
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,540
I'm really right around the corner.

856
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,080
Let's hang up, Oppa.

857
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,850
I'll call you after I shower when I get home.

858
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,530
Do you want to?

859
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,590
Take a shower quickly and call me, then.

You said you'd risk your life to protect her.

869

You said that to me, didn't you?

870
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,460
Do you think I was in danger because he couldn't protect me?

871
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,730
Just focus on the fact that your mom is safe.

872
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,400

Fine. Let's go ahead and do as we'd like.

878
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,930
The suspect of the park murder changed his testimony.

879
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,560
That means the real culprit is still out there.
