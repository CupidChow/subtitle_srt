00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,966
said they can't release personal information because it's a sensitive matter.

188
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:42,756
Same with the credit card receipt.

189
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,706
That means we need a warrant, after all.

190
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:48,666
At least an official request for cooperation.

191
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:58,276
What were you doing that you're so awkwardly taken aback?

192
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:00,896
Pardon? Why do you say that?

193
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:04,316
I got some snacks. Have some.

194
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:07,916
Yes, we should. Sounds tasty.

195

You don't even know what it is.

196
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:13,976

Or bungeoppang?

198
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:26,976
It is Ms. Lee Na Kyeong's lip balm.

199

The person the suspect saw in the park might be the culprit.

We don't know for sure yet.

201

202

What was the hearing aid company called? I wanted to go there.

203
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:43,486
Do you have a guy you know at the hearing aid company, too?

204
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,706
Or a younger friend?

- It seems like you've led a very proper life.

No.

Wow, seriously...

I hope they aren't doing something to upset the HQ.

00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:56,406
Do you remember Lee Maeng Jin? She quit.

224

Are you asking because you know Sook Hyeon's pregnant?

225
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,926
A long-distance dad cheated. Guess who?

226
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,786
The park murder suspect changed his testimony.

227
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:14,546
What about the thing I asked?

228
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:16,856
Let me ask you something first.

229
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,676
Will you return to the HQ?

230
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:19,956
Of course.

231
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:23,106
You're considering coming back, then?

232
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:25,676
Will my answer change what you'd tell me?

233
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:29,406
If you are going to come back, create a withdrawal route before you fight.

234
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:33,106
Don't do anything you'd be held accountable for.

235
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,226
But it has to do with my mom.

236
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,926
Who else should be held accountable other than me?

237
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:41,566
There's Senior Eun Jae Won.

238
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,746
-Im Tae Gyeong.
- I don't care what you say about me.

239
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,926
I care about you more than Senior Eun.

240
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:50,336
Wouldn't you feel the same way?

241
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,826
That's why I need to do it properly.

243
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:01,616
I'll catch the right culprit so no one can be held accountable.

Jin Hee, why are you taking it this far?

245
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:08,786
If what he said is true,

246
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:12,766
an innocent person is locked up and the real culprit is out there.

247
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,816
Isn't that good enough?

248
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:24,176
What sin did I commit in my previous life that I have a nutty friend like you? My gosh!

249
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:27,716
Hey, don't get the wrong idea. I'm only giving this to you because of Ahjumma.

250
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:33,316
I don't want you to blame me later because there's an actual culprit out there.

251
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,546
I came up with some other excuse to get this for you.

252
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,836
If anything goes wrong, I'll deny it altogether.

253
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:43,426
You'd better do this on your own.

254
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:46,426
Thank you, Tae Gyeong. Thank you so much.

255
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:53,546
They're videos from CCTVs in the park, the surrounding area, and dashcams at the time of the murder.

256
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,396
How many hours are on these?

257
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:59,006
- Ten days worth.
- So I need to watch 10 videos that are 24 hours long?

258
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,786
Multiply that by 48.

259
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:08,196
Help me just once. I beg you, Senior.

I'm refusing for you, not for myself.

262
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,976
We had a party for catching the culprit,

263
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:20,176
and we even split the bonus, but you want to ruin it all.

264
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:28,066
Let's say there's actually a real culprit.

265
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:30,856
Whether you catch him or not, it comes down to

266
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,106
the fact that if they find out you've been doing this,

267
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:36,336
you'll be done for.

268
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,546

362
00:27:57,296 --> 00:28:00,866
You're home all day thinking about me. Right?

363
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:09,266
Eun Mi, by chance, is it because of Jin Hee?

364
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,226
The reason you said no?

365
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:19,776
Oppa, even if we make a decision and change certain things,

366
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:23,406
it's between you and me.

367
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:26,746
I told you before, but stop getting Jin Hee involved.

368
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,136
It has nothing to do with her.

369
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:33,796
That's how Jin Hee and I've been living.

370
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,716
That won't change because of you, either.

371
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,496
Well, what am I supposed to...

372
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,806
Mom, pack your things.

373
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,326
Where am I supposed to go?

374
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,886
Ahjussi's place.

375
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,556
Of course, I know you mean his place.

376
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:02,726
Why would I go to his place when I have my own home?

377
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:05,826
I told you. I won't be home because I'm busy.

378
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:07,326
I can be on my own.

379
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:08,926
How could you be on your own?

380
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:11,366
You need someone to be your underling.

381
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:12,946
What? Underling?

382
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:15,076
I-I can do that for you.

383
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:17,466
What do you mean, you can?

384
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:22,476
Jin Hee, Mom hates it so much.

385
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:24,276
What if I just come here—

386
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,626
- No way.
- I don't want that.

387
00:29:28,356 --> 00:29:29,636
Why not?

388
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:30,816
Because of our promise.

389
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:34,636
We're not supposed to sleep with a man in this house.

390
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:37,866
I already broke it. What do you want me to do?

391
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:45,956
You live in this house with me.

392
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:49,496
Can't you keep our boundaries even when I'm not around?

393
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,426
Gosh, just the thought of it—

394
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:53,216
Why would you think about that?

395
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,446
Don't think about it.

396
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,706
Yes, Jin Hee.

397
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:02,286
I was wrong.

398
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,246
I'll take her to my place immediately.

399
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:06,316
Eun Mi, let's pack your bag.

400
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:09,066
I mean, why do I have to leave my home

401
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:12,106
and stay at someone else's? So uncomfortable.

402
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:15,416
Wow, you're so selfish.

403
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:18,956
You don't want to be uncomfortable, but you don't care about my discomfort?

404
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:22,156
You said you wouldn't be home.

405
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:25,656
How would I understand your discomfort at home, then?

406
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:30,916
Well, even if you can't understand, just do it if I ask you to.

407
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:35,566
You're hiding something. What is it?

408
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,816
What are you plotting to do by making me leave?

409
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:42,806
What are you talking about? What would I plot, exactly?

410
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:47,926
Whatever you do, don't do it here and do it at his place. That's what I'm saying.

411
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,006
Was that it?

412
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:54,376
You think I refused to live with him because of you?

413
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:55,626
No.

414
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:58,566
Like you said, why should I care who you live with?

415
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,076
Listen to you.

416
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:03,436
Hey, why does that not concern you?

417
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:07,066
You just said so. You said it doesn't concern me.

418
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:11,536
Well, it doesn't concern you, but it does.

419
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,716
Why? Because it's you.

420
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:16,016
See? You don't even know what you're saying.

421
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:19,416
I don't know. Whatever. Just go pack your stuff.

422
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,906
Okay. I'll just pack my stuff.

423
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:24,986
I will because I can't stand this.

424
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,936
I will.

425
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:34,716
Jin Hee, your mom and I will be okay.

426
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:36,926
I'm counting on you.

427
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,626
What? What is it?

428
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:19,706
What are you doing?

429
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:26,216
Why are you taking that? Mom.

430
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:28,546
What's this now?

431
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:34,096
Why are you being unreasonable now?

432
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,936
Not those. Mom.

433
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:42,736
You can't take those. I...

434
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:44,416
Take these instead.

435
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,376
Not these ones. Mom.

436
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:49,426
I had to wait to get these.

437
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:56,066
Oppa, I'll use the bed.

438
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,156
How nice.

439
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:04,126
Do you want a beer or something?

440
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:06,286
I'll make you drinking snacks.

441
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,986
Deal.

442
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:26,886
Hey. Let's go in.

443
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:32,416
There are five hearing-impaired ex-convicts

444
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,476
in their 20s and 30s in the area.

445
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:36,296
Did you meet with them?

446
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:39,366
I met two because I didn't have enough time.

447
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:42,046
They both have clear alibis.

448
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:46,286
There wasn't anything notable, either.

449
00:33:46,286 --> 00:33:48,476
How about the fingerprint you found?

450
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,446
I'll be meeting Jong Wan tomorrow morning.

451
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,756
I'll look around using that.

452
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:54,476
What a relief.

453
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:58,126
Please say hello to Senior Jong Wan for me.

454
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,816
You should at least sleep an hour if you're tired.

455
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:05,206
We need to stay up all night anyway.

456
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:24,166
Please wake me up in an hour.

457
00:34:56,826 --> 00:35:00,616
I can't get up if the bed is too comfortable.

458
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:05,976
Don't worry. I'll make sure to wake you up.

459
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:58,266
CCTV covers up to there

460
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:01,466
and he disappeared around here.

461
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,536
Where did he go, anyway?

462
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,576
So she headed to the park afterward?

463
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:53,316
Yes, it was where the park murder happened, but I didn't notice anything.

464
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:57,966
We couldn't tell exactly what she was looking for.

465
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:03,206
- Welcome back.
- Hello.

466
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,926
Welcome back.

467
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:07,576
Thank you, Team Leader Kim.

468
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,986
Let's talk for a moment.

469
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:35,396
What is this?

470
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:48,126
I think you have some explaining to do.

471
00:37:49,346 --> 00:37:53,936
Why didn't you tell us your mother has something to do with the park murder?

472
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:57,796
So you think the real culprit is out there. Right?

473
00:37:57,796 --> 00:38:00,196
That's why you think your mother is in danger.

474
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:02,816
Of course, Chief Eun knows about it.

475
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:06,436
You requested a visit to the jail because of that. Right?

476
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:10,966
You two were summoned to the HQ because of that, too.

477
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:13,266
What about us?

478
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:18,536
Do you guys even consider us as your teammates?

479
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,606
This is...

480
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,796
It's better for you not to know about this for now.

481
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:25,066
Once things get sorted out—

482
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,916
I'm so disappointed.

483
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,646
I thought we were a team.

484
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:30,726
Were we mistaken?

485
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:34,016
It's because it has to do with my mom.

486
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,266
Because of my personal matter—

487
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:38,116
How is this your personal matter?

488
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,476
That's right. It's our job.

489
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:44,546
Why are you all doing this?

490
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:46,926
Do you want the HQ to keep tabs on all of us?

491
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:48,416
Whatever.

492
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:52,646
Show us the documents you've been collecting in secret with Chief Eun.

493
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:53,676
Captain Cha.

494
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:57,576
That way, we can provide you with what we've been collecting.

495
00:38:57,576 --> 00:38:59,756
What have you been collecting...

496
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:01,826
Are you crazy?

497
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:05,056
Ms. Lee Na Kyeong's daily routes and credit card records.

498
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:07,046
I got it from my classmates.

499
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:11,466
We analyzed the footage you got from the HQ, too.

500
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:15,376
Well, what... When did you take those...

501
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:24,486
Are you saying you did all that work?

502
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:26,796
That's why you should've told us sooner

503
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:30,256
instead of struggling between you two.

504
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:35,856
L-Let me see. What did you do?

505
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:38,636
Come on, you have to follow the order.

506
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:42,976
Show us what you and Chief Eun found first.

507
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,446
Chief Eun.

508
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:11,196
What's this?

509
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,336
Do you live together?

510
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,596
You even changed the passcode, too?

511
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,066
Why did you see my daughter?

512
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:28,906
Even Oppa doesn't do that without my approval.

513
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:30,386
You're so strange.

514
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,456
You should celebrate that she has a dad and aunt now. Why be so angry?

515
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:36,766
Jin Hee and I've been doing fine, just the two of us. What for?

516
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:39,486
It's because you're not used to it.

517
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:42,526
Live without a family if you don't want it.

518
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,836
Why would you force that on Jin Hee, too?

519
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:46,466
What do you mean I don't have a family?

520
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:47,826
I have a family.

521
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,916
A real, proper family.

522
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:54,416
Jin Hee was loved by them plenty growing up, too.

523
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:57,896
You don't share a drop of blood. How's that family?

524
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,996
Does sharing blood make you family?

525
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:02,846
You and your husband were strangers once, too.

526
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:06,886
And is it okay to be so rude if you're family?

527
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:12,406
I see. That's why your parents treat Oppa like this.

528
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,636
You think you can just say whatever?

529
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:16,346
What do they have to do with this?

530
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:18,766
Ji Eun! That's enough. Let's go.

531
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:21,756
And I told you to call before you come.

532
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:24,366
Why are you so afraid of her all the time?

533
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:26,776
She's your daughter. Why do you need her permission?

534
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,516
Why is Jin Hee my daughter?

535
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:29,806
She's Eun Mi's daughter.

536
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:32,066
She's Eun Mi's daughter, whom she raised by herself.

537
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:35,416
And why are you acting out when I'm fine with it?

538
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,376
Gosh. You fool.

539
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:41,416
Does she not have your blood just because you deny it?

540
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:46,636
If I were strangers to them for 30 years,

541
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:50,096
you can't be entitled just because you share blood.

542
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:52,746
When did I act entitled?

543
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:56,256
Ji Eun.

544
00:41:57,256 --> 00:42:00,046
I'm so happy right now.

545
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:02,126
I can't ask for more.

546
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,806
Gosh, it's so frustrating. So frustrating.

547
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:11,256
I'm curious as to what's inside your head.

548
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:31,446
On the night of the incident, there was a man who was following the victim.

549
00:42:31,446 --> 00:42:34,196
He was spotted in front of the victim's house.

550
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,096
It was confirmed that he went to the park,

551
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:38,156
but he disappeared with the victim here.

552
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,746
But he hasn't shown up since then.

553
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:45,476
Meaning he was seen entering but not when he exited.

554
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:49,266
So we checked the CCTVs at the shops and dashcams in the area.

555
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,096
And this is...

556
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:56,656
where he was filmed walking downtown by a dashcam of a parked car.

557
00:42:56,656 --> 00:42:58,416
He was filmed?

558
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:59,696
Did you find him, then?

559
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:01,506
Yes.

560
00:43:01,506 --> 00:43:05,396
That means he exited the park through a small path.

561
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:07,396
That's why we looked into it.

562
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:09,866
It turns out there was a small path.

563
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:13,776
It's assumed that he exited through here.

564
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,766
So we kept tracking him.

565
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:19,976
Do you know where he was last seen is connected to?

566
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:20,736
Where?

567
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:26,376
The alley with the security light where Team Leader's mom rescued Ms. Lee.

568
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:27,886
Here.

569
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:32,426
Wow.

570
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:35,956
Could you look for more footage?

571
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:42,486
There's a man the suspect saw at night a few days after the incident.

572
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,796
The culprit always returns to the scene.

573
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:47,356
You think that's the real culprit?

574
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:49,436
No, we don't know that yet.

575
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:55,026
On the contrary, that man was seen leaving the park,

576
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:57,086
but not when he entered.

577
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,616
How creepy.

578
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:04,216
I'll look into it further.

579
00:44:26,736 --> 00:44:31,306
Are you sure there's a real culprit in the park murder out there?

580
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:34,076
Answer me, you bastard.

581
00:44:34,076 --> 00:44:38,756
We're about to enter hell together. I could use reassurance.

582

Have you seen a suspicious man in a baseball cap,

00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:02,966
a hoodie recently, by chance?

587
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,446
I don't think I have.

588
00:45:04,446 --> 00:45:06,566
Yes, got it.

I think we need to check this.

591
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:28,896
This overlapped with the other one.

592
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:31,906
- Really? I removed the ones that overlapped.
- Really?

593
00:45:31,906 --> 00:45:33,826

Ga Eul?

605
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:19,616

Where is she?

608
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:31,566
I saw her deeper inside the alley.

609
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:53,726
Hello?

610
00:47:53,726 --> 00:47:55,596

You found him? Where?

612
00:47:57,576 --> 00:47:58,966
At the convenience store.

613
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:00,956
He wasn't just captured passing by.

614
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:03,356
He stopped by the store and went to the park.

615
00:48:03,356 --> 00:48:04,736
He was captured by a dashcam nearby.

616
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:07,096
It matches the time the suspect

617
00:48:07,096 --> 00:48:08,516

618
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:10,686

621
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:15,596
where he disappeared last after leaving the park.

622
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:18,236
Is it the alley with the security light, by chance?

623
00:48:18,236 --> 00:48:19,956
- That's right.
- Yes.

624

He suddenly disappeared. So I was calling him, too. Just a moment.

00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:19,626
No one manages a large shop space like he does.

718
00:56:17,476 --> 00:56:19,936
You guys aren't my daughters.

719
00:56:19,936 --> 00:56:22,520
Look at you.

720
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:35,636
♫ The light pink skirt whirls around in the spring breeze ♫

721
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:41,266
♫ Once again today, the one who took my jacket ribbon ♫

722
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:45,116
You're just like me.

723
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:49,626
Do you know how scared I was whenever you cried?

724
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:51,780
Because I might abandon you?

725
00:56:55,516 --> 00:57:03,646
♫ Riding the wind, I'm dancing with the spring scent ♫

726
00:57:06,626 --> 00:57:10,876
What?

727
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:12,326
Gosh...

728
00:57:12,326 --> 00:57:16,416
♫ I'm calling spring ♫

729
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:22,380
♫ I'm singing to the whole world ♫

730
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:26,016
Jin Hee!

731
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:29,246
Where did you go?

732
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,966
Jin Hee! Jin Hee! Jin Hee.

733
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:37,506
Eun Mi, were you looking for her?

734
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,996
She was playing with Jin Soo. I feel so terrible.

735
00:57:41,596 --> 00:57:43,956
Where were you?

736
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:50,466
♫ It echoes in the cherry blossoms ♫

737
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:55,056
Stop crying, Mom.

738
00:57:55,056 --> 00:58:00,616
Are you sad? Being sad makes you look ugly.

739
00:58:00,616 --> 00:58:08,306
♫ In the white sky, I'm picturing spring ♫

740
00:58:08,306 --> 00:58:16,836
♫ Dancing to the sound of the whistle ♫

741
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:24,056
♫ I'm calling spring in the wind ♫

742
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:27,586
♫ I try running through it ♫

743
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:44,216
[Not Others]

744
00:58:44,216 --> 00:58:47,176
My proud teammates got special promotions.

745
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:49,616
If you get a chance to return to the HQ, leave without looking back.

746
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:51,706
I should be doing that. I have nothing to do.

747
00:58:51,706 --> 00:58:52,896
Father, how did you know I was here?

748
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,606
I should look into it properly if she's my bloodline.

749
00:58:55,606 --> 00:58:58,186
You didn't expect this would happen when they showed up?

750
00:58:58,186 --> 00:59:00,536
Get out. You don't even know how I feel. How dare you...

751
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:04,116
I'll do it to prove it for my mom. Give me your hair, Grandpa.

752
00:59:04,116 --> 00:59:07,326
Looks like you never thought I wouldn't marry Jin Hong.

753
00:59:07,326 --> 00:59:08,716
It's fun to watch you.

754
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:11,126
The way you talk, smile, run...

755
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:13,406
Do you like me, Senior?
