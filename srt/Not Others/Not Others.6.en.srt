Oh, Jin Hee! Do you want me to get you cotton candy?

9
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:51,794
Yes! I want strawberry flavor!

10
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,054
Strawberry flavor?

I wish you were my dad, Uncle.

30
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:03,034
Hold on. Let me sort my thoughts out.

31
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:08,424
Do you remember the day I went to the police station with Mi Jeong?

32
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:10,224
He said he recognized me then and followed me.

33
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:16,934
So he's the man you've been flirting with all this time. Right?

34
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,894
No.

35
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,664
What do you mean, no?

36
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,624
Don't flirt with him. Just quit.

37
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:28,054
That's up to me. You can't tell me what to do.

38
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,174
You only recently reunited with him.

39
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:31,614
You don't really know what he's like.

40
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:33,584
Why does that matter?

41
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:37,194
Well, it doesn't really matter, but...

42
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:38,954
Anyway, you can't!

43
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,654

He must've been shocked, too.

Pardon? I'm okay.

Oh, Team Leader!

74
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,464
Did you have dinner?

75
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,064
Why don't you have a cup of coffee?

76
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,924
I didn't do anything. I don't need coffee.

77
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:06,624
Yes, it's possible.

78
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,734
People can be like that.

79
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,464
He ignored me to my face,

80
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:13,304
looked down on me,

81
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:15,474
and was mean to me purposely.

82
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:18,834
Let's just say it's fine since I've done stuff, too.

83
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,004
It's not like we'd be seeing each other for long!

84
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:24,674
He has nothing to do with me, anyway!

85
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,414
But if that's the case,

86
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:35,644
I don't have to let things slide.

87
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:38,394
That's why it's been bothering me.

88
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:40,814
Yes.

89
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,924
Why let it slide?

90
00:05:56,944 --> 00:06:00,974
Have we been too harsh on her?

91
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:06,704
I didn't know, but she holds grudges.

92
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:19,834
What?

93
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,584
I have a question.

94
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,844
Stand straight while talking to me.

95
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:25,364
Pardon?

96
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:27,904
Yes.

97
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:31,254
Talk.

98
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:35,434
Do you remember the doctor named Park Jin Hong?

99
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:36,704
What about him?

100
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:40,814
When we checked his phone here because of the upskirt incident,

101
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:43,684
are you sure you didn't see anything?

102
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,084
Go get his approval.

103
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:50,044
Then I'll tell you.

104
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,284
Well, Senior!

105
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,224
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:35,774
A woman was murdered in the neighborhood recently.

107
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:39,324
Team Leader has a mother, too.

108
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:43,574
She probably was overly sensitive about the incident.

109
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:01,624
Why were you standing there?

110
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:04,204
What were you looking at?

111
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,294
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:37,774
I think there was a misunderstanding.

113
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:43,044
You two are suffering so much because of one reckless person.

114
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,614
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,414
Are you crazy?

116
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:02,574
You had to let him meet Jin Hee?

117
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:06,254
Who would've thought they'd run into each other there?

118
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,094
So, why did you give him room for that?

119
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,834
I didn't! He's the one who came to me!

120
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,414
Should I have broken his legs so he couldn't come?

121
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:15,134
You should've if you could!

122
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,264
Do you hate him that much?

123
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,384
Do you like him, then?

124
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,414
I don't like him, but...

125
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,954
he's not exactly all that bad.

126
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,974
Since he's not...

127
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:28,634
you'd date him or something?

128
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,284
What do you mean, date?

129
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,204
But why shouldn't I?

130
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,284
Come to your senses!

131
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:36,854
He's on another level compared to the men you've dated!

132
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:39,874
He's Jin Hee's father!

133
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:42,984
That doesn't matter right now. You don't even know.

134
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,414
That's what you think!

135
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:47,424
How could that not matter?

136
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:49,014
Really?

137
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:50,944
Does it matter?

138
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:52,374
You're seriously driving me crazy!

139
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,644
What kind of mom are you?

140
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,564
Will you marry him or something?

141
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,144
What do you mean, marry? So gross!

142
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:02,004
It'd end at some point, then.

143
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:03,854
Breaking up with him

144
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:07,914
can't be the same as breaking up with just anyone! It's her dad!

145
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:10,194
It'd hurt Jin Hee tremendously!

146
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,534
Okay! I won't date him.

147
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,704
That's enough.

148
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,754
Is that what I get for getting all worked up?

149
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,924
Hey, can't you answer properly?

150
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:21,604
Both of you are flipping out that I'm just considering it.

151
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:23,834
I'm afraid I'd get beaten to death if I actually dated him.

152
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,754
Are you happy?

153
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,414
That's exactly it.

154
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,154
It'd take more than just talking next time!

155
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,014
Whether you die or he dies,

156
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:35,874
I'll make sure I'll kill one of you!

157
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:40,364
I came to be comforted by my friend,

158
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:43,674
yet you're talking about my daughter more than me.

159
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:46,634
- Is she your daughter?
- She'd be mine if it wasn't for you! Didn't you know?

160
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,774
I'm the one who gave birth!

161
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,724
That's mine.

162
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,644
- Thank you!
- Don't thank her.

163
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:13,064
- Why not?
- Just don't!

164
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,854
Hey, don't come to this street.

165
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:18,134
What are you saying? This is my route home. Okay?

166
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,764
Oh.

167
00:12:23,664 --> 00:12:25,744
Hold on!

168
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,094
It's morning now. You're going home and not to school?

169
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:32,464
Why do you care?

170
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,634
I'm not sure why.

171
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,584
I feel like you'll cause trouble.

172
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,554
What's your name?

173
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,194
She's Gong Ga Eul, and I'm—

174
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,914
Why would you tell her that?

175
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:47,694
So fucking annoying!

176
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:48,964
Take care!

177
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,574
I told you not to!

178
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,064
You're home.

179
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:07,284
Didn't you say you have a meeting with a publisher?

180
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,794
It was canceled.

181
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,754
What is it this time?

182
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:14,684
What else? Because they don't think they can pay me.

183
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:17,564
Why do you work with a company like that?

184
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:20,404
You're picking up my mom in the evening. Right?

185
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,514
I don't know.

186
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,504
Maybe I should get a part-time job.

187
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,834
Hey, you can't suddenly do this!

188
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,004
How about my mom?

189
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,814
Why don't you pay me, then?

190
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,804
Pay for food and lodging. Then I'll pay you.

191
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:37,094
What's with you? Do you think I'm your servant?

192
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,674
Enjoy your meal.

193
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,934
- What's this?
- Why don't you...

194
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,764
pay with your card for now?

195
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,234
Mine is maxed out.

196
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,444
Buy it next month, then.

197
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:10,334
They're running out of sizes now!

198
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,584
I'll pay you back when I get paid.

199
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,594
How much is it?

200
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,244
How much was this?

201
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:19,814
It's 1.8 million won.

202
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:21,864
Are you crazy?

203
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:28,414
I'll pick up Ahjumma from work every day.

204
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,534
I'll cook and clean, too!

205
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,724
Running errands? It's a piece of cake.

206
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,124
What do you think?

207
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:44,764
The stew got cold! Hold on!

208
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,674
It'll be quick! About a minute or two?

209
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:49,944
Make me a fried egg, too.

210
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:51,964
Okay!

211
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,694
Pan!

212
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,824
Oil!

213
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:02,884
Egg!

214
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,494
Money!

215
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,834
Oh, right.

216
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,144
- Isn't Ahjumma in a relationship?
- No.

217
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:11,814
Who's the one she met in front of the hospital?

218
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,144
Weren't they flirting or something?

219
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,364
He was her first love.

220
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,334
If he was her first love...

221
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,330
Isn't he your— Gosh! Hot!

222
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:30,304
Hold on! Why am I paying for this—

223
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,104
Thank you, Jin Hee! I'll pay you when I get paid!

224
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,514
The oil is splattering!

225
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:36,304
Hey! Hey, you! Shit!

226
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,584
My gosh! Hey, come here!

227
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,724
- See you tomorrow!
- See you!

228
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:43,714
- Bye!
- See you!

229
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,314
Ahjumma! Are you getting off work now?

230
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:59,254
I'm getting a chicken instead of a pheasant.

231
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:01,524
No, is it a pheasant instead of a chicken?

232
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:04,294
I'm the pheasant. Who's the chicken?

233
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:07,004
I love your sense of confidence!

234
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,064
Yes, men have to be confident.

235
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,484
Shall we?

236
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:14,064
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Here we go!

237
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:51,394
He probably didn't think it concerned him when he heard I had a daughter.

238
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:53,204
But after seeing her face,

239
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:56,614
reality suddenly kicked in and he got scared.

240
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,734
Yes, hide again.

241
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:03,044
Run away again!

242
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:06,154
That suits you perfectly, you dumbass.

243
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,554
It's her. It's her!

244
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:29,154
What am I going to do?

245
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:47,144
I can't believe she thought she had a chance with me.

246
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,164
She should...

247
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,954
know her place, seriously.

248
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,174
Maybe because she knows her place

249
00:17:57,174 --> 00:18:00,554
that she's avoiding me without being able to talk to me.

250
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:08,994
It'd be so awkward working together!

251
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:16,034
What an immature woman.

252
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:22,974
Ahjumma!

253
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:27,734
Brea— Breakfast is ready...

254
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:32,184
How strange. Why couldn't I sleep?

255
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:35,774
I didn't drink coffee and didn't take a nap, either.

256
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:40,044
I don't even feel sick. Why?

257
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,064
Enjoy your meal.

258
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:49,634
I'll get going!

259
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:51,544
See you.

260
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:55,694
Gosh, so annoying.

261
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:57,414
You still have to eat to go to work—

262
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,254
I couldn't sleep! How could I eat?

263
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,544
Stop telling me to eat! Eat!

264
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:11,074
I should eat.

265
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:17,754
- Put the rice in the soup so it's easier—
- Seriously!

266
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:20,374
I can just eat myself—

267
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:27,254
I'll eat.

268
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,574
Does Jin Soo come on time when you're getting off work?

269
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,834
I won't date him.

270
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:45,934
I won't date him, so relax and stop spying on me.

271
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,844
When did I spy on you?

272
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:53,424
I'm worried about you because of the incident in the neighborhood.

273
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:57,204
I'm telling you to stop doing unnecessary stuff!

274
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,004
You...

275
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,804
What? My gosh!

276
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:22,484
Oh, my... Geez!

277
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,144
Yes, got it.

278
00:20:57,864 --> 00:21:00,064
The owner wants you to request formally.

279
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:02,934
There's a request form to check the CCTV. Right?

280
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:05,054
Got it. Thank you!

281
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,054
Thank you.

282
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,324
- Lieutenant Kim!
- Hello!

283
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:33,534
Hey, Kim Jin Hee!

284
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,794
Integrated Control Center?

285
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,554
Yes.

286
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:42,924
I heard one of our classmates works there, no?

287
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:45,074
What's it about?

288
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,734
Why? Can't you talk about it?

289
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:52,134
- There's this guy my mom's dating and—
- Another one?

290
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:57,154
Is he acting weird? Is he kind of fishy?

291
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,334
Gosh, no.

292
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:04,394
The CCTV at a bus stop...

293
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:08,174
I'd just like to check the CCTV at a bus stop.

294
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:11,384
Let me try asking,

295
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:13,554
but I'm not sure he'd actually do it.

296
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:16,584
Hey! By the way, your mom still has it.

297
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,784
She's so impressive! Tell her that I respect her.

298
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:21,014
Hey, Kim Jin Hee!

299
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:23,304
- Hello.
- Hello.

300
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:29,634
Chief, how could you do that to me?

301
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:33,654
Are you hanging in there?

302
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:38,324
Eun Jae Won probably won't be able to come back here.

303
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,994
He'd probably end up staying there.

304
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:45,184
But you have to come back. Right?

305
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:50,184
So don't get too close to him and keep your distance.

306
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:53,114
He's like a swamp.

307
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:56,754
He drags everyone around him down.

308
00:22:57,874 --> 00:23:00,884
There's no guarantee that won't happen to you.

309
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,814
Be careful!

310
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:10,034
How about the jokbal place at the intersection? Jokbal?

311
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:11,244
Jokbal sounds great!

312
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:12,854
Let's have bossam today. Bossam!

313
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:15,834
- It's going to be jokbal!
- Oh, come on!

314
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,534
Excuse me!

315
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:20,184
I have to go to the bathroom. You go on ahead.

316
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:21,664
- Yes.
- All of a sudden?

317
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,744
S-Shall we go?

318
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,904
- Bossam! Bossam.
- No, jokbal!

319
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,084
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

320
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:33,664
Let's go, let's go! Bossam! Bossam! Not jokbal!

321
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:36,934
Yes, Ahjumma.

322
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:39,554
Pardon?

323
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,634
Okay.

324
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,534
Yes.

325
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,244
Yes!

326
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:34,504
Hi, I'm back again.

327
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:36,554
I told you not to. Why do you keep coming?

328
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:38,104
Are you ignoring me?

329
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,634
Let's have dinner.

330
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,554
Dinner, my foot.

331
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:46,844
Should we grab a drink? It's your favorite.

332
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:51,634
When did I like drinking, exactly?

333
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:53,784
Don't be silly!

334
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:18,934
My goodness. Drink slowly.

335
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:27,964
Tell me.

336
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:31,204
Why do you keep coming? Can't you get it together?

337
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:39,704
I want to be by your side.

338
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,334
I said you can't do that.

339
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,394
Do you know how messed up I got since you showed up?

340
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:46,694
I can't do anything!

341
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,814
Even my daughter is spying on me.

342
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,334
Well, the thing is—

343
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:56,284
What did you do that she calls you someone weird and suspicious?

344
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:57,474
It's understandable.

345
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:01,994
I'm suspicious and weird from her point of view.

346
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,144
She didn't do anything wrong, then. Right?

347
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:07,594
It's all your fault, isn't it?

348
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:10,944
Well, it is my fault.

349
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,684
Now that we're on the subject, I'd like to apologize.

350
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:17,544
There's no way.

351
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:20,384
How dare you try to meet her?

352
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:22,774
- Just give me your phone number.
- Huh?

353
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:25,084
It was so frustrating that I couldn't reach you!

354
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,674
Give it to me right now.

355
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:28,554
Oh, right.

356
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,134
Answer immediately if I call.

357
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,954
Of course, I will!

358
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:49,094
And pick me up at the hospital every evening.

359
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,304
Walk me to my place.

360
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,374
You mean every evening?

361
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,794
Don't get the wrong idea!

362
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:57,794
It's because the neighborhood is dangerous.

363
00:26:58,564 --> 00:27:03,624
A police officer told me a woman was murdered.

364
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:08,354
Okay, I'll come every day.

365
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:12,964
Why don't I just take you to and from work? I also have a car.

366
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,504
Well?

367
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:17,314
Do as you wish.

368
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:22,334
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

369
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,934
Aren't you going to drink?

370
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,844
Oh, me?

371
00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:46,514
I should.

372
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,324
I will.

373
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,400
You said you hurt your toe, got infected, had a fever, and you almost died!

374
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,184
You said you got antibiotics and take medicine, too. Why would you drink?

375
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:59,914
Will you die if I tell you to, you dumbass?

376
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:01,944
How did you know?

377
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,754
Yes, don't worry. Take good care of yourself.

378
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:08,284
Yes, thank you!

379
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:13,204
He didn't seem like it, but he's so silly.

380
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:15,474
Your junior who was here last time. Right?

381
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,954
- Yes.
- Why? Is he sick?

382
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,794
I mean...

383
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:23,564
He called 911 and went to the ER,

384
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,244
but he needed a guardian's signature.

385
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:27,484
- So he called me.
- Oh, no...

386
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:28,924
He got a tetanus test, too.

387
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:32,444
It could've been really serious!

388
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:45,344
What are you looking at?

389
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:47,204
I'm not looking.

390
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:49,244
I won't look.

391
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,974
Hey, Kim Jin Soo!

392
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,554
He's slacking off!

393
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:34,364
Hey, Jin Soo!

394
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:36,434
Kim Jin Soo!

395
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,464
Where are you?

396
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:46,224
I'm on my way home now.

397
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:49,114
Did Ahjumma not come home last night, too?

398
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:50,644
What are you talking about?

399
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:53,384
She and her date.

400
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:57,304
They're in the same car right now.

401
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,194
Didn't you go to pick her up yesterday?

402
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:03,124
She said she was meeting someone. So I just left.

403
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,364
They're leaving.

404
00:30:11,364 --> 00:30:14,364
Hey, you should've called me, then!

405
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:16,084
Are you serious?

406
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:18,024
Cancel the purchase right now!

407
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,774
H-Hello? He...

408
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:28,354
You can't cancel because they started shipping it already.

409
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:31,414
Also, I didn't break a promise or anything.

410
00:31:08,154 --> 00:31:10,544
Go! Go!

411
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:11,774
Go, go!

412
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:13,984
Go in! Go in!

413
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:19,024
This is crazy... Seriously!

414
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:29,164
I said act like you don't know me in front of the hospital!

415
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:31,284
Just in case you might not see my car.

416
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:32,594
You think I'm stupid?

417
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:35,614
Can't I just drop you off and pick you up in front of the hospital?

418
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:38,124
I don't want to make you cross the street.

419
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:41,844
Things will get annoying if people at work find out.

420
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:44,964
It already gives me a headache. No.

421
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:50,374
Hurry! Put your head down!

422
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,974
You're...

423
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:01,404
still pretty.

424
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:04,954
Look outside! See if they're gone.

425
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:06,554
Huh?

426
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:12,134
They're gone.

427
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:24,024
You're going home now. Right?

428
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,894
I'm hungry.

429
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:32,094
Aren't you hungry, Oppa?

430
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:34,564
Me? I'm hungry, too.

431
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,164
I'm starving.

432
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,444
What would you like to eat?

433
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:41,404
Well...

434
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:47,334
I want to grill myself,

435
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,454
but I'm really bad at it.

436
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:52,414
Just eat. I can grill for us.

437
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:55,234
But you're really bad at it, too.

438
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:58,164
Jin Hee's amazing at grilling meat.

439
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:00,204
Really? She's good at grilling meat?

440
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,664
Yes. She's good at grilling everything.

441
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:05,014
Beef, lamb, pork, and chicken.

442
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,484
She's good at grilling everything.

443
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:09,344
I see.

444
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,734
She's good at grilling meat.

445
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,184
- What else is she good at?
- She's good at everything.

446
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:16,374
She's a good cook, a good athlete,

447
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,284
and she's good at taunting me, too.

448
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:20,884
She was good at studying, too. She was always at the top of her class.

449
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:24,904
- Really?
- I know I gave birth to her, but it's so fascinating.

450
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:30,124
Why do you keep asking about her?

451
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:33,084
I told you not to be curious about her.

452
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:35,644
Yes, sorry.

453
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:38,784
Try doing that again.

454
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,404
Oppa, the meat is burning.

455
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:42,124
Yes.

456
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:47,524
I'm so full!

457
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,284
Let's walk a bit to digest.

458
00:33:50,284 --> 00:33:52,114
Okay.

459
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:57,204
Let's get ice cream, too! It'd help us digest.

460
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,034
Sounds good.

461
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,494
What flavor should I get?

462
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:22,044
Baseball hat and a hoodie.

463
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:36,114
- Let go!
- Bring him over there. Over there.

464
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:39,044
Where do you live? I asked where you lived...

465
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:41,344
Where's Chief Eun?

466
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,784
I think he went out to get blood sausage soup.

467
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:46,344
Okay. Carry on.

468
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:02,154
What?

469
00:36:03,424 --> 00:36:06,414
I beg you, Senior!

470
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:14,354
Hey.

471
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:28,384
- Do you want a blood sausage soup?
- Yes, please.

472
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:30,054
Okay.

473
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:35,844
Is something going on?

474
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:38,364
The park murder.

475
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:41,604
Show me the picture of the suspect.

476
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,174
What for?

477
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:49,404
That suspect...

478
00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:53,014
seems to be following my mom around.

479
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,054
Did you see something?

480
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:01,074
I keep noticing the same man.

481
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:04,844
It's a young man. He wears a baseball hat.

482
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:08,634
I've seen him multiple times already.

483
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:13,054
Okay, just eat the soup.

484
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,414
Why won't you ask me anything?

485
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:25,314
That man is following my mom around.

486
00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:29,154
Won't you ask me why I think that?

487
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:39,974
This is the CCTV footage of the first attempted attack.

488
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:03,654
We couldn't even verify the CCTV footage.

489
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:06,284
We couldn't even get a composite drawing of the suspect, either.

490
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,584
And since the media started talking about it,

491
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:11,394
the HQ protected your mother's identity.

492
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:17,404
That's why the broadcasting company offered a reward to find her.

493
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:20,814
But since the victim died,

494
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:24,674
we had no choice but to interview material witnesses.

495
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:28,294
So I had to see your mother and interview her as a witness.

496
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:30,034
You did?

497
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,644
When?

498
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,814
Mom.

499
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,514
What's going on?

500
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,724
- I told you Park Sang Goo sued him. ight?
- Yes.

501
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:40,044
I'll be interviewed as a witness,

502
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:43,164
but Chief Eun said he'd let me be interviewed here instead.

503
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:45,184
That day?

504
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:48,114
She didn't say anything to me that day.

505
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:50,434
There must be a reason why.

506
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:52,624
It can't be.

507
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:55,314
She's a very simple person.

508
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:59,674
So we don't know if the man from the CCTV is the murder suspect yet. Right?

509
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:01,814
We're looking for him, assuming it's the same person.

510
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:05,484
Although we don't have evidence yet.

511
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:11,324
It's a good thing you didn't let her be exposed.

512
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,694
By the way, why do you keep obsessing over that doctor?

513
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,964
Did you notice something about him?

514
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:44,114
Apparently, he's my father.

515
00:39:45,464 --> 00:39:47,584
Biologically.

516
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,884
Weren't you working a night shift tonight?

517
00:40:04,884 --> 00:40:06,534
I'm off-duty.

518
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:11,284
The whole shift stuff or whatever.

519
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,424
I don't think I'll ever get it.

520
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:16,834
Go ahead and take a shower. You smell.

521
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,654
What smell?

522
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:24,314
Oh, the barbecue smell?

523
00:40:25,444 --> 00:40:28,434
Tell Jin Soo not to pick me up anymore.

524
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,054
I found someone else.

525
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,004
Aren't you going to ask me who?

526
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,804
Who is it?

527
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:44,604
That man.

528
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,394
My first love.

529
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:51,584
Don't get the wrong idea.

530
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,364
We're not dating.

531
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,284
He just helps me commute because he has a car.

532
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:59,724
Okay. Go take a shower.

533
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,224
Aren't you even curious?

534
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:14,334
Why should I be curious about your dating life?

535
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:16,824
Listen to you! Who's dating here?

536
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,984
I said we're not dating.

537
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,484
I told you! He just helps me commute.

538
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,714
Okay.

539
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,004
Okay, so commute without worrying about me.

540
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:30,854
Why would you talk like that? Are you kidding?

541
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,134
Am I funny?

542
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:34,574
Why are you acting mean?

543
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:37,334
To be honest, why do you care who I date?

544
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:40,234
It doesn't concern me? Do you really think that?

545
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:43,944
You never cared before whomever I dated.

546
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:47,044
It's because I don't want to be goldfish poop.

547
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:48,574
Okay?

548
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:51,414
Goldfish poop?

549
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:58,424
Jin Hee's mom, when are we getting your wedding invitation?

550
00:41:58,424 --> 00:42:00,814
I heard you're planning a wedding.

551
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:03,314
I'm not getting married.

552
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,434
We broke up.

553
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,944
Gosh, I knew it.

554
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,104
His family didn't want the kid. Right?

555
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:10,634
It's not like that. Okay?

556
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,614
Come on.

557
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,644
I think this whenever I see you.

558
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:18,424
You're exactly like goldfish.

559
00:42:18,424 --> 00:42:21,114
Goldfish? Why?

560
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:22,664
Just look at this!

561
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:26,584
See how pretty and shiny it is.

562
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:29,834
But look at that poop.

563
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:32,814
It can't even cut that gross thing off on its own.

564
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:35,284
It's destined to be that way.

565
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:36,664
What?

566
00:42:36,664 --> 00:42:40,614
If the goldfish is pretty, the poop must be pretty, too.

567
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:43,574
Jin Hee, you're so pretty!

568
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:45,984
Say, "goldfish poop!"

569
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:48,354
Goldfish poop.

570
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,304
- Hey!
- W-W-What?

571
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,624
Can't you act your age?

572
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:59,204
Let go! Let go!

573
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,974
Don't you know what the appropriate thing is to say?

574
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:03,974
Who are you calling poop?

575
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:05,914
Hold on!

576
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,204
Hey!

577
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:21,914
Why do you remember that?

578
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:25,754
It's just what those ignorant bitches said.

579
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:29,064
You always broke up with your boyfriends because of me.

580
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,334
Isn't that true?

581
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:35,524
Do you know how much I tried to be liked by them?

582
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:39,724
But you used to cry for days after you broke up!

583
00:43:39,724 --> 00:43:42,824
Do you know how old I was when I first noticed it?

584
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:45,184
I was six!

585
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:49,334
Does it still not concern me?

586
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:55,244
Do you know how scared I was whenever you cried?

587
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:57,094
Why would you be scared?

588
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:59,304
Because I might abandon you?

589
00:44:01,214 --> 00:44:04,764
Don't you know how guilty I've felt for being me?

590
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:06,684
That's why I'm good at cooking, studying,

591
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:10,724
and doing housework, so people can't call me goldfish poop!

592
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:18,844
Hold on.

593
00:44:18,844 --> 00:44:20,814
So...

594
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:25,044
you mean you were scared because I might abandon you? Is that what you're saying?

595
00:44:25,044 --> 00:44:26,494
Is that what you're saying?

596
00:44:26,494 --> 00:44:29,464
I'm saying it felt like it was my fault!

597
00:44:29,464 --> 00:44:34,114
I don't want to be treated like goldfish poop by him, too!

598
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,634
If you felt that way,

599
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:42,744
you should have said it, started a fight or made a fuss

600
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:45,174
and resolved it!

601
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:47,874
Why would you bottle that in?

602
00:44:47,874 --> 00:44:50,854
Why would you remember such a thing?

603
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:55,804
You've been closed-minded since you were a kid, just like you-know-who.

604
00:44:55,804 --> 00:44:58,954
Who do you think I resemble? It's probably you.

605
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:00,824
You don't resemble me.

606
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:04,174
You're closed-minded, exactly like him.

607
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:08,664
Why did you live with me all this time, then?

608
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,974
You should've sent me to him.

609
00:45:11,724 --> 00:45:14,034
It would've been good for both of us.

610
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:21,814
Hey, where are you going?

611
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,364
Are you leaving like this? Hey!

612
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:29,994
Jin Hee.

613
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,884
Oh, hello.

614
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:37,484
Oppa?

615
00:45:40,564 --> 00:45:43,754
You left the dessert I got you.

616
00:45:43,754 --> 00:45:46,584
I was just going to leave it in front of the door, but...

617
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,214
Hey! You'd better not leave like this!

618
00:45:51,214 --> 00:45:53,124
Hello.

619
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:55,674
Are you serious?

620
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:01,614
How much did you hear?

621
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:03,804
Well...

622
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,214
I'm sorry.

623
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,124
What? Did you hear everything?

624
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:24,134
You should've screamed if you were in pain.

625
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:28,094
Why were you holding it in? It's frustrating.

626
00:46:29,034 --> 00:46:31,534
I didn't want to scare you.

627
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:43,404
This is how you've been living.

628
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:45,404
It's really old.

629
00:46:45,404 --> 00:46:47,824
No, I like it.

630
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:52,284
I saved up to send Jin Hee to college.

631
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:55,624
But I got to keep it because she went to the police academy.

632
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:58,244
What's the point of keeping money?

633
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:02,474
I bought it by using the security deposit and a loan.

634
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:05,724
You saved up and bought a place, too.

635
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:09,294
You've been living diligently.

636
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,024
Diligently, my foot.

637
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:13,684
I just lived.

638
00:47:13,684 --> 00:47:16,074
I dated a lot, too.

639
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:22,634
One time, I almost got married,

640
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:27,424
but the man's parents didn't want Jin Hee.

641
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:32,494
Mi Jeong and Mom said they'd raise her and told me to leave her.

642
00:47:32,494 --> 00:47:37,544
So I really did think about leaving her

643
00:47:37,544 --> 00:47:39,554
just once.

644
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:43,234
I only thought about it.

645
00:47:44,124 --> 00:47:47,334
But because I didn't want to be apart from her,

646
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:50,324
I called it off.

647
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:56,184
But she remembers that.

648
00:47:57,264 --> 00:47:59,554
She shouldn't have...

649
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,364
What's wrong with me?

650
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:14,534
Why am I talking about this with you?

651
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:17,004
Leave!

652
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,374
What?

653
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:20,944
Don't you know what time it is?

654
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:24,184
Leave!

655
00:48:31,414 --> 00:48:33,384
I must be crazy. Right?

656
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:35,744
How could I say such a thing?

657
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:40,434
Gosh, I must be out of my mind!

658
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,314
By the way,

659
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:45,504
- Ahjumma's first love—
- Keep your mouth shut.

660
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:48,994
I mean, she said he resembled me.

661
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:53,184
Resemble my foot!

662
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:56,934
Right? Did she mean he looked like me when he was a kid?

663
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:02,864
Hey, his facial structure can't resemble yours, no matter how young he was!

664
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:05,334
If that's the case, they need to start a lab and

665
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:07,394
study why he changed so drastically.

666
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:10,224
That's how rare of a case it'd be!

667
00:49:11,844 --> 00:49:14,354
Do you think I'm overreacting right now?

668
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:16,094
No.

669
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:17,664
I'm just telling the truth!

670
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,654
Exactly as I saw!

671
00:49:19,654 --> 00:49:22,144
She must have really poor eyesight!

672
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:23,994
Her memories got so distorted—

673
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,544
So cold! Gosh!

674
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:36,344
Team Leader Kim!

675
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:40,854
Hello!

676
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:42,644
Are you patrolling?

677
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:44,054
Yes.

678
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:45,204
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Pardon?

679
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:47,034
Pardon?

680
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:48,474
Well...

681
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:51,524
Don't we make a nice couple?

682
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:56,874
We'll get going, then! Carry on!

683
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:59,344
Yes, get home safely.

684
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:01,244
See you!

685
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:05,214
I'll pick up some gum real quick.

686
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:06,794
Okay.

687
00:50:13,134 --> 00:50:14,574
Let go!

688
00:50:14,574 --> 00:50:16,294
How dare you...

689
00:50:16,294 --> 00:50:20,194
Why not? We're like family...

690
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:08,964
You saw me cooking.

691
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:12,134
You don't even let me eat whatever I want.

692
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:20,464
It's always the beansprout soup.

693
00:51:20,464 --> 00:51:24,014
I said I wanted dried pollock soup multiple times.

694
00:51:31,694 --> 00:51:34,684
Good morning, everyone...

695
00:51:49,154 --> 00:51:52,194
Hey! I don't need to pick up Ahjumma anymore?

696
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:53,714
- Why?
- No. Hey.

697
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:54,844
I'll cancel the payment.

698
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:56,714
I'll pay your daily wage separately.

699
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:59,714
You can't do... that...

700
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:01,494
Hey, please go home.

701
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,784
You said you'd only stay for three to four days. How long has it been already?

702
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:05,274
Hey.

703
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,814
Can't believe this happened to me.

704
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:10,554
What is it?

705
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:13,984
"You won two nights at a resort"?

706
00:52:13,984 --> 00:52:16,724
With this, I don't have to rely on the publisher.

707
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:19,844
I'll score stuff in Yeosu and save money, too!

708
00:52:19,844 --> 00:52:22,734
Then my bank account will get full soon, too!

709
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:27,114
I might as well start reporting two days in advance!

710
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:31,014
What was the editor's phone number?

711
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:35,784
Jin Soo, what happens if I cancel the card payment right now?

712
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:37,084
You can't.

713
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:39,274
How do you cancel what you won already?

714
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:43,164
Hey, just think about it. In that suite,

715
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:46,244
your share would be one toilet, maybe?

716
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:50,074
No, no. Maybe one tile in the bathroom. Don't you think?

717
00:52:50,074 --> 00:52:52,214
The rest is all mine.

718
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:55,774
Why? Because I paid with my card.

719
00:52:55,774 --> 00:52:57,134
Why are you doing this to me?

720
00:52:57,134 --> 00:52:59,464
What is it that you want?

721
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:03,424
Let's go together. I'll get you a room, at least.

722
00:53:03,424 --> 00:53:05,154
Let me know if you don't want to. I can cancel the payment.

723
00:53:05,154 --> 00:53:08,754
No... Hey! You miserly bastard!

724
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:10,714
You might as well step on me!

725
00:53:10,714 --> 00:53:15,854
Starting today, we'll patrol more frequently during weekdays and at night, too.

726
00:53:15,854 --> 00:53:20,454
The newly included areas are Namchon Trail, the electronics district,

727
00:53:20,454 --> 00:53:23,624
Jangmi Villa area on 19th St.,

728
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:27,334
and Park Sang Goo Orthopedics area on 45th St.

729
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:30,124
That's all. Are there any questions?

730
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,864
Wait...

731
00:53:33,094 --> 00:53:37,964
I'm sorry, but I'd like to take this weekend off.

732
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,434
All of a sudden—

733
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,754
No, it's okay! Use mine.

734
00:53:41,754 --> 00:53:44,004
You can switch with me.

735
00:53:44,964 --> 00:53:50,374
Yes, I-I'll switch with you, too.

736
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:52,394
Thank you!

737
00:53:57,574 --> 00:54:01,444
Mom, I went too far yesterday.

738
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:02,704
I'm sorry.

739
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:05,934
I'll treat you to a trip to Yeosu.

740
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:08,724
♫ I got a glimpse of your smile ♫

741
00:54:08,724 --> 00:54:12,054
Mom, should we go on a trip and get some fresh air?

742
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:14,394
Let's eat tasty food and...

743
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:17,974
♫ Hey, babe, I see everything ♫

744
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:22,584
♫ I'm so quick, I know everything ♫

745
00:54:22,584 --> 00:54:25,854
♫ I was thinking of keeping an eye on you longer ♫

746
00:54:25,854 --> 00:54:28,604
♫ I can't take it anymore ♫

747
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:30,984
Do you want to go to Yeosu? For two nights?

748
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:34,034
♫ Stand by, my eyes are focused ♫

749
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:35,794
♫ Your eyes will be on me ♫

750
00:54:35,794 --> 00:54:39,134
What kind of mom fights with her daughter all the time?

751
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:41,424
What did I do? What's the deal...

752
00:54:41,424 --> 00:54:44,944
♫ Let's get it on and on, baby ♫

753
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:47,994
What? Jin Hee?

754
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,334
Why does she want to go to Yeosu suddenly?

755
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,084
Gosh, what a good kid.

756
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:55,434
How does she apologize so nicely, too?

757
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:57,554
She's better than her own mother.

758
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:59,884
All the nice ones must be dead.

759
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:00,864
Do you want to come, too?

760
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,704
I'm not that dim. Why would I tag along with you?

761
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:07,374
I should give Jin Hee plenty of pocket money.

762
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:10,564
How about me? How about me?

763
00:55:10,564 --> 00:55:12,484
Why would I give you pocket money?

764
00:55:12,484 --> 00:55:14,774
- You must be crazy.
- Seriously...

765
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:17,824
Just reply to her! Say you'd go no matter what!

766
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:23,184
It's not even Jeju Island. Why go to Yeosu?

767
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:25,420
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in!

768
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,300
♫ Ki-ki-kiss me, lo-lo-love me ♫

769
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,494
Here comes Dr. Park!

770
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:34,024
Dr. Park!

771
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:36,294
- You came early.
- Dr. Park!

772
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:39,294
Wait just a moment. We can go up together after I park.

773
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,004
Yes, yes.

774
00:55:42,474 --> 00:55:46,954
Who did that? Who had the guts to take Dr. Park's spot?

775
00:55:46,954 --> 00:55:49,974
Looks like only their car is nice.

776
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:52,634
They're nouveau riche. How ignorant.

777
00:55:52,634 --> 00:55:53,754
You should just let it go.

778
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:56,654
It's better to avoid ignorant people like that.

779
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,134
Just park nearby.

780
00:55:58,134 --> 00:55:59,414
- Shall I?
- Yes!

781
00:55:59,414 --> 00:56:00,824
I should just concede.

782
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,334
- Of course.
- Clear!

783
00:56:02,334 --> 00:56:04,684
We'll look out for you.

784
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:07,454
- Yes, yes, good!
- Keep going! Keep going!

785
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:11,044
Keep going, keep going!

786
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:13,064
Nice, nice!

787
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:18,404
I told him to just keep going.

788
00:56:18,404 --> 00:56:20,974
What was that noise?

789
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:22,874
Gosh! Don't you know how much this costs?

790
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:25,544
How could you drive like that and bump into it?

791
00:56:25,544 --> 00:56:28,474
Gosh, that looks like a really expensive car!

792
00:56:28,474 --> 00:56:30,324
It'd cost him a pretty penny!

793
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:32,044
What will he do?

794
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:34,914
Hold on. Well, hold on.

795
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:36,874
He's so slow! Isn't he?

796
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:38,894
He's driving better now that he's flustered.

797
00:56:38,894 --> 00:56:40,674
He's better. Look at him now.

798
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:44,564
- Why not do it like that before?
- Why hit that car, anyway?

799
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,414
Did I bump into it?

800
00:56:47,414 --> 00:56:48,894
He's a really bad driver.

801
00:56:48,894 --> 00:56:51,004
Oh, no...

802
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:01,064
Are you the owner of this car?

803
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:02,794
Yes.

804
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,864
This is my designated spot.

805
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:07,074
Your car got scratched.

806
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:08,274
Have a look at it.

807
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:11,084
It made a dragging noise!

808
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:14,914
I should be telling her instead.

809
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,714
Thank you for letting me know.

810
00:57:16,714 --> 00:57:19,934
Why did you have to park in my spot, anyway?

811
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:22,684
Don't worry. It's fine.

812
00:57:22,684 --> 00:57:25,594
Pardon? It's fine?

813
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:28,114
Yes. It's fine.

814
00:57:29,674 --> 00:57:31,654
No one got hurt. Right?

815
00:57:31,654 --> 00:57:34,174
- Of course not!
- No!

816
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,614
Have you seen such a rude woman?

817
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:52,744
How generous!

818
00:57:52,744 --> 00:57:54,564
What a cool lady!

819
00:57:54,564 --> 00:57:57,624
I know. How wildly forgiving!

820
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:01,814
Pretty ones tend to have good personalities, too.

821
00:58:01,814 --> 00:58:03,224
Just like me.

822
00:58:03,224 --> 00:58:05,684

823
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:08,554
Gosh! It's because the weather is so grim.

824
00:58:08,554 --> 00:58:12,334
Gosh! Don't say stuff like that!

825
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:15,264
You're making me feel really old!

826
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:18,314
- It must be nice to be young!
