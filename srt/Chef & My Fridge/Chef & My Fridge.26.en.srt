1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,950
Today's fridge owners
are the geniuses of the century!

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,152
Please welcome
Lee Se-dol and Lee Chan-won!

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,054
I'm here to get my revenge
against Chef Tae-hun.

4
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,956
CHINESE MASTER CHEF OF 51 YEARS,
LU CHINGLAI

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,058
He has the most particular appetite.

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,092
I don't eat that.

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,761
I don't eat it as a meal.

8
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,696
I didn't really like it.

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:30,930
What if you had to use one of these?

10
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:31,998
Neither.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,769
We were duped by Se-dol's wife.

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,303
The zero sugar competition.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,905
-My gosh. No.
-No?

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,040
Over there.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,575
-Here's his honest take.
-Oh, no!

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,210
Tofu was just tofu.

17
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,979
-It's a little bland.
-Bland, huh?

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,914
We're here today with a Grim Reaper.

19
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,083
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN WINS

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,118
The octopus competition.

21
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,219
Hey, Se-dol!

22
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,488
This is good.

23
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,790
He said it was good.

24
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,291
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN WINS

25
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,926
Jung Ji-sun!

26
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,728
Her winning streak continues.

27
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,331
-She won all four rounds.
-He has an ironclad appetite.

28
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,500
We're here
with two geniuses of the century,

29
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,602
Lee Se-dol and Lee Chan-won.

30
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,271
Chan-won is already famous

31
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,974
-as a good singer and a show host.
-He's good.

32
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,676
-There's nothing he can't do.
-Thank you.

33
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,713
He received the Grand Award
in the 2024 KBS Entertainment Award.

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,648
It was too generous of them.

35
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:22,849
HUMBLE

36
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,017
It's all thanks to you.

37
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,984
Come on.

38
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:25,885
GO ON, SAY MORE

39
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,088
I learned so much from him.

40
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,490
The way you handled the live broadcast

41
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,026
of the audition program I was in
five or six years ago made news.

42
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,362
The show made a system so that
it could compile 1.5 million votes.

43
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,666
-But over 7.7 million votes came in.
-That's right.

44
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,569
-They couldn't compile it on the day.
-I remember.

45
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,605
But I saw how he handled
the situation for over an hour

46
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,208
and began to respect
the attitude he holds as a show host.

47
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,610
Yes, of course.
He's Chan-won's role model.

48
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,479
Your student won the Grand Award,

49
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,814
-but how come you don't have one?
-Tell me about it.

50
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,517
I really wanted to share this here.

51
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,221
This man named Kim Sung-ju

52
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:06,326
and the achievements and legacy
he left behind to this day

53
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,562
can't be appreciated with a single trophy.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,364
-I knew it.
-He's so eloquent.

55
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,433
If anyone asks
which TV personality I respect the most,

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,735
I have never said any other name

57
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,471
other than the name Kim Sung-ju.

58
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
MOVED

59
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,441
That's why he's here.

60
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,911
Gosh, I didn't know that was the case.

61
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,980
Please make everything
extra delicious for him.

62
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,716
PLEASE DO A GREAT JOB FOR HIM

63
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,452
And don't edit out anything he just said.

64
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,454
-Please air it all.
-Get them on air.

65
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,025
Chan-won is also nicknamed Chanto-wiki

66
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,760
and even ChanphaGo.

67
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,029
It means he's well-informed
in many different fields,

68
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,832
-and he has a great memory.
-He knows a lot of things.

69
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,134
When he performs
at different local festivals,

70
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,238
I hear he has a secret
to capturing the local audience's hearts.

71
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,606
How is that done?

72
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:58,611
First of all, I study everything
about that local event or festival.

73
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:03,349
My most recent one was in Danyang,
Mount Sobaek Azalea Festival.

74
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,318
Danyang is known
for its eight great views,

75
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,686
so I memorized those.

76
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,889
Sangseon Hermitage,
Jungseon Hermitage, Haseon Hermitage,

77
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,592
Sain Hermitage, Dodam Three Peaks,
Oksun Peak, Gudam Peak,

78
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,694
and lastly, Seongmun Natural Arch.
I memorized all eight.

79
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,798
Then I greet them saying,
"Hello, people of Danyang,

80
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,867
a beauty surrounded by Namhan River
full of the spirit of Mount Sobaek.

81
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,603
It's great to have eight great views
welcome me on this day.

82
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,206
Hello, my name is Lee Chan-won!"

83
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,540
-You have to go that far?
-Yes.

84
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,309
Let's say I went
to Gyeongbuk Sports Festival.

85
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,513
I memorize all 10 cities
and 12 counties in the jurisdiction.

86
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,016
I believe there are
a total of 22 local districts in total.

87
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,552
"Raise your hand if you're from Gyeongju!

88
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,154
Who's from Sangju?

89
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,657
Uljin! Yeongdeok! Yeongcheon!
Gyeongsan! Chilgok!" I mention it all.

90
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,793
HE CALLS OUT ALL 22 DISTRICTS
WITHOUT LEAVING A SINGLE ONE OUT

91
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,495
-That's impressive.
-Chan-won is ambitious.

92
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,964
-That's amazing.
-That's impressive.

93
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,068
Have you done research
on the chefs before you came today?

94
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,204
I actually didn't need to do that.

95
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,474
-Because I already know everyone.
-I see.

96
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,409
-He was born in the Year of the Mouse.
-That's right.

97
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,479
-The Year of the Horse.
-Yes, that's right.

98
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,481
-I believe he's another horse.
-Yes.

99
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,782
He should be a pig,

100
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,517
-but he was born early as a dog.
-Yes, I'm a dog.

101
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,152
You were born in the Year of the Pig.

102
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,890
He's the same age as my father,
so the Year of the Mouse, 1960.

103
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,627
-He should be a cow, but he's also…
-A mouse.

104
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,061
Yes, he was born early too.

105
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,396
-He was born early.
-And a monkey.

106
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,732
-A <i>jannabi</i>.
-The Year of the Monkey.

107
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,767
How does he know
the word "<i>jannabi</i>" for monkey?

108
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,702
The Italian knows his animal sign too?

109
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,773
-We should learn from him.
-Let's find out what it's like

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,708
when he's performing at a festival.

111
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,011
-Can you show us an example?
-Really?

112
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,545
-Yes, of course.
-Okay.

113
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,748
-Please come to the stage.
-Yes, all right.

114
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,982
All right, now.

115
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,752
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> Festival.

116
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,754
There are so many of you here.

117
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,957
You're here at the first
JTBC <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> Festival.

118
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,093
Please welcome
our special guest performer.

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,662
The prince of trot music,

120
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,064
please welcome Lee Chan-won!

121
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,165
PRINCE OF TROT MUSIC, LEE CHAN-WON!

122
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,566
IN A FRENZY

123
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,068
Chan-won is here!

124
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:07,206
Hello, the history began
on November 17th, 2014.

125
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,475
The deeply beloved <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>

126
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,943
broke the silence after five years

127
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,380
and has returned to you in December 2024.

128
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,581
The dates are accurate.

129
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,850
-A makeover project
-He's good.

130
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,385
for your most unhinged leftovers.

131
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,955
You're here at <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
with amazing chefs

132
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,357
and fantastic show hosts.

133
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,761
Today, Lee Se-dol, the Go genius,
and myself, Lee Chan-won are here as well.

134
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,897
Let me start off with "Jintobaegi"!

135
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,334
-He's so good.
-You're really good.

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,368
He really did that.

137
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,869
-He's on fire.
-He did it.

138
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,305
-He's the king of festivals.
-That was crazy.

139
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,508
That's why people love trot music.
It makes you feel so good.

140
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,210
Even the Italian is feeling it.

141
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,579
It makes you excited.

142
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,848
-Exactly.
-I just got started.

143
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,149
It hits me with energy.

144
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,151
That's why he's the most wanted singer

145
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,187
-for events and festivals.
-Makes sense.

146
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,355
So what's the next song?

147
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,225
After all, this is a cooking show.

148
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,029
It's time to look through
Chan-won's fridge.

149
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,630
You live alone, right?

150
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,067
Yes, I moved to Seoul alone
and live alone at the moment.

151
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,104
I recently moved,
and the place has a built-in fridge.

152
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,138
-Right.
-Right.

153
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,708
-So I couldn't bring the fridge.
-Of course.

154
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,809
But it's all in here, right?

155
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,611
Yes, of course. I brought everything.

156
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,913
He goes around the country
to perform at festivals,

157
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,149
-so he may have lots of local ingredients.
-You're right.

158
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,250
Let's take a look.

159
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,819
-Let's open Chan-won's fridge!
-Chan-won's fridge!

160
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,756
WOW

161
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,758
-It's full.
-There's lots of food, right?

162
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,327
-There is.
-Yes, I have a lot.

163
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,862
Last week was really rough.

164
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,497
IF WE MAY GET STARTED ON SE-DOL…

165
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,465
I don't really enjoy eating them.

166
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,200
-Neither.
-What?

167
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,136
-I don't eat fried food, either.
-No fried food?

168
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,906
He's a full-on isolationist of food
in the world of Go.

169
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,776
-Last week was rough.
-It was.

170
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,712
-First of all, the top shelf.
-What's that?

171
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,981
-You must've dried something.
-That's right.

172
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,449
-Yes.
-It's dried bracken.

173
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,885
-Do you dry them before you eat them?
-Bracken?

174
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,321
-How do you eat it?
-That'll make the texture meatier.

175
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,658
That's why you can use that
instead of meat to make <i>yukgaejang</i>.

176
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,494
-It'll add that meaty texture.
-Exactly.

177
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,296
At times, I stir-fry them too.

178
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,533
Do you like to cook for yourself at home?

179
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,936
-I really don't like to eat alone.
-I see.

180
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,840
I've never gone out and eaten alone.

181
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,109
I only eat alone
when I have no choice but to do so.

182
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:27,413
-I call my friends and colleagues to eat.
-You call them over.

183
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,681
-So…
-I only eat alone.

184
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,550
If a friend has to leave
for mandatory military service

185
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,918
or a birthday coming up,

186
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,820
I'd make a feast for them
with over 20 dishes.

187
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,456
<i>-Over 20 dishes?</i>
<i>-He's a cook.</i>

188
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,591
<i>It makes me very happy.</i>

189
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,828
-This guy loves Korean cuisine.
-Yes, I love Korean cuisine.

190
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,764
-I see dishes that are boiled down.
-Pickles.

191
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,233
I got that from Eunhyuk of Super Junior.
His mom made that.

192
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,035
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

193
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,803
Eunhyuk's mother

194
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,406
-adores me very much.
-I see.

195
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,109
-All those pickles are from his mother.
-I see.

196
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,879
-Perilla leaves and all?
-I like pickles and salted seafood.

197
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,684
Wait a moment. This must've been staged.

198
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,519
-I think so too.
-Right?

199
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,488
-Someone must've said something.
-What is it?

200
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,623
-I found caviar.
-Caviar?

201
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,359
I had a housewarming party
with all my friends.

202
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,763
I made everything that I served.

203
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,500
But I made the dishes to my taste,
so I thought some might not like it.

204
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,668
So I got the idea to make some canapés,

205
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,606
and we had that and cream cheese together.

206
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,808
It's not the expensive kind.

207
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,109
The fake caviar.

208
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,345
-It's not real?
-What's the difference?

209
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,747
Sturgeon roes are black,

210
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,617
-but those have been colored black.
-Yes, it was colored.

211
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,418
It was made to look like caviar.

212
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,420
The price difference is insane.

213
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,388
What about the taste?

214
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,156
-It's completely different.
-It's different.

215
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,559
My friends don't know
what they're eating anyway.

216
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,262
-They thought it was caviar. Good, then.
-Of course.

217
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,098
I see more Korean side dishes.

218
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,033
-That's seasoned bok choy.
-Seasoned bok choy.

219
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,003
The one over there
is stir-fried mushroom. I made it.

220
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,405
-You did?
-You made this yourself?

221
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,606
I found this too.

222
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,911
That's the green onion cream cheese I made
to have canapés with my friends.

223
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,747
I see. Green onion cream cheese.
That sounds like a Gen Z thing.

224
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,249
He made all three of these.

225
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,553
Just throw in
some green onions and allulose,

226
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,454
and season with salt and pepper.

227
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:20,059
I add some Greek yogurt when I have some
to make it taste sweeter.

228
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,595
-I didn't have any, so I didn't use it.
-What's wrong?

229
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,997
-Why? Is yogurt too sweet for you?
-No.

230
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,165
It's not that.

231
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,635
It's a mix of the things I can't eat.

232
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,306
-He put those together and made a dish.
-Cream cheese.

233
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,840
Green onion cream cheese.

234
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,076
-It's green onion cream cheese.
-There's also allulose.

235
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,378
Just do the opposite
of what you did last week.

236
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,546
That's right.

237
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,715
-It's great with a bagel.
-It's delicious.

238
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,550
Can we try this?

239
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,986
Did I bring… Yes, they're right here!

240
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,054
-Crackers?
-What is it?

241
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,989
-Crackers.
-Crackers?

242
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,558
-Oh, with the crackers.
-Yes.

243
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,227
-He'll put it together.
-Why don't we have

244
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,629
Se-dol judge Chan-won's cooking?

245
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,199
This is only made of the things he hates.

246
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,201
It's not a bad idea to try it.

247
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,302
Shall I?

248
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,471
Gen Z kids love it.

249
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,274
-That's how much I put on top.
-Oh, this much?

250
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,210
-Put it on his dish.
-I'd like less than that.

251
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,280
Come on, try some.

252
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,483
DONE IN ONE BITE

253
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,986
-It's good.
-You should try it.

254
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,888
-Taste it on behalf of our viewers.
-It's delicious.

255
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,725
It's on behalf of our viewers.

256
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,159
A TINY BITE

257
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,696
-That was barely a bite!
-You didn't eat anything.

258
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,200
-Isn't it still as good as new?
-You only had this much.

259
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,169
-I ate too much in the previous episode.
-The previous one?

260
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,239
-I'm still full from that.
-You're a TV personality now.

261
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,408
How was it, though? Honestly.

262
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,743
It's delicious.

263
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,150
-He's a TV personality now.
-He's a funny one.

264
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,786
-It's good.
-Yes, it's good.

265
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,555
-It's really good.
-Really? Thank you.

266
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,791
I love the texture of the green onion.

267
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,694
-It tastes just perfectly sweet.
-You're right.

268
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,595
Thank you.

269
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,965
Did you buy this gochujang
or is it homemade?

270
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,335
No, I was recently in Hongseong,
South Chungcheong Province.

271
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,771
-That place is famous for strawberries.
-Right.

272
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,973
So that's actually strawberry gochujang.

273
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,508
-Strawberry gochujang?
-Strawberry gochujang?

274
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,610
-It smells like strawberries.
-Doesn't it?

275
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,079
One of the locals
gave it to me as a present.

276
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,081
Oh, right! You don't eat gochujang!

277
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,216
-No, I do. I eat it.
-Strawberry gochujang.

278
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,819
-Please try strawberry gochujang.
-It's made with strawberries.

279
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,888
WHY WOULD ANYONE PUT STRAWBERRIES IN?

280
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,090
I'm curious to see his reaction.

281
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,494
His appetite is already accustomed
to his wife's cooking,

282
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,930
so that can't change overnight.

283
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,765
He has lots of vegetables.

284
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,934
I probably have lots of mushrooms.

285
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,903
-King oyster mushroom.
-Yes, king oyster mushroom.

286
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:44,837
This is shiitake.

287
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,839
-Do you like mushrooms?
-I love them.

288
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,075
I see all kinds of sauces on this side.

289
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,110
What's your favorite?

290
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,646
-Mayonnaise. I love mayo.
-Mayonnaise.

291
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,848
-I see.
-He loves mayonnaise.

292
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,350
If I were told to dip
everything I eat in mayo,

293
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,618
I could gladly do that.

294
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,787
Se-dol and I have nothing in common!

295
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,355
RESPONDING WITH A SMILE

296
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,357
How did you two
end up coming here together?

297
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,761
They'd probably never eat together
even if they met.

298
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,330
-Se-dol doesn't like all sauces.
-He doesn't.

299
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,365
Chan-won loves mayonnaise.

300
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,868
-The top shelf of the freezer.
-There should be something.

301
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,505
-I see some innards. Is this tripe?
-Tripe.

302
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,207
It's tripe, pork tripe.

303
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:25,211
It's actually the last portion
of the pork intestine.

304
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,113
My parents ran
a tripe restaurant for 20 years.

305
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,248
-I see.
-I remember that.

306
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,085
He has two kinds of tripe.
One is boiled and the other is raw.

307
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,420
You're right.

308
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:39,792
If any of the chefs end up
using tripe today,

309
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,428
the boiled one is already cleaned,
so you should go for that.

310
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,997
-He's considerate of the chefs.
-So considerate.

311
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,465
-Yes.
-He is.

312
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,602
I see some marinated crabs
on the second shelf of the freezer.

313
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,970
Yes, I have marinated crabs.

314
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,472
-Marinated crabs? It sounds good.
-Wait, this is Ho-young.

315
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,341
-Do you like marinated crabs?
-I do.

316
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,844
-And lots of meat here, all lined up.
-That's right.

317
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,047
-Chicken, no, drumsticks.
-He has chicken too.

318
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,283
-Both pork and beef.
-Pork belly.

319
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,452
-He has everything.
-You feed yourself well.

320
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,521
Room temperature ingredients.

321
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,823
-You have some noodles.
-He has lots of <i>ramyeon</i>.

322
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,259
Hey, wait. I found <i>taucu</i>, soybean sauce.

323
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,727
He has <i>taucu</i>?

324
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,830
If you add a spoon
when you use <i>chunjang</i>, black bean paste,

325
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,131
it brings out the savory taste.

326
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,300
How does he know that?

327
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,835
Do you make black bean sauce?

328
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,272
I do. I make it with starch water and all.

329
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,907
-Oh wow.
-I throw in a lot of sugar.

330
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,375
He must really love Chinese food.

331
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,776
I really do.

332
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,379
Wait, there's sugar in <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

333
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,847
Do you not eat <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

334
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,148
Almost never.

335
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,751
My gosh.

336
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,588
You have to try his food today.
How will you deal with this?

337
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,223
CHUCKLING

338
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,793
I'll just cook some <i>ramyeon </i>or something.

339
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,062
That was all for Chan-won's fridge!

340
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,765
FINISHED LOOKING THROUGH CHAN-WON'S FRIDGE

341
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,401
Let's find out what Chan-won ordered today

342
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,703
and who'll fight against whom.

343
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,405
Let us begin.

344
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,874
Here's Chan-won's order.

345
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,008
Please show us!

346
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,278
-Authentic Chinese cuisine.
-Chinese cuisine.

347
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,780
-Chinese cuisine.
-It's perfect for you.

348
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,782
Tell us why you ordered this.

349
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,184
-I've never been to China.
-Really?

350
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,586
Not to the mainland.

351
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,322
I wanted to have a taste

352
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:20,092
of authentic Chinese cuisine,
something I could eat in China.

353
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,628
-The food is different on the mainland.
-Indeed.

354
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,598
What's the next order?

355
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,334
-Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and tripe!
-Tripe?

356
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,170
-Tripe?
-What are you looking for?

357
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:35,241
Whenever I had tripe, I only had it
either grilled or stir-fried.

358
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,976
I wondered how else it could be cooked.

359
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,180
I want to eat a tripe dish
I've never had before

360
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,282
-in fine dining style.
-Something fancy.

361
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,584
That sounds so hard. Tripe smells strong.

362
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,052
THE HARDEST ORDER YET,
FINE DINING TRIPE DISH

363
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,354
Tripe in fine dining style.

364
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,689
There are two Chinese chefs

365
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,491
-and two fine-dining chefs.
-Two and two.

366
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,493
Chef Chinglai,
you can make the choice first.

367
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,798
I want to let Chan-won taste
authentic Chinese food today.

368
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,933
Authentic Chinese cuisine.

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,768
THE GRAND MASTER OF CHINESE CUISINE
CHOOSES AUTHENTIC CHINESE CUISINE

370
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,771
He knows what authentic Chinese food is.

371
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,972
So could it be?

372
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,974
The choice is in Tae-hun's hands.

373
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,943
Will it become a return match?

374
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,380
Will he run away?
Or will he accept the return match?

375
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,481
I would've fled.

376
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,284
-Accept it.
-I honestly want to avoid this.

377
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,520
But I'm not going to get
another chance like this.

378
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,289
With that being said,

379
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,058
I'll join Chef Chinglai today.

380
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,660
He accepts the challenge.

381
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,228
A RETURN MATCH IS COMING RIGHT UP

382
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,430
-I have to be the judge of this?
-We'll use this chance

383
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,265
to settle the record once and for all.

384
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,068
-It won't be easy to decide.
-I'll end up in a tight spot.

385
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,605
Then tripe dishes in fine dining style
automatically go to these two.

386
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,174
-I don't have a choice.
-You don't.

387
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,542
Choi Hyun-suk versus Fabri.

388
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,745
-I wanted to avoid him on this show.
-Why?

389
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,914
He hurts my ears.

390
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,316
-He's talkative.
-I'm too loud?

391
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,084
ALREADY TIRED

392
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,652
ME?

393
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,354
-All right. Do that later.
-Stop fighting.

394
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,855
-You're in trouble!
-Please don't fight.

395
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,892
-He'll have to keep explaining himself.
-It's an emergency for him.

396
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,927
All right, now.

397
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,029
Let us begin the rounds
with Chan-won's ingredients!

398
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:12,271
This is the first round
with ingredients from Chan-won's fridge.

399
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:17,142
Chef Lu Chinglai, the world-renowned
grand master Chinese cuisine chef,

400
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,880
is up against Chef Lim Tae-hun,
trained only in Korea, aka Self-Made Chef.

401
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,949
This is a return match.

402
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,119
The two chefs
have reunited here on the show.

403
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,556
Chef Chinglai
is such a significant figure in the field.

404
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,726
He's the vice chairman
of the China Cuisine Association,

405
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,929
as well as the chairman
of the Korea China Cuisine Association.

406
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,530
-Unbelievable.
-His titles are impressive.

407
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,165
My gosh, the associations.

408
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,301
-Chef Tae-hun holds a title too.
-What is it?

409
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,437
The vice chairman of the Korean Chinese
Food Culture Exchange Association.

410
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,342
-The chairman versus the vice chairman.
-That's right.

411
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,044
The loser should just step down.

412
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,379
WILL THEY BET THEIR TITLES TOO?

413
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,180
-Betting their titles.
-Exactly.

414
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,049
That'll cause so much trouble for me.

415
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,251
Why? You were so high-spirited last time.

416
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,954
LAST TIME, HE WAS SURE
HE COULD COOK AND DELIVER IN 15 MINUTES

417
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,323
He says he can deliver in 15 minutes.

418
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,226
But I'm here with Chef Chinglai.

419
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,627
Yes, he's your opponent.

420
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,731
I first began my business
before I had proper training.

421
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,866
I didn't have a mentor,

422
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,970
so I studied to fill that void
by reading Chef Chinglai's book.

423
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,606
-He taught himself.
-Yes.

424
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,207
You couldn't even meet him.

425
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,778
So I had always considered him
as my mentor at heart.

426
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,847
Actually, Chef Chinglai
must feel more pressured.

427
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,182
-That's true.
-That's right.

428
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,884
-He lost in <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.
-He already lost.

429
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,585
If he loses again today,

430
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,221
I'm not sure how we'll have to react.

431
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,991
I think I just need to focus
on making my food.

432
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,760
I'll humbly accept the result,
no matter how this battle ends.

433
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,431
-That's Lu Chinglai.
-Of course.

434
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,632
That's his class.

435
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,001
I received a report on Chef Tae-hun.

436
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,469
-What is it?
-All right.

437
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,805
-This report was made by Chef Nam-no.
-Okay.

438
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,874
HOSHI and WOOZI visited last week, right?

439
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,176
Of SEVENTEEN, yes.

440
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,245
They kept saying he looked like Wi Ha-jun.

441
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,347
How did you convince those kind boys?

442
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,349
-Come on, Tae-hun.
-What?

443
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,384
EXCUSE ME, TAE-HUN

444
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,753
-There's a resemblance.
-I can see it.

445
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,822
But the outer edge
is flowing down a little more.

446
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,390
WI HA-JUN LOOKALIKE
FOR THE FIRST 3 SECONDS

447
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,092
His eyes are slanted down.

448
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,628
I'm not sure how Wi Ha-jun
would feel about that.

449
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,997
Se-dol, last week,

450
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,567
<i>you kept an eye</i>
<i>on Chan-won's five-minute check.</i>

451
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,001
I wanted to go out too.

452
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,369
Do you want to go with me?

453
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,404
You should go with him.

454
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,805
Do you want to go out this time?

455
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,408
-Sure, I'll go.
-Yes, with Sung-ju.

456
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,443
Are you looking forward to this round?

457
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,513
-I've been to China numerous times.
-Of course.

458
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,547
You're right.

459
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,317
-There are lots of Go players in China.
-Yes.

460
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,254
I've had lots of authentic Chinese food,
so I'm looking forward to it.

461
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,989
When I ask you about the region,

462
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,091
can you go, "It's from Zhangjiajie"?

463
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,259
SHY

464
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,561
-You've been to many places in China.
-I'll do that.

465
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,498
CHEF TAE-HUN'S INGREDIENTS: SOYBEAN PASTE,
KING OYSTER MUSHROOM, WOOD EAR MUSHROOM,

466
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,566
NAPA CABBAGE, SHIITAKE, PORK BELLY,
SHISHITO PEPPER, CHUNJANG, SOFT TOFU

467
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,535
Chef Tae-hun, what's your dish called?

468
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,303
The dish I'm making is…

469
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,474
Who Ordered Double-Cooked Pork?

470
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,710
-Double-cooked pork?
-Yes.

471
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,945
-Who Ordered Double-Cooked Pork?
-You're making double-cooked pork.

472
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,782
It's the recipe
on page 172 of Chef Chinglai's book.

473
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,886
He probably read that book
like it was the Bible.

474
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,921
-He remembers the page number.
-It's there.

475
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,623
It's the Chinese restaurant's equivalent
of spicy stir-fried pork.

476
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,924
-Chinese stir-fried pork.
-Yes.

477
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,059
It's not spicy,
but it's often eaten in Sichuan.

478
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,027
That sounds great.

479
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,330
You'll have to boil the pork first.
Will you have enough time?

480
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,233
He has to boil it, fry it,
stir-fry it, and add peppers.

481
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,704
I'm going to add my twists
to make the double-cooked pork.

482
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,474
-I'll also make a cold salad.
-Two dishes?

483
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,808
-Cold salad?
-A cold salad too?

484
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,945
-I'm going to make a cold soft tofu salad.
-Tofu salad?

485
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,014
-Have you ever had double-cooked pork?
-Have you had it before?

486
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,749
No, I've never had it.

487
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,185
It's my first time, so it'll be new.

488
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,253
Se-dol, you've had it, right?

489
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,155
Yes, I have.

490
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,158
But I don't remember
enjoying it very much.

491
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,561
-Did you have it in China?
-I did.

492
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,363
I think that'll probably change today.

493
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,865
I hope it does.

494
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,801
CHEF CHINGLAI'S INGREDIENTS: NAPA CABBAGE,
PICKLED VICTORY ONION, PICKLED PEPPERS,

495
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,870
PICKLED PERILLA LEAVES, SHISHITO PEPPER,
CHUCK FLAP TAIL, OYSTER SAUCE, AND MORE

496
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,906
I wonder what Chef Chinglai is making.

497
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,743
-I named it Grand Chow Mein Master.
-"Grand Chow Mein Master."

498
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,214
Chow mein is a type of stir-fried noodles.

499
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,383
<i>Each region in China</i>
<i>has a different type of chow mein.</i>

500
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,851
<i>It differs according to the region.</i>

501
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,386
<i>Most people make the Beijing style.</i>

502
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,989
I saw some instant noodles,

503
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,958
so I'll boil them and fry them,

504
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,760
and then make a spicy stir-fry,
which I'm sure you'll love.

505
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,897
I also saw some pickled vegetables,

506
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,833
so I'll chop some onion
and serve it like <i>zha cai</i>

507
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,835
for you to eat on the side.

508
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,770
-I see.
-I'm already excited.

509
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,173
All right, then.

510
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,410
Let's begin the round and make
authentic Chinese cuisine for Chan-won.

511
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,115
He's here to establish the failing order
in the world of Chinese cuisine.

512
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,951
Chef Lu Chinglai, the living legend.

513
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,454
This man is here to hold the legend back.

514
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,289
The Wi Ha-jun of <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

515
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,824
PROBABLY NOT WI HA-JUN, MAYBE HALF HA-JUN…

516
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,492
That was harsh.

517
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,462
Chef Lim Tae-hun is up against him.

518
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,565
Who'll become
the most authentic Chinese chef?

519
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,369
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

520
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,107
BOWING IN 90 DEGREES

521
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,975
HE GREETS HIS MENTOR BEFORE HE BEGINS

522
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,211
He begins by showing his respect.

523
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,912
Tae-hun shows his respect.

524
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,914
-Red pepper powder.
-Red pepper powder goes in right away.

525
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,483
Chili oil. Yes, right.

526
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,786
GREEN ONION

527
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,788
ONION

528
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,190
He's making chili oil.

529
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,094
It doesn't matter who the master
and the student are in a battle.

530
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,796
Those are pickled veggies.

531
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,665
Oh, are they?

532
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,799
Who made those again?

533
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,702
-It's from Eunhyuk's mother.
-Eunhyuk's mother.

534
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,737
Pickled peppers
and pickled perilla leaves.

535
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,974
CHOP CHOP CHOP

536
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,344
If you look at Chef Chinglai,

537
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,713
he does everything slowly
like he's doing tai chi.

538
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,882
He moves so slowly and smoothly.

539
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,017
-Like a chef at a luxurious hotel.
-Exactly.

540
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,219
He chops quietly too.

541
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,922
-It usually makes a big sound.
-Right, it's very quiet.

542
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,591
-He chops quietly like Western cuisine.
-My gosh.

543
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,126
THE USUAL CHOPPING

544
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,362
CHOPPING EVERYTHING LOUDLY

545
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,765
-He does everything so gently.
-He does.

546
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,169
Many people have put on shows
by using those Chinese kitchen knives,

547
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,303
but he's very gentle.

548
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,039
He also hits the mushrooms quietly too.

549
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,708
-He's rather relaxed.
-He is.

550
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,410
CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP

551
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,979
He's loud, but he's quiet.

552
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,816
-It suddenly became loud.
-Yes, Tae-hun.

553
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,287
They're using the same ingredients.
It's the same.

554
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,657
And he learned to do this
by reading Chef Chinglai's book.

555
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,960
If you think about it,
Chef Chinglai is fighting himself.

556
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,929
-You're right.
-With his clone.

557
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,297
Exactly.

558
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,466
THE MASTER CUTS NAPA CABBAGE

559
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,368
SO THE STUDENT DOES THE SAME

560
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,402
It looks similar.

561
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,239
But Chef Chinglai has so much composure.

562
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,707
He's relaxed.

563
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,577
-He's full of charisma.
-Exactly.

564
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,679
-Is that bok choy?
-It is.

565
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,347
He's using bok choy.

566
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,450
Chinese cuisine
is a little different from others.

567
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,320
-You always prepare the ingredients first.
-That's right.

568
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,458
Chef Chinglai is chopping
all the pickled veggies right now.

569
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,461
-They've been chopping for five minutes.
-You're right.

570
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,764
They get the ingredients ready first.

571
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,265
Chef Chinglai

572
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,033
does the best performance with his knife.

573
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,301
Do you have something for us?

574
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,404
ONE FOR THE FANS

575
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,273
TURNING IT ONCE

576
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,242
TURNING IT TWICE

577
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,914
Are you watching this, Tae-hun?

578
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,383
Doing that made me lose my track.

579
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,551
-My gosh.
-It's so cool.

580
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,154
-Please do not try this at home.
-No.

581
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,023
He's now chopping the meat
for the double-cooked pork.

582
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,260
It's as thin as paper.

583
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,162
You're right. It's very thin.

584
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,763
IT'S NOT EASY TO CUT PORK BELLY

585
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,000
-He's really good at that.
-It's not easy to do.

586
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,536
Usually, you'd slice the pork
after it's boiled.

587
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,371
-But he's slicing it raw.
-Right.

588
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,941
I think he'll slice it thinly
and cook it in his own style.

589
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,043
Are you going to deep-fry it right away
instead of boiling it first?

590
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,445
Yes, I'm going to fry it right away.

591
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,712
He has to do it quickly.

592
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,048
-Yes, he's cutting down on time.
-That's spicy stir-fried pork.

593
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,218
<i>-Ramyeon </i>noodles?
-Yes.

594
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,720
-He has to make chow mein.
-With <i>ramyeon </i>noodles?

595
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,356
I don't have enough time
to make noodles from scratch.

596
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,193
You have 11 minutes left.

597
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:25,664
It looks like Se-dol is only concerned
about the five-minute check.

598
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,265
No, it's not that. Oh, wait.

599
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,902
-I have to go, right?
-Keep that in your mind.

600
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,605
1. CHOP GREEN ONION, GARLIC,
WOOD EAR MUSHROOM, AND SHISHITO PEPPERS

601
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,040
Tae-hun has quick hands.

602
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,042
-Are those wood ear mushrooms?
-Yes.

603
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:38,910
Shishito peppers.

604
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,979
He has to prepare the ingredients first.

605
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,148
-Then he'll cook everything in a flash.
-Yes.

606
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,950
What's he doing now?

607
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,919
-The double-cooked pork.
-He's deep-frying the pork.

608
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,621
He wanted to cut down the time.

609
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,456
It'd take too long if he boiled it whole.

610
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,391
-Right.
-He decided to velvet it and fry it.

611
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,927
Can he make double-cooked pork
in just 15 minutes?

612
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,663
-Can he recreate the flavors?
-I wonder.

613
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,033
DROP?

614
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,235
What?

615
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,836
-What? Into iced water?
-That's iced water.

616
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,471
-Iced water?
-Into iced water?

617
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,707
-The fried pork?
-Yes.

618
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,242
Wouldn't it become weird?

619
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,677
-If he does that…
-It'd become soggy, no?

620
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,313
-It'll shrink and become chewy.
-You're right.

621
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,549
-It'll make it chewy.
-You're right.

622
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:18,950
THE NOODLES ARE COOKED

623
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,118
And the noodles for the chow mein.

624
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,455
He's going to use <i>ramyeon </i>noodles
to make chow mein.

625
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,191
Chef Chinglai is… Are you frying them?

626
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,492
BACK INTO THE OIL?

627
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,761
He just boiled <i>ramyeon </i>noodles…

628
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,763
If he fries them,
they'll become raw <i>ramyeon </i>again.

629
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,332
-Exactly.
-It's already made by deep-frying.

630
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,934
THE REINCARNATING RAMYEON PHILOSOPHY(?)

631
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,335
It's like reversed <i>ramyeon</i>.

632
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,737
Yes, you're right.

633
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,141
I wanted to brown them a little
and give them a crunchy texture.

634
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,210
I love that texture.

635
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,681
I think the <i>ramyeon </i>noodles
became raw again.

636
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,683
It went back to its uncooked state.

637
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,385
If it's too crunchy,
he can boil them again.

638
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,519
Boil them again?

639
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,555
-And again?
-Reversed <i>ramyeon</i>.

640
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,224
-He'll keep reversing them?
-The texture changes.

641
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,226
-Do you not trust him?
-It's like red ginseng.

642
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,095
It's not that.
I've just never seen that before.

643
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,866
They became raw <i>ramyeon </i>noodles again!

644
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,735
-It's just like this now.
-They're the same!

645
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,737
No, that's not the case.

646
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,940
It's crunchier in a different way.

647
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,007
Is that so?

648
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,076
He's still composed.

649
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,215
2. OIL PAN AND STIR-FRY CHUCK FLAP TAIL,
SHISHITO PEPPERS, AND SOY SAUCE

650
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,650
ADDING THE SMOKY FLAVOR

651
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,652
He begins the fire show!

652
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,689
-Chef Chinglai's fire show!
-It's a show!

653
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,725
Chef Chinglai looks so chill.

654
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,330
He's done preparing the ingredients,
and he's starting to cook.

655
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,232
3. BOIL VEGGIES, RED PEPPER POWDER, WATER,
OYSTER SAUCE, BLACK PEPPER TO MAKE SAUCE

656
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,635
-It already looks delicious to the eyes.
-Indeed.

657
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,705
Chef Chinglai's dish looks good as is.

658
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,639
Indeed.

659
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,608
-There's the soft tofu.
-He's working on the soft tofu.

660
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,809
For the cold salad, right?

661
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,577
How is he going to make that?

662
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,645
Why is he dropping it in there?

663
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,614
-He put it in water.
-The tofu goes into the water.

664
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,583
-He's chopping the tofu in the water.
-I see.

665
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,119
-Is there a reason?
-To maintain its shape.

666
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,855
-In case it gets crushed.
-He wants to keep the shape.

667
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,090
In case it gets crushed?

668
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,426
Soft tofu is too soft,
so he's doing that to keep its shape.

669
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,695
-So this is his technique.
-Yes, it usually gets crushed.

670
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,063
I see.

671
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,131
It's like mozzarella.

672
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,766
Yes, it's like mozzarella.

673
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,368
SLAM

674
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,703
4. FINELY CHOP GARLIC,
CHILI PEPPER, AND GREEN ONION

675
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,271
Tae-hun is moving very fast.

676
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,507
He's making two cuts first.

677
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,909
It's not easy to chop chili peppers.

678
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,545
I thought he already chopped
the green onions, but he's using more.

679
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,348
I think it's for something else.
He's chopping these very thinly.

680
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,283
He's making the salad sauce.

681
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,952
I see.

682
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,387
SOY SAUCE

683
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,022
VINEGAR

684
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,224
TREMBLING

685
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,127
-Why are you trembling so much?
-Why?

686
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,095
His hands are shaking violently.

687
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,165
Why are you trembling so much?
What's the matter?

688
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,068
-He's so nervous.
-What's wrong?

689
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,170
-His hands are shaking a lot.
-Tae-hun looks nervous!

690
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:53,738
He's nervous.

691
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,707
SOY SAUCE

692
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,942
-Is that sugar?
-Yes!

693
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,078
-We need sugar!
-That's it!

694
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,080
-He needs to use sugar.
-Yes.

695
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,649
I feel so much better.

696
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,786
Everyone, isn't it nice to live in a world
where you can freely use sugar?

697
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,387
-I feel much better.
-Yes.

698
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,656
-I feel better.
-Were you stifled?

699
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,091
I can breathe again.

700
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,528
Sung-ju, will you taste the sauce
for soft tofu as soon as you go out?

701
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,531
-Taste it with Se-dol.
-I'll make Se-dol taste it.

702
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,100
I'll try it.

703
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,937
Sung-ju, please go out
and report back to us with Se-dol.

704
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,338
Shall we, Se-dol?

705
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,840
-Please.
-Let's go!

706
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,975
I'm on my way. Let's go, Se-dol.

707
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,577
Follow me with the spoons.

708
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,780
Let me report from the kitchen
with Se-dol by my side.

709
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,483
Lu Chinglai and Lim Tae-hun.

710
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,417
WHAT SHOULD WE START WITH?

711
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,719
-Sung-ju!
-Yes?

712
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,021
Try the soft tofu sauce
with loads of sugar!

713
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,856
-This one!
-Try that one!

714
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,192
Please try this, Se-dol.

715
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,993
-Grab a spoonful!
-A spoonful!

716
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,664
-Grab a spoonful! He's going to try it.
-Fill up the spoon!

717
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,299
All right, Se-dol.

718
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,601
What do you think?

719
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,303
All right, Se-dol.

720
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,739
What do you think?

721
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,675
SUGAR BOMB

722
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,611
LET'S CELEBRATE!
SE-DOL FINALLY PUTS SUGAR INTO HIS BODY

723
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,214
All right, Se-dol. What do you think?

724
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,484
AN EXPLOSION OF SWEETNESS

725
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,753
Why are your eyes welling up?

726
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,188
What's it like?

727
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,790
-He doesn't want to swallow it.
-How is it?

728
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,691
Is it good?

729
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,326
What's it like?

730
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:22,961
It's to die for.

731
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,562
It's to die for?

732
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,531
In a positive way?

733
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,867
-Well, it's sweet.
-Yes?

734
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,035
-But it's oddly appealing.
-It is?

735
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,539
-It's quite sour.
-Is it?

736
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,241
He's heating up the wok.

737
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,612
5. OIL PAN AND STIR-FRY THE VEGGIES
IN SOY SAUCE

738
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,784
SPEEDING UP

739
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,553
PROPERLY ADDING THAT SMOKY FLAVOR

740
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,021
A fire show.

741
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,958
ADDING NAPA CABBAGE AND MUSHROOMS

742
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,494
HE FISHES OUT THE FRIED PORK
FROM THE ICED WATER

743
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,429
INTO THE WOK

744
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,667
HE STIR-FRIES EVERYTHING QUICKLY
OVER HIGH HEAT

745
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,469
-Are the noodles going in?
-It went in.

746
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,171
Just like that?

747
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,372
He's making chow mein.

748
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,340
-I wonder what that'll taste like.
-He's stir-frying the deep-fried noodles.

749
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,642
That's right.

750
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,344
That's the chow mein.
Do you want to taste the sauce?

751
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,646
Just the sauce.

752
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,415
-He put in a lot of oyster sauce.
-He's trying the sauce.

753
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,517
-He used lots of oyster sauce.
-That looks so good.

754
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,352
All right, Se-dol.

755
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,189
Does it taste like
authentic Chinese cuisine?

756
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,091
-Is it authentic?
-Is it good?

757
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,726
-What is it?
-Well…

758
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,528
-It does taste good.
-Okay.

759
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,965
But I'm not sure
if it's authentic Chinese cuisine.

760
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,133
It doesn't taste authentic?

761
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,902
-He just tasted the sauce.
-It doesn't taste authentic?

762
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,338
It'd be better if it were a bit saltier.

763
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,141
-That looks so good.
-He plating it already?

764
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,977
-It's on the sweeter side.
-It's sweet?

765
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,813
We just dared to give him such reviews.

766
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,282
-He adds more sauce!
-Oyster sauce.

767
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,117
He's not done yet.

768
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,453
You have 2 minutes and 45 seconds left.

769
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,488
-<i>Chunjang</i>.
-Is that <i>chunjang</i>?

770
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,791
-<i>Chunjang </i>and <i>taucu</i>.
-A mix of <i>chunjang </i>and <i>taucu</i>.

771
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,959
And water.

772
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,694
That's the sauce
for the double-cooked pork.

773
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,129
I get it.
He just throws the sauce in like that.

774
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,365
7. ADD DOUBLE-COOKED PORK SAUCE,
CHILI OIL, AND BLACK PEPPER AND STIR-FRY

775
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,435
Look at Tae-hun's fancy performance.

776
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,469
That was glamorous.

777
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,038
Can you taste
the double-cooked pork sauce?

778
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,175
THE DOUBLE-COOKED PORK IS ALREADY DONE

779
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,077
I want to try one more thing.

780
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,478
-Do you?
-Yes.

781
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,514
What about this? Can he try this sauce?

782
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,350
-Sure.
-What was this used for?

783
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,252
-For the double-cooked pork.
-Two minutes.

784
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,187
This was the sauce for double-cooked pork.

785
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,556
Let me try just the sauce for the pork.

786
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,591
Are you getting a hint of Sichuan?

787
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:34,826
So?

788
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,429
-It definitely feels Chinese.
-He says it definitely feels Chinese.

789
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,865
IN A FLURRY

790
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,667
POPPING IN INSTANT RICE

791
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,068
He's warming up the rice now!

792
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,005
AND HIS MASTER IS ADDING BEATEN-UP EGGS
INTO THE LEFTOVER NOODLES?

793
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,874
He's pouring in beaten-up eggs
and cooking it again.

794
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,342
All of a sudden?

795
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,678
-Are you redoing the leftovers?
-He has some already.

796
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,446
-I'll put this on the top.
-Oh, on the top.

797
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,515
Oh, you're going to pour this
on top of that.

798
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,020
I get it. He added more oyster sauce
because the eggs make it bland.

799
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,822
That method is used very often.

800
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,258
-You have 1 minute and 30 seconds!
-There are 1 minute and 30 seconds left.

801
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,095
POURING THE COLD SALAD SAUCE
ON TOP OF THE SOFT TOFU

802
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,132
He's done making the cold soft tofu salad.

803
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,200
-The cold soft tofu salad.
-The cold soft tofu salad.

804
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,835
-The cold soft tofu salad.
-Yes.

805
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,538
Wait, you can't touch the food
that's going to be served.

806
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,639
WHO SAID YOU COULD TOUCH THAT?

807
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,742
-How can you touch Chan-won's food?
-The chili oil.

808
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,747
HE POURS CHILI OIL ON THE SALAD!

809
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:30,648
The chili oil!

810
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,451
-He poured oil on top of that.
-That was the final touch.

811
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,220
-The chili oil.
-I think he's done. Tae-hun!

812
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,589
He hasn't rung the bell yet.

813
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,124
-You have a minute left.
-Sung-ju!

814
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,493
-Sung-ju!
-He almost had to serve it like that.

815
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,595
Have Se-dol try the chili oil.

816
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,998
-The chili oil?
-The chili oil?

817
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,132
Where's the chili oil?

818
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,200
Just the chili oil?

819
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,469
-This?
-This? This might kill him.

820
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,804
He doesn't like oil!

821
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,505
NO, I DO

822
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,140
-He doesn't like oil!
-Fifty seconds or so.

823
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,643
How's the chili oil?

824
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,312
It smells wonderful.

825
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,780
-It does?
-Yes, it smells good.

826
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,750
You still have a minute.

827
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,785
He's serving the side dish.

828
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,722
4. MIX CHOPPED PICKLED VEGGIES,
ONION, SESAME OIL, AND SERVE SEPARATELY

829
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,757
-Where do I put the rice?
-All right.

830
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,492
-Why are you asking us?
-You can't ask us.

831
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,261
Why are you asking us?
You have around 40 seconds left.

832
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,130
-All right.
-The rice.

833
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,532
Chef Chinglai finishes first.

834
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,202
Chef Tae-hun is done too.

835
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,471
They finished with 35 seconds to spare.

836
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,407
-Awesome.
-Good work.

837
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,642
-Did he ring the bell?
-He did.

838
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,411
They look so good!

839
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,312
It smells so good.

840
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,613
Good work.

841
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,848
BOWING

842
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,750
-Great work.
-Great work.

843
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,619
Yes, you did a great job too.

844
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,521
The sauce I tasted at the very beginning

845
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,957
-was much more intense than I thought.
-Was it?

846
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,258
GIGGLING

847
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,627
Se-dol had such a blast.

848
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,596
-He looks--
-You know what?

849
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,098
-He can eat dishes with sugar.
-He sure can.

850
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,066
I think he likes sugar.

851
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,101
I should've added some sugar, then.

852
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,437
-I finally learned what I really like.
-Just now?

853
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,241
-He found out just now.
-He just found out that he likes sugar.

854
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,376
He just found out that he likes sugar.

855
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,744
I should've poured it in.

856
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,248
Two authentic Chinese dishes are finished
for Chan-won to taste.

857
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,017
HIGH EXPECTATIONS

858
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,087
That was a battle
between two renowned Chinese chefs.

859
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,623
Se-dol, how was your five-minute check?

860
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,558
Not only was it fun,

861
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,227
but I don't remember much
after the first intense flavor.

862
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,629
-The first sauce you tried?
-Yes.

863
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,265
I was like, "What is this?"

864
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,734
-I think he likes sugar now.
-You can eat some, right?

865
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,402
It's all about sugar now.

866
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,072
We can turn a picky eater
into someone who enjoys everything.

867
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,242
-He was capable of changing.
-He was.

868
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,212
-We should offer a treatment program.
-He's changed.

869
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,347
Please try the chow mein first.

870
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,449
Yes, thank you.

871
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,752
CHOW MEIN MADE WITH RAMYEON NOODLES
SERVED WITH SOUR SEASONED PICKLES

872
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,454
MADE WITH THE SECRETS
OF A GRAND MASTER CHINESE CHEF

873
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,923
I wonder how the noodles turned out.

874
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,193
CHEF LU CHINGLAI'S GRAND CHOW MEIN MASTER

875
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,561
Thank you.

876
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,297
-He boiled it and fried it again,
-It looks so good.

877
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,365
the reversed <i>ramyeon </i>noodles.

878
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,369
Exactly. Poong kept teasing him about it.

879
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,505
-He'll keep reversing them?
-You kept teasing him.

880
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,808
If you boil <i>ramyeon </i>noodles and fry them,
they go back to their original state.

881
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,345
-Viewers could be curious.
-Yes, the viewers may be curious.

882
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,780
-Right?
-All right.

883
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,216
-It's an honor, Chef Chinglai. Thank you.
-Sure thing.

884
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,684
He shows his respect.

885
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,452
My gosh!

886
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,920
-My gosh!
-Goodness.

887
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,125
Look at how it's still steaming hot.

888
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,526
I wonder what it'll taste like.

889
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,961
BLOWS ON IT AND TAKES A BITE

890
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,896
Grand Chow Mein Master.

891
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,166
AUTOMATICALLY TILTING HIS HEAD BACK

892
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,968
-He has to tilt his head back.
-Yes.

893
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,370
-He wanted authentic Chinese food.
-Are you in Beijing?

894
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,506
It's a bit on the saltier side,
which is perfect for me.

895
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,008
-I see. That's good.
-It's just to my liking.

896
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,177
-How did he make something like this?
-I know.

897
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,012
He split up the noodles in half.

898
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,716
What kind of effect does it have
to cook the noodles separately?

899
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,651
The thin <i>ramyeon </i>noodles
maintained the texture

900
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,720
of crunchy outside and chewy inside.

901
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,355
Crunchy outside and chewy inside.

902
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,523
It's crunchy outside and chewy inside?

903
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,358
He stir-fried these with vegetables.

904
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,494
<i>So I think the water from the veggies</i>
<i>made the noodles softer.</i>

905
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,396
<i>It's unbelievably good.</i>

906
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,632
Crunchy outside and chewy inside.
Sweet and salty.

907
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,568
You can use all good adjectives for food
to describe this.

908
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,203
That's amazing.

909
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,207
If I may ask,
how did you add the sweet flavor?

910
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,409
I'm sure it was the onion.

911
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,810
Did you not add any sugar?

912
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,445
I don't even know where it is.

913
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,447
SIMPLY IMPRESSIVE

914
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,817
This dish was also made for Se-dol.

915
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:27,718
Just so you know,

916
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:31,556
Chef Tae-hun
added a whole ladle full of sugar.

917
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,357
Who Ordered Double-Cooked Pork?

918
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,293
-May I try these?
-Try the side dish.

919
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,794
-That's like the side dish.
-It is.

920
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,097
-Is that cabbage?
-Pickled peppers and perilla leaves.

921
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,900
He made that very quickly.

922
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,535
It's not overly salty.

923
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,971
It's a perfect side dish to eat with rice.

924
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,840
-The balance must be good.
-Yes.

925
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,475
-I want some too.
-The pickled perilla leaves.

926
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,946
He could've just served

927
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,915
pickled radishes in the fridge,
but he put in extra effort.

928
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:58,816
I want some too.

929
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,687
I just tried these two together,
and everything came together perfectly.

930
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,322
It's now seasoned perfectly.

931
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,390
-It must balance everything out.
-Yes.

932
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,259
-Authentic Chinese cuisine.
-It's delicious.

933
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,229
All right, then. Next up is Chef Tae-hun.

934
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,830
Who Ordered Double-Cooked Pork?

935
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,498
REINTERPRETING HIS MASTER'S RECIPE
IN HIS OWN STYLE!

936
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,867
<i>He made double-cooked pork</i>
<i>and soft tofu salad.</i>

937
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,570
<i>The house special rice by Self-Made Chef.</i>

938
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,839
DOUBLE COOKED-PORK
AND COLD SOFT TOFU SALAD

939
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,342
The salad looks good too.

940
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,610
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
WHO ORDERED DOUBLE-COOKED PORK?

941
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,279
There's no way this doesn't taste good.

942
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,747
A Sichuan-style dish.

943
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:30,982
It looks so good.

944
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:35,186
-I thought it'd get soggy in the water.
-Right?

945
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,088
It'll taste best with cabbage.

946
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,756
-Okay.
-He suggests eating it with cabbage.

947
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,128
He took a big bite.

948
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,463
Looks delicious.

949
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,165
He stuffed it into his mouth.

950
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,867
I wonder what it tastes like.
He probably has an idea.

951
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,868
My mouth is watering.

952
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,570
That looks good.

953
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,172
I've now arrived in Sichuan

954
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,240
without getting on a flight.

955
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,110
-It's absolutely delicious.
-Are you getting Sichuan flavors?

956
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,245
The texture of the meat is so peculiar.

957
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:05,016
He put the fried pork
into iced water, remember?

958
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,885
It's a Chinese cooking technique
to make the meat have more texture.

959
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,788
He used that technique
to keep the juice all inside.

960
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:12,790
Is it chewy?

961
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,759
Yes, I think chewy is the right word.

962
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,361
-A bit glutinous?
-Yes, exactly.

963
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,830
What do I do? I can't hold back anymore.

964
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,833
-Try the cold soft tofu salad too.
-Shall I?

965
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,137
-It probably has a good kick.
-Se-dol is eyeing that.

966
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,205
-He put a huge spoon of sugar in it.
-Yes.

967
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,075
-And Se-dol liked it.
-A ladle full of sugar.

968
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,779
-It'll give him a better appetite.
-It looks good.

969
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,814
It'll arouse his appetite.

970
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,282
That looks the most delicious.

971
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,551
-I'm dying to try it.
-I can imagine what it tastes like.

972
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,386
No way!

973
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,088
CURIOUS

974
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,289
Wait a moment.

975
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,424
This is even better!

976
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,994
-The cold soft tofu salad?
-Better than the pork?

977
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,996
The double-cooked pork is good,
but this is really good.

978
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,631
-That good, huh?
-I'm dying to try it.

979
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,533
-Se-dol just gulped.
-What is this?

980
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,801
HIS BODY RESPONDS FIRST(?)

981
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,136
-He swallowed his own saliva.
-You should try a huge spoonful of this.

982
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,238
-May I try it now?
-Yes, go ahead.

983
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,841
-I'll happily try it.
-Oh, he's eager to try it.

984
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,410
-He's not turning it down.
-Se-dol tries it right away.

985
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,311
A SPOONFUL

986
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,213
That's a big bite.

987
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,049
WILL THE FINISHED DISH
SATISFY HIS APPETITE?

988
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,986
-What's his verdict?
-He doesn't like the sweetness of sugar.

989
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,556
-First of all, it's delicious.
-Yes?

990
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,324
-Okay.
-Back there,

991
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:24,028
-I just tried the sauce, right?
-Yes, just the sauce.

992
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,964
It wasn't as shocking as that.

993
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,100
I see. Is it because of the tofu?

994
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,935
-The tofu…
-Yes?

995
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:35,673
…is balancing out the shock I felt
when I had just the sauce.

996
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,443
Wait, didn't you tell us before
that you liked tofu?

997
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,146
-I like tofu.
-Right?

998
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,215
Didn't you tell us before
that you liked tofu?

999
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,051
He likes sugar!

1000
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,854
He should be saying something positive
about the tofu.

1001
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,157
-He likes sugar!
-He says the tofu is ruining the sauce.

1002
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,527
-The tofu is the problem.
-It is.

1003
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,230
The tofu was the problem.

1004
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,466
-Let's try the chow mein first.
-Chow mein.

1005
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,068
It's really good.

1006
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,836
Please smell it first.

1007
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,838
-Is it like authentic Chinese food?
-Yes.

1008
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,343
He boiled the noodles
and then fried them again.

1009
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,811
The texture is unique.

1010
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,679
The noodles feel like

1011
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,015
they were cooked to al dente.

1012
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,350
It's like that, right?

1013
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,053
I thought it'd taste spicy and intense,

1014
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,623
but it's quite mild and nice.

1015
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,560
This was a representation
of the kind of food he makes.

1016
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,930
<i>He often likes to bring out</i>
<i>the flavor of the vegetables.</i>

1017
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,300
<i>It's not too strong because of the eggs,</i>

1018
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,536
-<i>so anyone would enjoy this dish.</i>
-<i>I see.</i>

1019
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,404
The eggs added a touch of mildness.

1020
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,874
TRYING THE CHOW MEIN
MADE WITH LOTS OF MSG-FILLED OYSTER SAUCE

1021
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,943
YUM

1022
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,446
YUM

1023
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,782
HE ALSO EXPANDED HIS PALATE
TO THE WORLD OF MSG

1024
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,785
-It tastes mild.
-Exactly.

1025
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,887
How is it?

1026
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,290
Se-dol seems to enjoy the dishes
more than last week.

1027
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,025
-Wait.
-Why didn't you…

1028
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,762
He used so much oyster sauce.
You do like MSG.

1029
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,764
It doesn't taste too strong.

1030
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,432
-It doesn't, right?
-No.

1031
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,568
-I feel so wronged.
-Is it easy to enjoy?

1032
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,670
You know what?

1033
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:13,804
MSG is the best.

1034
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,906
HE CHANGES ATTITUDE LIKE A PRO

1035
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,409
He became a different man

1036
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,010
in just one episode!

1037
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,745
He's not who he was in the last episode.

1038
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,515
-Do you feel wronged?
-I feel so wronged.

1039
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,484
They had to cook without sugar
for no reason.

1040
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,053
Am I going to be the MSG ambassador?

1041
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,021
You might land an ad deal.

1042
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,291
-He'll start promoting oyster sauce soon.
-He's enjoying it.

1043
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,160
All right, next.

1044
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,362
-This is Chef Tae-hun's dish.
-The double-cooked pork.

1045
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,832
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
WHO ORDERED DOUBLE-COOKED PORK?

1046
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,468
It tastes smoky.

1047
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,003
The soft tofu is insane.

1048
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,340
-Their dishes…
-Yes?

1049
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,409
…are very similar,
even though they're completely different.

1050
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,513
They're both very easy to eat.

1051
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:00,618
-I learned to cook from his recipe book.
-That must've had an impact.

1052
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,286
-Their dishes are on the same line.
-Yes.

1053
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,457
This could've tasted very cliché,
as it's a mix of soy sauce and vinegar.

1054
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,126
<i>But that touch of chili oil did the trick.</i>

1055
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,127
<i>It's really good.</i>

1056
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,229
Before adding the chili oil,

1057
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,065
it was probably
an ordinary sour fried chicken sauce.

1058
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,202
<i>But the moment he poured the chili oil,</i>
<i>it became a different dish.</i>

1059
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,337
It must be tough to choose one.

1060
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,839
-It's really hard.
-This is driving me crazy.

1061
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,241
-Se-dol, please choose one.
-This is a tough one.

1062
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,710
-What do I do?
-Write down one of their names.

1063
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,480
-Choose what you enjoyed more.
-Which one was better?

1064
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,750
-It's time to make your choice.
-This is really hard.

1065
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,818
-They were both good.
-It's hard.

1066
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,021
<i>Press one for Lim Tae-hun.</i>

1067
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,189
<i>Press two for Lu Chinglai.</i>

1068
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,292
<i>Please make your decision</i>

1069
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,493
and press the button.

1070
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,428
My gosh.

1071
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,764
How did you choose so quickly?

1072
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,133
I don't remember what happened last week.

1073
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,504
-He changed after he had sugar.
-He's a different man.

1074
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,440
-Did he choose?
-He made his choice.

1075
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,942
Chan-won made his choice.

1076
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,643
-That was very hard to do.
-I wonder.

1077
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,879
LEE SE-DOL HAS ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND

1078
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,481
-Let's start with Se-dol's choice.
-Sure. What is it?

1079
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,250
I knew it.

1080
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,352
Lu Chinglai.

1081
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,453
It was the oyster sauce.

1082
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,222
-It was the oyster sauce.
-He'll become the oyster sauce ambassador.

1083
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,425
He likes oyster sauce.

1084
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,193
-He loves it.
-He might land an ad deal soon.

1085
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,130
Who did Chan-won choose?

1086
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,732
Let's find out.

1087
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,000
Show us the result.

1088
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,103
Authentic Chinese cuisine,

1089
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,572
a return match
between Lu Chinglai and Lim Tae-hun.

1090
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,209
Will Chef Chinglai get his revenge?

1091
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,880
Or will Chef Tae-hun win once again?

1092
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,482
Who did Chan-won choose?

1093
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,251
Which one felt more authentic?

1094
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:42,853
Show us!

1095
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,356
-Who's the winner?
-Who's the winner?

1096
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,523
Who's the winner?

1097
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,025
LU CHINGLAI WINS

1098
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,793
LU CHINGLAI'S GRAND CHOW MEIN MASTER WINS

1099
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,830
Chef Lu Chinglai!

1100
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,165
A DEEP BOW

1101
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,801
-Tae-hun gives him a deep bow.
-Thank you.

1102
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,570
-I had fun.
-It was an honor.

1103
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,574
Chef Chinglai
successfully got his revenge.

1104
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:08,012
-Se-dol and I had the same opinion.
-It was the same.

1105
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,081
You two are on the same page now.
You can finally dine with him!

1106
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,517
-Yes, why don't we grab a meal sometime?
-Yes, do that.

1107
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,119
Let's meet up soon.

1108
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,321
-They can eat together now.
-They can.

1109
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,189
-What was the reason?
-It was good.

1110
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,292
The double-cooked pork was excellent.

1111
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,796
But it felt like something
I've had somewhere in Korea.

1112
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,867
But the chow mein was something
I've never tasted before.

1113
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,568
I see.

1114
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,937
Thank you so much, chefs. It was an honor.

1115
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,041
Chef Chinglai got his revenge.

1116
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,612
I think Se-dol and I probably share
the same opinion in this round.

1117
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,113
PEACE SIGN

1118
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,314
Why did you take a picture?

1119
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,784
I wanted to report this to my family.

1120
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,552
-A moment to remember.
-The screen.

1121
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,521
-This screen?
-This one.

1122
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,023
He's the first chef
who took a photo of the screen

1123
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,391
-in the middle of the shoot.
-The first.

1124
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,794
Many just take photos of the food.

1125
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,862
We should hear from him.

1126
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,798
Chef Tae-hun

1127
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,099
gave me a bow.

1128
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,867
How can he be so kind?

1129
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,503
It was a great experience to be here

1130
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,872
next to him once again.

1131
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,040
-Wasn't it?
-Thank you.

1132
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:15,412
He was going to bow, no matter the result.

1133
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,247
I'll continue to do my best.

1134
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,516
I doubt I'll ever be

1135
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,218
as great as Chef Lu Chinglai.

1136
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,186
You're more than capable.

1137
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,723
But I'll do my best to at least reach
somewhat close to his level.

1138
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,558
-How nice.
-That was nice.

1139
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,461
Please put a star on Chef Chinglai
who won the return match!

1140
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,895
Oh, I have to do that.

1141
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,797
Congratulations.

1142
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,899
-Thanks.
-There he goes.

1143
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,167
Congratulations, Chef Chinglai.

1144
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,802
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1145
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:43,040
-Congratulations! This was his first win!
-Congratulations!

1146
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:48,579
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Chan-won's fridge.</i>

1147
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,315
-The two tallest chefs on the show.
-You're right.

1148
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,551
Chef Hyun-suk and Chef Fabri

1149
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,854
are up against each other
for the first time.

1150
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,923
Chef Hyun-suk currently has eight stars.

1151
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,158
-The first place.
-The first place.

1152
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:05,996
His win rate is at 80%
with a record of 8 wins and 2 losses.

1153
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,298
He has an amazing record.

1154
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,733
It's your first round against Fabri.

1155
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,768
Yes, right.

1156
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,637
Chef Fabri is an excellent chef.

1157
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,472
His expertise is in fine dining,

1158
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,041
so he adds delicate touches to his dishes.

1159
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,278
-He's one of the chefs I respect highly.
-I see.

1160
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,513
However…

1161
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,847
I knew there was more to it.

1162
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,683
He tends to talk nonstop,

1163
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,919
and the tone of his voice is rather high.

1164
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,587
I want to block him out,
but I can keep hearing him.

1165
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:34,124
I could end up
getting caught up in his words,

1166
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,260
so I need something
like noise-canceling headphones.

1167
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,129
Italians are like that.

1168
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,532
We're all very passionate,

1169
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,001
so we love to talk passionately.

1170
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,969
-He can't help it. It's in his blood.
-That's just how we are.

1171
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:50,307
Now that I'm standing here with him,
I'll go over to his side

1172
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,408
and talk even more.

1173
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:55,179
-I see.
-I'll talk to you and disturb you.

1174
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,947
You made him even angrier.

1175
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,816
I'll just keep talking.

1176
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,117
BITING HIS LIPS

1177
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,418
He's getting caught up.

1178
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:06,490
I film a JTBC show called
<i>Special Reporter 25hr</i> in this studio.

1179
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,492
And there's another person like him
on that show.

1180
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,994
His name is Alberto,
and he's just like him.

1181
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,696
He's super talkative.

1182
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,798
I know what I said just now,

1183
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,133
but once I start cooking,

1184
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,101
my ears and mouth are completely blocked.

1185
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,603
Only my eyes remain

1186
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,637
to keep an eye on the guest.

1187
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,738
ONLY LOOKING AT THE GUEST

1188
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,940
It's an honor.

1189
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,041
-So much pressure.
-His mouth gets blocked?

1190
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,376
How is he going to taste the food
if his mouth gets blocked?

1191
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,012
Have you ever had tripe, Chef Fabri?

1192
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,849
I've never had it before.

1193
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,050
-No?
-Oh, no.

1194
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,418
-That's not good.
-It's going to be hard for him.

1195
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,453
It'll be a tough battle for him.

1196
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,422
I don't think
there's a single fine-dining restaurant

1197
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,624
-that cooks with tripe.
-Exactly.

1198
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,693
Chef Hyun-suk,
we're the first ones in the world.

1199
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,229
-The first fine dining trip dishes.
-Exactly.

1200
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,165
CHEF FABRI'S INGREDIENTS: FRENCH FRIES,
CRACKERS, BOILED TRIPE, PERILLA OIL,

1201
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,234
PIZZA SAUCE, PERILLA SEED, MARINATED CRAB,
SEA TRUMPET, CHEDDAR, BROCCOLI

1202
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,071
The dish I'm going to make is called

1203
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,640
Tripe Soap Opera.

1204
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,308
-"Tripe Soap Opera"?
-"Tripe Soap Opera."

1205
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,178
I love soaps!

1206
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,681
<i>Love and War</i> and <i>Temptation of Wife</i>
are my favorite dramas.

1207
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,917
THEY'RE BOTH CLASSICS

1208
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,919
-Tripe Soap Opera.
-I'll use tripe

1209
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:13,657
and make a dramatic dish
in fine dining style.

1210
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,494
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Also, you said you liked marinated crabs.

1211
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,764
-Yes, marinated crabs.
-And you said you liked mayonnaise.

1212
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:24,968
I'm going to make mayonnaise
with marinated crab.

1213
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,904
-With marinated crab?
-You'll make mayonnaise from scratch

1214
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,171
with marinated crab?

1215
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,774
-Yes, with crab meat.
-That's so creative.

1216
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,477
I'll use the crab meat

1217
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,878
because it's protein.

1218
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,748
It'll be easy to emulsify the oil.

1219
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:38,682
That sounds good.

1220
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,485
I'm so looking forward to this.
Mayo made with marinated crab?

1221
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,788
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS: MAYONNAISE,
ARTIFICIAL CAVIAR, BOILED TRIPE, SOJU,

1222
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,924
SHISHITO PEPPER, CREAM CHEESE, EGG SAUCE,
EGG SOY SAUCE, CARBONATED WATER

1223
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,026
My dish is called

1224
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,528
Tripe and Caviar Are the Best.

1225
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,897
"Tripe and Caviar Are the Best."

1226
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,265
So you're using caviar?

1227
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,067
He must be.

1228
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,336
I saw that he had artificial caviar.

1229
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,439
Using caviar is an important aspect
of the fine dining experience.

1230
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:06,843
I'll also use the Idong <i>galbi</i>
marinade technique on the tripe

1231
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,547
and serve it on deep-fried
and crispy cream cheese.

1232
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,717
I want him to experience
something that's gentle

1233
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,753
yet explosive with many flavors.

1234
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,788
That's amazing.

1235
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,623
-Tripe and cream cheese?
-I can't imagine that.

1236
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,191
-Yes.
-That's so new.

1237
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:25,162
Now, let us fill the order for Chan-won.

1238
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,832
<i>-Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and tripe, hey</i>
<i>-And tripe</i>

1239
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,435
The round will begin now.

1240
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,837
He's here to write a soap opera story

1241
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,073
about defeating the first place
of <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

1242
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,574
Chef Fabri is up.

1243
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,677
This man thinks it'd be absurd
for him to lose.

1244
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,147
Here to show the class of his eight stars,

1245
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,616
Chef Hyun-suk
gladly accepts his challenge.

1246
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,653
Which one of the two chefs
will show us a fancy new side of tripe?

1247
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,089
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1248
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,223
Let's go!

1249
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,524
Begin!

1250
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,059
Let's go!

1251
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,296
<i>Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, and turn</i>

1252
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,197
Hey, hey!

1253
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,199
I smelled it earlier,

1254
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,967
-and it smelled a lot.
-It does.

1255
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,769
It smells even worse when it's raw.

1256
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,572
-Right?
-They should do their best to cover it up.

1257
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,873
How are they going to do that?

1258
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,843
Chef Hyun-suk is doing something
very interesting.

1259
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,446
Most people cut tripe in circular discs
with the fatty filling.

1260
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,183
But if he cuts it straight, it's easier
to get the filling and the smell out.

1261
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,753
-I see.
-Once he stir-fries it or cooks it.

1262
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,654
The experts already know what to do.

1263
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,124
Look at how he's scraping out
the fatty filling.

1264
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,627
That's the source of its smell.

1265
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,696
Fabri is cutting it into discs
without scraping it out.

1266
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,065
It'll smell quite bad with the filling.

1267
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,501
-He should remove the filling.
-I hope he has a plan.

1268
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,870
He's cutting the tripe into tiny pieces.

1269
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,571
INTO A BLENDER!

1270
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,241
He's grinding tripe with crackers.

1271
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,842
He's grinding it with crackers?

1272
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,477
-In a blender?
-With tripe?

1273
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,312
Crackers and what?

1274
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,614
-Tripe.
-Perilla leaves?

1275
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,749
-Tripe.
-Dried sea trumpet.

1276
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:53,884
That's dried sea trumpet?

1277
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,585
-I love dried sea trumpet.
-It's good.

1278
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,254
He's mixing dried sea trumpet
and crackers?

1279
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,189
I think it'll taste good.
It'll be like seaweed snacks.

1280
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,658
-Perilla oil?
-Perilla oil.

1281
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,294
-He put the filling in too.
-It'll probably smell.

1282
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,529
He added perilla oil.

1283
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,998
1. MAKE PIE CRUST DOUGH BY GRINDING TRIPE,
DRIED SEA TRUMPET, AND PERILLA OIL

1284
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,100
WORKING HARD

1285
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,336
Everything has been ground up.

1286
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,337
WHAT WILL HE USE THIS FOR?

1287
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,006
POURING IN

1288
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,075
Chef Hyun-suk just poured in soju.

1289
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,943
Is that ponzu?

1290
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,978
That's egg soy sauce.

1291
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:23,647
I bought it in Japan.

1292
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,582
Cream cheese.

1293
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,884
-Oh, he just cut it open.
-He cuts it open.

1294
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,453
It caught on fire.

1295
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,821
-The soju.
-The heat.

1296
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,090
SOJU ON FIRE

1297
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,624
He did that on purpose.

1298
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,692
He added in garlic.

1299
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,327
Yes, garlic.

1300
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,328
BLACK PEPPER

1301
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,464
-Oh, ground pepper.
-That's cool.

1302
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,933
SALT

1303
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,234
Look at him!

1304
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,604
What are you doing right now?

1305
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,505
UP CLOSE

1306
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,040
-Go away!
-He said, "Go away!"

1307
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,776
-He got kicked out.
-Fabri is trying to distract him.

1308
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,444
He went over and talked to him.

1309
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,247
2. BOIL DOWN THE TRIPE IN A MIX OF SOJU,
EGG SOY SAUCE, GARLIC, GROUND PEPPER, SALT

1310
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,749
LEFTOVER FRENCH FRIES?

1311
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,985
READY? GO!

1312
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,553
Wait, what are those?

1313
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,122
-French fries?
-What are those?

1314
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,958
These were leftovers.

1315
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:11,661
I had too much left over, so I froze them.

1316
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:12,963
You didn't want to waste them.

1317
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,532
There's an Italian stew

1318
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,301
made with potato, tomato, and tripe.

1319
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,704
-Trippa.
-Trippa. Yes.

1320
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,806
Ketchup? What's that?

1321
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,341
Pizza sauce.

1322
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,811
He's mixing pizza sauce,
French fries, and tripe?

1323
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,080
AND IN!

1324
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,381
Is that stew?

1325
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,484
Does Fabri not have
a clear understanding of tripe?

1326
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,186
-It already smells weird.
-He keeps going.

1327
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,488
It won't be easy to handle.

1328
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,724
I think the pizza sauce
will cover up the smell.

1329
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,826
-The pizza sauce?
-He wants to cover up the smell

1330
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,427
with the smell of Italian pizza.

1331
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,529
-What's that?
-What's that?

1332
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,831
-Marinated crab?
-Marinated crab?

1333
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,800
-He's using the sauce.
-He's only using the marinade.

1334
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,969
Man, I can't tell what that'll taste like.

1335
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,071
HYUN-SUK CUTS UP THE CREAM CHEESE

1336
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,974
What's that? Frying powder?

1337
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,177
-Isn't it flour?
-I think it's frying powder.

1338
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,179
-Frying powder?
-Frying powder. Right?

1339
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,915
Carbonated water.
I think he'll deep-fry something.

1340
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,317
Are you frying the cream cheese?

1341
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,654
He covered the cream cheese
in a batter made with carbonated water.

1342
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,788
Is he deep-frying it?

1343
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,590
What if the cream cheese melts?

1344
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,659
He coated the cream cheese with flour
and covered it with the batter.

1345
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,993
CRUNCHY OUTSIDE, CHEESY INSIDE

1346
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,262
He created a shell
to make sure it doesn't melt.

1347
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,163
Right.

1348
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,400
-It'll explode if you cut it.
-Hurry up.

1349
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,339
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH FABRI'S BATTER?

1350
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,942
-The one he ground up with sea trumpet.
-It's a tart crust.

1351
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,009
It's like a tart crust.

1352
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,711
He's making a tart crust with that.

1353
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,712
I get it.

1354
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,382
The crust dough is made with
crackers and dried sea trumpet.

1355
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,684
So that dough

1356
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,986
will turn into a cookie-like crust,
and then he'll top it with tripe.

1357
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,889
-I see.
-That's amazing.

1358
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,057
No.

1359
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:48,758
TALKING TO HIMSELF

1360
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:49,859
I can't let this happen.

1361
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,128
-Get in there.
-Fabri is trying to shape the crust.

1362
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,196
Is that a bottle cap?

1363
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,031
A bottle cap?

1364
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,400
It's the tart crust.

1365
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,535
The tart crust.

1366
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,869
3. MAKE DOUGH AND BAKE IT IN THE OVEN

1367
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,339
-Will it get cooked?
-Shaped like a bottle cap?

1368
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,873
WOW

1369
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,309
Se-dol is in deep shock.

1370
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,511
He thinks everything
is quite different from last week.

1371
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,613
Well, it's…

1372
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,281
Isn't the recipe so complicated?

1373
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,016
You called my rounds the craziest,

1374
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,952
-but isn't this the craziest round?
-Right?

1375
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,354
Do you want to go out again?

1376
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,755
Gosh, no.

1377
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,457
REFUSES

1378
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:24,094
Se-dol is having fun right now.

1379
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,930
-He's having fun on the show,
-He is.

1380
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,632
Before, it was only his wife
who watched this show.

1381
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,433
CUTTING

1382
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,136
WHAT'S THE CRAZIEST KICK
HYUN-SUK WILL SHOW US?

1383
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,604
Chef Hyun-suk is grinding something.

1384
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,473
-Green onion.
-It's green onion.

1385
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,974
I love green onions.

1386
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,243
I see. He's grinding green onions.

1387
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,344
WHAT IS HE MAKING WITH GROUND GREEN ONION?

1388
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,113
Is he making green onion cream cheese?

1389
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,848
-What's that?
-Mayonnaise.

1390
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,185
Mayonnaise! Hyun-suk is using mayonnaise.

1391
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,920
-Mayonnaise.
-Green onion mayonnaise.

1392
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,022
He's making green onion mayonnaise.

1393
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,723
He's straining it right now.

1394
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,859
Oh, he's straining it.

1395
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,161
-It's not working.
-It's not getting strained.

1396
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,629
SHH!

1397
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,164
Oh, it's working.

1398
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,666
-It's working.
-Surely but slowly.

1399
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,135
It's working indeed.

1400
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,637
-Enough!
-Enough!

1401
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,439
-It's enough.
-He has enough.

1402
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,540
Gosh, my eyes sting.

1403
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,410
He put another layer of batter
on the cream cheese

1404
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,245
and double-frying it.

1405
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,746
He's frying it twice.

1406
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,015
5. REFRY THE CREAM CHEESE FRITTERS

1407
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,519
WHAT WILL HE MAKE
TO FIGHT AGAINST THE GREEN ONION MAYO?

1408
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,621
EGG WHITES

1409
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,090
Fabri is using marinated crabs.

1410
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,125
-Just the meat.
-Only the meat.

1411
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,761
-He said he'd make mayo.
-He did.

1412
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,296
He said he'd make marinated crab mayo.

1413
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,998
Is he using that instead of eggs?

1414
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,800
I'm only using egg whites.

1415
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,102
-Just egg whites? Not yolks?
-No.

1416
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,005
The crab meat will act as the protein
the egg yolks would've provided.

1417
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,340
-Exactly.
-So just egg whites.

1418
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:44,574
-That's right.
-I knew that'd be the case.

1419
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,078
You'll get the authentic taste
of the ingredients.

1420
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,214
-But that's…
-That's so interesting.

1421
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,550
He's now blending
egg whites and marinated crab meat.

1422
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,452
He'll probably add oil to that.

1423
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,754
It'll turn into mayo
after he puts some oil in.

1424
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,923
ADDING OLIVE OIL!

1425
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,958
Can he make mayo without egg yolks?

1426
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,827
TURN INTO MAYO!

1427
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,762
DOUBLE SPEED

1428
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,032
It's working.

1429
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,601
4. BLEND EGG WHITES, MARINATED CRAB,
AND OLIVE OIL TO MAKE MARINATED CRAB MAYO

1430
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,104
It's mayonnaise. He really made it.

1431
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,705
Are you making mayo?

1432
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:16,873
That's mayo.

1433
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,208
Instead of using what he has?

1434
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,509
Chef Hyun-suk used store-bought mayo.

1435
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,010
-What?
-Not me.

1436
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,413
Fabri made mayonnaise from scratch!

1437
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,015
-Marinated crab mayo.
-That's the spirit of fine dining.

1438
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,817
-Marinated crab mayonnaise.
-Marinated crab mayonnaise.

1439
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,787
He used marinated crabs
so that mayo is really expensive.

1440
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,890
HYUN-SUK SHUTS HIS EARS AND FOCUSES

1441
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,126
SHISHITO PEPPERS

1442
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,962
JUST GOING FOR IT

1443
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,765
THE CREAM CHEESE FRITTERS
HAVE BEEN DOUBLE-FRIED

1444
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,700
Are you grilling the tripe, Chef Hyun-suk?

1445
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:44,868
He parboiled it.

1446
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:48,638
He made cuts and parboiled it
in a mix of soju and soy sauce.

1447
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,307
-I think he'll broil it once again.
-Is that what you did?

1448
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,776
Just like that?

1449
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,979
Broiling is the best way
to get rid of the fat smell.

1450
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,213
He should broil them.

1451
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,283
Yes, it's probably a better idea
to broil them.

1452
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,853
-Are you doing okay?
-Go away.

1453
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,523
FABRI LURKS AROUND
LIKE A MOSQUITO IN THE SUMMER

1454
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,924
Hey, go away.

1455
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,160
RELAXED

1456
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,060
He was like, "Shoo."

1457
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:12,962
Like he's shooing a dog.

1458
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,166
YOU'D BETTER STOP…

1459
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:17,600
Is that tripe?

1460
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,536
I CAN'T HEAR HIM…

1461
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:23,339
-Come on, Fabri.
-He attacked him.

1462
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,874
That's how Italy plays soccer.

1463
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,643
Yes, you're right!

1464
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,612
-They play with tight defense.
-You're right.

1465
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,515
-He's using a torch.
-With a torch.

1466
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:33,516
It looks good.

1467
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,319
He broils the tripe
to get rid of the fat smell.

1468
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,221
That's probably the best way.

1469
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,523
He's torching it again.

1470
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,958
It's catching on fire.

1471
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,994
You keep putting something on it
as you broil it.

1472
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,297
Chef Hyun-suk
is putting in a lot of effort.

1473
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,599
He's broiling it quite a lot.

1474
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,001
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FAT SMELL?

1475
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,237
IT SMELLS THE BEST!

1476
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,173
He smelled it
and gave himself a thumbs-up.

1477
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,211
-He's such a shameless one.
-My gosh.

1478
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,247
Five minutes left.
You should go, Jung-hwan.

1479
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,415
Is Se-dol going with you?

1480
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,783
No.

1481
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,717
Will you join me?

1482
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:08,885
No, thank you.

1483
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,487
I think you'll do a good job.

1484
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,821
It's time to check the kitchen.

1485
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,357
It's quite hard to cook with tripe.

1486
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,258
No, not yet.

1487
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,327
-Is it not ready yet?
-No.

1488
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,862
He says it's not ready yet.

1489
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,730
I wonder what the mayo tastes like.

1490
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,599
-Hurry up and try this.
-I need to hurry?

1491
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,600
I have to put this in here.

1492
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,068
Really? Then let me taste it.

1493
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,936
-Marinated crab mayo.
-Marinated crab mayo.

1494
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,739
-I wonder how this will taste.
-Do tell us.

1495
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:33,576
-How will it taste?
-Marinated crab mayo.

1496
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,613
-Look at his face.
-How is it? Is it a soap opera?

1497
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,282
Is it a soap opera or not?

1498
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,685
I'm not sensing an affair quite yet.

1499
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,254
It's not pungent enough.

1500
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,522
It should be much more pungent

1501
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:46,990
-to call it a soap opera.
-I see!

1502
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,193
-It's too bland.
-It must be too weak.

1503
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,630
-Then people won't like it.
-I can definitely smell the oil,

1504
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,634
but the marinated crab meat,
mayo, and oil don't mix too well.

1505
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,935
Is that so?

1506
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,804
All you need is a bit of MSG.
Just a drop of oyster sauce.

1507
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,907
-Okay!
-Seasoning.

1508
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,543
I guess Fabri has never watched
soap operas before.

1509
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,677
MIX IT

1510
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,548
THE FINISHED MARINATED CRAB MAYO
GOES INTO A SAUCE TUB

1511
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,417
GREEN ONION MAYONNAISE

1512
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:17,153
You've worked hard on these…
What kind of fritters are these?

1513
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:18,788
Cream cheese.

1514
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,323
He tops the cream cheese fritters
with tripe.

1515
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,359
And now the caviar.

1516
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,995
-It's colored herring roe.
-That's right.

1517
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,766
He's doing his best with the caviar.

1518
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:32,035
-He's doing his best.
-He's working hard.

1519
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,571
PRETTY

1520
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,006
-This one. Was this pizza sauce?
-Yes.

1521
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,909
-Should I try this?
-Pizza sauce.

1522
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,778
I think it'll have a fatty smell.

1523
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:42,912
I think so too.

1524
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,048
I'm not sure if he covered up the smell.

1525
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,418
It already smells bad.

1526
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,086
AHHHHH

1527
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,521
-Jung-hwan.
-Does it smell?

1528
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,256
Does it smell?

1529
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,624
Does it smell?

1530
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,693
We're standing here
at the tripe alley in Daegu.

1531
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,630
I love tripe.

1532
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,299
Se-dol should've been here.

1533
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,401
-Should I try it?
-Jung-hwan tries a piece.

1534
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,237
Does it make you happy or sad?

1535
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,574
Is it like a soap opera?

1536
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,210
It's making me happy.

1537
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,379
A SURPRISING HAPPY ENDING!

1538
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,014
The smell is there,

1539
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,584
but the flavor itself…

1540
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,952
Aren't you going to cook?

1541
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,454
-The smell…
-Are you done cooking?

1542
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,855
-Was the smell okay?
-Yes.

1543
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,423
-He must've covered it up.
-It's not so bad.

1544
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,524
-Go away.
-Look at him.

1545
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:29,859
Why is he doing that?

1546
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,762
It's okay. I'm just waiting for this.

1547
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,364
Fabri is waiting for the oven.

1548
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,565
CHECKING THE TIME

1549
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,568
7. TOP THE TRIPE WITH ARTIFICIAL CAVIAR,
SHISHITO PEPPER, AND EGG SAUCE

1550
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,169
He's almost done.

1551
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,771
He's busy presenting his dish.

1552
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,374
-Chef Hyun-suk is almost done.
-He's almost done.

1553
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,343
A GENEROUS SCOOP OF GREEN ONION MAYO

1554
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,348
DONE WITH THE PRESENTATION

1555
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,119
-Chef Hyun-suk is done!
-He's done!

1556
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:58,221
He finishes with two minutes to spare.

1557
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,590
-He finishes with two minutes to spare.
-It looks so pretty.

1558
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,592
-He made his dish in 13 minutes.
-What about Fabri?

1559
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,161
-Fabri has some time left.
-Two minutes.

1560
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,663
I smell lingers in the aftertaste.

1561
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:09,699
-The smell?
-Oh, you smell it, huh?

1562
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,435
-The more I chew, the more it smells.
-What are you doing?

1563
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,272
Are you done?

1564
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,707
THE TRIPE ROUND REVENGE

1565
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,242
He's getting his revenge.

1566
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,743
You have 1 minute and 30 seconds left!

1567
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,613
Koreans like to talk too.

1568
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,181
Does it look good?

1569
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,516
I LOVE THIS DRAMA

1570
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,584
Are you done, Fabri?

1571
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,422
People say a nobleman
gets his revenge over ten years.

1572
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,291
It smells good.
I wonder what it tastes like.

1573
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,093
The tables have turned.

1574
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,561
I knew it.

1575
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:39,962
-Is it ready?
-The tables have turned.

1576
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,097
-One second.
-Is the crust ready?

1577
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,331
One minute.

1578
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,100
-You have one minute left.
-Fabri.

1579
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,468
Don't be nervous.

1580
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,236
-Something dropped.
-It looks good.

1581
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,439
-It looks good.
-He dropped the mold.

1582
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,240
Was that the mold?

1583
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,476
So he's topping the crust
with the filling.

1584
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,078
ADDING THE TRIPE STEW
MADE WITH PIZZA SAUCE ON TOP!

1585
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,546
-Don't be nervous.
-He has less than a minute.

1586
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:58,147
I'm not undefeatable.

1587
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,149
APPALLED

1588
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,451
Oh, no.

1589
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,686
-Oh, that's hot!
-Be careful.

1590
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,088
Be careful.

1591
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:05,988
Forty seconds.

1592
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:06,989
Forty seconds.

1593
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,424
Will he put anything else on top?

1594
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,625
Probably the mayo.

1595
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,760
Right, the mayo.

1596
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,097
-Thirty seconds.
-He has to add the mayo.

1597
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,565
-You have no time.
-He's using mayo too.

1598
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:18,901
-I think everything will depend on this.
-The mayo he made, right?

1599
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,603
-Twenty seconds.
-Look at that.

1600
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,939
Oh, no. Fifteen seconds.

1601
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,907
-You should serve it.
-What's that?

1602
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,276
You're almost out of time. Ten seconds.

1603
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:33,249
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five…
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five…

1604
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,584
-He's done.
-He's done.

1605
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,552
He finished with only four seconds left.

1606
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,888
-That was extraordinary.
-It was.

1607
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,090
-They both look pretty.
-They're so different.

1608
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,725
I wonder what they taste like.

1609
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,361
How did he come up with the idea
to make a tart in 15 minutes?

1610
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,396
Look at the color.

1611
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,967
And now, both dishes are made
to fill Chan-won's order.

1612
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:54,604
<i>-Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and tripe</i>
<i>-And tripe, hey</i>

1613
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,973
Both dishes are done.

1614
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,674
This was the toughest round yet

1615
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,042
with tripe as the key ingredient.

1616
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,945
-I apologize.
-It wasn't an easy battle.

1617
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,413
But as you can see,

1618
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,783
both dishes came out neatly
in the fine dining style.

1619
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,951
-They both look amazing.
-Yes.

1620
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,087
-Let me try them and be the judge.
-Okay.

1621
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,489
Please try Chef Hyun-suk's
Tripe and Caviar Are the Best.

1622
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:19,028
BROILED TRIPE TOPPED WITH
A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF CAVIAR(?)

1623
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:24,167
SERVED WITH CREAM CHEESE FRITTERS
AND GREEN ONION MAYO SAUCE

1624
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,371
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
TRIPE AND CAVIAR ARE THE BEST

1625
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:32,141
Gosh, I have to take a picture of this.

1626
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,877
-They look so pretty.
-Indeed.

1627
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,046
Chef Hyun-suk is walking over.

1628
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,015
-When you eat that,
-How do I eat it?

1629
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,616
you don't have to use a fork or a knife.

1630
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,119
-Just use your hand.
-Just like that?

1631
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,087
-Okay.
-Let me help you.

1632
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,890
So those scissors weren't for nails?

1633
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,292
IT'S MEANT TO BE USED IN THE KITCHEN

1634
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:50,560
I thought they were for nails.

1635
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:51,928
AS IF, LOL

1636
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,464
-I served it with green onion mayo.
-The sauce.

1637
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,766
Green onion mayo?

1638
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,002
I like mayo very much,
so I'll dip it in a lot of sauce.

1639
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,672
Why is the shape still the same
after he cut it?

1640
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,675
-He only cut the top.
-Oh, only the top?

1641
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:07,577
The fry is crunchy on the outside,

1642
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,812
but it's soft on the inside
to the point where it's almost runny.

1643
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:10,847
-I see.
-I see.

1644
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,014
It looks good.

1645
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:14,150
-Thank you. I'll enjoy it.
-He's taking a bite.

1646
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,018
What if you burn your mouth?

1647
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,521
-Tripe and Caviar Are the Best.
-It looks so good.

1648
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,924
He had everything in one bite.

1649
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:25,995
It must be good.

1650
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:30,132
He's probably never had
a tripe dish like this before.

1651
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,835
Will it open his eyes
to a new world of tripe dishes?

1652
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,038
-He's astonished.
-It looks good.

1653
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,640
I can't believe
you can have tripe like this.

1654
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,576
I understand why he has eight stars.

1655
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,577
-You do?
-Yes.

1656
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,279
It must be good.

1657
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,847
It's not just good.

1658
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,583
-It doesn't smell at all.
-Not at all?

1659
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,386
Bravo, Hyun-suk.

1660
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,288
-Isn't he good?
-Go away.

1661
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,556
Get away from me.

1662
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,691
So it doesn't smell at all?

1663
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,293
-Not at all.
-Not even the slightest bit?

1664
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,995
How did he get rid of the smell?

1665
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,665
I thought it'd be impossible
even if he had an hour and a half.

1666
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:07,703
I added soy sauce to soju,

1667
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,572
<i>as well as ground pepper and garlic.</i>

1668
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,641
<i>Then, I briefly marinated it,</i>

1669
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,142
<i>broiled it with a torch,</i>

1670
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,744
<i>coated it with the sauce again,</i>

1671
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,112
<i>-and repeated that three times.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1672
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:20,182
The smell of the sauce
probably got rid of all the smell.

1673
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,185
I see.
That's why you did that three times.

1674
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,221
I also added shishito peppers

1675
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,723
to add that smoky yet spicy flavor

1676
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,160
to make a fine dining-style dish
that comes with lots of flavors.

1677
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:35,231
I smelled something I loved,
and it was shishito pepper.

1678
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,599
-Shishito pepper.
-Yes.

1679
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,100
-You said you liked those.
-Yes.

1680
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,602
It sounds crunchy.

1681
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,870
Man, that looks so good.

1682
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,339
I'll start frying cream cheese
from now on.

1683
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,810
The caviar almost tastes authentic.

1684
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,513
Pairing it with all the other ingredients
enhances its flavor.

1685
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:54,417
Caviar goes very well with eggs.

1686
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:59,155
<i>The egg sauce you had</i>
<i>was something I could squeeze like mayo,</i>

1687
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,190
so I balanced the dish with that.

1688
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,725
That sounds great.

1689
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,961
Next, Chef Fabri's dish.

1690
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,829
<i>Tripe Soap Opera.</i>

1691
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,565
SEA TRUMPET AND TRIPE TART TOPPED WITH
TRIPE STEW AND MARINATED CRAB MAYO

1692
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,403
CHEF FABRI'S TRIPE SOAP OPERA

1693
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,240
I'm sorry for wasting so much time,

1694
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,309
-but let me take pictures.
-Do as you like.

1695
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,279
I can't just eat a fine dining dish
without taking pictures first.

1696
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,415
-That's one of a kind, so take pictures.
-Of course.

1697
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,516
I'm moved.

1698
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,286
The tripe expert, Chan-won.

1699
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,722
To be frank,

1700
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:35,491
I'm not sure what it'll taste like.

1701
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,926
UNKNOWN TRIPE

1702
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,861
-What are you saying?
-So can I have it or not?

1703
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,230
I'm just being honest.

1704
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,766
I had to make do with what I had.

1705
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,303
-He even made the mayo himself.
-Yes.

1706
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,405
TASTING THE SAUCE

1707
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,874
-He felt something.
-It must be good.

1708
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,809
THIS TIME, JUST THE TRIPE

1709
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:57,246
He didn't remove the fatty filling.

1710
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,049
-I'm eating tripe right now,
-Yes?

1711
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,751
but I can smell marinated crab.

1712
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,055
<i>-That's amazing.</i>
<i>-He used marinated crab to make the mayo.</i>

1713
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,990
<i>Yes, I can smell it right away.</i>

1714
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,959
He must've covered up the fat smell
with the fishy smell.

1715
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:13,562
I guess so. He covered up the fat smell
with the fishy smell.

1716
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,865
He covered up the fat smell
with the fishy smell?

1717
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,366
Can we call it covering up?

1718
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,902
Well, he managed to do it.

1719
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,838
He just presented something
that smells stronger.

1720
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:23,739
It worked though.

1721
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,142
-It tastes just right. Let me try this.
-I see.

1722
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,511
-My gosh.
-I wonder what the tart tastes like.

1723
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,980
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE WITH THE TART?

1724
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,451
CURIOUS

1725
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,552
I wonder if it's good.

1726
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,288
May I express this in the best way I can?

1727
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,656
Is it hard to describe?

1728
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,392
It's the real deal.

1729
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:49,398
Fabri, you might have a chance.

1730
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,534
Does it go well with the tart?

1731
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,303
I actually don't like to eat
crackers or bread.

1732
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:58,507
-They all feel too dry to me.
-Right.

1733
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,643
But how is this so soft?

1734
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,747
He couldn't bake it all the way
because he ran out of time.

1735
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,816
I think that actually helped.

1736
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,517
-It still had the softness.
-Yes.

1737
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,687
Instead of baking it
until the point it was crunchy?

1738
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,657
It's like a mix of land and sea.

1739
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,460
<i>-He added dried sea trumpet, right?</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

1740
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,328
<i>And he also added marinated crab meat.</i>

1741
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,932
The seafood flavor meets with the tripe,
the flavor from land.

1742
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,834
I see.

1743
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,670
How did the Italian chef
make something so Korean?

1744
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:32,141
<i>When I had the tart, tripe,</i>
<i>and marinated crab mayo,</i>

1745
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:35,544
the fat smell and the fishy smell
all came together

1746
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,745
to create a good balance.

1747
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,348
So Ho-young did the job.

1748
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,817
-You're right!
-It was Ho-young.

1749
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,253
-Ho-young made his appearance today.
-He did.

1750
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,889
He just said the fat smell
was covered up with the fishy smell.

1751
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:51,360
-We can be sure after Se-dol tries it.
-You're right!

1752
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,995
That'd seal the deal.

1753
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,064
Se-dol will have to try it.

1754
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,633
-I'm a little full right now.
-What do you mean?

1755
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,570
-Just have a little bit.
-Se-dol will confirm it for us.

1756
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,206
Se-dol has opened his eyes to new flavors.

1757
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,641
He's going to try some tripe too.

1758
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,444
You might like it so much
and end up going to Daegu often.

1759
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,213
It's made of everything you hate, Se-dol.

1760
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,649
Cheese, fried food, mayonnaise, and sugar.

1761
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:17,286
I think he'll show growth
after this again.

1762
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,588
Please try it in one bite.

1763
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:20,723
EATING IT IN ONE BITE

1764
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,324
He ate it right away.

1765
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,026
Wait, is he spitting it out?

1766
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,795
I thought you were going to spit it out.

1767
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,597
He won't do that.

1768
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,232
NERVOUS

1769
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,334
He hasn't swallowed it yet.

1770
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,470
Hey, this is bad.

1771
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:36,705
Does he not like it?

1772
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:37,806
-Oh, no.
-He stopped for now.

1773
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:40,476
No, he likes it. He's smiling.

1774
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,445
-Mr. Particular.
-Mr. Particular?

1775
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,681
It's making my eyes well up.

1776
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:46,782
Is it?

1777
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,151
Were you that deeply moved?

1778
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,521
-We're here to fix his eating habits.
-We are.

1779
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:56,192
-This is a journey of Se-dol's growth.
-Right?

1780
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,360
-Is it the fatty smell?
-Can you smell it?

1781
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,628
-Can you?
-No, right?

1782
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,065
-It's tough to describe in words.
-Indescribable, huh?

1783
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,435
-It's quite mysterious.
-Mysterious?

1784
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,305
But is it still enjoyable?

1785
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,773
Well…

1786
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,576
I think I've really grown.

1787
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,646
He couldn't have had that last week.

1788
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,816
He has finally grown!

1789
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,886
-We read his wife's letter, remember?
-Yes.

1790
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,589
I rarely tear up, but…

1791
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,757
I bet your wife
is also tearing up at home!

1792
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,926
-He must be moved.
-Oh, no.

1793
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,996
-He can eat something like this?
-Her husband has grown!

1794
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,497
I can eat anything now.

1795
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,902
-And next, Fabri's Tripe Soap Opera.
-This one.

1796
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,771
The dish that covered up the fat smell
with the fishy smell.

1797
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,373
What is this nonsense?

1798
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,475
He covered up the fat smell
with the fishy smell.

1799
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,311
What if he successfully eats this too?

1800
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:50,879
He takes a bite.

1801
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,516
Let's watch
how his facial expression changes.

1802
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,051
-This is fun.
-He likes it.

1803
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:58,287
-What?
-It must be good.

1804
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,789
-He looks more relaxed than before.
-It must be okay.

1805
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,926
I was surprised at how mild it tasted.

1806
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,527
-What?
-It must be good.

1807
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:06,629
Hey, wait!

1808
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,897
He finally knows what's good!

1809
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,833
He's Mr. Gourmet!

1810
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,735
He's no longer just Se-dol.

1811
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:15,437
-He's Mr. Gourmet.
-Mr. Gourmet.

1812
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,239
-He must have a good appetite.
-Exactly.

1813
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:20,542
-I didn't expect this.
-You didn't?

1814
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,611
-Wait, I…
-If any celebrities want to fix

1815
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,980
-their picky appetite, come on the show.
-You're right.

1816
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:28,417
-You were appalled by the mayo.
-Tell me about it.

1817
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:32,955
I thought it'd be
the toughest dish to eat.

1818
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:36,892
I kept wondering
how I should react after eating this.

1819
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,928
-In a negative way?
-Yes.

1820
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,230
You thought it'd be the worst dish.

1821
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:45,034
I realized it was possible to cover up
one bad smell with another.

1822
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,169
-Cover up a bad smell with a bad smell.
-Fat smell with a fishy smell.

1823
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:48,937
Do you understand why he said that?

1824
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,139
This is amazing.

1825
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,206
SIMPLY AMAZED

1826
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:54,843
So it was possible to cover up
the fat smell with the fishy smell.

1827
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,378
Even Se-dol can eat this.

1828
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,847
-How was this made possible?
-It was a very creative idea.

1829
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:00,282
I think we should make a show.

1830
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:02,051
<i>Mr. Gourmet's Gourmet Trip.</i>

1831
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:05,020
Right? I want to join that show.

1832
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,289
-We can go around and eat together.
-Right?

1833
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:10,526
-I want to join him.
-And witness his changes.

1834
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:12,394
Mr. Gourmet, Se-dol.

1835
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:13,362
That was hilarious.

1836
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,464
-Is your wife here?
-She's in the studio.

1837
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,599
-Really?
-You came with her?

1838
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,968
-Is she watching right now?
-She's hiding somewhere.

1839
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,270
Where is she?

1840
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,239
She showed a huge smile
as soon as she saw that moment.

1841
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:25,507
I knew it.

1842
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,242
She's glad she brought him here.

1843
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,378
We provided treatment.

1844
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,481
She'll buy a bag of sugar on her way home.

1845
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,952
You two can stop by the grocery store

1846
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,221
and pick up sugar, tripe, cheese.

1847
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,589
-And ketchup.
-Mayonnaise.

1848
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,025
-Mayonnaise.
-Oyster sauce!

1849
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,928
HAPPY TO ENLIGHTEN HIM
WITH THE TASTE OF OYSTER SAUCE

1850
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:49,431
You should definitely
get some oyster sauce.

1851
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,766
He's okay with MSG.

1852
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,302
-That was amazing.
-That was so funny.

1853
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,137
My wife is watching, right?

1854
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,805
Honey, I've grown.

1855
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,141
Mr. Gourmet.

1856
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,110
That's so moving.

1857
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,612
-Se-dol the Gourmet.
-Se-dol the Gourmet.

1858
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,648
It's time to make a decision.

1859
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,385
-Wait, I have to be the judge.
-That's right.

1860
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:14,656
Both dishes
were unexpectedly well-received.

1861
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,091
<i>Press one for Fabri.</i>

1862
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,060
<i>Press two for Choi Hyun-suk.</i>

1863
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,396
Let's hear from Se-dol too.

1864
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:23,465
-We're hearing from Se-dol too.
-Yes, he knows what's good now.

1865
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,634
-This is tough.
-Fabri or Choi?

1866
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,805
Press one for Fabri,
and press two for Choi Hyun-suk.

1867
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,574
Please make your decision
and press the button.

1868
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,410
-Jeez.
-This is hard.

1869
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:38,046
-I picked one.
-You did? Okay.

1870
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:40,682
Just so you know, Se-dol chose…

1871
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:43,719
-Fabri.
-Fabri.

1872
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,523
-Fabri.
-That's really small.

1873
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:51,293
But Chan-won is the fridge owner.

1874
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,830
Let's find out who won the tripe round.
Please show us!

1875
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:56,932
Who did Chan-won choose?

1876
01:13:56,999 --> 01:14:00,736
<i>-Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and tripe, hey</i>
<i>-Hey</i>

1877
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,539
Will Hyun-suk
keep his sole lead once again?

1878
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:07,276
Or will Fabri drag him behind?

1879
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:10,512
Which tripe dish did Chan-won like better?

1880
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,614
Show us!

1881
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,583
Who did Chan-won choose?

1882
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,152
Who's the winner?

1883
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,687
FABRI WINS

1884
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:19,788
Fabri wins!

1885
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:23,192
CHEF FABRI'S TRIPE SOAP OPERA WINS

1886
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,028
Fabri wins!

1887
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,996
FABRI DEFEATS THE TOUGHEST OPPONENT

1888
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,566
HAPPY

1889
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,602
-We made the same choice twice.
-You two have the same appetite.

1890
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:36,472
I knew it! Se-dol now knows what's good!

1891
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,273
You two should be good friends.

1892
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,076
Se-dol, let's grab a bite to eat soon.

1893
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,545
-We should.
-Right?

1894
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,247
-You should.
-Yes, you should.

1895
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,583
Why did you pick Fabri's dish?

1896
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,718
Both dishes were made with so much effort,

1897
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:52,521
but it was the fact that
he made the mayonnaise from scratch.

1898
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:57,960
Of course, Chef Hyun-suk
put so much effort into his dish.

1899
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:00,195
But I also had another thought.

1900
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,198
I recently met with my younger brother
who's the pickiest eater,

1901
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:06,268
but I thought he'd probably eat this.

1902
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,669
-He must be like Se-dol.
-Yes, Se-dol.

1903
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:10,973
Seeing Se-dol almost made me feel like
I was with my younger brother.

1904
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,041
You should bring him here.

1905
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:14,476
HE NEEDS TREATMENT TOO

1906
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,911
They'll fix his appetite too.

1907
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,279
First of all…

1908
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,882
<i>I thank you</i>

1909
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,050
<i>Sincerely</i>

1910
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:23,452
<i>Thank you</i>

1911
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,954
Thank you.

1912
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,023
Fabri takes his third win.

1913
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,225
Congratulations on your third star.

1914
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,660
He takes the golden star.

1915
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,663
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations.

1916
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,131
A PREVIEW FOR NEXT WEEK'S EPISODE
WILL FOLLOW

1917
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,233
Please welcome today's fridge owners.

1918
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,402
Sunwoo Yong-yeo and Lee Joon!

1919
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,570
-Hello.
-<i>She always eats breakfast</i>

1920
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,071
<i>at a hotel in her luxury car.</i>

1921
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,841
<i>The fanciest 81-year-old in Korea.</i>

1922
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:47,442
It's great to be loved by young people.

1923
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,545
-It made me so happy.
-I bet.

1924
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,213
Food is really important.

1925
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,948
I don't like flour.

1926
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,016
Grease? No, thank you.

1927
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,117
How about sugar?

1928
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:56,018
Of course, no.

1929
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,653
-I can't fry anything or use grease?
-I can't cook.

1930
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,321
If you keep eating like that,
you'll die soon.

1931
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,822
A FRIGHTENING PHILOSOPHY ON FOOD

1932
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,292
<i>I'd like to have Ms. Sunwoo as my queen.</i>

1933
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,027
<i>I'll make a luxurious dish.</i>

1934
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,428
<i>The two prestigious chefs.</i>

1935
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,897
-It caught on fire!
-This is bad.

1936
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,299
What's going on, Gyeong-jun?

1937
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:11,667
Good grief. Sweet mercy.

1938
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,769
-It's a mess!
-He makes the spectators uncomfortable.

1939
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:15,337
-What's that?
-It's a horror special.

1940
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,738
-It's ruined.
-It's ruined?

1941
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,307
Isn't this discrimination?

1942
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:19,942
The best dancer in our show!

1943
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,376
THE NEW DANCER CHALLENGES HIM

1944
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:22,844
<i>I love both abalone and octopus.</i>

1945
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,046
<i>I enjoy seafood.</i>

1946
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,648
-That's huge.
-It's the best ingredient.

1947
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,418
It's absolutely delicious.

1948
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,552
She must love it.

1949
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:31,920
Please choose one.

1950
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,656
-Gosh, I don't know.
-She doesn't know.

1951
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,394
-Try this.
-Why do you only offer it to Young-kyu?

1952
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:42,331
Gosh, my mother-in-law
is making me eat too much.

1953
