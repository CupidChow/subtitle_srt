1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,718
You're watching <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
with two lovely fairies.

2
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,088
Jae-hyung was originally known
as the music fairy,

3
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,723
but his YouTube channel blew up.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,960
He's now in his second prime.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,228
<i>His content, </i>Fairy's Table,

6
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,765
<i>gets at least a million views</i>
<i>whenever it drops.</i>

7
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,133
-Oh, my.
-Yes.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,603
I mostly cook French home-style dishes,

9
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,905
<i>the ones I know how to make.</i>

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,409
<i>And I invite guests I want to meet</i>
<i>and chat with them over a meal.</i>

11
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,611
It's a simple YouTube channel.

12
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,413
Why did you choose to shoot it at home?

13
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,581
I lived in France,

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,852
and when you live abroad,
life never goes as you expect or want.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,957
One day, I went to my friend's place
and had a short chat in the kitchen,

16
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,093
and that was when
many of my problems were resolved.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,095
We had such a genuine conversation.

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,732
I realized chatting in the kitchen
can make people very relaxed.

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,233
-And genuine.
-Exactly.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,102
Because of that relaxing setting,

21
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,472
many stars who rarely appear
in variety shows

22
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,942
<i>still choose to appear on </i>Fairy's Table.

23
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,213
Are you just good at casting people?
Or is it because of that relaxing setting?

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,614
It's probably both.

25
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:26,086
-I came here today for Jung-hwan.
-I see.

26
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,555
-To get him on the show?
-That's right.

27
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,823
Let me tell you a behind-the-scenes story.

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:34,828
He once asked, "Can you get
Jung-hwan to come on my show?"

29
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,296
"I'll make something delicious."

30
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,532
To that, I said,
"He's already had his share of good food."

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,102
"And he never shares what's on his mind."

32
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,037
That's why he came here himself.

33
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,473
-I came to get him.
-To catch him.

34
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,007
-He came to get me?
-Yes.

35
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,709
I'll bring the contract later.

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,744
THE CONTRACT IS READY

37
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,514
You have to make something
that your guests like, right?

38
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,050
-Yes.
-Some people can't eat certain food.

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,852
They let me know first.

40
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,920
They'd tell me
that they have peanut allergy, or…

41
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,456
BURP

42
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,225
-I'm sorry.
-Did you just burp?

43
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,292
You had Coke and burped.

44
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,829
-It's the Coke.
-Come on, Jae-hyung! You were talking.

45
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,265
Stop drinking so much Coke.

46
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,968
Jeez. You were the first guy
who burped while talking.

47
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,203
-You said you were nervous.
-How bold of you.

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,638
You must feel more relaxed now.

49
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,306
Fairies don't burp.

50
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,376
-What fairy? That's just a lie.
-Come on.

51
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,278
Is this what he does on a show?

52
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,513
SNIP SNIP

53
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,081
OUR DEAR FAIRY IS QUITE HUMANE

54
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
Jeez.

55
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,885
-Yes, so what was the question?
-He's unbelievable.

56
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,921
-Have you ever ruined your dish?
-I have.

57
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,723
It was when Kim Go-eun came.

58
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,559
<i>I made rice and put it in the rice cooker,</i>

59
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,128
-but it wasn't cooked.
-You forgot to press the button.

60
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>You didn't press the button.</i>

61
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,064
You can invite me next time.

62
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,232
GO-EUN ALMOST WENT HOME…

63
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,934
-You just show everything as is.
-I do.

64
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,004
I prepare everything before they come,
so if something goes wrong,

65
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,539
it is what it is.

66
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,774
That's similar to what we do here.

67
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,777
He pretty much made
a knockoff version of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

68
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,012
A knockoff?

69
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,281
-A copycat.
-He copied it.

70
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,416
-He copied us.
-He copied it.

71
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,319
-He just changed the setting to his home.
-Right.

72
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,155
-Just like how we cook in that kitchen.
-Exactly.

73
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,390
There's no bed here.

74
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,125
-Do you have a bed on the show?
-No.

75
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,128
-That's what I thought.
-I just wanted to win.

76
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,964
It'll be great

77
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,801
if the guests he mentioned
come on our show too.

78
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,305
We're both trying our best
to take advantage of each other.

79
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,574
-That was pretty fierce.
-Of course.

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,276
If you want a bed,
we'll lay it out for you.

81
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,279
-We can do that.
-Let them lie down.

82
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,015
Go-eun, please come on the show.
We won't serve you raw rice.

83
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,651
-Of course not.
-We'll make delicious dishes. Join us.

84
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,119
All right.

85
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,522
Anyway, Sung-ju.
Have you been on his channel too?

86
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,357
Yes, I have.

87
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,826
<i>It was during the</i>
<i>2024 Paris Summer Olympics.</i>

88
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,228
He was there, actually.

89
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:54,234
So, it felt a bit like the initial guest
he had invited didn't show up.

90
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,136
Right, because it was the Olympics.

91
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,672
He would've cast sports stars or athletes.

92
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,740
But he invited you.

93
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,309
Right, he reached out to me
out of the blue and said,

94
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,211
"Hey, can we get to know each other?"

95
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,414
So I went to see him,
and oh, my.

96
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,484
It was a restaurant
on the first floor of a hotel.

97
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,152
When I went there,

98
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,488
I was stopped by the guard.

99
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,725
Then Jae-hyung came and said,
"Yes, that's him. Let him in."

100
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,594
You're exaggerating.

101
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,630
-"Let him in."
-In French?

102
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,698
-Yes, he's fluent in French.
-In French.

103
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,634
-He was a Parisian.
-He's fluent.

104
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,669
He said,
"How do you want your food, Sung-ju?"

105
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,604
I said, "Al dente."

106
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,576
WILL YOU COOK IT AL DENTE?

107
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,478
What was that?

108
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,946
He's good.

109
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,148
I'D LIKE SOME TEXTURE

110
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,316
Then the server goes…

111
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,684
EXCELLENT

112
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,885
And he'd go…

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,422
He's fluent in French.

114
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,192
So I asked,
"How long have you studied here?"

115
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,560
How long?

116
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,297
Well, here's the thing.
I studied film music for two years

117
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:02,435
and contemporary classical music
for five years.

118
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,106
-You were there for seven, eight years.
-Yes, that's right.

119
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:12,245
Jun-hwan didn't know
Jae-hyung studied in Paris.

120
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,681
He thought his thing
was just acting like a Parisian.

121
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,816
Just his thing?

122
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,551
He thought he acted like a Parisian.

123
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,020
He thought you were mimicking
people who live in Paris.

124
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,655
Is that true?

125
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,357
At first, I thought
he was just called that.

126
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,360
But I met him today and realized
he was actually fluent in French

127
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,329
and had lived in Paris for a long time.

128
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,663
I haven't said a word in French.

129
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,599
BUT FEELS LIKE YOU DID

130
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,869
-He heard a witness talk.
-He did speak French.

131
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,272
THEY KEEP HEARING FRENCH

132
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,608
When we think of Paris,
we think of glamour and fanciness.

133
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,945
SINGING

134
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,381
GLAMOROUS

135
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,816
-That's what we think.
-Yes.

136
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,417
Where did he learn to do that?

137
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,019
EVEN THE PARISIAN
DOESN'T GET HIS MUSIC

138
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,288
Are there any dishes you miss
when you think of that time?

139
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,190
There are. Yes.

140
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,158
<i>Confit de canard.</i>

141
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,426
<i>Confit de canard?</i>

142
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,796
-Duck leg.
-Is that the name of the dish?

143
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,700
Duck confit is a dish
made with salted duck legs.

144
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,771
It's usually cooked in duck fat
over low heat for a long time.

145
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,041
-In duck fat?
-Yes. It's a grilled dish.

146
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,843
-I see.
-I see.

147
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,445
It won't be easy to capture
Jae-hyung's appetite.

148
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,849
I'm just happy to be here
to eat whatever they make for me.

149
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,586
Gosh, you two are just like baby birds.

150
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,388
You just sit there
and eat whatever they give you.

151
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,257
-He knows as a cook himself.
-That's right.

152
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,459
It makes you feel anxious
when you cook for someone.

153
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,827
-You need to put in the effort.
-Right.

154
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,462
-It's not easy.
-It's not.

155
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,666
All right, let's go through
Jae-hyung's fridge.

156
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,002
<i>We have high expectations</i>

157
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,104
<i>of the ingredients we'll find.</i>

158
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,441
He probably has everything fancy.
All kinds of delicacies.

159
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,444
-But I don't eat much when I'm home.
-I see.

160
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,514
Otherwise, I can't stay in shape.

161
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,649
I eat very simple dishes at home.

162
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,718
-He makes do with what he has.
-I'm nervous.

163
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,221
What kind of ingredients
does Jae-hyung have in his fridge?

164
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,524
-We present his fridge!
-Here we go!

165
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,859
EVERYONE IS INTERESTED

166
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,694
WHAT KIND OF FANCY INGREDIENTS
DOES HE HAVE?

167
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,664
I'm already seeing caviar.

168
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,100
-He has caviar.
-He has all the good stuff.

169
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,501
You can see it right here.

170
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,804
Everyone has caviar in their fridge.

171
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,806
I'm sorry. I'm joking.

172
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,141
I don't.

173
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,677
Caviar. We just found a fancy ingredient.

174
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,712
Who did you serve caviar to?

175
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,849
-For Jennie.
-Jennie of BLACKPINK.

176
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,417
And I think j-hope.

177
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,986
He'll only open caviar
for people like Jennie and j-hope.

178
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,021
No, that's not the case.

179
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,556
IMMEDIATELY SLANDERING HIM

180
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,459
-It's only for top-class idol stars.
-You have to be that big.

181
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,327
-He hasn't opened the truffle sauce.
-He hasn't.

182
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,563
-He has truffle sauce.
-He does.

183
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,533
-Look at the cheese.
-He has so many of them.

184
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,669
So many varieties.

185
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,171
You must use lots of cheese to cook.

186
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,042
I do. Lemon, butter, cheese,
and other dairy products

187
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,311
are most prevalently used
in French cuisine.

188
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,313
These must be butter.

189
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,283
Yes, I do have quite a bit of butter.

190
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,685
-Bordier.
-That's really expensive.

191
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,954
-Oh, my.
-Is this soap?

192
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,021
-Soap?
-No.

193
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,991
-It looks like soap.
-It's hand-churned.

194
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,025
That's really good butter.

195
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,627
-Really?
-It's very expensive.

196
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,862
How much does a bar cost?

197
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,797
Probably over 10,000 won. It's not much.

198
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,965
For that little?

199
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,534
I have to use one whole bar
when I cook French food.

200
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,702
One whole bar?

201
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,403
You have kelp butter?

202
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,306
That's something I use for rice cookers…

203
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,042
No, I mean, rice in a stone pot.
I must be nervous.

204
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,612
-A stone pot, not a rice cooker.
-Yes.

205
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,182
I drop in a few spoons of that
when I make rice in a stone pot.

206
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,751
-It makes delicious rice.
-Rice in a pot.

207
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,819
What's this?

208
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,489
-Duck.
-Duck.

209
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,159
-Is this for the duck confit?
-Yes, it can be used for <i>confit de canard</i>.

210
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,263
It hasn't been cooked yet,
so it's just duck meat.

211
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,098
WATCHING CLOSELY

212
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,200
What do you usually do with this?
I heard something about fat.

213
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,669
-Yes, there's duck fat.
-Duck fat?

214
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,337
-You have duck fat?
-You have duck fat?

215
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,739
I do.

216
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,676
Duck fat and grilled potatoes
go really well with caviar.

217
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,780
-Right.
-It's a whole feast in your mouth.

218
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,716
The third shelf. What is this? Quail?

219
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,319
-Quail?
-It says quail.

220
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,854
I ordered this.

221
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,123
I wanted to serve this,

222
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,459
but I didn't know if guests would like it,
so I haven't served it yet.

223
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,628
This is the first time
we've seen quails on the show.

224
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,797
-Yes, it's a first.
-You're right. Goodness me.

225
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,733
I'm sure our chefs can cook with these.

226
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,435
His fridge is like a French kitchen.

227
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,003
He has lots of vegetables.

228
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,774
-Oh, my.
-Radishes. He has radishes.

229
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,444
-Radish. Red radishes.
-Radish?

230
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,479
-Dill. Wild chives.
-Wild chives.

231
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,615
You have lots of vegetables.

232
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,716
This is celery.

233
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,152
Are these carrots? Baby carrots?

234
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,354
-Mini carrots.
-These are called mini carrots?

235
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,123
-They're often used in Western cuisine.
-They are.

236
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,859
-Thyme. He has lots of herbs.
-He has thyme?

237
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,761
He's serious about cooking.

238
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,964
Isn't it rare for people
to have thyme in their fridge?

239
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,266
-It's like a restaurant fridge.
-It is.

240
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,835
-It's like a restaurant.
-There are lots of things.

241
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,338
I can see why you have guests over.

242
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,674
-And champagne.
-What is this?

243
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,810
I wanted to share…

244
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,911
WHOA

245
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,979
He has magnum champagne.

246
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,914
-Magnum?
-He has that?

247
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,315
-Really?
-Magnum champagne.

248
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,818
-Even a few chefs are surprised.
-That's crazy.

249
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,886
-Today…
-That shouldn't be in an ordinary fridge.

250
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,957
It's the most prestigious line
among champagnes.

251
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,660
And it's the bigger bottle, right?

252
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,462
Looks like it. It's huge.

253
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:33,499
-It's a perfect size for us to share.
-Really?

254
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,737
What are these? There's frozen food.

255
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,972
Yes, that's dessert.

256
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,140
He walked out.

257
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,643
I keep desserts just in case I need them.

258
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,211
I always keep one in the freezer.

259
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,713
-Potato gratin.
-Potato gratin?

260
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,116
-What's this?
-You left a mat in here.

261
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,918
-Yes, why did you freeze these?
-Pastry.

262
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,955
Isn't this a mat for your bathroom?

263
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,124
You leave this out in front of a bathroom.

264
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,394
-That's frozen dough.
-Frozen pie dough?

265
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>I use that to make quiche.</i>

266
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,097
<i>I've never seen such an ingredient before.</i>

267
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,167
-I thought it was an ancient document.
-Right?

268
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,237
-It's like a book.
-Yes, an ancient document.

269
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,106
-It's very thick.
-And large.

270
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,309
-And the main ingredients. Chicken.
-Chicken.

271
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,312
These must be chicken thighs.

272
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,681
Are these pork?

273
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,716
Yes, they're from Jeju…

274
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,252
No, some delicious…

275
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,387
He's walking out again.

276
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,891
This is pork shoulder,
and this is Jeju's… No, that's not it.

277
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,392
Anyway, it's supposed to be good.

278
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,063
This is pork shoulder,
and this is pork sirloin.

279
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,298
Look at the squid.

280
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,300
This looks like halibut.

281
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,435
-Halibut.
-Halibut.

282
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:47,139
Wait, look at these.
He has some Korean ingredients.

283
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,442
I found kimchi, everyone.

284
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,145
I recently went to Na-rae's place
to shoot <i>I Live Alone</i>

285
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,081
and got a batch after helping her make it.

286
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,583
-Yes, right.
-I still have some left.

287
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,052
-I see.
-It's kimchi I made with Na-rae, so…

288
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,620
-Yes.
-Please stay seated.

289
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,224
-Why do I feel so anxious?
-We'll manage.

290
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,560
-We'll do it.
-What is it?

291
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,229
-He has lots of sauces over here.
-He does.

292
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,165
These sauces
are all from different countries.

293
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,203
-Italy.
-Italy. This one's from Japan. French.

294
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,004
And Korean too.

295
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,073
He uses all these.

296
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,609
Let's take a look
at the room temperature ingredients.

297
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,212
What's this can?

298
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,414
It's canned <i>confit de canard</i>.
I bought it for the first time.

299
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,751
-So you just have to heat it up?
-Yes, that's what it says to do.

300
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,786
-But you haven't used it.
-I haven't.

301
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,554
-You have four cans.
-He must like it a lot.

302
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,691
He keeps tomato-related sauces
on the top shelf.

303
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:43,863
I love all things made with
San Marzano tomatoes.

304
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,931
It's a famous kind from Naples,

305
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,869
the best kind of tomatoes
grown near Mount Vesuvius.

306
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,904
-He has all these classy ingredients.
-Did you know?

307
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,172
It's the most delicious.

308
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,075
-I didn't know about Mount Vesuvius.
-It's from a volcanic area.

309
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,210
-Pompeii.
-Pompeii?

310
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,379
The volcanic outburst at Pompeii.

311
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,615
-You kept quiet, but finally got to talk.
-Yes, I have knowledge in that area.

312
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,682
Also, this is…

313
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,152
IT'S NOW NATURAL
FOR HIM TO SHOW THE INGREDIENTS

314
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,386
These are called cèpes.

315
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,256
-Oh, porcini mushrooms.
-I bought these porcini mushrooms.

316
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,659
-These are <i>girolles</i>, which I love.
-Chanterelles.

317
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,262
-<i>Girolles</i>?
-It's a mushroom.

318
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,663
Why? Do you know this?

319
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,099
-No, it sounded like a swear word.
-He has porcini and chanterelle.

320
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,434
FAN OF KIM POONG

321
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,004
-These must be from Japan.
-Right.

322
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,772
<i>-Katsuobushi.</i>
-Oh, these!

323
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,708
-This is <i>katsuobushi</i>.
-<i>Katsuobushi</i>. It's for Chef Kang-rok.

324
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,678
Chef Kang-rok had been wondering
when someone might come with <i>katsuobushi</i>.

325
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,713
-Really?
-He has them.

326
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,916
Can you win a star with this?

327
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,685
It has to come with kelp, though.

328
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,454
He has kelp butter.

329
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,391
-He has kelp butter.
-Kelp butter.

330
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,027
This is great news for Chef Kang-rok.

331
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,996
-That was all for Jae-hyung's fridge.
-That's all.

332
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,200
-There were lots of new ingredients.
-There were.

333
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,969
-He's a gourmet.
-As expected.

334
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,605
Let's find out Jae-hyung's order

335
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,907
and decide which chefs
will compete against each other.

336
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,677
Show us his first order!

337
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,080
-"French-tastic dish."
-"French-tastic dish."

338
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,548
-Like the language?
-The language?

339
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,318
-I can make a fanatical dish.
-"French-tastic."

340
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,787
-It must have different meanings.
-It does.

341
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,722
-It's a combination of two words.
-Right.

342
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,224
What kind of dish do you want?

343
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,661
-There are professional chefs here,
-Right.

344
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:28,033
so I wanted to taste something
more classy and luxurious.

345
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,437
You know, something so fantastic
that makes me utter French words.

346
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,305
What kind of words do you say?

347
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,608
<i>-C'est bon.</i>
<i>-C'est bon.</i>

348
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,010
Something that will make him give
the best compliment in French.

349
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,446
Here's the second order.

350
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,282
-I see. "A dish to stuff everyone."
-"A dish to stuff everyone."

351
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,952
You want something classy,
then stuff yourself. What is this?

352
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,088
I believe music and food

353
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,024
become more abundant
when you share with others.

354
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,893
I really hold to that belief.

355
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,528
So when I shoot <i>Fairy's Table</i>,
the production crew joins us

356
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,198
after the shoot ends,
and we all eat together.

357
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,201
I believe that's an important aspect.

358
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,470
I brought a bottle of champagne, remember?

359
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,105
-Will he open it?
-The champagne.

360
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,607
I want to have that with everyone
while we eat.

361
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,675
So are you asking them

362
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,744
to make enough food for everyone?

363
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,713
That'll be the cherry on top.

364
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,850
-How many people do we have? 12?
-That's not so easy.

365
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,287
You have to cook for 12 people.

366
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,923
12 SERVINGS IN 15 MINUTES?

367
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,026
-That's tough.
-Is that too much?

368
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,261
-It'll be a challenge.
-They can pull it off.

369
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,130
-They'll do it.
-Let them take on the challenge.

370
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,098
Now, choose your fight.

371
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,301
-I'll take…
-French or stuffing people?

372
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,936
-I'll take the French-tastic dish.
-Of course. I knew it.

373
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,171
-That suits him.
-The French-tastic dish.

374
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,241
What kind of French words
will you make him say?

375
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,843
-You know, <i>Oh là là.</i>
-<i>Oh là là.</i>

376
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,712
Yes, that's a French phrase.

377
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,616
A French chef took his place
for the French-tastic dish.

378
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,251
-I don't really know French.
-Okay.

379
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,354
-So I'll make a dish to stuff everyone.
-All right.

380
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,356
-Can he do it?
-You're on the slower side.

381
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,891
Can you cook for 12 people?

382
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,827
-He mentioned that he didn't eat a lot.
-Right.

383
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,963
-He doesn't eat a lot.
-I'll cook a bit for everyone.

384
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,498
We have Sam Kim and Kwon Sung-jun left.

385
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,934
-I'll take one.
-He raises his hand right away.

386
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,237
-I'll go with stuffing everyone too.
-Stuffing everyone.

387
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,607
This means Sam must make
a French-tastic dish.

388
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,144
HE HESITATED
AND DIDN'T GET TO CHOOSE

389
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,212
Is that okay?

390
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,081
I cooked Korean food last time.

391
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,283
THE ITALIAN CHEF
CAN'T COOK ITALIAN CUISINE

392
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,754
Now, let us begin the round
between Jong-won and Sam.

393
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,527
This is the first round
with Jae-hyung's ingredients.

394
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,330
Jong-won, the kind-hearted chef,

395
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:42,134
versus Sam, once a kind-hearted chef.

396
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,336
-He was once kind-hearted?
-Yes.

397
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,973
He's now called
Canine or the Lobbying King.

398
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,676
These days, he gets mad
at every question we ask.

399
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,578
It was because I used one pan.

400
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,146
I could've done better with three.

401
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,748
-I did it.
-You did?

402
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,082
I offered him 500,000 won

403
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,818
-and a bottle of EVOO on top of that.
-Yes, right.

404
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,588
I must've had some pent-up anger.

405
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,459
-From the previous season?
-It must be from a decade ago.

406
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,296
-This is why we need to vent.
-He held it back for far too long.

407
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,133
I just heard a loud voice
coming from the waiting room.

408
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,702
He said, "I'm an Italian chef!"

409
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,271
"Why do I have to make
a French-tastic dish?"

410
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,440
Exactly. Goodness.

411
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,277
That's not it.
I had to cook Korean food last time,

412
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,714
-and today, I have to cook French food.
-That's true.

413
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,848
-It's disadvantageous.
-But I mean,

414
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,850
then why didn't you choose first?

415
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,187
-Well, yes.
-You should've stepped in sooner.

416
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,992
I also hear Chef Jong-won
feels burdened about this round.

417
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,894
-If he wins, he just breaks even.
-Right.

418
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,096
-Yes.
-He's up against an Italian chef.

419
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,731
If he loses, he loses big time, right?

420
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,032
-He should resign.
-Right.

421
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,434
-Resign?
-Actually,

422
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,104
it's hard to make
what I'll make in just 15 minutes.

423
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,673
I don't know if it'll come out well,
but I'll do my best.

424
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,109
There are lots of French dishes

425
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,479
that require marination
and days of preparation.

426
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,148
So my request could've been too much,

427
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,883
but I'm grateful he gladly accepted.

428
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,685
-I rarely say something like this.
-Yes?

429
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,889
-But I've played in both countries.
-Oh, you have! That's right.

430
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,159
The two countries have
completely different types of dishes.

431
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,462
-They take great pride in their food.
-Absolutely.

432
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,963
They're completely different.

433
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,034
-It won't be easy for Sam to win.
-That's true.

434
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,936
That means France wins against Italy.

435
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,438
That's a very dangerous thing to say.

436
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,574
-That's a risky statement.
-He's right.

437
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,176
-You hear me?
-It really is.

438
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,879
Regular viewers have no idea.
It is what it is to them.

439
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,714
-It's a sensitive problem.
-Mr. Loach.

440
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,649
-Please be careful.
-Okay.

441
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,884
-That's funny.
-Mr. Loach.

442
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,854
Our producer had to put on his suit
and apologize after last week.

443
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,622
THE LOACH EPISODE
CAME WITH A GREAT BACKLASH(?)

444
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,592
You've tainted <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
with the color of poop.

445
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,929
Well, you could've given me
an ordinary order.

446
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,800
France and Italy are close
yet very distant countries.

447
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,468
-Yes.
-Is that so?

448
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,070
Whenever I go to Italy,

449
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,673
I usually make a stop in France
and familiarize myself with the food.

450
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,410
I think I get the kind of dish
you want to eat.

451
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,479
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
PASTRY DOUGH, PORCINI,

452
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,047
DIJON MUSTARD, MUSHROOM, CREAM,
CAPER BERRY, CHICKEN STOCK,

453
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,415
DILL, CARROT, THYME, BUTTER,
LEMON, HALIBUT, CELERY

454
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,451
My dish is called…

455
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,987
The lyrics for "Les Champs-Élysées."

456
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,624
I expected to only see fancy dishes
when I went to Paris.

457
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,762
But the first dish I had there
was simple, warm, and fragrant.

458
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,831
So the dish I'll make is

459
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,368
meunière with halibut.

460
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,572
You also had some mushrooms,
so I'll make rich mushroom soup.

461
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,308
If I have some time left,
I'll make carrot<i> rapées</i>, carrot salad,

462
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,943
and add in celery.

463
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,078
I thought it'd be delicious
to eat all three together.

464
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,414
-At the same time?
-Yes.

465
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,049
Is there a French dish called meunière?

466
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,350
It's called sole meunière.

467
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,820
It's a fish dish cooked
by continuously pouring butter over it.

468
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,390
It's a dish I really love.

469
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,358
And about the mushrooms I brought.

470
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,028
I'll use the dried porcini too.

471
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,798
I have some Italian mushrooms,
and he's going to use those.

472
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,567
So he'll use
some Italian cooking techniques.

473
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,002
-No, it's all French.
-It is?

474
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,039
-It's not Italian.
-Be careful.

475
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,106
-He'll get mad.
-I'm sorry.

476
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,510
He has good hearing now.
He can hear everything.

477
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,478
CHEF JONG-WON:
CANNED DUCK CONFIT, DILL,

478
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,047
FROZEN POTATO GRATIN, CANNED
CASSOULET, RASPBERRY VINEGAR,

479
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,515
WORCESTER SAUCE, DUCK LEG,
BEEF STOCK, RADISH, AND MORE

480
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,151
Chef Jong-won, what's your dish?

481
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,254
There's a famous French saying
people say before they eat, which is,

482
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,656
-"Bon appétit," right?
-Yes, bon appétit.

483
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,825
My dish is called Son Appétit.

484
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,293
-Son Appétit.
-Son Appétit.

485
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,997
-He changed it from bon to Son.
-Son Appétit.

486
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,434
-Can you explain it please?
-He said he liked <i>confit de canard</i>,

487
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,237
and he had a canned version of that,

488
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,772
so I'll use that as well as duck leg.

489
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,609
It won't be
a traditional <i>confit de canard.</i>

490
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,245
I'll add a personal touch to it
and make it my own.

491
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,779
He listened to what I was saying.

492
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,616
Yes, he won't take the easy way out.

493
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:55,721
Let us begin the French-tastic dish round.

494
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,524
He's here to show the class
of a one-star Michelin French restaurant,

495
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,193
Chef Son Jong-won.

496
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,496
This Canine villain is here
to teach him a lesson,

497
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,598
Chef Sam Kim.

498
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,533
-He's scary.
-Oh, goodness.

499
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,168
-The more he smiles, the scarier he is.
-How scary.

500
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,903
He's showing his true color.

501
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,672
He really is scary. I'm kind of nervous.

502
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,907
He's like Dracula.

503
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,811
Which one of the two chefs
will make Jae-hyung blurt out French?

504
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:24,316
-Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!
-Okay!

505
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,518
THE FIRST RETURN MATCH
IN THREE MONTHS

506
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,186
AFTER JANG WON-YOUNG'S EPISODE

507
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,254
This is a big match.

508
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,456
I hope you get a taste of France.

509
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,660
These dishes are all impossible to make
in 15 minutes.

510
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,528
-Is that so?
-Of course.

511
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,930
French dishes take a while to make.

512
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,532
This won't be easy.

513
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,602
MAKING GARLIC OIL
WITH CRUSHED GARLIC

514
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:48,640
Chef Sam usually prepares vegetables first
before he starts cooking.

515
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,809
He'll stir-fry mushrooms in butter

516
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,278
to make the mushroom soup.
That's the basics.

517
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,013
He's making mushroom soup first.

518
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,615
Yes, that's right.

519
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:03,255
2. ADD THYME, BROTH, AND CREAM
TO STIR-FRIED MUSHROOM AND BOIL

520
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,257
-There's so much tension here.
-I know.

521
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
There's a lot of tension in the air.

522
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,827
-This is fun.
-Indeed.

523
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,263
It's not easy to strike up a conversation.

524
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,931
They both get really mad.

525
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,667
Yes, and because it takes a while
to make the dishes.

526
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,035
JONG-WON BEGINS WITH CANNED FOOD

527
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,005
But they'll do their best.
So that's what's in the can.

528
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,807
That's cassoulet.

529
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:26,845
It's a stew made with duck,
sausage, pork, and more.

530
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,148
-It's a very time-consuming dish to make.
-I see.

531
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,151
Are those cans ready to eat?

532
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,187
Yes, they are,

533
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,091
but I think he'll use that
along with the duck leg to make his dish.

534
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,259
-Is that duck leg?
-It is.

535
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,262
He's removing the bone.

536
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,766
He's removing the bone from the duck leg.

537
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,770
It takes a while to cook the duck fully
with the bone intact

538
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,172
-and it can turn tough too.
-Right.

539
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,240
POWERFUL!

540
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,776
MUSCULAR ARMS

541
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,911
That was Jong-won.

542
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,781
ANTI-GOOD VIBES

543
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,684
Look at him. He's fast too.

544
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,252
Look at that duck.

545
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,190
1. SEASON CUT DUCK LEG MEAT
WITH SALT AND PEPPER, THEN GRILL

546
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,159
REMOVING
THE CHOPPING BOARD FOR MEAT

547
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,594
SPINNING

548
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,661
TAKING GLOVES OFF

549
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,430
AH-HA!

550
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,832
-He's cooking the duck right now.
-He is.

551
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,535
Is it necessary to push it down
as it cooks?

552
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,836
If you cook it with the skin side down,

553
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,605
-it'll shrink, right?
-Yes.

554
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,508
It'll make the meat curve.

555
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,412
-So he's doing that to keep it flat.
-I see.

556
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,881
-He's using halibut!
-Halibut!

557
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,049
Look at him.

558
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,485
Is he removing the scales?

559
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,021
-The skin.
-The scales?

560
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,389
-The skin?
-The skin.

561
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,625
The skin tastes delicious
when it's grilled,

562
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,995
but meunière is a soft, buttery dish
made after coating the fish in flour.

563
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,264
-Yes, I'm trying to make it softer.
-I see.

564
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,533
It's really soft.

565
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,001
He's holding it down.

566
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,736
BEING CAREFUL
SO HE DOESN'T DAMAGE THE FISH

567
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,138
That skin is too tough.

568
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,510
-He stripped the halibut naked.
-Meunière.

569
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,912
He's not filleting the fish.

570
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,580
He just stripped it naked.

571
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,283
-He kept the bones in.
-Are you not going to debone it?

572
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,552
-No, I'm keeping it in.
-You're keeping it in, right?

573
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,621
He'll cook that as is
in case the flesh breaks off.

574
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,356
He'll cook everything first.

575
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:22,060
-Jae-hyung knows everything they're doing.
-He does.

576
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,095
It's so much fun to watch the process.

577
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,765
The fight is between duck and halibut.

578
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,266
Duck versus halibut.

579
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,470
-It'll take a while for the duck to cook.
-It will.

580
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,306
NEXT INGREDIENT, RADISH

581
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,909
CAUTIOUS

582
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,512
2. CUT OFF THE RADISH TOP

583
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,081
NEXT, CARROT

584
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,487
IT'S AS IF HE'S WORKING
WITH A RULER

585
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,790
-He's also using a carrot.
-Yes.

586
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,525
They're both using carrots.

587
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,760
-He said he's making carrot salad.
-Yes.

588
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,964
He's peeling the skin off,
but I guess he's not throwing it away.

589
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,799
I'm not peeling the skin off.
I'm making thin slices.

590
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,635
-Oh, I see.
-He must be making salad with that.

591
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,570
Oh, by making thin slices.

592
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,372
-Rapées?
-Rapées.

593
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,773
I know what that is.

594
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,509
It's the current fad.

595
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,844
-Grated carrot salad.
-Grated carrot salad.

596
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,447
Is that peanut butter?

597
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,482
-It's Dijon mustard.
-Dijon mustard.

598
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,984
That's the name of an area.

599
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,587
The mustard from there
is one of the more expensive mustards.

600
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,923
It's like Cheongyang pepper.

601
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,291
Is that it?

602
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,193
UNTIL THE DUCK GETS COOKED,

603
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,395
WE CAN WATCH
THE MICHELIN-STAR CHEF COOK!

604
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,732
EVEN PIECES

605
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,634
He's so delicate.

606
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,701
AMAZED

607
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,104
DELICATE

608
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,373
THE DUCK IS ALMOST FULLY COOKED

609
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,941
BUTTER

610
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,576
THYME AND GARLIC

611
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,778
You have ten minutes left.

612
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,447
3. INFUSE GRILLED DUCK LEG
WITH BUTTER, THYME, AND GARLIC

613
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,516
-Jong-won is moving fast.
-He sure is.

614
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,951
It already looks delicious.

615
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,786
Jong-won is really quick.

616
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,688
-Is it his last name, Son, also hand?
-Sure.

617
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,890
DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT?

618
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,026
PAN-FRIED DUCK LEG IS DONE

619
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,128
That must smell so good.

620
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,732
WASHES THE PAN

621
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,568
SPINNING

622
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,270
It's going in the oven.

623
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,805
Oh, wow.

624
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,374
Gosh, he's really fast.

625
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,577
He cut off the flesh,
grilled it, then put it in the oven.

626
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,178
But it didn't take long.

627
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,448
He did everything in just six minutes.

628
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:27,619
Jong-won is on
a difficult journey right now.

629
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,588
Can he really finish everything?

630
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,124
I feel bad for making Jong-won do this.
The process is just…

631
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,261
MUSHROOM SOUP

632
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,230
Look at the color of the mushroom soup.

633
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,500
The mushroom soup.
He's blending the mushrooms.

634
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,135
-To make it smoother.
-Yes.

635
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,871
-It smells good.
-That must be so good.

636
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,774
I think Chef Sam also added thyme
to mushroom soup.

637
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,876
-Yes, I did!
-He did.

638
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,846
He has better hearing too.
He can hear everything.

639
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,215
I had to use thyme to add more fragrance.

640
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,885
It'll have a more complex fragrance
than regular cream soup.

641
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,188
UNLIMITED HERBS

642
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,255
What's that?

643
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,257
-Dill and parsley.
-Dill? Parsley?

644
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,228
HE GRABS TWO KNIVES?

645
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,763
-Double knives!
-Double knives!

646
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,298
-Double knives! Double-knife technique!
-Double knives!

647
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,001
DOUBLE-KNIFE TECHNIQUE

648
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,069
Look at him go!

649
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,137
OH, MY

650
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,538
GLANCES

651
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,276
HE QUICKLY SPLITS THE BEAT

652
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,247
-He's doing it!
-He keeps chopping!

653
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,615
HEHE

654
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,484
-The Michelin-star chef!
-So fast.

655
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,419
I should try that.

656
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,555
I don't think Sam can do that!

657
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,057
-I can.
-You can?

658
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,125
I can.

659
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,694
DROPPING A BAR OF BUTTER IN FURY

660
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,863
He got annoyed.

661
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,998
WHO MADE SAINT SAM LIKE THIS?

662
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,834
-He's getting annoyed.
-He's easily irritated.

663
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,236
-You can?
-Are you going to do it?

664
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,705
I have too much to do right now.

665
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,774
Gosh, double knives.

666
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,475
He pretty much destroyed those.

667
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,912
Parsley butter.

668
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,581
-He's making herb butter.
-Herb butter.

669
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,684
Wasn't that butter 10,000 won per bar?

670
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,352
-Yes, Bordier butter, the expensive one.
-Right?

671
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,921
-It guarantees great flavor.
-It guarantees deliciousness.

672
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,890
SPINNING IT AROUND FOUR TIME

673
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:16,261
A QUADRUPLE SPIN

674
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,763
PULLING OUT ANOTHER PAN

675
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,900
Is it because these are French dishes?
They keep using butter.

676
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,168
-Right.
-Yes.

677
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,336
-He's using lots of butter.
-He's using lots of butter.

678
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,039
-This is a tough challenge.
-Halibut.

679
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,810
There's the halibut.
He's using that expensive butter.

680
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,878
The 10,000-won butter.

681
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,315
He must be cooking that over low heat.

682
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,516
He's cooking it in butter.

683
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,453
-Butter burns in high heat.
-That's why.

684
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,622
HE'S READY TO SERVE IT ALREADY?

685
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,558
I think the soup is already done.

686
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,126
It'll turn cold
if you serve it too quickly.

687
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,296
Was that bread dough?

688
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,397
-Pastry dough.
-Pastry dough.

689
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,933
He'll cover it with that
and put it in the oven.

690
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,835
It's the French touch.

691
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,470
He'll cover it and bake it.

692
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,205
That must be really good.

693
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,875
It'll take a while
for the pastry dough to get baked.

694
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,845
-He can do it in high heat.
-That is French style.

695
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,380
It'll smell like flour
if it's undercooked.

696
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,217
-He has seven minutes to cook that.
-Seven minutes.

697
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:16,020
I wonder if they'll have enough time.
They're both running short.

698
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,790
I feel bad doing this to them.

699
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,658
I don't think I should bother them.

700
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,361
-They can't talk.
-They're both focused.

701
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,964
You have six minutes or so now.

702
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,968
-They don't have enough time.
-The process is just…

703
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,069
-What's that?
-It's cheese.

704
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,504
-Is that cheese?
-Yes.

705
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,072
-Is that cheese?
-It's potato.

706
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,141
-Potato.
-Potato, that frozen one.

707
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,076
-I'm sorry.
-The gratin.

708
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,944
Oh, the gratin.

709
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,515
-The one we saw earlier.
-The frozen gratin.

710
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,718
-It wasn't cheese.
-He's adding a garnish.

711
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,689
A COMPILATION OF GOOD VIBES
WITH HIS PET TOWEL

712
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,725
TEMPERATURE CHECK!

713
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,995
THE END

714
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,897
Are those capers?

715
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,032
-Caper berries.
-Caper berries.

716
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,268
Fresh capers, I see.

717
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,736
7. FINELY CHOP CAPER BERRIES
AND DILL

718
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,539
HOW'S THE HALIBUT?

719
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,908
Gosh, everyone, it's the meunière.

720
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,076
He's making meunière
by pouring butter over the fish.

721
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:16,648
-He continues to shower the halibut.
-Continuously.

722
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,485
He strips it naked first,
then coats it with butter.

723
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,886
Like taking a shower.

724
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,322
He's washing the halibut's back.

725
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,625
-Sung-ju, we only have five minutes left.
-Yes?

726
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,561
-Come on.
-I'll go out.

727
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,564
-Please tell us how it's going.
-I almost missed the mark.

728
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,333
Things look very tense right now.

729
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,101
The meunière.

730
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,504
-The meunière.
-He keeps showering the fish with butter.

731
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,640
Look how Sam is focused
on making the meunière.

732
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:47,212
He's using butter too.
He's showering something too.

733
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,814
He's showering that with butter,
and he's showering this with butter.

734
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,351
French cuisine
is all about showering the food.

735
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,153
-Sung-ju!
-Yes?

736
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,988
Can you taste each chef's butter?

737
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,524
The butter? I think it'll taste the same.

738
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,626
Keep showering it.

739
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,328
He used up all the butter.

740
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,865
-He's using a lot of butter.
-Yes, he is.

741
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,734
-Should I taste the butter?
-He's putting in more.

742
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,769
More butter?

743
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,471
-I need even more.
-You put in more.

744
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,340
-Is that necessary?
-That's how it is.

745
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,242
-That's how it is.
-That's how it is.

746
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,743
-Really?
-The mushroom soup.

747
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,511
-The mushroom soup he made.
-Mushroom soup?

748
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:21,613
It's in the oven. Don't open it.

749
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,281
-Where's the mushroom soup?
-Right there.

750
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,382
-Here it is.
-Don't open it!

751
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,751
Let me taste the remaining soup.

752
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,753
-Gosh.
-Nice color.

753
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,989
So? Is it French-tastic?

754
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,459
Is it French-tastic?

755
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,527
Gosh, man.

756
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,929
He looks cocky.

757
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,732
I feel like I'm walking down
the Champs-Élysées.

758
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,037
As expected of Sam. This is who you are!

759
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,538
You have 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

760
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,908
-Is it good?
-It was excellent.

761
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,044
SWOOSH

762
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,514
That's the duck. He put in so much work.

763
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,150
-It's out. The duck is out.
-It looks so good.

764
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,452
What's this?

765
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,755
He's working with lots of ingredients.

766
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,258
YELLOW HERB BUTTER
ON TOP OF RED RADISH

767
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,862
-He's making radish beurre.
-That's radish with butter.

768
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,132
There's a lot going on.
I don't know how it'll taste.

769
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,100
9. PUT HERB BUTTER BETWEEN
RADISH AND SPRINKLE SALT

770
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,835
It'll taste refreshing.

771
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,771
They look like cherries.

772
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,106
He made that shape?

773
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,808
FIXING

774
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,877
FIXING

775
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,713
-Let me wring out some and try it.
-Yes, try some!

776
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,983
-He just put this between that vegetable.
-Right.

777
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,318
Okay.

778
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:38,222
Does the flavor show you the Eiffel Tower?

779
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,425
I'm 100 m away from the Eiffel Tower!

780
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,060
-Gosh.
-You're close!

781
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,964
I think I've had this
during the last Olympics.

782
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,131
-Really?
-Yes.

783
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,866
You have 2 minutes and 13 seconds.

784
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,768
What's that? Balsamic vinegar?

785
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,538
-No, Worcester sauce.
-I see. Worcester sauce?

786
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,839
10. MIX WORCESTER SAUCE,
BEEF STOCK,

787
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,240
RASPBERRY VINEGAR, BUTTER
TO MAKE SAUCE

788
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,308
He's using more butter.

789
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,077
The halibut is ready.

790
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,212
Gosh, look at that.

791
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,449
ADDING DILL AND CAPER BERRIES

792
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,185
INTO THE BUTTER
THAT COOKED THE HALIBUT

793
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,223
PLATING HALIBUT MEUNIÈRE

794
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,061
The halibut is almost fully ready
as halibut meunière.

795
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,398
You just need the mushroom soup
to be ready.

796
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,735
I'm looking at the soup from out here,

797
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,137
-and I can see the bread rising!
-Oh, really?

798
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,640
The pastry dough has risen quite a lot.

799
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,742
This is looking great.

800
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,510
-Don't open it until you're done.
-He's right.

801
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,646
Until you're done…
That must be the side dish.

802
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,248
-It's to go on the side.
-I see.

803
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,817
-This is a French home-style dish.
-Yes.

804
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,288
-He's done making a little side dish.
-Nice.

805
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,758
-Sam is just…
-It's out.

806
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,494
-That's French home-style cooking.
-Yes.

807
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,963
-You have a minute left!
-One minute!

808
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,533
-You have a minute left!
-One minute! One minute left!

809
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,668
-Don't open it.
-One minute left!

810
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,937
So? Do you want me to turn the heat off?

811
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,307
-He's stacking everything. That's amazing.
-I see.

812
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,876
He's turning it into a shape.

813
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,646
-Jong-won looks at the time.
-They made French dishes in 15 minutes.

814
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,549
This is simply unbelievable.

815
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,987
-Jong-won is putting in a lot of work.
-This is crazy.

816
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,422
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

817
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,923
TOUCHED

818
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,426
-Thirty seconds!
-Don't open it.

819
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:25,430
The mushroom soup is still in the oven.

820
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,432
You have twenty seconds left.

821
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,133
He's cutting the duck.

822
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,169
-He's assembling it.
-This is crazy.

823
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,504
-Fifteen seconds.
-It's too hot.

824
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,640
LASTLY, THE SAUCE

825
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,444
-He's assembling it.
-This is crazy.

826
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,280
-Fifteen seconds.
-It's too hot.

827
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,414
GOLDEN BROWN

828
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,083
Ten, nine, eight,

829
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,851
seven, six,

830
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,920
five… Sam is done.

831
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,889
USING TWEEZERS
TO ADD DUCK LEG MEAT

832
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,759
HE CAN'T MISS OUT
ON THE DETAIL UNTIL THE END

833
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,662
-Three, two, one.
-The sauce.

834
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,965
That's it. The end. It's over.

835
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,900
That was so tense.

836
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,369
There's a standing ovation.

837
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,940
-You really made French home-style dishes.
-You did this in 15 minutes.

838
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,374
Home-style cooking versus fine dining.

839
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,144
Oh, darn it.

840
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,679
ANXIOUS

841
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,913
I forgot to top it with this.

842
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,583
I just need to put it on the halibut.

843
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,319
I also forgot something.

844
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,921
-What did you forget?
-I had to top it with fig jam.

845
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,059
Chef Sam finished cooking first.

846
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,528
Is there something you want to say
before Jae-hyung digs in?

847
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,866
The halibut will taste great
with some thyme on top,

848
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,434
but I finished without doing that.

849
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,271
But Chef Jong-won
also happened to forget something.

850
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,007
-Did you two talk it out?
-They both forgot something.

851
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,777
I should've topped it with fig chutney
for a sweet touch, but I forgot.

852
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,147
-He needs to top it with that.
-That sounds great.

853
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,715
We'll let you do that.

854
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,583
It's reeking of a French kitchen.

855
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,684
ADDING THYME
ON TOP OF THE HALIBUT

856
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,320
You didn't have enough time
to top it with thyme.

857
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,623
-He ran out of time.
-Right.

858
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,558
-He couldn't do it.
-It smells great.

859
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,027
Fig jam is a must for duck.

860
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,896
-That's right.
-That plays a big part.

861
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:10,468
Now, please try
Chef Sam's O Sam-Élysées first.

862
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,970
Look at these.

863
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,072
It looks like home-style cooking.

864
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,109
HALIBUT SHOWERED IN BUTTER

865
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,514
CHEF SAM KIM'S O SAM-ÉLYSÉES

866
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,816
-May I bring a bottle of champagne?
-It smells great.

867
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,952
Do these dishes pair well with champagne?

868
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,355
Yes, of course.
Especially so for the fish dish.

869
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,326
I added thyme
before I covered it with the pastry dough.

870
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,228
So don't open it all at once,

871
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,031
but make a little cut
and enjoy the smell first.

872
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,333
He says it'll smell great.

873
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,102
I can really smell the butter.

874
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,939
-It smells so savory.
-I see.

875
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:52,009
-He'll remember his days in Paris.
-Of course.

876
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,978
-I hope he begins to speak French.
-Right.

877
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,346
It looks really good.

878
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,349
He's trying the mushroom soup.

879
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,520
GULP

880
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,324
-It's so good.
-He says it's really good.

881
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,660
That'll keep the soup much hotter.

882
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,264
-It keeps it hot for a long time.
-I see.

883
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,400
It must taste so good with champagne.

884
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,771
-That pair is pretty much paradise.
-Indeed.

885
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,909
-I bet it pairs really well together.
-It goes well with champagne.

886
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,110
It must be fantastic.

887
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,312
He's pretty much in Paris.

888
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,982
STUTTERING

889
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,620
-He began to speak in a dialect.
-I'm on Champs-Élysées.

890
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,689
-It's the thyme and the mushroom.
-The mushroom.

891
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,993
I feel like
I'm walking down a country lane.

892
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,361
He can sense nature.

893
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,763
And now, he's trying the halibut.

894
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,399
That's French home cooking,
halibut meunière.

895
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,635
Gosh, the halibut looks so soft.

896
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,637
Fish dishes are expensive in France.

897
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:53,738
You're right.

898
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,507
A TASTE OF FRANCE HERE
ON CHEF & MY FRIDGE

899
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,242
He gets to taste it here on the show.

900
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,680
-He hasn't said anything in French.
-No.

901
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,448
I hope he does that soon.

902
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,017
This is freaking delicious.

903
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,451
LAUGHING

904
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:12,089
-Koreans swear when food is really good.
-We do.

905
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,058
<i>C'est super bon</i>.

906
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,228
-That means, "it's really delicious."
-<i>C'est super bon</i>.

907
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,230
-So it means it's super good.
-It's the best.

908
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,032
It's seasoned perfectly too.

909
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,967
It's just a bit salty.
It's just how I like it.

910
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,703
The soup is a bit bland,
so it whetted my appetite.

911
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,105
Then I fell straight into the sea.

912
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,674
INTO THE SEA
WITH THE HALIBUT DISH

913
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,410
He sure sounds like a gourmet.

914
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,179
Why are you wearing clothes
from an Italian brand?

915
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,184
You're wearing Italian
from your head to toe.

916
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,753
He's wearing Italian
while ordering French.

917
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,422
He went to a French restaurant
dressed in Italian.

918
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,023
-And the salad.
-Salad.

919
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,693
He made thin slices of carrots.

920
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:49,760
Yes.

921
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,498
CRUNCH

922
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,201
Is France appearing
before your eyes again?

923
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,670
CLAPPING

924
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,507
Why is my mouth watering?

925
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,277
He used
a generous amount of Dijon mustard.

926
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,079
So that sharp taste

927
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,449
has to blend well
with the sweetness of the carrot.

928
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,786
-It's really good.
-I'm jealous.

929
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,023
<i>-C'est super bon. C'est parfait.</i>
-I see.

930
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,691
Super good, I see.

931
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:24,929
And next, the dish of nostalgia.

932
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,263
<i>Confit de canard.</i>

933
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,601
FRENCH GRILLED DUCK
ON TOP OF POTATO GRATIN

934
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,872
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S SON APPÉTIT

935
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,707
May I use my fingers?

936
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,978
HE GRABS RADISH WITH BUTTER
WITH HIS FINGERS!

937
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,249
NODDING

938
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,689
Does it feel like France?

939
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,257
That's not okay.

940
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,092
-The butter is too greasy, right?
-No, your face.

941
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,160
Oh, me?

942
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,997
The flavor of the butter

943
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,300
completely took over my mouth,
much more than the radish.

944
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,104
I think that's very distinct
to French cuisine.

945
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,507
And now, the duck dish.

946
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,842
-Top it with a bit of chutney.
-Okay.

947
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,513
He almost ran back home
after seeing the loaches last week.

948
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,417
He was like, "I wouldn't have come
if I had known it'd be like this."

949
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,919
But he looks quite touched now.

950
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,088
-He forgot all about the loach.
-The loach.

951
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,425
What's wrong? What is it?

952
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,394
It's impossible
for this combination to taste bad.

953
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,196
It's seriously so good.

954
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,000
The two are in a zone
with this French dish.

955
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,768
What will he say in French now?

956
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,170
Will he say, "<i>Oh là là</i>"?

957
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,938
<i>C'est sublime.</i>

958
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,807
-Slimy?
-No.

959
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,777
It means it's the best. It's sublime.

960
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,180
-Sublime.
-Sublime.

961
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:50,848
RELIEVED

962
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,583
This dish is very shocking to me

963
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,786
because the bottom layer is frozen food,

964
00:40:55,853 --> 00:41:00,458
and the next is heated
canned <i>confit de canard</i>.

965
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,561
It brought out
the nutty flavor of the duck even more.

966
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,031
And because it's topped with duck leg,

967
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,334
it's nutty yet very fresh.

968
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,471
And this fig jam on top

969
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,105
make this the best combination.

970
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,310
First, let's try Chef Sam's dish,
O Sam-Élysées.

971
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,880
-This is the mushroom soup.
-Right.

972
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,518
HIS EYES WIDENED

973
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,320
-What is it?
-This is

974
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,921
full of aroma.

975
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,859
-You're right.
-It has a strong mushroom smell too.

976
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:38,996
It goes really well
with the thyme as well.

977
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,131
Yes, the mushroom soup
gives you a taste of nature.

978
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,101
Next, the meunière.

979
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,736
How's the halibut?

980
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,204
EYES WIDENED AGAIN

981
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,139
It doesn't have that fishy taste.

982
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,308
It tastes fresh,

983
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:55,379
but I can also taste
the oily butter flavor.

984
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,149
SCRATCH

985
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:04,855
HE'S ABOUT TO EAT THE PLATE TOO

986
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,359
HE TAKES A SIP OF THE CHAMPAGNE
HE WAS SO JEALOUS OF

987
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,594
-Oh, man.
-It's a team dinner.

988
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,731
-He's at a team dinner all alone.
-He's really enjoying it.

989
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,399
What are you doing, Nam-no?

990
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,001
Sir, can you clear this table?

991
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,504
He's eating it off the bone.

992
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:26,143
This is a dish that everyone knows
if they have ever made Western cuisine.

993
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,579
The easiest and the hardest thing
is to control the sourness.

994
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,581
But it was done perfectly.

995
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,016
It tastes refreshing.

996
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,218
What did you put in for the sourness?

997
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,922
-Lemon juice.
-Lemon juice and caper berries.

998
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,056
I see.

999
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,925
Okay, now, the salad.

1000
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,428
It may taste unfamiliar.

1001
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,230
It's long like noodles,

1002
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:50,134
so it creates a different texture
and makes it more fun to eat.

1003
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,903
-Put everything into your mouth.
-It must be so fresh.

1004
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,506
HE QUIETLY STEALS(?) THE CARROT
SALAD JUN-HWAN WAS EATING

1005
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,410
What are you doing, Chef Hyun-suk?

1006
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,245
I was worried something might be in this.

1007
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,414
So I acted as a taster
to check for poison.

1008
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,382
-But I already ate it.
-Court Lady Choi.

1009
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,018
-I had it first.
-You should've tasted it first.

1010
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,554
-Court Lady Choi.
-You ate his leftovers.

1011
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,389
This time, Chef Jong-won's dish.

1012
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,792
-The fig jam.
-Yes.

1013
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,126
-Oh, wow.
-<i>Confit de canard</i>.

1014
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,730
This is crazy. He's a crazy man.

1015
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,498
THE CRAZY DISH WAS ACKNOWLEDGED
BY THE CRAZY MAN

1016
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,001
This is duck meat.

1017
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,172
MMM

1018
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,740
<i>Oh là là.</i>

1019
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,476
-"<i>Oh là là</i>."
-What was that?

1020
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,978
He's speaking French
instead of Jae-hyung.

1021
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,646
It was French-tastic for him.

1022
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,081
Dou you like it?

1023
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:41,418
It's really good.
The fig jam goes so well with the duck.

1024
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,320
I love that combination.

1025
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,155
-I should taste Chef Jong-won's dish.
-Okay.

1026
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,690
-Chef Jong-won…
-The duck meat.

1027
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,125
I have to do this.

1028
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,628
Yes, someone must check.

1029
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,263
DROP

1030
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,232
Why did you put the empty plate there?

1031
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,770
-Why did you put the empty plate there?
-Do you want him to clean up?

1032
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:03,774
What was that?
You should've put it in front of you.

1033
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,776
-Give us an honest review.
-How is it?

1034
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,045
Gosh, this is…

1035
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,980
I have a feeling
it might be a bit too salty.

1036
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,017
It's not overly salty.
It has great balance.

1037
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,786
He also threw in raw duck meat
to add to that.

1038
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,489
-Right.
-People who love wine

1039
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,858
would down a whole bottle with this.

1040
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,560
-It makes you crave wine and champagne.
-It does.

1041
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,497
It's time for you to make a decision.

1042
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,466
-It's finally time. Make your decision.
-It's so hard.

1043
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,502
-Gosh, wait.
-You have to decide.

1044
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,936
The evaluation is solely yours.

1045
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,705
Press one for Son Jong-won.

1046
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:36,907
Press two for Sam Kim.

1047
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,777
This is so evil.

1048
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,680
-Yes, exactly.
-It's not easy.

1049
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,082
Make your decision only by the taste.

1050
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,784
By your standards.

1051
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,851
All right.

1052
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,020
-Have you decided?
-Yes.

1053
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,155
He pressed it.

1054
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,924
All right, Son Jong-won versus Sam Kim.

1055
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,293
-Who did Jae-hyung choose?
-Who is it?

1056
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,561
Let's find out!

1057
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,230
-A French-tastic dish.
-Who will it be?

1058
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,700
Will it be Sam the Italian chef?

1059
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,069
Or Jong-won the French chef?

1060
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,871
Jae-hyung! <i>Oh là là</i>!

1061
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,073
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

1062
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,776
Who's the winner?

1063
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,344
SON JONG-WON WINS

1064
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,679
It's Jong-won!

1065
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,348
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S
SON APPÉTIT WINS

1066
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,318
-Jong-won wins!
-Great work.

1067
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,353
The French chef wins.

1068
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,222
-It was a tough decision.
-Actually,

1069
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,392
the decision wasn't about
which was more delicious.

1070
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,361
-Both their dishes were equally excellent.
-Right.

1071
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,298
I guess Chef Jong-won's dishes
hit the nostalgic aspect a little more.

1072
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,999
-You're right.
-Right?

1073
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,069
I actually almost choked up earlier.

1074
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:43,707
It's my first time
seeing someone cook for me

1075
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,309
made exactly to my order.

1076
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,211
I'm really moved.

1077
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,714
-I can't look that way right now.
-You can't.

1078
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,716
-Sam is glaring at you.
-I'm not.

1079
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,918
-He's showing his temper.
-I'm really not.

1080
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,121
Sam, does this feel unfair?

1081
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,388
No, the thing is,

1082
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,224
I don't like French cuisine anyway.

1083
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,692
HOLDING A GRUDGE

1084
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,794
Italian cuisine is the best.

1085
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,330
-Come on now, Sam.
-That's fair.

1086
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,931
I love Italian cuisine.

1087
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,301
-That's right.
-Of course. But he did his best.

1088
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:15,239
Now, Chef Jong-won gets Jae-hyung's star!

1089
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,341
ON A ROLL
WITH 3 CONSECUTIVE WINS

1090
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,842
-Chef Jong-won takes his fourth win…
-Thank you.

1091
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,377
…and the fourth star.

1092
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,579
-Congratulations, Jong-won!
-Congratulations!

1093
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,248
Four wins!

1094
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,117
-He already won four times?
-Gosh.

1095
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:31,789
This is the second round
with Jae-hyung's ingredients.

1096
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,124
The winner of <i>MasterChef Korea</i>,
Choi Kang-rok.

1097
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,094
The winner of <i>Culinary Class Wars,</i>
Kwon Sung-jun.

1098
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,097
The never-before-seen big match.

1099
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,666
-The match between the winners.
-This is big.

1100
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,334
Now, here's the problem.

1101
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,370
Kang-rok won twice and lost five times.

1102
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,705
Sung-jun won twice and lost four times.

1103
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,075
They're neck and neck.

1104
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,711
-Again, this is a lot of pressure.
-I bet.

1105
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,313
But Kang-rok is better off.

1106
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,816
-He is?
-He caught the big fish, Hyun-suk.

1107
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,118
-He did.
-Indeed.

1108
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,955
If you think about it,
he's up against Hyun-suk's proxy.

1109
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,256
How do you feel?

1110
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,892
When it comes to revenges,

1111
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,696
a baby's revenge is always the scariest.

1112
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,303
The pupil usually trains oneself
to get their master's revenge.

1113
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,272
-"I'll get my master's revenge!"
-Right.

1114
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,042
My master taught me a lesson.

1115
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,678
"Do not fret over winning
or getting stars."

1116
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,648
-I'll cook only to satisfy Jae-hyung.
-All right.

1117
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,584
He's too much.

1118
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,985
What's with this place?

1119
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,388
Gosh, they're becoming one.

1120
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:43,861
Chef Hyun-suk, shouldn't you give
a word of advice to Baby Hyun-suk?

1121
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:45,662
-Be careful.
-Yes.

1122
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,763
Choi Kang-rok

1123
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,832
is an eagle.

1124
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,101
-He began to fly.
-Okay.

1125
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,437
But Chef Sung-jun

1126
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,172
is a phoenix egg.

1127
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,507
-A phoenix egg?
-Yes.

1128
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,143
-The egg is slowly breaking.
-Okay.

1129
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,045
-Once he breaks out of the egg…
-Yes?

1130
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,214
…an eagle would be easy to…

1131
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,618
So you're a phoenix?

1132
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,887
He's a phoenix, and he's a phoenix egg.

1133
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,489
-A man born from an egg.
-"Born from an egg?"

1134
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,324
IT'LL GO DOWN IN THE LEGEND OF
CHEF & MY FRIDGE

1135
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,027
-Like Bak Hyeokgeose.
-Egg Sung-jun.

1136
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,263
-Egg Sung-jun, huh? Goodness.
-Phoenix egg.

1137
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:23,333
Anyway, Chef Kang-rok,
are you traumatized by his hairstyle?

1138
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,468
GLANCES

1139
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:28,405
That was his hairstyle
during <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

1140
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,340
-Oh, that's right.
-He has a crack on the side.

1141
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,675
He does.

1142
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,844
-You mean, his parting.
-A crack?

1143
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,546
-It's not a crack.
-Yes, right.

1144
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,449
There's a crack on the egg!

1145
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,485
There's a crack on the phoenix egg!

1146
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,922
He'll hatch very soon!
A crack on his head?

1147
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:47,391
Do you find that parting uncomfortable?

1148
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,959
Well…

1149
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,528
I find it a bit frightening.

1150
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,531
-His hairstyle.
-Yes.

1151
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,067
I noticed that Chef Kang-rok

1152
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,671
was jealous of my abundant hair.

1153
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:04,241
If I may ask, do you wear a hat
because you don't have much hair?

1154
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,243
I was actually nicknamed the bald eagle.

1155
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,181
That was why.

1156
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,184
The eagle we usually speak of
is the bald eagle.

1157
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,888
You're awful. You called him an eagle
and attacked him from the start.

1158
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,289
WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE AN EAGLE?

1159
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,424
I'M SORRY

1160
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,259
CHEF SUNG-JUN:

1161
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,760
MUSTARD, DILL, SUN-DRIED TOMATOES,
HONEY, LEMON, SHALLOT,

1162
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,362
CHEESE, RASPBERRY VINEGAR,
BASIL PESTO, BUTTER, CELERY, ETC

1163
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,798
The dish I'll make is called

1164
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,267
Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna.

1165
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,769
-"Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna."
-"Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna."

1166
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,272
-Oh, lasagna.
-Are you making lasagna?

1167
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,808
It's not your ordinary lasagna.

1168
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:38,909
It's called <i>maltagliati</i>.

1169
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,779
It's a Northern Italian dish
made with broken lasagna pasta

1170
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,082
by crushing it into irregular pieces.

1171
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:48,118
If I translate it liberally,

1172
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,953
it can be called
"anti-good vibes lasagna."

1173
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,222
-Anti what?
-Anti-good vibes.

1174
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,959
Good vibes,
like you have vibes that are good.

1175
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,128
I'll also make crunchy chicken

1176
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:01,198
with creamy Tuscan sauce

1177
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,935
made with tomatoes, vegetables, and cream.

1178
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,804
It'll be a mild dish we can all enjoy.

1179
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,606
The chicken will be the source of protein,

1180
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,241
and the pasta will be the source of carbs.

1181
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,877
-You can dip bread in the remaining sauce.
-It sounds good.

1182
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,579
So Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna

1183
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,381
and stuff ourselves to the brim.

1184
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,915
-I see.
-That's what I've prepared.

1185
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,717
-Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna
-Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna

1186
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,887
-and stuff ourselves to the brim.
-and stuff ourselves to the brim.

1187
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,823
CHEF KANG-ROK: PORK SIRLOIN,
KATSUOBUSHI, KELP BUTTER,

1188
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,892
YUJA PONZU, DRIED RADISH, LEMON,
NAPA CABBAGE, AND YUZU KOSHO

1189
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,495
Chef Kang-rok, what's your dish?

1190
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,664
I'll make Jeongol Fairy.

1191
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,667
-It's called Jeongol Fairy?
-Yes, Jeongol Fairy.

1192
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,904
Are you going to be
Jeongol Fairy instead of Braising Fairy?

1193
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,039
A bit diluted.

1194
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,841
Yes, I'll make <i>jeongol</i>, hot pot, today.
It's called Jeongol Fairy.

1195
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,844
I took a closer look at his fridge

1196
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,282
and found quite a lot of
Japanese ingredients.

1197
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,952
So I want to make Japanese cuisine,
which is my expertise.

1198
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,821
-I'm going to make Japanese-style <i>jeongol</i>…
-Okay.

1199
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,024
-…by using pork.
-I see.

1200
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,693
Chef Sung-jun,
I heard you were very confident

1201
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,529
about cooking for 12 people.

1202
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,397
I was assigned to kitchen police duty
during my military service.

1203
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,532
He has an advantage.

1204
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:11,134
So I can cook for 12 people
with my eyes closed.

1205
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,904
Then, can you do it with your eyes closed?

1206
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,706
-It was a figure of speech.
-Is that so?

1207
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,509
Let us begin the last round.

1208
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,080
He's here to take down Baby Hyun-suk
after winning against Hyun-suk.

1209
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:27,684
Kang-rok, the winner of <i>MasterChef Korea,</i>
wants to take down the Show-off Chefs.

1210
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:32,389
He's here to take Kang-rok down smoothly
just like his sleek and smooth hair.

1211
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:36,560
Sung-jun, the winner of
<i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

1212
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,429
This is the biggest match
between the strongest of two shows.

1213
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,866
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1214
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:45,836
Begin!

1215
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,706
Above all, you must make enough
for everyone.

1216
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,008
You need to make at least 12 servings.

1217
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,910
HE STARTS BREAKING
THE LASAGNA SHEETS

1218
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,479
He's breaking those.

1219
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:59,883
-He's breaking the lasagna sheets.
-He's breaking them into the water.

1220
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,752
-It's an intriguing dish.
-I bet. I bet it'll be good.

1221
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,989
That'll add a variety of
interesting textures.

1222
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,126
Chef Sung-jun, what's that meat?

1223
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,393
Chicken thighs.

1224
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,761
-Chicken thighs.
-Chicken thighs.

1225
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,531
AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT FOR 12 PEOPLE

1226
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,066
Black pepper.

1227
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,103
He'll need to make a lot
for all of us to feel stuffed.

1228
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,438
Indeed.

1229
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,174
What is he using?

1230
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,943
-Dried radish.
-Dried radish?

1231
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,478
He soaked it in water and put it in.

1232
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,615
HE BRINGS OUT PORK

1233
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:32,883
What's the cut?

1234
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,251
-Sirloin.
-I see.

1235
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,253
Chef Kang-rok, is that pork?

1236
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,122
-Yes, he's pounding pork sirloin.
-I see.

1237
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,493
IMMERSED

1238
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,930
He wants to use thinly sliced pork,
but because it's rather thick,

1239
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,632
he's pounding on it to thin it out.

1240
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:49,733
Right, I see.

1241
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,635
Why are you thinning it out?

1242
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,237
It'll be too tough if it's thick.

1243
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,973
-He wants to tenderize the meat.
-He's tenderizing it.

1244
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,609
And he's cutting it up into thin slices.

1245
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,478
I have a question.

1246
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:05,248
-Isn't it faster to stack it and cut it?
-Right?

1247
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,484
But he's cutting one slice at a time.

1248
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:11,555
It's because he may have
too much time left in the end.

1249
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,124
In case he has too much time left?

1250
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,226
-He has to fill up the time.
-Right.

1251
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:19,196
-He doesn't have too many ingredients.
-He doesn't.

1252
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,932
HE REPEATS
TO GET 12 SERVINGS READY

1253
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,700
Soup dishes are better

1254
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,502
-when they're boiled for a long time.
-Well said.

1255
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:30,040
But he spent about three minutes
on preparing the meat.

1256
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,375
Shouldn't you make the broth first?

1257
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,110
Just give me a minute.

1258
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,279
Right. I was just worried.

1259
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,982
-We're waiting.
-Yes.

1260
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,052
-It takes too long to cut one slice each.
-Cut it all together.

1261
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,119
FRUSTRATED

1262
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,323
He's stacking the meat.

1263
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,025
-He's finally doing it.
-He's stacking it now.

1264
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,595
-He could've done that earlier.
-He couldn't go on like that.

1265
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,631
He just threw in pork.

1266
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,933
That's how he's using the dried radish.

1267
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,402
Is he using dried radish
to make the broth?

1268
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,870
People often use radish to do so.

1269
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,472
HE USES DRIED RADISH
INSTEAD OF RADISH

1270
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,541
-You got it in Japan, right?
-Yes.

1271
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,977
I wanted to try using that

1272
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,479
because it soaks in water quickly.

1273
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,384
3. COAT SEASONED CHICKEN THIGHS
WITH FLOUR

1274
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,486
DUCK FAT

1275
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,554
Is that duck fat?

1276
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,356
He's mixing it with duck fat.

1277
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,825
Chef Sung-jun, what's that butter?

1278
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,794
-I put in butter and duck fat.
-Duck fat.

1279
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,096
I slightly coated the chicken with flour,

1280
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,964
and I'll cook it slowly
in butter and duck fat.

1281
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,399
He just put the chicken

1282
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:33,403
into duck fat and butter.

1283
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,773
It'll be really delicious
to cook chicken in duck fat.

1284
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,442
5. ADD CRUSHED GARLIC AND ROSEMARY
INTO THE PAN WITH CHICKEN THIGHS

1285
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,379
-That looks good. It'll taste savory.
-He'll probably pan-fry those.

1286
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,482
PREPARING THE VEGETABLES

1287
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,386
PEELING THE CELERY SKIN FIRST

1288
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,222
HE HAS TO PREPARE 12 TIMES
THE USUAL AMOUNT

1289
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,557
-You had shallots?
-Yes.

1290
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,993
-He had shallots.
-He did.

1291
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,964
-Chef Sung-jun is using baby carrots.
-Shallots and baby carrots.

1292
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,066
A BOWL FULL OF VEGETABLES

1293
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,069
-Look how fast he is.
-Oh, my.

1294
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,672
Sung-jun is moving very quickly.

1295
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,308
-Look at how fast he is.
-Listen to that sound.

1296
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,311
So he moves the hand with the knife,
and brings the ingredient next to it.

1297
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,980
AUTOMATICALLY WAITING

1298
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,415
Look how fast he is.

1299
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,450
He's really fast.

1300
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,718
He even glances around.

1301
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,487
HE CAN SPARE TIME TO LOOK AROUND

1302
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,723
CHOP! CHOP! CHOP! CHOP!

1303
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,960
KANG-ROK CHOPS TOO

1304
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,296
That was the fastest

1305
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:36,066
-Chef Kang-rok has chopped so far.
-That's right.

1306
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,102
Sung-jun is chopping shallots,

1307
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,037
while Kang-rok is chopping green onions.

1308
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,807
There's a bit of a difference in speed.

1309
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,209
He's slower than Chef Sung-jun.

1310
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,178
He's so easily affected.

1311
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,815
Well, performance isn't everything.

1312
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,883
-Yes, it just has to be delicious.
-Indeed.

1313
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,453
Why does he seem so relaxed?

1314
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,988
HE USES NAPA CABBAGE TOO

1315
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,358
He's using napa cabbage.

1316
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,693
It's game over
once cabbage goes into the soup.

1317
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,364
HE PUTS THE CABBAGE INTO THE POT
WITHOUT TURNING THE HEAT ON

1318
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,500
-What about the heat?
-What? I should do that now.

1319
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:11,835
-You're doing it now?
-Thanks.

1320
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,837
He's worried he'll be done too quickly.

1321
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,207
Why is the heat so low?

1322
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,043
Why won't he bring it to a hard boil?

1323
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,212
I have to season this.

1324
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,713
Give me a minute.

1325
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,148
-You're seasoning it?
-Yes.

1326
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,884
Are we all going to share
that one pot of <i>jeongol</i>?

1327
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:33,156
Just keep cooking.

1328
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,991
I'm sorry for asking.

1329
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,960
He ends up glitching.

1330
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,796
That looks really good.

1331
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,632
He threw in mushrooms and everything
into the pan with the chicken.

1332
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,067
8. PUT OLIVE OIL INTO A PAN

1333
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,636
AND FRY CRUSHED GARLIC, SHALLOT
AND TOMATO SAUCE

1334
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,372
-Tomato sauce.
-Tomato sauce.

1335
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,609
-From Naples.
-Are you making pasta sauce with that?

1336
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,444
Yes, the tomatoes are from Naples.

1337
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,779
He can't live without Naples.

1338
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,747
THE FLAVOR
FROM MATFIA'S HOMETOWN(?)

1339
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,315
The tomatoes aren't overly crushed.

1340
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,185
-There's still a bit of texture.
-Yes.

1341
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,555
9. ADD CREAM, CELERY
AND BASIL PESTO

1342
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,725
INTO THE TOMATO SAUCE
TO MAKE CREAM SAUCE

1343
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,027
He added pesto to the rosé sauce.

1344
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,862
-He added pesto to the rosé sauce?
-Yes.

1345
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,664
Is it okay to add basil pesto to that?

1346
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,833
I'm not sure.

1347
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,202
10. ADD SUGAR AND BLACK PEPPER
TO THE CREAM SAUCE

1348
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,372
Chef Sung-jun's dish
has become very colorful.

1349
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,941
It looks so good.

1350
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,077
Is that an orange?

1351
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,479
-Lemon.
-Lemon?

1352
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,414
How are you going to use that?

1353
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,418
I'll put lemon peels into the <i>jeongol</i>.

1354
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,420
-The peels.
-Like you're using the zest.

1355
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,689
It'll taste bitter
if the whites of the peel go in.

1356
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,559
That's why he's cutting it out.

1357
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,760
Just the outer layer.

1358
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,930
-Yuzu is used often in Japanese cuisine.
-They do.

1359
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,731
But he's using a lemon instead.

1360
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,767
I wonder when someone will have yuzu.

1361
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:54,637
Chef Kang-rok is still waiting
for someone with yuzu.

1362
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,707
The bitterness of lemon
comes from the white parts?

1363
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,543
Can't you use a potato peeler?

1364
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,111
-You can.
-You can, right?

1365
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,313
It'll be even thinner.

1366
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,148
That's not how you learn it
at culinary schools.

1367
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,382
Oh, they don't?

1368
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,552
COOKING DILIGENTLY
JUST AS HE LEARNED

1369
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,654
-What the…
-What's wrong?

1370
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,022
-What's with the time?
-Seriously.

1371
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,325
It's so frustrating
to see him do that with a knife.

1372
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,961
Just peel it with a potato peeler.

1373
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,763
5. REMOVE WHITES OF A LEMON
AND JULIENNE JUST THE OUTER LAYER

1374
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,765
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds.

1375
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,567
-You're halfway through.
-Halfway through.

1376
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,935
Time flies.

1377
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,738
-What's that? Yuzu kosho?
-Yes, yuzu kosho.

1378
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:29,806
It is.

1379
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,608
That's called yuzu kosho.

1380
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,812
It's a mix of green yuzu peels
and green chili peppers.

1381
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:36,946
It goes well with soup dishes.

1382
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,350
Aren't you supposed to bring
that dish to a hard boil?

1383
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:43,520
The flavor comes out stronger
when it's boiled over low heat.

1384
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,655
Is that so? There was a reason.

1385
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,124
-Chef Kang-rok, was that kelp butter?
-Yes.

1386
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,593
He put in kelp butter.

1387
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,362
He threw in kelp butter.

1388
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:53,897
He didn't have any kelp.

1389
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,598
-Yes.
-It's to season the soup.

1390
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,934
He's throwing in the vegetables.

1391
00:58:58,735 --> 00:58:59,802
Cooking wine.

1392
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,974
You can already tell these dishes
are from two different countries.

1393
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:09,512
11. PUT COOKED LASAGNA SHEETS
INTO THE SAUCE AND BRING TO A BOIL

1394
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,148
-Look at the pasta.
-It's the broken lasagna sheets.

1395
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,984
That pasta will give it
an interesting texture.

1396
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,054
That's hot.

1397
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,124
THE SAUCE SPLATTERED
BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH

1398
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,794
IT'S NOT EASY
TO COOK 12 SERVINGS

1399
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,462
Whoa, the time.

1400
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,831
You have 5 minutes and 12 seconds.

1401
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,433
Gosh, the lasagna.

1402
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,769
HE PUTS THE LASAGNA
INTO AN OVEN-PROOF DISH

1403
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,972
-He's now…
-He has to bake it in the oven.

1404
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,540
Are you going to bake that?

1405
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,108
-Yes.
-Oh, it's going into the oven.

1406
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:40,109
Right now?

1407
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:43,046
-Five minutes. Please go, Jung-hwan.
-Yes.

1408
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:46,649
SUNG-JUN IS IN A RUSH

1409
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,118
Oh, man.

1410
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,854
That sauce is perfect for dipping bread.

1411
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,623
It'll taste great with baguette.

1412
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,428
That looks so good. That chicken.

1413
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,131
Chef Kang-rok,
you're making a simple dish.

1414
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,033
You threw in pork and cabbage.

1415
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,002
Why won't you boil it over high heat?

1416
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,071
It's a dish you eat
while boiling it slowly.

1417
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,772
-Slowly?
-I see.

1418
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,308
-He'll serve it in the pot while it boils.
-All right,

1419
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,845
why don't you taste the soup right now?

1420
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,246
-This?
-Yes.

1421
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,948
How does the soup taste right now?

1422
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,416
It's not seasoned at all.

1423
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,552
You have to keep track of the change.

1424
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,855
-The pork isn't even cooked yet.
-You're out there to taste the food.

1425
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,423
-But it looks good.
-But the pork isn't cooked yet.

1426
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,792
-It's okay. You can eat undercooked pork.
-How's the soup?

1427
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,095
Please try the <i>jeongol</i> soup.

1428
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,162
Not yet.

1429
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,731
It has to be good.

1430
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,499
-It has to be.
-It must taste refreshing.

1431
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,101
But he hasn't boiled it for long.

1432
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,803
Will it stuff you?
Or do you feel stuffy and frustrated?

1433
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,140
-Stuffy and frustrated.
-It's not ready yet.

1434
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,775
It's not seasoned yet.

1435
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:49,612
He just threw in everything,
so it's only now ready to be cooked.

1436
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,414
-But it still tastes like nothing.
-I see.

1437
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,182
-He only has 3 minutes and 20 seconds.
-I know.

1438
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,852
It tastes way too bland.

1439
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,955
-Please wait.
-Why don't you turn up the heat?

1440
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,460
13. TOP THE LASAGNA WITH BRIE
CHEESE AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES,

1441
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,030
THEN BAKE IT IN THE OVEN

1442
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,498
Which cheese did you use?

1443
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,200
-Brie.
-Oh, Brie cheese.

1444
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:14,704
PHEW

1445
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,041
Everything is in the oven now.

1446
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,076
-Did you start the oven?
-I did.

1447
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,344
The timer hasn't started.

1448
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,112
What? Damn it.

1449
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,647
The timer hasn't started.

1450
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,582
-What? Damn it.
-Oh, no!

1451
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,084
The timer hasn't started!

1452
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:31,521
-It just started thanks to me.
-Thank you.

1453
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,423
-That would've been bad.
-So it wasn't preheated?

1454
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,992
-We have to check these things.
-Yes.

1455
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,293
I preheated it.

1456
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,731
14. BLEND SOUR CREAM, HONEY, HOT
SAUCE, DILL, RASPBERRY VINEGAR,

1457
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:46,903
OLIVE OIL, ESTRAGON MUSTARD,
AND BLACK PEPPER

1458
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,037
There's nothing to taste.

1459
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,006
This is too bland. He hasn't even begun.

1460
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:53,109
Jung-hwan, you should try it again
now that we have two minutes left.

1461
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,744
-Let me try it again.
-Great.

1462
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,246
-I'm using a new spoon.
-Tell us if it changed.

1463
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,314
It looks good.

1464
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,384
Sung-jun's dish is still in the oven.

1465
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,821
So? How's the <i>jeongol</i>?

1466
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,391
It tastes the same to me.

1467
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,625
CRYING

1468
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,494
It's still a bit bland.

1469
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,097
-You have 1 minute and 50 seconds.
-It's still a bit bland.

1470
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,466
He's putting in <i>katsuobushi</i>
into broth bags.

1471
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:17,867
Right, <i>katsuobushi</i>.

1472
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,902
He's finally using it.

1473
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,305
-He still seems relaxed.
-He does.

1474
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,740
He only has a minute left.

1475
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,908
He can't infuse it for too long.

1476
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:29,879
Wait, I taste that savory flavor
toward the end.

1477
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,115
It'll change with <i>katsuobushi</i>.

1478
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,349
-Yes, right.
-It'll be different when it gets colder.

1479
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,152
You're putting that in now
with only a minute left?

1480
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,253
-Is that okay?
-Yes.

1481
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,688
Hurry up!

1482
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,290
Hurry up! Man, this is frustrating.

1483
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,859
You don't put it in
when the broth is boiling.

1484
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,127
You have to put <i>katsuobushi </i>in

1485
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:48,064
when the temperature is under 100 degrees
because that's when it gives out flavor.

1486
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:51,367
And he'll pull it out quickly
after soaking it for a bit,

1487
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,902
or else it'll taste too strong and bitter.

1488
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,737
Oh, I didn't know that.

1489
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,142
SUNG-JUN BLENDS THE SAUCE

1490
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,410
HE GRABS A SPOON, BUT…

1491
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,513
Damn it.

1492
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,615
-What? Damn what?
-The spoon.

1493
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,917
-The spoon.
-Was there an accident?

1494
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,819
-Was there an accident, Sung-jun?
-No.

1495
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,088
Things look chaotic here. What is it?

1496
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,723
I'm done. It's the sauce.

1497
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,726
-The sauce.
-The sauce.

1498
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,128
It would've been bad
if I hadn't started the oven.

1499
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,065
KANG-ROK HAS HIS EYES
ON THE JEONGOL

1500
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,568
Kang-rok has made a decent amount of food.

1501
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,537
It would've been bad
if I hadn't started the oven.

1502
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,406
He's going to taste the soup.
Jung-hwan, can you help him out?

1503
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,241
-You have one minute!
-One minute.

1504
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,177
-You have one minute!
-One minute.

1505
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,611
-One minute!
-Thirty seconds.

1506
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,113
UGH

1507
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,482
-Kang-rok, is it good?
-Wait.

1508
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,317
He had it and went, "Ugh."

1509
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:42,385
Is something missing?

1510
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,287
-Do I eat this with these bags?
-No.

1511
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,755
-Will you fish them out?
-I'll take them out.

1512
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,290
-Let me try it again.
-It's just for the aroma.

1513
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,825
It looks hot.

1514
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,226
THE 3RD TASTE TEST

1515
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,461
How is it? He has 40 seconds left.

1516
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,529
Forty seconds.

1517
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,698
Forty seconds.

1518
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,368
Nothing changed?

1519
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,637
I feel like I've also become Mr. Slow.

1520
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,273
-It tastes the same to me.
-Nothing has changed?

1521
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,442
He should season it.

1522
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,878
-Yuzu kosho.
-He's using yuzu kosho.

1523
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,546
Are you not going to use salt?

1524
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,948
Right. No. It's…

1525
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,050
Wait, you should season it.

1526
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,419
Will he be able to finish it?

1527
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,324
HE GETS DIPPING SAUCE READY

1528
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,459
CHECKING THE TIME

1529
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,862
HE OPENS THE OVEN

1530
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,330
It smells amazing.

1531
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,434
HE GRABS A LEMON AND CHEESE

1532
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,537
Sung-jun, are you hiding?

1533
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:37,707
He's ready. The lasagna is ready.

1534
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:38,808
He's grating lemon zest on top.

1535
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,244
-You have 15 seconds left.
-Look at this.

1536
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,846
He's grating all kinds of cheese.

1537
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,615
-Eight seconds. Seven.
-Eight. Seven.

1538
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,750
-Six, five,
-It looks good.

1539
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,785
-four, three,
-Four. Three.

1540
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,288
-two, one.
-two, one.

1541
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,356
-It's over.
-It's over.

1542
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,825
-Hit the bell.
-The bell.

1543
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,127
-Hit the bell.
-The bell.

1544
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:00,630
-He wants to hit it later.
-Kang-rok.

1545
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:03,299
KANG-ROK INTENTIONALLY
REFUSES TO HIT IT

1546
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,736
-He wants to hit it later.
-Why won't you hit it?

1547
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:07,970
PLEASED

1548
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,106
Hit the bell.

1549
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,976
CHOI KANG-ROK'S
JEONGOL FAIRY IS DONE

1550
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,411
He refused to hit the bell on purpose.

1551
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,480
He wanted to boil it for longer.

1552
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,615
-He wanted to serve it later…
-Don't turn it off.

1553
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,550
…so he waited for Sung-jun.

1554
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,486
The burner.

1555
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,354
You're using a burner? That'll work.

1556
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,457
-Oh, he's using a burner.
-It'll keep boiling.

1557
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,393
-What about these?
-They're beans.

1558
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,895
-Did you put these in?
-I couldn't.

1559
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,664
-You couldn't?
-I forgot.

1560
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,831
It's not too important.

1561
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:39,936
Just like that, they've finished
making these dishes for Jae-hyung.

1562
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,138
It's different when you cook for one

1563
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,307
compared to when you cook for 12.

1564
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:49,145
We saw them sweating
and working hard while cooking.

1565
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,881
Also, Chef Sung-jun
forgot to use these beans.

1566
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:52,949
What?

1567
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,184
And?

1568
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,753
-So he's eating it.
-You're eating it?

1569
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,322
Yes, it's good.

1570
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:02,692
Did he also copy
how I left out ingredients?

1571
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,063
That's not something you should copy.
Don't leave out ingredients like him.

1572
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,733
First, Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna
by Chef Sung-jun.

1573
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,169
Will you break it into 12 servings?

1574
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,737
CHICKEN MEETS LASAGNA
IN TOMATO CREAM SAUCE

1575
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:21,177
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
LET'S SHARE CHICKEN AND LASAGNA

1576
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,180
-It's meaningful because we'll share.
-Of course.

1577
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,182
Jae-hyung is off to get the champagne.

1578
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,217
THE FAIRY FETCHING HIS CHAMPAGNE

1579
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,152
He's going to open that huge bottle today.

1580
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,656
-Gosh, the magnum.
-It's huge.

1581
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,260
This is meaningful because we're eating
and drinking together.

1582
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,695
It's the coolest
if he opens it without a big sound.

1583
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:40,763
Yes, that's it.

1584
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,898
HE'S THAT CLASSY!

1585
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,266
He popped it quietly.

1586
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,769
-First, Chef Kang-rok for cooking.
-This is important to him.

1587
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,904
He pours a glass for the chefs who cooked.

1588
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,073
He's such a loving fairy.

1589
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,942
-Yes.
-He's so warm-hearted.

1590
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,977
-He's Fairy Jae-hyung after all.
-Fairy Jae-hyung.

1591
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,279
He wanted to share it with everyone.

1592
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,150
-He's the first to bring a bottle for us.
-He is.

1593
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,452
He's so warm-hearted.
That's a pretty pricey bottle.

1594
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,421
It has to come out to 12 servings.

1595
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:06,789
It's more than enough.

1596
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,425
-Is it?
-Yes, I made it for 12 people.

1597
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,627
Gosh, he made it exactly for 12.

1598
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,465
-Hyun-suk is the only one helping him.
-Of course.

1599
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,633
Which one should I give him?

1600
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:21,103
-Give Jun-hwan the best one.
-Yes, right.

1601
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,373
You should pick the best one
to give to Jae-hyung.

1602
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,441
THIS GUY

1603
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,445
Jae-hyung is the evaluator.

1604
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:33,382
-This looks good, Jun-hwan.
-Thank you.

1605
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,453
-We're in for a treat thanks to the order.
-Right?

1606
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,355
-A dish to stuff everyone.
-Yes.

1607
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,657
You popped open a champagne,
so please make a toast.

1608
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,325
-Say something.
-<i>Santé!</i>

1609
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,827
What does that mean?

1610
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,062
-Health.
-I see.

1611
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,630
I want to wish for everyone's good health.

1612
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,298
-<i>Santé!</i>
-Cheers!

1613
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,666
-<i>Santé!</i>
-Thank you.

1614
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:51,734
Stay healthy, everyone.

1615
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,536
Let's make a toast.

1616
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:54,637
This is nice.

1617
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,741
Are we allowed to do this during a shoot?

1618
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,210
-We're in for a treat.
-It's such a treat.

1619
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,379
It'll go well with the food.

1620
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,747
-Shall we?
-Can we dig in?

1621
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,216
-Can we eat too?
-Yes, of course.

1622
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:09,585
THE FRIDGE OWNER DIGS IN

1623
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,487
So you made chicken, right?

1624
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,022
-Yes, chicken thighs.
-Right.

1625
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,890
-It's so tender.
-I broke up lasagna sheets.

1626
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,992
You can mix it up with the sauce.

1627
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,395
Let's Share Chicken and Lasagna.

1628
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,197
He says it's meaningful
when we eat together.

1629
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,500
THE FRIDGE OWNER
SAVORS THE FLAVOR

1630
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,039
AND EVERYONE ELSE
CAN DO THE SAME TODAY

1631
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,810
THIS GUY SLURPS

1632
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,345
HAPPY

1633
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,514
-The chicken is cooked so well.
-You're right.

1634
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:43,519
-He used lots of butter to make it crispy.
-He almost braised it.

1635
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,222
-Gosh, it's so refreshing.
-It is.

1636
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,058
THIS IS WHAT
SHARING HAPPINESS IS

1637
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,261
What's this refreshing touch?

1638
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,762
I added raspberry vinegar in the sauce.

1639
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,732
-I see. It was vinegar.
-I used raspberry vinegar.

1640
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,570
AGAIN, TODAY
IS JUN-HWAN'S CHEAT DAY

1641
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,939
HE EATS AND EATS

1642
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,441
It's good.

1643
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,909
AND EATS SOME MORE

1644
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,045
Gosh, Jun-hwan cleaned out his plate.

1645
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,547
GONE

1646
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,916
-You said…
-Ten pieces of penne.

1647
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,351
Last week, you were…

1648
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,785
Why would he eat the loaches?

1649
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:20,022
He's enjoying the chicken dish.
Do you like it?

1650
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,290
It's really good.

1651
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,993
-I can smell something exotic too.
-I see.

1652
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,061
It's boosting my appetite.

1653
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,663
<i>There's this distinct aroma.</i>

1654
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,099
<i>I added dill in the sauce…</i>

1655
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,302
<i>-and a bit of lemon zest.</i>
-He's grating lemon zest on top!

1656
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,738
I love that refreshing touch.

1657
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:40,809
This sauce with dill
goes so well with the chicken.

1658
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:41,877
A GREAT COMBO

1659
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,846
He's like Doctors Without Borders.

1660
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,682
He's a Chef Without Borders.
It's delicious.

1661
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:50,252
He goes back and forth
between French and Italian cuisine.

1662
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,122
-It's a festival on the show today.
-Indeed.

1663
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,558
It's nice to eat and chat together.

1664
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,893
It'd be nice if we could always do this.

1665
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,496
-We can eat and share stories.
-Yes.

1666
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,332
Chef Hyun-suk, any concerns?

1667
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,733
Making a living.

1668
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,069
We have to share these stories.

1669
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:11,540
What about you, Jun-hwan?
Do you think you can win a gold medal?

1670
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,276
-Well…
-Let's get his honest take.

1671
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,879
-The shoot is over.
-He may not feel like that.

1672
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,147
Wait.

1673
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,483
That was such a good bait.

1674
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,086
He could've caught a tuna with that.

1675
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:26,188
He threw a really nice bait.

1676
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:27,389
THE FISHING FAIRY OF TALK SHOWS

1677
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,326
But there's a possibility you can win it
after the Asian Games, right?

1678
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:33,829
No matter what the competition is,
the process is the most important.

1679
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:38,434
I got to eat delicious dishes
both last week and this week,

1680
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,971
-so it will have a positive impact on me.
-A good energy.

1681
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,873
-Please take that energy.
-Yes, right.

1682
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,676
THE DOPPELGÄNGERS
PUT ON A MUKBANG

1683
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,679
My goodness, look at those two.

1684
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,682
Ho-young and Nam-no,
have you two been starving?

1685
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,552
It's even more delicious
when you eat it out of the pan.

1686
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,787
From the pan? How is it?

1687
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,323
I'm sorry, but while we were chatting,

1688
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,425
Chef Rok began to look grim.

1689
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,627
The soup will boil down!

1690
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,731
-It's boiling down. We have to eat that.
-Hurry.

1691
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:11,433
Chef Rok, will you serve this to us?

1692
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,335
PORK AND CABBAGE JEONGOL
WITH A HINT OF KATSUOBUSHI AROMA

1693
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:18,107
CHEF CHOI KANG-ROK'S
JEONGOL FAIRY

1694
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:21,310
Chef Kang-rok made a wise decision.

1695
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,945
He let us drink,
then relieve the hangover.

1696
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,047
-Right.
-Was that his move?

1697
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,617
He'll let us leave
with a comfortable stomach today.

1698
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,786
It smells so good.

1699
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,889
-The cabbage looks good.
-Yes, it looked good.

1700
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,624
-Thank you.
-He made more than I thought.

1701
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:36,692
Look at this.

1702
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:37,793
Oh, wow.

1703
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:42,464
-The <i>katsuobushi </i>smell is strong.
-That lemon really played its part.

1704
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,133
The <i>katsuobushi</i> really made a difference.

1705
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,502
I thought it was too bland until the end.

1706
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:48,404
Would it have changed?

1707
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,706
-Eat it as is at first.
-You can eat it however you like.

1708
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,042
Then try it with the sauce.

1709
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:54,877
IT'S HOT

1710
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,880
-It must be hot.
-A soup dish, <i>jeongol</i>.

1711
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,249
The sweetness of the cabbage
hits you hard.

1712
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:04,386
-The cabbage looks good.
-Yes, he put in a lot.

1713
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,855
My gosh. The soup dish.

1714
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,490
-<i>Jeongol</i>.
-What is it?

1715
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:09,758
It just hit the spot.

1716
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,560
Does it have a rich flavor?

1717
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,563
I knew it. This is why Koreans need soup.

1718
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,098
HE MADE RICH FLAVOR
WITH CABBAGE AND DRIED RADISH

1719
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,801
It smells amazing.

1720
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,703
The ponzu sauce.

1721
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,004
You can dip it in there.

1722
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,007
SLURP

1723
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,677
I love the soup. It's seasoned perfectly.

1724
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,547
It's even better
now that it's been boiled down.

1725
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:32,981
It tastes even better
after it has boiled down.

1726
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,084
It doesn't taste bland anymore

1727
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,319
because it's been boiling for a while.
It was bland earlier.

1728
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:39,521
Because it's seasoned like this,

1729
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:43,859
you can appreciate the flavor and aroma
of <i>katsuobushi </i>more clearly.

1730
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:48,330
He said <i>jeongol </i>was a humble dish
that you share with a big group.

1731
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:51,533
But there's a Japanese course meal
called kaiseki.

1732
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,268
It has a very nice hint of citrus,

1733
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,237
and it's luxurious enough to include it
as one of the courses in kaiseki.

1734
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,841
Doesn't the pork
look like it'll smell bad?

1735
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:02,010
It's too pale,
and it hasn't been seasoned.

1736
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,480
But it doesn't smell at all.

1737
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,815
How shocking is that?

1738
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,386
This must be his technique.

1739
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,388
The touch of yuzu kosho
must be the citrus flavor.

1740
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,022
-And lemon.
-Right.

1741
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:17,393
I thought it'd create a different aroma,
but it didn't.

1742
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:21,196
-Jun-hwan.
-Jun-hwan eats so well.

1743
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,699
He's on a roll today.

1744
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,034
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

1745
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,903
I love Japanese food too,

1746
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:31,006
so I enjoy <i>nabe, </i>Japanese hot pots.

1747
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,108
It's delicious.

1748
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,979
It's tough to get the show going
when everyone eats together.

1749
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,383
-We're all busy eating.
-Right?

1750
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,185
Everyone is busy eating.

1751
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,653
I'll just choose someone.

1752
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,724
The savory broth is called
<i>umadashi</i> in Japanese.

1753
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:53,028
The mix of <i>katsuobushi </i>broth and pork
will create that savory flavor.

1754
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,030
He made good use of that.

1755
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,932
It was a wonder

1756
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,967
that it tasted fresh
even though everything was cooked.

1757
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:02,604
-Right.
-It was cooked, but it still tasted fresh.

1758
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,939
-And clean.
-Exactly.

1759
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,408
This will always sell out
if he sells it in a retirement village.

1760
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,344
They'll demand it every single day.

1761
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,980
-They'll eat it like medicine.
-Yes, it's like medicine.

1762
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,916
The younger generation

1763
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,919
-would love Sung-jun's dish.
-Right, it has that flavor.

1764
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,388
Jun-hwan, which one would you choose?

1765
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,890
I'd pick Chef Sung-jun's dish.

1766
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,126
-See? I told you so.
-Right.

1767
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,295
-You'll go for the soup, right?
-Goodness.

1768
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:27,362
Why did I even ask?

1769
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,730
I didn't get enough soup.

1770
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,866
It's like that.

1771
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,202
Please stop. I can't choose.

1772
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,038
The fridge owner will make the decision.

1773
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,140
Press one for Choi Kang-rok.

1774
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,675
Press two for Kwon Sung-jun.

1775
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:43,378
Which one of them will Jae-hyung choose?

1776
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,180
Let's find out! Please show us.

1777
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:50,619
That was a round
between the two champion chefs.

1778
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:53,388
Kwon Sung-jun,
the winner of <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

1779
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,958
Choi Kang-rok,
the winner of <i>MasterChef Korea</i>.

1780
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:59,628
Which one of them did Jae-hyung choose?

1781
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,631
A dish to stuff everyone!

1782
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,467
Who did Jae-hyung choose?

1783
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,836
-The winner is…
-The winner is…

1784
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,572
Jae-hyung, who is it?

1785
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,040
KWON SUNG-JUN WINS

1786
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,308
It was Sung-jun!

1787
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:16,445
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S LET'S SHARE
CHICKEN AND LASAGNA WINS

1788
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,780
-Sung-jun wins.
-The champagne.

1789
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,449
IT'S ME, KWON SUNG-JUN

1790
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,384
The champagne.

1791
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,452
NICE CEREMONY

1792
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,420
Gosh, Sung-jun.

1793
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,556
We can always stuff ourselves
no matter where we are.

1794
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,758
But it was the atmosphere
of eating together.

1795
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,860
-I like that team dinner vibe.
-Right.

1796
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,996
It may look unrefined,

1797
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,331
but the lasagna felt like
a party dish to share with everyone.

1798
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:39,101
-Sung-jun's dish.
-I thought it was more fitting.

1799
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:42,804
Come to think of it,
we chatted more while eating his dish.

1800
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:43,839
-Right.
-Yes.

1801
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,207
During Kang-rok's dish, we were all like…

1802
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,545
EVERYONE WAS JUST
FEELING THE FOOD

1803
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:50,646
-But it was delicious.
-Thank you.

1804
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,749
-Please try this at home.
-Yes.

1805
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:58,053
-He got Chef Hyun-suk's revenge.
-He got his revenge.

1806
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,856
This is from Chapter 3, Verse 1
of Chef Hyun-suk's Greatest Quotes.

1807
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,190
-Chapter 3, Verse 1?
-Chapter 3, Verse 1?

1808
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,892
"Do not cook for the star."

1809
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,194
-"Cook for your guest."
-Yes.

1810
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:10,799
I was able to achieve such a result
because I followed his teaching.

1811
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:12,467
PROUD

1812
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,636
Sung-jun takes his third win!

1813
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:16,471
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

1814
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,875
Congratulations!
You get a star from Jae-hyung.

1815
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,945
Congrats, Sung-jun.

1816
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,714
Peng. Paeng Hyun-sook.
Guin. Queen!

1817
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,115
I just keep it going until the end.

1818
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:29,384
Did you just laugh?

1819
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,388
Please make something
that doesn't make us rile up.

1820
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,623
Then you can remarry.

1821
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,124
Please stop getting such ideas.

1822
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,859
All he ever does at home is sleep.

1823
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,394
Great job making your husband look good.

1824
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:41,263
IT'S SUDDENLY TURNING
INTO DIVORCE CAMP

1825
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,999
Please welcome two chefs
who came to get their revenge!

1826
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,468
I think it'll be more meaningful
to win against Chef Hyun-suk here.

1827
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,337
The world of chefs has no discipline now.

1828
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:51,206
I'll get my revenge
just like the Italian Mafia.

1829
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,642
I have a character to keep,
so I won't lose.

1830
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,143
We're about to see huge matches.

1831
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,079
<i>I'll show you that I'm on another level.</i>

1832
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:00,315
<i>I want to get my revenge</i>
<i>against the Queen of Dim Sum.</i>

1833
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,184
-She's doing it.
-It worked.

1834
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,251
NO WAY

1835
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,620
That's so cool.

1836
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:05,988
<i>She's grown a lot.</i>

1837
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,723
She's definitely relaxed.

1838
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,424
-Darn it.
-This is scary.

1839
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:10,759
My gosh!

1840
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,394
Return matches are different.

1841
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,795
This is scary. Please be careful.

1842
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,864
<i>I'll fight him head-on and win.</i>

1843
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,000
<i>I gladly accept his challenge.</i>

1844
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,501
Isn't it burnt?

1845
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:20,869
THE CLASS OF THE OLD-TIMER

1846
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,337
He's doing his signature move.

1847
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,806
-It won't fit in. How do I do this?
-Someone help him!

1848
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:26,541
He's having issues with the blender.

1849
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,910
-Keep it up, Gyeong-jun!
-Hyun-suk is teasing him!

1850
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,879
Good luck, Gyeong-jun!

1851
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:31,947
WHAT HAPPENED DURING
THE RETURN MATCH?

1852
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,016
You have no time to taste that,
Chef Gyeong-jun.

1853
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,517
<i>Hurry up! Get cooking!</i>

1854
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,886
-Open up.
-Okay.

1855
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:39,921
It's as if she's feeding a patient.

1856
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:54,269
