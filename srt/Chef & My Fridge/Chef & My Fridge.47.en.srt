1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,485
We're here today with two guests
that have polar opposite appetites.

2
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,855
Woo-jae recently became
a key variety show figure,

3
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,356
thanks to his unique personality.

4
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,325
Not only is he a hot TV personality,

5
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,861
-but he's also a huge fashion icon.
-Yes, of course.

6
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,997
-What are you wearing today?
-What's the theme?

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,899
I knew I'd be meeting chefs,

8
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,567
so I got a shirt with a similar collar.

9
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,536
He intentionally looked for that collar.

10
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,772
I wanted to dress for the occasion,

11
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,974
-although I'm not cooking.
-He notices things we don't.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,909
So I decided to dress to fit in.

13
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,878
We prepared a special segment

14
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,313
after hearing Woo-jae would be joining us.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,950
-It's called Nosy Woo-jae & My Fashion.
-My Fashion.

16
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,118
-I see.
-Nosy.

17
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:57,057
You do have content on your channel
titled Nosy Fashion, right?

18
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,691
<i>You look at</i>
<i>and criticize people's outfits.</i>

19
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,894
First, you need way larger socks.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,095
You'll get a hole

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,030
after three more uses
without clipping your toenails.

22
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,434
You help them match clothes better,
and at times, even a compliment.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,302
When our chefs arrived today,

24
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,337
we took photos of their outfits.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,606
-This was the reason?
-We took them.

26
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,108
You can't do this to us.

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,276
I didn't dress up today.

28
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,411
Sam looks especially troubled.

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,013
-Sam?
-He's in distress.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,047
I have information.

31
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,683
You know those shoes
he always wears, right?

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,186
-Yes.
-I've seen those seven years ago.

33
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,388
-You should get new shoes, Sam.
-I'm serious.

34
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,457
This is the first outfit. Show us!

35
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,559
Wait, what?

36
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,195
-Not bad.
-What are you wearing? A cropped shirt?

37
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,631
-Why do your legs seem so long?
-It's because I raised my arm.

38
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,867
Look at his chubby cheeks. How cute.

39
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,769
-What do you think?
-It doesn't look bad to me.

40
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,238
-Not bad, right?
-He looks stylish.

41
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,208
-He reminds me of something.
-Yes?

42
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,909
He's like a middle school kid

43
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,278
trying to perform "Shock" by BEAST
at a school talent show.

44
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,783
He must've cut the shirt himself
the day before

45
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,151
to turn it into a stage costume.

46
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,619
REPURPOSING IT HIMSELF

47
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,088
The hemline is rolling up.

48
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,624
It's a Western-style outfit,
which is popular now.

49
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,260
-Western-style in middle school.
-In middle school?

50
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,629
-You're in middle school.
-Western-style in middle school.

51
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,431
He says you seem like a teenager.

52
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,633
-About 15.
-Yes, he says you're like a teenager.

53
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,836
What would you change
if you had to dress like that?

54
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,138
-Something I'd change?
-Yes.

55
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,974
His fingers are the tackiest right now.

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,143
-They're bothering me so much.
-His fingers.

57
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,311
By the time someone is Sung-jun's age,

58
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,548
they should've dropped
making poses such as this or this.

59
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,183
-The outfit isn't bad
-Isn't so bad?

60
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,685
-for a cover performance of "Shock."
-It's not bad?

61
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,889
Show us the next chef.

62
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,892
-My gosh!
-Goodness.

63
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,926
How hideous.

64
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,495
-He's like an athlete.
-He must be a judo athlete.

65
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,430
-Yes, judo.
-Why are you touching your tummy?

66
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,200
Do you think athletes are like him?
Even we don't dress like that!

67
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,434
THE ATHLETE IS INSULTED

68
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,436
-Don't say that about athletes.
-Don't say that!

69
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,139
Athletes are really good with fashion.

70
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,607
Don't look down on athletes, kid!

71
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,576
He must be one of Sung-jun's friends…

72
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,646
-Another middle school.
-…but he couldn't perform on stage,

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,214
a kid who couldn't dance.

74
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,850
They're in the same class,
but he couldn't perform?

75
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,019
There's no formula to fashion,

76
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,322
but if you match
your T-shirt and shoes all in white,

77
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,724
-it makes you look like a piano.
-A piano?

78
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,593
BUT THE KEYS ARE RATHER BIG

79
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,895
-A piano?
-A pia-Nam-no.

80
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,730
-At least his hair's dyed.
-Right.

81
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,501
If he had put on black shoes,

82
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,303
they'd make his legs look much longer.

83
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,939
-I see. That's an excellent tip.
-You're right.

84
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,240
A-HA

85
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,741
-Next one, please.
-My gosh.

86
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,176
It's Sam!

87
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,012
-Is he going hiking?
-I saw those a decade ago!

88
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,014
-He's dressed to go hiking.
-He loves those shoes.

89
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,917
-Those are the old shoes?
-Yes, they are.

90
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,085
They aren't dress shoes.

91
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,687
I thought he made them with clay.

92
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,322
THOUGHT THEY WERE MADE OF CLAY

93
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,057
-Made of clay?
-Get new shoes. Please.

94
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,725
He's dressed to go hiking.

95
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,527
-He just…
-Right?

96
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,028
He just looks like a mad chef.

97
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,564
A CHEF MAD ABOUT COOKING

98
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,435
A chef who couldn't care less
about the things that happen in the world

99
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,970
-outside the kitchen.
-No care.

100
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:01,674
<i>-He only stays in the kitchen, cooking.</i>
<i>-All he cares about is making food.</i>

101
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,876
<i>A madman for cooking.</i>

102
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,912
-This is a great compliment.
-It is.

103
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,014
-You're right.
-That's how a chef should dress?

104
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,883
When it comes to his pants,

105
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,587
I have a feeling he had kept them on
since before he fully grew to this height.

106
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,357
He's been wearing them since then.

107
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,825
The pants are shorter now.

108
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,860
That was when he first picked up a knife,

109
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,263
so even when new styles
were released out there,

110
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,364
he couldn't care less.

111
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,433
-He just wears what he has.
-The pants must've been significant.

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,271
-To him, fashion is just a covering.
-A covering. That's true.

113
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,474
-Also, do you see that secular brand?
-The secular brand?

114
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,441
It's from the outside.

115
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,777
In his long culinary journey,

116
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,280
it must've been a birthday present
from someone he's closest to.

117
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,482
-Did someone give it to you?
-Yes, he's right.

118
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,852
-Was that right? It was?
-Wow. He's like a shaman.

119
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,388
-I just want to get him new shoes.
-Right?

120
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,355
What should he change?

121
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,457
I don't want to change him.
He should keep cooking.

122
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,759
I want him to be even crazier.

123
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,128
-Because he's a madman for cooking.
-That's cool.

124
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,963
Who's the next chef?

125
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,564
-Hey.
-Hey.

126
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,701
-He took it like he was your boyfriend.
-This isn't allowed.

127
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,870
-Did he pose?
-Was it candid?

128
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,805
Does he always dress like that?

129
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,774
The whole energy just shifted.

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,509
You bring lots of stuff to the studio.

131
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,744
-I always do.
-He brings all kinds of tools.

132
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,913
I'm not sure if it's because of his bags,

133
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,715
but he's like a cool uncle
at a wholesale market.

134
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,052
-At Dongdaemun?
-Wholesale fashion markets.

135
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,522
<i>-A guy often seen at Dongdaemun.</i>
<i>-Like the domestic uncle buyer?</i>

136
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,690
<i>A guy who buys wholesale.</i>

137
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:27,093
-But he seems to know a lot about fashion.
-He does.

138
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,096
-He might even know more than me.
-He knows his stuff.

139
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,966
All around the world,
people began to wear shorter T-shirts.

140
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,102
-I see.
-That's the T-shirt he's wearing

141
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,172
-with the straight leather jacket.
-And wide pants.

142
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,841
-Yes, the regular fit jeans.
-No washing.

143
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,344
There's nothing more I need to comment on.

144
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,945
-He's that good?
-He always dresses nicely.

145
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,846
I'm jealous.

146
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,382
-That's good. Jong-won passes.
-He passes.

147
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,084
-Only one passed.
-Just one.

148
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,687
We have one last person left.
The last chef.

149
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,855
Chef Ho-young.

150
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,824
Does he own that coffee shop?

151
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,825
NO, HE'S ON VACATION

152
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,960
-I went to eat donuts.
-You went to hang out?

153
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,096
Wait, I just noticed it!

154
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,365
Those are two different shirts!

155
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,567
GETTING CHILLS

156
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,669
I seriously thought
they were the same shirt.

157
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,204
The photos are about two years apart.

158
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,841
There are two years of time
between the two pictures.

159
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,442
-He's the same.
-Two years?

160
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,778
In that case, I have to give it to you.

161
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,582
You already have your own style going on.

162
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,417
Should he unbutton one more?

163
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,452
Well, if his tummy feels too tight.

164
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,856
Looking at the number of donuts, he should
unbutton a few more after he eats.

165
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,959
Did you eat all those?

166
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,661
-Do you need that many?
-They were new and very good.

167
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,730
-Did you finish them?
-Do you usually order that much?

168
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,767
-That was as much as I could get.
-That was the limit.

169
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,537
There was a quantity limit.

170
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,305
He would've gotten more.

171
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,307
Anyway, thank you, Woo-jae.

172
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,642
HIS CUTTING NOSINESS IS OVER

173
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,643
That was a fun segment.

174
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,045
Among the content on his channel,

175
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,715
there's something even more popular
than this fashion critique.

176
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,385
It's so popular
that it recorded ten million views.

177
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,686
Was it a short-form content?

178
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,955
-No, the actual one.
-A longer one got ten million views?

179
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,056
It's about 20 minutes.

180
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,958
The title is already unusual.

181
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,661
<i>It's called "Fricking Mid </i>Mukbang<i>."</i>

182
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,296
<i>Fricking Mid </i>Mukbang?

183
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,331
How do you eat your food?
I've never seen you eat.

184
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,733
Here's how.

185
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,335
-His teeth reach out first.
-His teeth?

186
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,004
LIKE A DONKEY

187
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,872
He takes a bite like this first.

188
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,608
We'll show you a quick example
to help you understand.

189
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,576
We prepared a video.

190
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,345
-Let's take a look.
-I should see it too.

191
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,814
<i>This one hit over ten million views.</i>

192
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,918
Do you see the teeth?
His teeth come out first.

193
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,352
He had like one centimeter.

194
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,720
I have a tiny mouth.

195
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,289
HIS TINY LITTLE MOUTH…

196
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,224
He doesn't want to eat.

197
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,061
So he never eats a lot, does he?
He only takes a few nibbles.

198
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,831
His tongue hides behind his teeth,
wondering if it should come out.

199
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,033
-That much would numb your teeth.
-Right?

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,335
REFUSING THE BITE
WITH ALL HIS MIGHT

201
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,304
It's way too sweet.
So the video is like this.

202
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,238
THIS GOT 10M VIEWS?

203
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,573
Here's how this all began.

204
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,108
There were moments when I ate
while filming my videos, right?

205
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,212
The comments said, "Throw it out
if you're going to eat it like that."

206
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,113
-"You're wasting food."
-Right.

207
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,417
So I had a feeling I could help people
who were trying to lose weight.

208
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,652
<i>Many people said my video helped them</i>

209
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,689
<i>suppress their false appetite</i>
<i>in the middle of the night,</i>

210
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,558
<i>-and it became a </i>mukbang<i> for dieters.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

211
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,129
I wonder what the mid <i>mukbang</i> creator,
Woo-jae, has in his fridge.

212
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,431
Let me tell you once again

213
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,933
that he didn't volunteer to come,
but rather, he refused once.

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,336
-I refused the invite once.
-I see.

215
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,104
A REMINDER FOR THOSE WHO FORGOT

216
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,739
You'll be shocked when you see my fridge.

217
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,740
-It's empty.
-The food?

218
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,376
But the writer said,
"It will happen. Give them your faith."

219
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,945
"Don't take our chefs as a joke."

220
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,581
-That's why I agreed to come.
-I see.

221
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,551
We believe in what the chefs can do.

222
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,152
No matter what he has,

223
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,388
no, even if he doesn't have much,

224
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,657
-you must pull through.
-I'm looking forward to this.

225
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,860
-We're about to open Woo-jae's fridge.
-Geez.

226
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,265
-We're about to begin.
-Why are those covered up?

227
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,133
-Is that a suitcase?
-Those?

228
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,936
-Right?
-Those ingredients are usually open.

229
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,605
Is that tiny fridge all you have?

230
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,742
-I used to have a big fridge too,
-Are you serious?

231
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,112
but it had way too much empty space.

232
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,247
-That doesn't happen.
-He had too much empty space

233
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,615
-in his old fridge.
-That's crazy.

234
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,652
So I switched to a smaller fridge
just before I moved,

235
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,887
so the movers
who had to carry my fridge out

236
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,290
seemed the happiest as they worked.

237
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,724
They had it easy.

238
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,560
-They smiled as they carried it.
-They smiled?

239
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,129
One could've carried it out on the back.

240
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,698
You'd say an empty fridge
was like a whip for the chefs, right?

241
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,366
You're getting clubbed today.

242
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,303
-They're getting clubbed?
-Clubbed.

243
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,039
-Let me make that clear beforehand.
-The chefs are getting clubbed?

244
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,874
Did you bring everything you had?

245
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,342
-Everything.
-Everything?

246
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,277
-You're scaring them too much.
-Wait.

247
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,012
I just hit it, and it sounds empty.

248
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,951
It means the fridge is delish,
just like how you feel out watermelons.

249
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,787
-Let's open it and find out.
-All right, then.

250
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,356
We present Woo-jae's fridge!

251
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,191
My gosh.

252
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,696
JOO WOO-JAE'S FRIDGE REVEAL

253
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,432
EMPTY

254
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,735
It's an emergency.

255
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,070
This is serious.

256
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,072
AVOIDING COMPLAINTS

257
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,373
It's not that.

258
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,041
-I can't lie.
-How are they gonna shoot anything?

259
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,276
I can't lie here.

260
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,577
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL

261
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,615
I couldn't suddenly go shopping
just because I'd be on TV.

262
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,249
-That's true.
-It's as is.

263
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,685
I wish you filled it up.

264
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,054
-What is this?
-It's too empty.

265
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,857
No one sustains themselves
solely on beverages at home.

266
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,360
-He brought his fridge like this?
-We should make drinks.

267
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,295
How are the chefs going to cook?

268
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,830
This is devastating.

269
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,465
You should've declined until the end.

270
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,233
-It's the emptiest yet.
-I did!

271
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,135
-You should've said no.
-What will you do?

272
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,471
I really told them
that I couldn't be on the show.

273
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,173
-What's this? Strawberry jam?
-Jam.

274
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,141
Strawberry jam.

275
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,045
I once ordered frozen bread
and had it with that,

276
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,280
and that's what's left from then.

277
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,783
Did you finish the bread?
Are there any leftovers?

278
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,752
I finished it. What can I do?
Only the jam remains.

279
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,888
He only needed this much jam
to finish a loaf of bread.

280
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,623
I can eat a whole jar.

281
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,192
-Did you dip your bread in that?
-Did you really just dip it?

282
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,862
-He doesn't even eat lots of jam.
-It wasn't a whole loaf.

283
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,165
It was actually French toast
that came in separate packaging.

284
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,566
-There is no such thing.
-You got that?

285
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,301
-It's a thing.
-It's a frozen product.

286
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,604
Did you buy it from Lilliput?

287
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,373
A 188-CM TALL LILLIPUTIAN?

288
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,476
And then you have
cola and coffee, that's it.

289
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,245
Make zero cola sauce, free of sugar.

290
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,480
May I let him borrow my ingredients?

291
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,182
I knew that'd be the case,

292
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,017
-so I prepared some down there.
-I see.

293
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,786
-I knew it.
-What's in the freezer?

294
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,521
I wouldn't come like this.

295
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,755
-I knew it.
-What has he got?

296
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,991
I might be brazen,
but I wouldn't come in that state.

297
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,392
He does have some stuff.

298
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,194
-Nothing's there.
-Nothing in there.

299
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,097
You didn't even freeze any ice?

300
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,166
-It's empty.
-Not even some ice.

301
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,068
Iced water is not good for you.

302
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,169
DUMBFOUNDED

303
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,337
Do you have a water purifier?
What about in summer?

304
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,605
I still have it lukewarm.

305
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,208
-I feel sick when the water's too cold.
-It's not for him.

306
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,277
-Don't you get irritated?
-It's bad for you.

307
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,913
-If so, why do you drink cola and coffee?
-Right?

308
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,749
I have to enjoy my life
to some degree, don't I?

309
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,217
So I drink it and have diarrhea.

310
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,254
What can I do? That's the only way.

311
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,557
-He must have something.
-Everything I have is in there.

312
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,192
-He has something.
-Let's see it.

313
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,727
-Does he have something?
-What is it?

314
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,795
Yes, this is his freezer.

315
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,897
-What is it?
-He brought something.

316
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,432
Aren't those the same products?

317
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,135
-Ice cream. Can I just pour these out?
-Just take it and…

318
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,405
-It's bread and ice cream.
-Ice cream.

319
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,339
This is just awful.

320
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,874
HUMILIATION

321
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,010
-That's my favorite ice cream.
-Ben & Jerry's.

322
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,247
It's my favorite flavor from this brand.

323
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,182
-What about these?
-These breads are the same.

324
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,485
-The chefs should be excited about this.
-What is it?

325
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,286
-What's that?
-You can extract

326
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,721
many ingredients from this.

327
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,257
-It's egg bread.
-Egg bread?

328
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,126
-Egg bread?
-What is this?

329
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,595
Hear me out, chefs.
Let me try to convince you.

330
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,898
This is made of bread, egg,
and bacon pieces.

331
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,166
Bacon pieces sound good.

332
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,068
-Three ingredients.
-That's more than enough.

333
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,470
-And some cheese, right?
-Cheese?

334
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,172
-That's the egg yolk.
-The yolk.

335
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,340
It's the yolk.

336
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,941
He has ten bags of egg bread.

337
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,510
-What's that?
-Wet tissue?

338
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,978
It's <i>jeolpyeon</i>, pounded rice cake.

339
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,548
To your surprise,
it's filled with red bean paste.

340
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,983
NO WAY

341
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,484
-Is that surprising?
-You can use that.

342
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,952
What's that?

343
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,355
-What's that? <i>Bingsu?</i>
-Chocolate <i>bingsu</i>, shaved ice.

344
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,157
Do you see the tangerine?

345
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,291
How plentiful.

346
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,493
If you want to use tangerine,
you'll find it there.

347
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,895
-What else…
-He has fruit.

348
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,197
This is probably a chestnut.

349
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,498
A type of nut.

350
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,434
And you'll see some crunchy things,
as well as the chocolate ice.

351
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,936
You got everything.

352
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,273
The single piece of tangerine
is on a first-come-first-served basis.

353
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,508
-I can't miss that.
-And it's a tiny piece.

354
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,343
It's not even a whole tangerine.
It's yay big.

355
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,345
Do you eat these as your meal substitute?

356
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,614
I bought these to eat at home

357
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,350
because I don't immediately feel hungry
when I wake up.

358
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,085
-So…
-That's unusual.

359
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,122
But when I go out to work
after lying around without eating,

360
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,024
I feel kind of guilty

361
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,327
for doing this to myself
and for my parents.

362
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,162
So I thought
I could eat something like this.

363
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,831
Goodness.

364
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,832
There's egg in it.

365
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,100
-The egg makes it perfect.
-It's called the perfect food.

366
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,569
-It has carbs, protein, and fat.
-Not bad.

367
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,371
-So I eat this before I go out.
-Is this filling?

368
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,739
Don't be alarmed.

369
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,641
I eat two of these.

370
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,709
EXCELLENT JOB, WOO-JAE

371
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,110
He eats a lot.

372
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,647
AN APPLAUSE

373
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,349
-Would three make you faint?
-He eats two.

374
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,984
-You'll get fat.
-I eat two of these.

375
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,920
It depends on my condition, though.
At times, it's just one.

376
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,522
But I eat two when I have an appetite.

377
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,724
-What about the rice cake?
-It's similar.

378
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,260
So from Monday through Saturday,

379
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,330
-I do egg, egg, <i>tteok</i>, egg, egg, <i>tteok</i>.
-You mix it up.

380
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,432
-You mix it up a bit.
-He can get sick of one.

381
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,600
He tries to mix it up.

382
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,101
FREEZER, THE END

383
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,703
These are all from his freezer.

384
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,504
AT A LOSS

385
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,407
-May I say something brazen again?
-Sure.

386
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,177
If I may speak as a viewer,

387
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,746
if they manage
to make something from this,

388
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,449
it would be even more interesting
in my opinion.

389
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,418
If they made toast with this,
that would be amazing.

390
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,421
Can you continue
to throw in something like an ad?

391
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,924
That I clearly turned down
the offer to be on the show.

392
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,660
-Please flash that every five minutes.
-As the caption.

393
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,330
If you're into ice cream,
does it mean you prefer sweet things?

394
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,299
Sweetness is my favorite flavor.

395
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,800
-Like all these.
-He likes sweet things.

396
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,737
-I basically love all things sweet.
-He basically loves sweet things.

397
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,273
You don't have any ingredients,
so do they need to know that?

398
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,208
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE INGREDIENTS…

399
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,211
-Wait, the room temperature ingredients.
-Okay. The real deal.

400
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,779
Please give a big hand!

401
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,447
OF COURSE, THERE'S MORE

402
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,348
That wasn't funny.

403
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,419
-I was joking until now.
-He wouldn't have come empty-handed.

404
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,554
-That wasn't funny.
-Stop joking around.

405
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,789
-He knows TV.
-He's got more.

406
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,125
You must've been anxious
because of everything I said,

407
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,793
but you can forget your worries now.

408
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,395
RELIEVED

409
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,497
-This is what he does.
-We should be seeing something.

410
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,232
You'll see four different cuisines now.

411
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,967
-Four countries?
-I'm excited.

412
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,636
We've never been this thrilled
to see room temperature ingredients.

413
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,673
-We present his room temperature food!
-Room temperature food!

414
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,707
-…food!
-…food!

415
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,044
My goodness. Look at these.

416
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,312
-…food!
-…food!

417
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,615
My goodness. Look at these.

418
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,017
-He has some <i>ramyeon.</i>
-What's going on?

419
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,319
He only has <i>ramyeon</i> and snacks.

420
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,454
-Cookies.
-These are popular cookies.

421
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,422
Dang it.

422
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,857
-What was that sound?
-These are all snacks.

423
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,360
-You can make a house of cookies.
-These are all snacks.

424
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,895
-Look below.
-Below?

425
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,398
-Spicy beef <i>ramyeon</i>.
-It's like a convenience store.

426
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,766
Black bean <i>ramyeon.</i>

427
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,101
-<i>Naengmyeon</i>.
-<i>Mul-naengmyeon</i>.

428
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,202
<i>Jjolmyeon,</i> spicy chewy noodles.

429
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,104
And what's this?

430
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,138
-What will I do?
-What's this?

431
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,140
Let's just make him some <i>ramyeon.</i>

432
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,343
First of all, you must like <i>ramyeon.</i>

433
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,011
If I may be honest,

434
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,280
I don't particularly like it.

435
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,516
I make all food look bad,
but brands still send me things.

436
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,286
Those <i>ramyeon</i> brands?

437
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,955
Yes, they seem very daring,
but yes, they send me some.

438
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,790
-They want you to try these?
-Yes.

439
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,327
-Anyway, my favorite one there
-Yes?

440
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,130
-is the one in the middle.
-The black bean <i>ramyeon</i>, Jjawang?

441
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,331
-Black bean <i>ramyeon.</i>
-Jjawang.

442
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,067
I also found <i>yukgaejang</i> with noodles,
hot and spicy beef soup.

443
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,169
-That looks good.
-Andong-style noodles.

444
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,406
-Everyone will go for those.
-Buckwheat noodles.

445
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,041
Those are the only ones.

446
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,110
You all seem interested
for the first time.

447
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,445
-Those are it.
-You're all ready to jump in.

448
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,747
I have to grab it.

449
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:55,948
-And seize it.
-This is it.

450
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,852
That was Woo-jae's fridge,
the fridge that's here to club the chefs.

451
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,253
It'll hurt a lot.

452
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,022
-You're in trouble.
-This is horrendous.

453
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,158
That was all for Woo-jae's fridge.

454
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,561
It's the emptiest fridge yet,
but the chefs on our show…

455
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,696
-They can do it.
-They can.

456
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,432
-Of course. And they must!
-Make something from nothing.

457
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,300
-That's <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>
-Yes.

458
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,435
You're happy to sit out.

459
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,970
I should've taken part in this episode.

460
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,805
-You have to do it.
-You look very excited.

461
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,774
-Of course, I am.
-This isn't the first.

462
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,375
Anyway, did you order anything?

463
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,444
I did. I brought some orders.

464
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,379
I do have orders.

465
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,014
Let's find out what the orders are.

466
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,051
-Show us Woo-jae's orders!
-I wonder what they are.

467
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,019
Woo-jae's order.

468
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,055
-Half a Meal, Please.
-Half a Meal, Please.

469
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,157
-Half a Meal, Please.
-Half a Meal, Please.

470
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,092
What do you mean, Half a Meal, Please?

471
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,629
I wanted to take a load off them
according to my fridge's situation.

472
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,397
-He's a decent guy.
-How nice.

473
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,333
Honestly speaking,
it's more like a quarter of a meal.

474
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,369
-A quarter of a meal.
-A quarter, please.

475
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,172
My fridge may have come
in such low quality,

476
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,141
but I wanted to ask
these best chefs in Korea

477
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,678
to focus on doing the best they can
with whatever they can find here.

478
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,680
Here's the next order.

479
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,716
-Chef, Not My Fridge.
-What does he mean?

480
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,485
-Chef, Not My Fridge.
-Really?

481
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,454
I honestly never asked you
to work with my fridge.

482
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,256
I actually never asked.

483
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,858
That's one reason,

484
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,160
but my fridge literally has nothing,

485
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,930
so I wanted to ask you
to make something for me

486
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,532
-with room temperature ingredients.
-They can do that.

487
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,167
We can't use anything from the fridge?

488
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,803
The piece of fruit
is only for those in round one.

489
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,372
This sounds like trouble.

490
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,740
The unfortunate four.

491
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,242
HEAD DROPPED

492
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,711
Wait, I already feel embarrassed enough.

493
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,314
That was so unintentional.
Did I just say unfortunate?

494
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,249
Here are the unlucky chefs.

495
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,085
Ho-young, Jong-won,
Eun-yeong, and Sung-jun.

496
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,054
These four chefs are left.

497
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,789
-I'll choose first.
-Sure.

498
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,959
-I'll go with Half a Meal, Please.
-Half a Meal, Please.

499
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,861
Then I'll go.

500
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,798
I'm a man's man who isn't afraid
of challenges, so the bottom round.

501
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,333
SUNG-JUN PICKS CHEF,
NOT MY FRIDGE

502
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,335
Woo-jae looks thrilled.

503
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,337
The two have split up.

504
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,339
-I'll jump in first.
-Eun-yeong!

505
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,275
-I'll go for Chef, Not My Fridge.
-Hey!

506
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,676
-No fridge ingredients?
-No.

507
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,312
Ho-young has no choice
but to join Half a Meal, Please.

508
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,615
The first round is Half a Meal, Please.

509
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,451
Let Jong-won and Ho-young's
15-minute cook-off begin!

510
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,359
<i>This is the first round played</i>
<i>with ingredients from Woo-jae's fridge.</i>

511
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,262
The fashion icon of the show,
Chef Jong-won is up,

512
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,499
as well as the dancing icon of the show,
Chef Ho-young.

513
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,402
-This fridge is going to whip them.
-Yes.

514
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,803
No, club them.

515
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,272
First of all…

516
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,742
-Is something wrong?
-No.

517
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,743
That's not the case.

518
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,944
He's out of it.

519
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,214
Your mind seems as blank as that fridge.

520
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,950
-Yes, my mind is pretty blank now.
-Is it?

521
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,786
The fridge owner had some decency

522
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,856
and asked for half a meal,
not a full meal.

523
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,725
He came with the order
titled "Half a Meal, Please."

524
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:58,630
But cooking in a smaller batch
doesn't mean it'll be any easier.

525
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,266
It's our job as chefs to cook a great dish
despite the amount

526
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,068
-of ingredients we get…
-It's what chefs do.

527
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,937
He's right. That's what chefs do.

528
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,940
You also thought
the order was more advantageous for you.

529
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,175
I'm also infamous
for not eating my meals on time.

530
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,811
-How sad.
-He's like me.

531
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,414
But Ho-young always makes sure he eats.

532
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,517
-Every meal.
-How do you plan to understand

533
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,451
-what he's like?
-He can't.

534
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,720
Actually, I'm hungry right now.

535
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,924
You should have an egg bread.
That should be enough.

536
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,727
He often eats the ingredients
while he cooks.

537
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,897
He tries a bite of the egg bread.

538
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,299
-Where did it go?
-Did he eat the big one?

539
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,200
Where did it go?

540
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,836
Chef Ho-young has never had half a meal.

541
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,404
-No.
-More like three meals and a half.

542
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,673
The order must be rough for you.

543
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,108
WHAT?

544
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,811
DRUNK ON EGG BREAD

545
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,880
I said the order must be tough
for you to comprehend, half a meal.

546
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,216
The fact that he eats half a meal

547
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,317
is hard to understand.

548
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,152
CAN TOTALLY CONNECT

549
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,089
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS:
RED BEAN-FILLED JEOLPYEON

550
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,157
COOKIE DOUGH ICE CREAM,
MILK PUFF SNACK, CHOCOLATE SNACK

551
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,360
What are you making, Chef Jong-won?

552
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,697
I prepared something for Woo-jae,
who's a fashion icon.

553
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,399
Red Bean Icon.

554
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,634
-Red Bean Icon?
-Red Bean Icon?

555
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,935
Did he have red beans?

556
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,503
It's in the red bean paste.

557
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,005
-In the rice cake!
-The rice cake!

558
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,940
He'll probably need ten
to get just one spoonful.

559
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,408
It probably doesn't have a lot.

560
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,076
I want to serve three courses

561
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,145
in this half a meal
for the first time in the world.

562
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,047
-Three courses?
-Will he serve tiny bits?

563
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,549
He'll serve courses as he gets whipped?

564
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,918
First, I'll serve red bean porridge.

565
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,053
-Red bean porridge.
-Red bean porridge.

566
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,322
-Red bean porridge with rice cake.
-Red bean porridge?

567
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,190
Next, fried <i>jeolpyeon.</i>

568
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,725
Lastly, red bean <i>bingsu.</i>

569
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,427
-Red bean <i>bingsu?</i>
-Even <i>bingsu?</i>

570
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,596
I'll only use the ingredient he has

571
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,231
and nothing else.

572
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,367
I'll challenge myself to the limit.

573
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,304
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS:
EGG BREAD, VANILLA LATTE

574
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,372
BUCKWHEAT NOODLE MEAL KIT,
BLACK BEAN RAMYEON

575
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,342
Up against him is Chef Ho-young.
What are you making?

576
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,477
Here's the name of my dish.

577
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,280
-I'm going to make udon.
-That sounds good.

578
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,649
I'll make handmade udon.

579
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,551
And because he doesn't have much food,

580
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,554
I'll separate bacon pieces
from the egg bread

581
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,324
and stir-fry it with udon.

582
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,092
I didn't think anyone would use bacon.

583
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,629
I also saw latte,
so I'll mix that with eggs,

584
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,899
<i>make a twister egg omelet,</i>
<i>top it on the udon,</i>

585
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,302
and let him enjoy it with some sauce.

586
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,603
So they can really do it?

587
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,872
-They're making that from nothing.
-Coffee?

588
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:26,044
You'll see some basic ingredients there,
such as green onion and onion.

589
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,280
Can they use only those
instead of my ingredients?

590
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,048
In that case, go to a restaurant instead.

591
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,883
GEEZ…

592
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,320
-You brought your fridge.
-Jung-hwan, I said I declined the offer.

593
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,291
That's why I feel really bad
as I sit here.

594
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,428
I also have no idea
how I'm going to survive this hour.

595
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,463
Don't worry.

596
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,199
They'll do it.
The two chefs will make it happen.

597
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,201
-I also believe they will.
-Yes.

598
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,570
Will the dishes turn out as they planned?

599
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,640
Let us begin the round,
Half a Meal, Please.

600
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,509
It must be so hard.

601
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,345
-It's a tough battle.
-They should try, and they will do it.

602
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,416
This chef won't get whipped
and serve three courses,

603
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,851
Chef Son Jong-won.

604
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,087
This chef will do a noodle-pulling show
instead of dancing today,

605
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,390
Chef Jung Ho-young.

606
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,660
Who'll win the first half-meal round
in the history of <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

607
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,864
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

608
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,034
MAKE THE BEST HALF A MEAL!

609
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,804
He runs to the back to grab ice.

610
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,439
-Ice.
-Ice.

611
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,108
-No?
-It was ice cream.

612
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,611
-Ice cream?
-He's using ice cream too.

613
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,579
-What will he do?
-It goes in the pan?

614
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,047
In the frying pan?

615
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,517
Then why did you pull it out
from the freezer?

616
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,519
It would've melted faster
at room temperature.

617
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,221
It was in the freezer
because it's ice cream!

618
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,223
Will he boil the ice cream?

619
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,626
-Is that for red bean porridge?
-Ice cream in porridge?

620
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,795
-He adds water to ice cream.
-Water?

621
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,962
He's boiling the ice cream.

622
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,364
Ice cream sauce.

623
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,399
I'm making sauce for red bean <i>bingsu.</i>

624
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,735
Will ice cream turn into milk when boiled?

625
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,104
-It'll be like condensed milk.
-Condensed milk.

626
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,375
HE BOILS TSUYU FROM THE
BUCKWHEAT NOODLES MEAL KIT

627
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,378
Chef Ho-young must be
getting ready to make noodles.

628
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,180
-Udon noodles?
-Will you make the noodles?

629
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,215
Right, he didn't have udon.

630
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,218
1. GRIND FLOUR, SALT, AND WATER
TO MAKE UDON DOUGH

631
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,955
He's going to make udon noodles
by using flour.

632
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,356
He'll need the noodles.

633
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,725
PROOFING IT FOR A MOMENT

634
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,594
He's going for the red bean paste!

635
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,430
This is the key.
How much paste will he be able to get?

636
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,467
-He's going for the red bean paste!
-Red bean paste!

637
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,901
How much will he get?

638
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,102
That's more than I expected.

639
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,637
RELIEVED

640
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,440
-Look at the red bean paste.
-Don't throw the rice cake away.

641
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,243
This is the key.
How much paste will he be able to get?

642
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,377
There's no bacon.

643
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,779
What? There's no bacon?

644
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,714
-There's no bacon?
-He was counting on it!

645
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,316
The bits aren't too big.

646
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,052
ITTY-BITTY

647
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,553
What is that?

648
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,789
LOOKING HERE AND THERE

649
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,091
-No?
-There are no bacon pieces.

650
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,526
What did I taste, then?

651
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,261
There are tiny bacon bits inside.

652
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,396
You're right. They're bacon bits.

653
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,600
-Bacon bits?
-It looks like he won't have enough bacon.

654
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,635
It's an emergency.

655
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,070
This is too…

656
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,938
HAPPY(?)

657
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm sorry!

658
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:12,110
There seems to be more red bean paste
compared to the bacon bits Ho-young found.

659
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,812
-Work with this.
-Bacon.

660
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,047
-Pick out the bacon bits.
-I'm so sorry.

661
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,616
How will you find anything?

662
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,884
Those are crumbs, not bacon.

663
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,785
SNIFFLE, CHOKING

664
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,221
-There's nothing.
-No?

665
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,457
-Why are you so happy?
-So just bacon smell?

666
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,926
-Oh, no.
-Will he even find one piece of bacon?

667
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,028
Today's recipes remind me
of a science experiment.

668
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,363
-Yes, it's like they're in a lab.
-They have to make something.

669
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,532
THEY HAVE TO CREATE SOMETHING
OUT OF NOTHING

670
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,334
THE ACTUAL ENGINEER MAJOR
PULLS OUT LAB EQUIPMENT

671
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,303
ACTUAL NAME: SPATULA

672
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,472
He's scraping the paste with a spoon!

673
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,076
That's all he got from that, half a spoon.

674
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,379
He still thought of the red bean paste.

675
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,880
You're making me cry.

676
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,082
Jong-won scrapes the red bean paste.

677
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,686
I never knew
how precious red bean paste was.

678
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:55,820
That must be so hard.

679
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,990
-That's not a lot of red bean paste.
-It's like loot farming.

680
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,526
-It's like playing an RPG game.
-Loot farming.

681
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,296
TINY RED BEAN PASTE: FROM JEOLPYEON,
MIXED WITH A TEARDROP OF A MAN

682
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,432
-I feel so bad for the chefs.
-Right?

683
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,069
Those chefs aren't the kind of people
who have to scrape to find ingredients.

684
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,837
This is killing me right now.

685
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,542
There aren't many bacon bits
in the egg bread.

686
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,578
These are the bacon bits.

687
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,846
This can't be called egg and bacon bread.

688
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,448
It includes bacon scent.

689
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,716
Okay.

690
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,051
-May I take these?
-Sure.

691
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,786
Go ahead and eat.

692
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,854
I WON'T SAY NO

693
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,457
This is good.

694
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,961
I think he's going to find
a spoonful of paste by the time he's done.

695
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,862
-The spoon…
-He scrapes for more!

696
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,332
It's sad how he has to scrape it
from his fingers too.

697
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,300
-It's heartbreaking
-It is.

698
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,235
Why didn't you decline until the end?

699
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,939
WHAT COMES AFTER HIS BACON HELL?

700
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,341
EGGS

701
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,278
-He's mixing eggs with coffee.
-Isn't that the latte?

702
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,146
-Instant coffee, eggs, and flour?
-Latte and eggs?

703
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,581
-Or starch?
-It's starch.

704
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,951
-He said he'd make a twister omelet.
-He'll turn it into an omelet.

705
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,654
ON THE OTHER HAND, JONG-WON…

706
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,057
He's scraping everything with the spatula.

707
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,159
DOING HIS BEST

708
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:12,297
-He's scraping for every last bit!
-He has to keep scraping!

709
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,567
The board. I have to scrape the board.

710
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,802
-Did you get everything?
-I scraped the board.

711
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,137
Is that everything you got?

712
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,272
He's done getting the red bean paste.

713
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,109
That's all the paste he can find.

714
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,477
Zero waste.

715
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,613
-He has to make porridge and <i>bingsu.</i>
-You're right.

716
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,582
That really is only enough
for half a meal.

717
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,084
-Look at that.
-He's splitting it in half.

718
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,754
-He managed to scrape a lot.
-That's quite a lot.

719
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,589
If he spills it, it's done.

720
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,957
Yes, spill it, and it's over.

721
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,727
Chef Jong-won is trying his best
to only cook with ingredients

722
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,330
which Woo-jae brought here.

723
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,633
-So far, it was 100%.
-It was 100% so far.

724
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,336
-I used some water, though.
-Water.

725
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,837
H2O is fine by me.

726
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,006
-He stays true to the mission.
-He does.

727
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,777
-I wonder what that's like.
-Melted ice cream is the <i>bingsu</i> sauce.

728
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,080
I see. It'll be like condensed milk.

729
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,516
HE GRABS THE PROOFED DOUGH

730
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:05,650
The flour dough.

731
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,120
Chef Ho-young must work
with the basic ingredients we provided.

732
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,489
-That must be the udon noodles.
-Yes.

733
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,725
How will he do that?

734
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,694
-But he has no bacon.
-He's an expert.

735
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,530
Udon noodles are different
from pasta or <i>kal-guksu.</i>

736
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,998
You're right. They're chewier.

737
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,499
3. CHOP MATURED DOUGH
AND MAKE UDON NOODLES

738
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,803
He's making noodles for a week.

739
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,937
A WEEK'S WORTH FOR WOO-JAE

740
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,105
A week's worth?

741
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,341
-That's half a meal for Chef Ho-young.
-Right.

742
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,544
Chef Ho-young,
you only need to make half a serving,

743
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,812
and not your half serving.

744
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,780
It's just a habit.

745
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,348
That's a lot.

746
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,784
-He'll cook everything?
-He might eat more if it's good.

747
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,187
A STONE MORTAR?

748
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,154
He's oiling that.

749
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,023
-What's going inside?
-He's oiling the mortar.

750
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,658
-I have to oil it.
-<i>Jeolpyeon?</i>

751
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,260
-The rice cake!
-Will he pound the rice cake?

752
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,629
-You'll pound the rice cake?
-To make a big lump.

753
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,965
He's pounding the rice cake
to make a bigger lump.

754
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,401
-By using the mortar.
-He's pounding it.

755
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,938
-Someone needs to do this.
-He needs help.

756
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,874
FIGHTING ALL ALONE

757
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,711
-He needs help with the process.
-He needs someone.

758
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,813
-The pieces became one.
-Yes.

759
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,715
He's trying so hard.

760
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,650
He's turning it into a long shape.

761
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,587
-Why? Why is he doing that?
-Why is he rolling that?

762
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,388
Is he making tiny small balls?

763
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,857
You're right. I'm making tiny balls.

764
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,926
THAT WAS WHY HE POUNDED THE RICE CAKE

765
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,762
-For the red bean porridge?
-For the porridge.

766
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,030
-My gosh.
-That's fascinating.

767
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,633
Is that for the red bean porridge?

768
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,368
That's so amazing.

769
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,936
-Isn't this intriguing?
-It is.

770
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,005
I just got chills.
How did he come up with that idea?

771
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,106
Good ingredients.

772
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,608
-Are you intrigued?
-I am.

773
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,444
That's like asking soccer players
to play without soccer shoes.

774
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,212
-Yet they can play.
-They can.

775
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,847
I'm glad you didn't decline.

776
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,415
I'm glad as long as it's fun.

777
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,286
He even puts two pieces together

778
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,221
to make it look like the actual topping.

779
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,524
-That circular shape.
-Like a peanut.

780
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,225
Yes, he's giving it that shape.

781
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,328
-He doesn't have enough time.
-Yet the continues to make the shape.

782
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,465
Look how delicate he is
with the tiny shapes.

783
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,467
Seven minutes left.

784
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,769
Ho-young definitely looks like
he has more time to spare.

785
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,172
-Yes.
-Chef Ho-young looks relaxed.

786
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,907
4. STIR-FRY VEGGIES AND BACON BITS

787
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,510
Chef Ho-young uses the bacon bits
he barely managed to find.

788
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,114
ADDING FLAVORS
WITH THE BASIC PROVIDED VEGGIES

789
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,482
They're really something.

790
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,419
-Chef Ho-young uses flakes from <i>ramyeon.</i>
<i>-Ramyeon?</i>

791
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,423
He's adding the vegetable flakes
from the black bean <i>ramyeon.</i>

792
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,059
-You're right.
-He got as much as he could find.

793
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,929
You're right! There are vegetable flakes.

794
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,996
There were veggies!

795
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:36,334
-He had veggies.
-Yes, he did. He had it there.

796
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,169
Have those flakes ever been so valuable?

797
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,904
You added enough protein.

798
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,606
-That's enough.
-Enough protein.

799
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,075
He had vegetables!

800
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,945
STANDING APOLOGY

801
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,181
And he bows
to ask for their understanding.

802
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,717
The noodles are in the making.

803
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,320
-It looks good.
-The udon is ready.

804
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,822
-It looks excellent.
-How is he so good at that?

805
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,124
BLACK BEAN RAMYEON SOUP BASE

806
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,559
What's that now?

807
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,662
Chef Ho-young sprinkled
black bean <i>ramyeon</i> soup base.

808
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,364
He's mixing it like teriyaki sauce.

809
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,633
-To make stir-fried udon?
-Yes.

810
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,969
He said he loved that <i>ramyeon</i> the most.

811
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,770
-He's using onions…
-What's he doing?

812
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,672
-What's that? Snacks?
-What's he doing?

813
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,242
-The cream puff snack.
-The puff snack.

814
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,645
-The cream puff snack.
-He's smashing the cream puff snack.

815
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,480
-What's he going to do?
-What's that?

816
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,450
How will he use that?
Is that for red bean <i>bingsu?</i>

817
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,018
He's using it to coat the rice cake.

818
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,354
-He's using that instead of bean powder.
-Right?

819
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,490
-He used the puffs as the bean powder.
-He coated the rice cake?

820
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,259
He'd be good
at the convenience store mission.

821
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,727
A GREAT IDEA BY USING THE SNACKS

822
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,228
It's like <i>injeolmi</i>.

823
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,531
What he's doing is practically magic.

824
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,667
The fridge owner is…

825
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,802
He's now fried <i>jeolpyeon.</i>

826
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,738
-It's magic.
-It is.

827
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,872
It's regular <i>jeolpyeon</i>, right?

828
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,007
SPRINTING AT FULL SPEED

829
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,210
-Where are you going?
-What do you need?

830
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,279
-Everything's gone.
-Nothing's there.

831
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,381
-Ice?
-I was going to make red bean <i>bingsu.</i>

832
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,283
-It's his <i>bingsu.</i>
-The chocolate <i>bingsu!</i>

833
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,352
-Will he use the seasonal fruit?
-The one with the fruit?

834
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,454
-The seasonal fruit!
-Seasonal fruit?

835
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,591
-That fruit? Will he use that?
-It'll be winter soon, right?

836
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,061
-And that <i>bingsu</i> has a piece of tangerine.
-You're right. The tangerine!

837
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,597
The chocolate <i>bingsu?</i>

838
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,065
Yes, there was tangerine.

839
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,199
That precious fruit.

840
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,301
It hasn't melted.

841
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,004
-It hasn't melted.
-It's still stuck in the ice.

842
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:20,905
Oh, no.

843
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,340
What's going on?

844
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,709
He pulled it out.

845
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,679
SAFELY RESCUED

846
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,083
-He rescued the tangerine!
-And he chops it in half?

847
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,918
He found the tangerine!

848
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,854
Sung-ju, can you report back
from the kitchen?

849
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,257
-I don't know if that's necessary.
-I feel so bad.

850
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,792
At least take a smell.

851
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,694
You'd feel bad for eating something.

852
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,761
You shouldn't taste it.

853
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,763
I don't think
there's anything I can taste.

854
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,700
He's using a torch with these ingredients?

855
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,636
The two chefs are doing their best.

856
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,939
Jong-won and Ho-young
are doing their best right now.

857
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,607
HE DOESN'T FORGET TO CLEAN UP

858
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,743
Let me have a taste
of the stir-fried udon.

859
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,578
It's not finished yet, though.

860
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:04,015
Look at the udon noodles.
Let me try the stir-fried udon.

861
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:08,453
Does it taste like it'll make
even a mid <i>mukbang</i> artist dance?

862
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,256
CURIOUS

863
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,492
The noodles are so chewy!

864
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,827
I knew it.

865
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,062
Isn't it a bit too sweet?

866
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,464
Stir-fried udon is better sweet.

867
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,233
-He said he liked sweet things.
-He likes his food sweet.

868
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,568
-It's for Woo-jae.
-It's simple.

869
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,204
I tend to like the kind of food
that taste sweet.

870
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,340
Ho-young begins
to serve the food delicately.

871
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,745
TRYING THE RED BEAN PORRIDGE

872
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:34,979
ADDING SALT

873
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,582
It's really turning
into red bean porridge.

874
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,450
The noodles are so chewy.

875
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,085
That looks deliciously fried.

876
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,755
-The fried <i>jeolpyeon</i>.
-It looks so good.

877
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,989
That has to be good.

878
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,225
GRINDING ICE

879
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,193
-He's making <i>bingsu.</i>
-What's he doing?

880
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,829
He's grinding ice to make <i>bingsu.</i>

881
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,399
-How sexy.
-I didn't know we had this machine.

882
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,967
<i>He's actually using ice.</i>

883
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,301
<i>That's crazy.</i>

884
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,437
He's grinding ice for <i>bingsu.</i>

885
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,739
My arm hurts.

886
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,841
I didn't know he'd do this.

887
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,011
-It's half a meal.
-He's trying so hard.

888
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,047
There just isn't enough quantity.

889
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,948
RED BEAN PORRIDGE IS DONE

890
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,750
Red bean porridge is done.

891
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:13,751
That's a lot.

892
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,886
Is that a shot glass?

893
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,088
-What's that?
-Yes, a shot glass.

894
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,957
6. SERVE RED BEAN PORRIDGE
AND TOP IT WITH RICE CAKE

895
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,161
Chef Jong-won is already done making
two of the courses.

896
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,731
Two chefs are doing their best
despite the tough situation.

897
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,533
6. MIX TSUYU, WITH INGREDIENTS
TO MAKE SAUCE

898
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,401
The thickness is perfect.

899
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,671
-What's that?
-It's the sauce to pour over the omelet.

900
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,641
-Two minutes! Time to make the omelet!
-Yes, the twister omelet.

901
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,142
THE EGG HE BEAT WITH LATTE

902
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,545
1 minute and 50 seconds.

903
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,148
POURING

904
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,349
He's doing something.

905
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,818
It's tough to do.

906
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,019
DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH TIME?

907
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,221
-Is this a thing in Japan?
-Coffee? I don't think so.

908
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,389
It's…

909
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,824
Oh, no!

910
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,058
Oh, no. Why?

911
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,660
-It's tough to do.
-Oh, no.

912
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,528
-He failed!
-He failed!

913
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,663
Ho-young fails!

914
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,933
-He must redo it at 1 minute, 13 seconds.
-Oh, no!

915
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,167
-He has to redo it!
-The twister!

916
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,069
Use a smaller pan.

917
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,471
-Just use eggs.
-A smaller pan.

918
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,407
-Yes, that's more like it.
-It's like making <i>dalgona.</i>

919
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,375
You have under a minute.

920
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,443
You don't have enough time.

921
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,178
HE ALSO DOESN'T HAVE TIME

922
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:19,884
7. TOP SHAVED ICE ON TOP OF
CRUSHED PUFFS TO MAKE BINGSU

923
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,188
-That's <i>bingsu.</i>
-Look at the <i>bingsu.</i>

924
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,156
He's making <i>bingsu.</i>

925
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,557
He tops it with seasonal fruit.

926
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,226
He has to finish this.

927
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,162
Jong-won is having a rough time too.

928
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,397
This is the seasonal <i>bingsu.</i>

929
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,566
It's seasonal fruit <i>bingsu.</i>

930
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,170
ICE CREAM SAUCE
THAT HAS COOLED DOWN

931
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,738
Seasonal fruit and red bean <i>bingsu.</i>

932
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,741
-Fruit and red bean <i>bingsu.</i>
-He's even topping it with red bean paste.

933
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,811
-He tops it with red bean paste.
-He can do this.

934
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,380
FEELING MORE HUMILIATED
AS INGREDIENTS ARE PILED UP

935
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,182
He's using some cookies too!

936
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,117
A stick cookie. How detailed!

937
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,552
You have 25 seconds.

938
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,520
RADDLED

939
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,756
-Don't their efforts make you feel worse?
-This is killing me.

940
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,358
Just pour it in!

941
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,793
HIS 2ND TRY FOR THE TWISTER OMELET

942
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,030
STIRRING

943
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,865
He has to save this!

944
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,368
He can't make the twister shape!

945
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,171
-Twenty seconds.
-Isn't that a regular fried egg?

946
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,506
-Twenty seconds.
-Isn't that a regular fried egg?

947
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,942
He just tops it on the udon.

948
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,179
He makes it look like a twister.
Don't let it fall apart!

949
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:25,016
-It looks good.
-That's it! It looks beautiful!

950
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,884
JONG-WON BEGINS
TO SERVE THE FOOD

951
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,519
RED BEAN PORRIDGE

952
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,489
FRIED JEOLPYEON

953
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,925
SEASONAL FRUIT AND RED BEAN BINGSU

954
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,493
The egg is on the udon.

955
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,961
Ten. Nine. Eight.

956
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,930
-Jong-won is done.
-This is crazy!

957
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,065
Five.

958
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,367
Four. Three.

959
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,503
Two. One.

960
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,939
Ho-young rings the bell and is done.

961
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,274
-This is unbelievable.
-For real.

962
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,977
-I can't believe it.
-They managed to make something.

963
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,545
Great work.

964
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,513
WOW

965
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,615
-It looks so pretty.
-They both look good.

966
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,818
-Push it over quickly.
-There weren't enough ingredients.

967
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,687
Please push it down the middle.

968
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,457
Both dishes were made for Woo-jae's order
of Half a Meal, Please.

969
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,693
-He's in tears.
-Yes.

970
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,762
He must be moved.
The fridge owner is very touched.

971
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,331
The more effort

972
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,733
the chefs put in just now,

973
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,803
-the more embarrassed I felt.
-Don't say that.

974
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,472
I felt like
I was standing naked in a plaza.

975
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,274
I was so embarrassed.

976
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:27,945
It's hard to believe that
these dishes were made with ingredients

977
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,647
that came from my fridge.

978
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,583
Chef Jong-won didn't even use
other ingredients provided.

979
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,052
Please try his dishes first.

980
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,489
THREE DISHES
MADE WITH SCRAPED RED BEAN PASTE

981
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,057
RED BEAN PORRIDGE

982
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,659
FRIED JEOLPYEON

983
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,394
RED BEAN BINGSU

984
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,798
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S
RED BEAN ICON

985
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,967
These three flavor musketeers
will enrapture him.

986
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,402
LIFT

987
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,271
The little touches are moving.

988
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,074
EACH COURSE HAS A DIFFERENT UTENSIL

989
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,376
Those are so cute.

990
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,344
I'll try the porridge first.

991
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,713
It's like something you can get
at a cute cafe in Seochon.

992
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,682
-Try it with the rice cake.
-Look at that.

993
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,652
He scraped the paste
out from <i>jeolpyeon</i> to make that.

994
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:11,088
-Geez. It's literally red bean porridge.
-Like from a hot cafe in Seochon.

995
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,623
It's red bean porridge.

996
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,558
-With the rice cake and all.
-The rice cake too.

997
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,828
It's like red bean porridge
someone had simmered for 48 hours.

998
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,398
You don't have to consider anything.
It's red bean porridge.

999
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,700
FINALLY, A BITE
OF THE RED BEAN PORRIDGE!

1000
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,672
Is it red bean porridge?

1001
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,640
-Wait, is this for real?
-Does it taste real?

1002
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,042
TWO BITES

1003
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,578
Did it just seem passable?
Or was it like real porridge?

1004
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,814
-He already had four bites.
-The light eater?

1005
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,416
-What?
-He goes back for more.

1006
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,684
His lips went out first.

1007
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,486
-My gosh.
-Hey.

1008
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,623
-Wait, this means you aren't…
-Have you always had a big appetite?

1009
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,757
You know what?

1010
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,159
I must be a big eater.

1011
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,128
-My gosh.
-You kept eating and eating.

1012
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,130
This doesn't make any sense.

1013
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:57,601
I can't believe he made this
from the paste he got from <i>jeolpyeon.</i>

1014
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,770
It's just regular old red bean porridge.

1015
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:05,142
-But it does come with more sweetness.
-It's sweeter?

1016
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,811
Did he add more sugar?

1017
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,679
-Did you? No?
-Just salt.

1018
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,714
Just salt?

1019
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,716
-You added salt?
-So it became sweeter.

1020
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,150
Is that why it's sweeter?

1021
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,454
-So we add salt to red bean porridge.
-It brings out the sweetness.

1022
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,524
-Woo-jae, the light eater, continues.
-He keep eating more.

1023
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,428
Jong-won uses his magic
to make him go back for more.

1024
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:25,896
-Fried <i>jeolpyeon.</i>
-It looks good too.

1025
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,565
-He can do that?
-Right?

1026
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,768
-Don't try to play a part.
-You're cutting that?

1027
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:35,272
Others may be curious,
and this much is enough for me.

1028
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,341
He fried that <i>jeolpyeon.</i>

1029
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,443
YUM

1030
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,678
CURIOUS

1031
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,613
Will the light eater be pleased?

1032
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,383
It must taste familiar,
but it's been toasted.

1033
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,484
Yes.

1034
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,188
Did you just fry it?
Did you add anything else?

1035
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,558
Rice cake is starchy, so it turns
crunchy and delicious when fried.

1036
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,195
You know that flavor
when you grill a bar of rice cake?

1037
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,164
-The crunchiness.
-The crunchy texture.

1038
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,600
It's that
and the sweetness of the red bean.

1039
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,968
All he did was fry this,

1040
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,270
but it became something else.

1041
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,472
It's a completely different rice cake.

1042
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,474
It tastes a whole lot classier.

1043
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,443
-The red bean <i>bingsu.</i>
-The hero.

1044
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,577
And now, the red bean <i>bingsu.</i>

1045
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,447
-Try it with the red bean and the fruit.
-The seasonal fruit?

1046
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,149
-The tangerine.
-The tangerine?

1047
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,618
-That single piece?
-He keeps emphasizing the seasonal fruit.

1048
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,853
-There are two pieces.
-Seasonal fruit is good for you.

1049
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,156
A BITE OF RED BEAN BINGSU

1050
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,792
AND A BITE OF THE COOKIE

1051
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,428
-He can make food look good and enjoy it?
-It's like a classy cafe.

1052
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,998
-It's so good.
-Is it?

1053
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,133
-Is it good?
-It's so good?

1054
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,602
The seasonal fruit was the kick!

1055
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,673
-From the chocolate <i>bingsu?</i>
-It's the tangerine.

1056
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,809
-Nice addition.
-That single tangerine piece.

1057
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,478
-The other half remains here.
-He had cut it in half.

1058
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,014
I couldn't figure out
another subtle flavor,

1059
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,917
and it was the crushed cream puff snack.

1060
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,985
-The puff snack?
-The cream puffs.

1061
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,556
<i>-There's a subtle taste of that too.</i>
<i>-He coated the rice cake with it.</i>

1062
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,224
It has a lot of flavors.

1063
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,926
<i>-There's ice cream.</i>
<i>-Ice cream sauce.</i>

1064
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,794
<i>-Is that why?</i>
<i>-That's the sauce.</i>

1065
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,095
May I have just one bite?

1066
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,897
I left the fruit for you.

1067
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,400
It was already half a meal,
yet he left some behind.

1068
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,001
He left some for him?

1069
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,503
Try some.

1070
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,437
A BITE OF THE PORRIDGE

1071
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,438
-The porridge.
-The porridge.

1072
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,773
EYES WIDENED

1073
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,009
-It must be a taste he likes.
-The porridge is so good.

1074
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,244
Isn't it amazing?

1075
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,612
-It is.
-It really is.

1076
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,080
-That's the red bean porridge.
-Porridge.

1077
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,617
EATS THE OTHER HALF
OF FRIED JEOLPYEON

1078
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,752
TRULY AMAZED

1079
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,958
It's like something served at a nice cafe,
like a place you'd go on dates.

1080
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,061
-It has that Ikseon-dong vibe.
-Ikseon-dong.

1081
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,897
-It's like a cafe in Ikseon-dong.
-A traditional <i>hanok</i> cafe.

1082
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,132
-The seasonal fruit <i>bingsu.</i>
-There's one.

1083
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,033
Do you have the piece?

1084
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,537
-He left a piece for you?
-You'll taste the sourness.

1085
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,306
The subtle flavor fills your mouth, right?

1086
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,809
-The tangerine is the key.
-It was the kick.

1087
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,378
It's like something you'd get
at a very classy cafe.

1088
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,114
It's just small in portion.

1089
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,617
The quantity is ridiculous,
but the porridge is amazing.

1090
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,820
-The porridge?
-If you want a bowl of that,

1091
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,555
he'll need 200 <i>jeolpyeon.</i>

1092
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,024
-You have to save it.
-Exactly.

1093
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,327
And next, Chef Ho-young's dish.

1094
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,865
HANDMADE STIR-FRIED UDON
AND TWISTER OMELET WITH LATTE

1095
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,737
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
TRY HALF A UDON

1096
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,806
He ripped out the bacon bits

1097
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,642
-and stir-fried that.
-I must've lost my mind.

1098
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,943
I didn't take a picture!

1099
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,281
-No!
-That's not good.

1100
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:34,251
Chef Jong-won's dish
already looks too muddled.

1101
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,886
The fried <i>jeolpyeon</i> is gone.

1102
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,655
At least the dishes, then.

1103
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,189
-He forgot.
-Can you take a picture?

1104
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,991
I'll send it to you.

1105
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,126
Please do that.

1106
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,061
-Ho-young's dish.
-I'll try some.

1107
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,931
The key of his dish was the bacon bits

1108
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,199
<i>and the dried vegetable flakes.</i>

1109
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,935
<i>-And latte.</i>
<i>-Latte.</i>

1110
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,037
I've never seen anyone make
omelet with latte.

1111
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,171
Okay, now.

1112
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,275
Try everything together,
including the omelet and sauce.

1113
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,811
-Will it smell like coffee?
-Yes, just like that.

1114
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,546
The omelet is such a wonder.

1115
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,148
He's eating too much today.

1116
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,983
-He eats so well.
-He eats well.

1117
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,418
You aren't a light eater.

1118
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:12,856
HMM?

1119
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,427
This is insane!

1120
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,562
This is insane!

1121
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,530
ANXIOUS - RELIEVED

1122
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,831
Is it that good?

1123
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,900
Is it because of the <i>katsuobushi?</i>

1124
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,002
It tastes like
stir-fried udon at a restaurant.

1125
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:29,974
But it came with a bit more sweetness
just as he had said.

1126
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,276
It's like a fusion stir-fried udon,

1127
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,846
-but it's definitely catered to my taste.
-With the sweetness.

1128
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,015
He must've made it sweeter
to please your appetite.

1129
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,984
Where did you find the <i>katsuobushi?</i>

1130
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,120
It was in the <i>ramyeon</i> meal kit.

1131
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,755
You got it from there?

1132
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,557
He managed to spot that.

1133
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,627
-He found everything.
-So that's where you found it.

1134
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:52,296
Gosh, he found <i>katsuobushi.</i>

1135
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,430
THIS TIME, JUST THE OMELET

1136
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,566
-He eats well.
-He's eating a lot.

1137
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,301
-Does it taste like coffee?
-Like latte?

1138
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,603
-It does play a role.
-Does it?

1139
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,339
The omelet itself became a bit softer.

1140
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,842
The egg tastes much milder.

1141
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,911
-How are the noodles?
-They're excellent.

1142
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,047
-He found the bacon bits.
-This is it, right?

1143
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,650
-That wasn't a bacon bit.
-It's a piece of bread.

1144
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,519
-Bread mixed with bacon bits.
-He ripped out the bread as is.

1145
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,888
-It's stuck on the bread. It's too tiny.
-He just used it?

1146
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,289
It's not just bacon.

1147
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,192
It's two-thirds bread
with a bit of bacon on it.

1148
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:25,095
The smaller the bacon, the better.

1149
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,464
It's too much when it's too big.

1150
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:32,269
I love the chewiness
from these tiny bacon bits.

1151
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,339
-I was so curious about the omelet.
-Try it with the omelet.

1152
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,508
It tastes amazing.

1153
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,443
SLURPING

1154
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,847
I get what he meant about <i>katsuobushi.</i>

1155
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,849
I think it's how good the sauce is.

1156
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:49,086
<i>It's a mix of </i>tsuyu<i>,</i>
<i>cooking wine, and vinegar,</i>

1157
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,889
<i>and I controlled the thickness</i>
<i>with sugar and starch water.</i>

1158
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,357
He used starch.

1159
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,325
It almost tasted like teriyaki sauce.

1160
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,528
He made it thicker with starch.

1161
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,930
-The sauce is insane.
-It's crazy.

1162
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,131
The sauce is crazy.

1163
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,600
How did they make these
with those ingredients?

1164
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,871
-That's why they're amazing.
-Exactly.

1165
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,473
It's now time to choose.

1166
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,609
Which one captured his heart more?

1167
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,411
<i>Press one for Son Jong-won</i>

1168
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,147
<i>and two for Jung Ho-young.</i>

1169
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,417
Let's find out who won this round,

1170
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,319
Half a Meal, Please. Show us!

1171
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,089
Who will become the winner?

1172
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:29,660
Will it be Chef Jong-won,
who made three dishes by using red beans?

1173
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,731
Or will it be Chef Ho-young,
who made delicious stir-fried udon?

1174
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,667
Which half a meal did Woo-jae pick?

1175
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,901
Which one is it?

1176
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,237
Who'll win a star?

1177
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,972
Who's the winner?

1178
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,574
Who is it?

1179
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,008
SON JONG-WON WINS

1180
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,544
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S
RED BEAN ICON WINS

1181
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,348
-Great work.
-Son Jong-won takes the star today.

1182
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,883
-I see.
-Yes.

1183
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,519
I could taste the power of seasonal fruit.

1184
00:45:55,586 --> 00:46:00,758
-Of course, the seasonal fruit.
-I tasted the power of seasonal fruit.

1185
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,794
Both dishes were amazingly delicious,

1186
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,865
something I couldn't believe they made
by using the ingredients I had.

1187
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,467
Because of that, I had no choice

1188
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,638
but to decide by the percentage
of outside ingredients they used.

1189
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,240
Yes, I would think so.

1190
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,608
-I had to.
-Of course.

1191
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,710
I wondered why he suddenly began to run.

1192
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,147
<i>-It was just to get the tangerine piece.</i>
<i>-That was the kick.</i>

1193
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,449
And it played a big part in his victory.

1194
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,918
-The seasonal fruit.
-That really was the reason.

1195
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,554
Please put a star on Chef Jong-won!

1196
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,657
This is his ninth win!

1197
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:38,395
-Thank you.
-He takes his ninth star. Congratulations!

1198
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,064
The red bean dishes win.

1199
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,767
-Finally.
-The red bean dishes.

1200
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:48,038
<i>Next, the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Woo-jae.</i>

1201
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,474
The cold-blooded chef
who'll even fight her own teacher,

1202
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,410
like a moth to a flame,
the reckless Park Eun-yeong is up.

1203
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,411
A moth to a flame?

1204
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,313
One who always finds
a new teacher to side with,

1205
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,881
the sliest chef of them all,

1206
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:02,820
-The sliest?
-Kwon Sung-jun is also up.

1207
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,422
His teacher always changes.

1208
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,624
You aren't wrong, but gosh

1209
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,459
I've never seen an order like this.

1210
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,663
He says, "Chef, Not My Fridge."

1211
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:16,400
He's on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> and says,
"Chef, Not My Fridge."

1212
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,002
"Don't use what's in the fridge.
Only use what's outside."

1213
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,338
You two aren't allowed to open the fridge.

1214
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,973
The ingredients sound perfect now.

1215
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,308
It's perfect?

1216
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,943
The ingredients reminded me

1217
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,513
of the convenience store round,

1218
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,215
which we have done before.

1219
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,850
<i>On</i> Culinary Class Wars.

1220
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,351
<i>I easily took first place.</i>

1221
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,587
<i>Napoli Matfia.</i>

1222
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,756
-You're right.
-But my dear Eun-yeong

1223
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,758
-had to go home.
-She had to go?

1224
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,260
You were eliminated?

1225
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,528
It's a return match.

1226
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,396
A REMATCH HERE
ON CHEF & MY FRIDGE

1227
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,167
Chef Eun-yeong said this before.

1228
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:54,104
"It's so hard to cook on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
because of Sung-jun."

1229
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,473
-What? Why?
-Is he giving you a tough time?

1230
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,810
Chef Sung-jun always sits
right in front of me when I cook

1231
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,211
and tries to sabotage me.

1232
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,246
Sabotage you?

1233
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,847
-Sabotage you?
-That was rough.

1234
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,717
-He tries to hinder you.
-Hinder you.

1235
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:11,822
He often tries to hinder me
by causing inconveniences.

1236
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,825
So I thought
it was about time I taught him a lesson.

1237
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,262
That was why I wanted to fight him today.

1238
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,063
She's completely wrong,

1239
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,065
because I'll sabotage her
by her side today.

1240
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,634
Right next to her.

1241
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,036
I won't sit around and just listen to him.

1242
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,371
THIS IS INTERESTING

1243
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,772
She's making comebacks.

1244
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,909
-Their fight is fierce.
-This is a solid competition.

1245
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,145
At first, I felt sorry,
so I really shouldn't feel this way.

1246
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,948
But the two chefs in the previous round
did such a great job,

1247
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,249
so I have high hopes now.

1248
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,218
It's bad news.

1249
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,020
I'm so sorry about that.

1250
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,055
HIS EXPECTATIONS HAVE GONE UP

1251
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,456
He's like, "They can do this?"

1252
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,626
If they made it look impossible,
I would've just felt sorry.

1253
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,194
But you could do this.

1254
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,165
-You could, but you haven't.
-Exactly.

1255
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,634
-That's what chefs on the show do.
-Correct.

1256
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,202
He suddenly became so brazen.

1257
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,371
PFFT

1258
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,441
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS:
SWEET POTATO CHIPS

1259
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,043
CHOCOLATE PUFF SNACK,
MILK PUFF SNACK, GUMMIES

1260
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,544
What I'm making is called

1261
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,080
Plan to Lose Again by <i>Basi?</i>

1262
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,117
-Plan to Lose Again by <i>Basi?</i>
-You're making <i>basi?</i>

1263
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,520
-The way he said that was…
-It's like Shin Dong-yeop's thing.

1264
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:17,454
Hello, there.

1265
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,556
WOO-JAE'S SIGNATURE GREETING

1266
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:24,328
I've taken after Dong-yeop's thing
to greet my viewers like that,

1267
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,430
"Hello, there" is how I start my videos.

1268
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,533
-I've taken that tone and used it.
-Just like that.

1269
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,734
What's it called again?

1270
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,570
-Plan to Lose Again by <i>Basi?</i>
-Plan to Lose Again by <i>Basi?</i>

1271
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,372
Why is he so annoying today?

1272
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,007
She has lost by <i>basi</i> before.

1273
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,542
She had to go home

1274
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,177
after facing <i>siraegi basi </i>on that show.

1275
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,079
She's making thin lines.

1276
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,581
-Chef Jung Ji-sun. Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1277
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,883
He's already messing with her head.

1278
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,586
-So I'm making <i>basi.</i>
-What?

1279
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,521
There's a French pastry
called croquembouche,

1280
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:56,026
-Croquembouche?
-made with a pile of choux pastry.

1281
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:59,162
So I plan to make that
by using his snacks.

1282
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,630
Additionally,

1283
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,866
I'm going to use the gummies

1284
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,267
to secure the snacks.

1285
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,336
Also, I saw these sweet potato chips.

1286
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,271
-That's a good one.
-I'll also use this

1287
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,874
to make a cream sauce
and serve with the dish.

1288
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,576
This round won't be easy as well.

1289
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,044
He's making a cream sauce with chips?

1290
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,579
She's using too many things,

1291
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,115
including knives,
but I won't use any knives or scissors.

1292
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,550
-No?
-I'll only use my hands.

1293
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,352
HE'LL ONLY USE HANDS

1294
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,254
-No tools?
-Zero tools.

1295
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,155
With his hands.

1296
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,491
Actually, what Chef Eun-yeong
is making seems too obvious.

1297
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:28,392
-Obvious?
-I can tell.

1298
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,428
-She'll fiddle with some flour and stuff.
-Fiddle?

1299
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,397
-That must be aggravating.
-It's too much.

1300
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,033
-He's provoking you out in the open.
-Hmph!

1301
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,869
-He keeps picking on Chef Eun-yeong.
-Are you scared?

1302
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,238
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:
ANDONG-STYLE NOODLES MEAL KIT

1303
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,873
BLACK BEAN RAMYEON,
PEANUT CREAM BISCUITS

1304
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,608
The dish I'm making is

1305
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,877
Know Your Woo-jae.

1306
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,812
Know Your Woo-jae.

1307
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,682
Just like saying, "Know your place!"

1308
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,452
AN EXCELLENT WORDPLAY

1309
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,055
Hey, know your place, Know Your Woo-jae.

1310
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,191
Sung-jun doesn't know his place

1311
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:05,095
and tries to make <i>basi</i>
while fighting against a Chinese chef.

1312
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,431
I should teach him a lesson today.

1313
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,032
Also, if there is something

1314
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,235
he's not doing right while making <i>basi,</i>
I'll probably need to offer help.

1315
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,072
-Ask for help when you need it.
-Of course.

1316
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,174
She thinks he doesn't know his place.

1317
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,376
So? What are you making?

1318
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,311
I prepared a Chinese dish and a dessert.

1319
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,847
There's a dish called dough-drop soup,

1320
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,816
-Dough-drop soup.
-which resembles <i>sujebi.</i>

1321
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,117
Dough-drop soup?

1322
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,518
I'm going to make that first,

1323
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,287
and he seems to love
peanut cream biscuits,

1324
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,255
-I do.
-so I'll make churros with those.

1325
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,924
-What?
-Churros?

1326
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,625
So she <i>is</i> fiddling with flour.

1327
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,294
-He's so annoying.
-Homemade Chinese <i>sujebi.</i>

1328
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,196
-Fiddle? That's right.
-And now…

1329
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,866
let the next round begin.
The order is, "Chef, Not My Fridge."

1330
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,735
She says, "Sung-jun, know thyself."

1331
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,206
The Socrates among chefs,
Chef Park Eun-yeong.

1332
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:53,343
But he's here to present Eun-yeong
with <i>basi</i>-phobia.

1333
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:58,348
The Santa Claus among chefs,
Chef Kwon Sung-jun.

1334
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,684
This is a rough round they'll play

1335
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,352
without opening the fridge.

1336
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,754
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1337
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,825
THE CHEF WHO ALWAYS
CHANGES HIS TEACHER!

1338
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,727
THE CHEF WHO WAITED FOR REVENGE!

1339
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,330
Sung-jun won't use any tools to make <i>basi.</i>

1340
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,133
-He won't use any tools?
-No.

1341
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,267
First, chips.

1342
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,270
He pours the entire bag into a pot.

1343
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,705
He'll boil that?

1344
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,573
You're making a crapload
for a light eater.

1345
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,444
-What now?
-I didn't get that. What?

1346
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,713
Why is he making a crapload
for a light eater?

1347
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,949
-A crapload?
-A crapload?

1348
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,651
He can't finish it,
so don't make a crapload.

1349
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,486
She's using many harsh words.

1350
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,921
He needs to learn a lesson.

1351
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,157
Sung-jun is making a crapload of food.

1352
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,292
SUNG-JUN'S
"EXCHANGE THE TEACHER" BEGINS

1353
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,593
Your oil looks great.

1354
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,562
COPYING KIM POONG!

1355
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,597
SHE WAS ALSO A VICTIM BACK THEN

1356
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,865
Hey, don't use too much.

1357
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,134
He steals her oil like it's his.

1358
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,469
It looked great.

1359
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:55,839
He's adding butter to the chips.

1360
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,340
I think she'll grind the biscuits.

1361
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,143
She'll grind the peanut biscuits.

1362
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,645
She said she'd make churros.

1363
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,614
I'm dying to see how she'll make churros.

1364
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,184
-Yes, they usually come in long sticks.
-Yes.

1365
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,385
And they're chewy.

1366
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,855
I guess that'll turn into churros.

1367
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,324
Can she make churros
with peanut cream biscuits?

1368
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,792
POURING IN

1369
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,028
Sugar? My gosh.

1370
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:20,363
More!

1371
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,765
He's using a crapload of sugar.

1372
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,633
-More! More sugar!
-<i>Basi </i>is made with sugar.

1373
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,535
Isn't that too much sugar?

1374
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,603
It's okay.

1375
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,772
Sung-jun uses gummy candies.

1376
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,074
Gummies? What's he doing with those?

1377
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,910
He's going to melt them and…

1378
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,313
I'll use it
to secure the cream puff snack.

1379
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,148
-He's using it as glue.
-Yes.

1380
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,083
I have to make a high pile.

1381
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,285
-He's using it as glue.
-It's like glue.

1382
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,354
That's a wonderful idea.

1383
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,789
It's all about ideas today.

1384
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,023
He's only using snacks.

1385
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,858
He's using melted snacks.

1386
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,994
They aren't people
who should cook with those things.

1387
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,530
-Is that for cream?
-The chips have already melted.

1388
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,265
The sweet potato chips actually melted.

1389
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,802
What's that sauce?

1390
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,805
I added butter to hot water
to make this dough.

1391
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,573
I boiled water to make this dough.

1392
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,309
-I see. That's a thing.
-I feel so bad.

1393
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,745
Wait, it already looks like churro dough.

1394
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:09,879
AMAZED

1395
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,881
-Yes, if it's a long stick.
-Yes, if it's long.

1396
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,717
-If it's longer, it is.
-The color is right.

1397
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,853
Goodness, what a mess.

1398
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,755
-What a mess.
-Did you mess with it?

1399
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,459
-You can't mess with this.
-You're so nervous.

1400
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,761
They're busy dissing each other.

1401
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,630
4. COOL CHURRO DOUGH
IN THE FREEZER

1402
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,231
Eun-yeong is very spiteful.

1403
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,234
-Yes, she is.
-Chef Eun-yeong looks quite spiteful.

1404
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,937
That's why they seem like siblings.

1405
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,872
ONION - GREEN ONION

1406
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:36,973
DOUGH-DROP SOUP BEGINS!

1407
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,542
She's stir-frying onion right now.

1408
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,345
Is that soup base?

1409
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,715
-I'll add just a little.
-She uses some black bean <i>ramyeon.</i>

1410
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,818
Adding black bean <i>ramyeon</i> soup base
to stir-fried onion is just <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

1411
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,387
-It is.
-She's making <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

1412
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,023
-Wasn't she making something like <i>sujebi?</i>
-I am.

1413
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,658
That with <i>sujebi?</i>

1414
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:57,160
-The vegetable flakes.
-The vegetable flakes.

1415
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,428
5. STIR-FRY WITH COOKING WINE

1416
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,830
BONE BROTH FROM THE ANDONG-STYLE
NOODLES MEAL KIT

1417
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,800
What's she using that for?
Is that the soup?

1418
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,335
6. ADD BONE BROTH
AND WATER AND BOIL

1419
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,570
He's grinding that?

1420
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:12,375
-He's grinding the cooked chips.
-Is that the cream?

1421
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,743
You're absolutely frazzled.

1422
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,313
-He said he'd turn it into cream.
-Like mousse?

1423
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,581
He said he wouldn't use
knives or scissors,

1424
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,817
but he still uses a blender.

1425
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,052
I have to.

1426
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,487
I guess he couldn't use his hands.

1427
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,990
You should refrain
from using the ladle too.

1428
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,491
AHEM

1429
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,627
-He should.
-And for that pot.

1430
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,195
Stir the gummies with your hand too.

1431
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,530
You only talk big.

1432
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,864
You used all the tools.

1433
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,100
You just didn't use a knife.
You used everything else.

1434
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,435
Or scissors.

1435
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,803
CHIPS BECAME SWEET POTATO CREAM!

1436
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,271
He had to use everything.

1437
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,939
It goes into a piping bag.

1438
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,409
He's using a piping bag now.

1439
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,545
COPYING JONG-WON!

1440
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,414
JONG-WON'S TEACHING:
MAKE EVERY MOVE FULL OF VIBES

1441
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,949
He turned those into that?

1442
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,218
He cools it for now.

1443
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,454
-Is it going well?
-It is. Stop talking to me.

1444
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,523
-I don't think it is.
-Why are you using so much sugar?

1445
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,027
You don't need that much to make <i>basi.</i>

1446
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,562
Your dish is so obvious.

1447
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,564
Listen to those two.

1448
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,033
-Is this a comedy sketch?
-Did they rehearse this?

1449
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,702
-Who'll eat all that food?
-You have zero creativity.

1450
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,137
-How annoying.
-Right?

1451
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,472
THE CHOUX PASTRY SNACKS

1452
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,541
She's making the dough right away?

1453
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,610
She's making the dough for the soup.

1454
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,346
She has to shake it around
while adding drops of water.

1455
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,281
-Is that dough like <i>sujebi?</i>
-It is.

1456
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:28,518
That's the dough for the dough-drop soup.

1457
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,153
That's already done.

1458
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,755
-That's done?
-That's it.

1459
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,123
It's still just flour.

1460
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,024
-That's Chinese <i>sujebi?</i>
-It's softly made.

1461
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,861
The dough is barely kneaded,
so it's just like some beads.

1462
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,298
WHAT IS THIS?

1463
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:44,100
What is that?

1464
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,205
IT'S MELTED GUMMIES!

1465
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,074
He lays out melted gummy.

1466
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,942
I love the color.

1467
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,244
It acts as glue.

1468
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,912
THE GLUE TO SECURE
THE CHOUX SNACKS

1469
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,947
See? You can do this.

1470
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,482
Yes, he's doing it.

1471
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,518
GOOD!

1472
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,220
-He's using that as glue.
-He'll pile the snacks?

1473
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,323
Woo-jae goes, "See? You can do this."

1474
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,592
See? He's doing it.

1475
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,661
I don't think it'll hold up.

1476
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,129
Can he really pile everything?

1477
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,597
He doesn't have enough gummies.

1478
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,199
-He'll run out on the top.
-It's not enough.

1479
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,901
You'll need lots of gummies.

1480
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,702
I just need it for the foundation.

1481
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,571
Thanks to me, it feels like the holidays.

1482
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,707
-Isn't it like Christmas?
-It is like Christmas.

1483
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,311
-It is a Christmas dessert.
-And look at that green color.

1484
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,913
You're right.

1485
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,648
I think I can try that later.

1486
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,017
I never thought of using that as glue.

1487
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,519
You have 8 minutes and 30 seconds.

1488
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,557
The dough will start to melt
as soon as it's in the soup,

1489
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,659
so it'll turn out like thick soup.

1490
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,527
-It's like that?
-Yes.

1491
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,931
It does have some dough beads,
but it's also like thick soup.

1492
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,866
-It's not just beaded dough?
-No.

1493
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,668
Do you remember the piping bag?

1494
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,870
But he said he wouldn't use
knives or scissors.

1495
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,405
-How will he cut that?
-What?

1496
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,840
-Wait.
-You're right!

1497
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,976
-What if he bites it off?
-You said you wouldn't use tools!

1498
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,479
-You can't use knives or scissors!
-He said he wouldn't.

1499
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,481
How will you cut that piping bag?

1500
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,549
You know you'll look awful
if you use a knife now.

1501
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,718
I'm dying to know what he'll do.

1502
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,553
Hey, you can't use a knife.

1503
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,255
We're going to be disappointed.

1504
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,057
You said you wouldn't use a knife.

1505
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,892
SCISSORS CONFISCATED

1506
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,027
-The knives too.
-Take the knives too.

1507
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,362
How will you cut it?

1508
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,997
CAN I TAKE THAT BACK?

1509
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:24,434
You can probably make a hole
by rubbing it on the side of your hair.

1510
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,369
You can use the side of your head.

1511
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,637
With the side of his hair?

1512
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,973
-I need help, Eun-yeong?
-Help?

1513
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,341
You said you'd help!

1514
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,042
-Scissors?
-Will he use scissors?

1515
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,178
-Will it cut it off?
-Come on!

1516
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,547
Cut it for me. Help.

1517
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,818
SO CHEAP - I DIDN'T USE
SCISSORS, EUN-YEONG DID

1518
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,553
-He crashes down.
-He didn't use it himself.

1519
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,489
-Eun-yeong is too kind.
-She is.

1520
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,758
-That's why she's older.
-How nice.

1521
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,527
-Come on.
-That's why she's an older friend.

1522
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,729
-She uses a piping bag too!
-Churros!

1523
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:53,997
Churros.

1524
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,699
-She's making churros!
-It's happening!

1525
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,434
Hold it closer.

1526
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,370
The dough won't slide out smoothly.

1527
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:02,005
-It won't?
-It does.

1528
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,240
-Use more power!
-It's going well.

1529
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,241
Do you need help?

1530
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:09,913
That's called <i>pâte à choux</i>,
made with butter, flour, and eggs.

1531
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,148
-Yes?
-What's in it seems similar.

1532
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,650
I see.

1533
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,953
She's using biscuits,
so it'll cook quickly too.

1534
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,288
Six minutes left.

1535
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,190
Sung-jun continues to build his pile.

1536
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,059
Eun-yeong makes churros.

1537
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,294
EUN-YEONG USES ALL HER STRENGTH

1538
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,498
SHE'S DONE MAKING 4 CHURROS

1539
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,667
10. DEEP-FRY THE CHURRO DOUGH

1540
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,535
She drops them in oil.

1541
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,571
Churros are supposed to be deep-fried.

1542
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,706
Piling up those choux snacks

1543
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,475
does make it look like a Christmas tree.

1544
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,612
You're right.
He's using a lot of choux snacks.

1545
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,614
Can Woo-jae finish that?

1546
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,817
He'll have to keep it for a decade.

1547
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,787
-Until I'm 50?
-You'll have to eat it until you're 50.

1548
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,056
It's usually made
by setting a cone in the middle

1549
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,592
-and sticking choux pastry on it.
-Yes.

1550
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,528
It's usually for display,
instead of consumption.

1551
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,163
I wanted to make it as a dessert to eat.

1552
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,698
I've never seen anyone make a pile.

1553
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,201
-It's like he's praying to a pagoda.
-Yes, right.

1554
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,203
Is he making <i>basi </i>now?

1555
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,771
Sugar is boiling.

1556
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:12,775
It's the most important
to keep the sugar from crystallizing.

1557
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:13,843
Yes.

1558
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,179
It has to melt,
so the moment it crystallizes,

1559
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,614
-Is it ruined?
-everything will shatter.

1560
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,748
You're right.

1561
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,683
It's past five minutes.

1562
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,753
Jung-hwan, please go out.
We were too immersed in the round.

1563
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,121
Is there anything I can eat?

1564
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,422
There's nothing to taste.

1565
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,057
That sugar.

1566
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,959
-Sugar?
-The sugar.

1567
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,729
That pile of choux snacks
makes it feel like Christmas.

1568
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,298
-Yes.
-It feels like the Christmas season.

1569
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,367
He glued everything together
with melted gummies.

1570
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,069
EUN-YEONG FINISHES
DEEP-FRYING CHURROS!

1571
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,171
GOLDEN BROWN

1572
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,474
EGG

1573
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,744
-Jung-hwan!
-What's this?

1574
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,846
-The sugar is crystallizing.
-It's Chinese porridge.

1575
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,148
-What is Eun-yeong making?
-It's like <i>sujebi.</i>

1576
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:53,483
Can you try that?

1577
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,018
You have four minutes left.

1578
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,453
-That's new.
-It's Chinese <i>sujebi.</i>

1579
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,656
It's actually pretty good.

1580
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,591
-She hasn't served this.
-No.

1581
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,094
Will that soup put Sung-jun in his place?

1582
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,130
Will that soup put Sung-jun in his place?

1583
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,034
Will that soup put Sung-jun in his place?

1584
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,368
It will!

1585
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,937
-It's good.
-Know your place.

1586
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,706
-Isn't it good?
-The texture.

1587
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:17,874
The texture is fascinating.

1588
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,843
-I see.
-It's a lot of fun in your mouth.

1589
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,781
I see. So it's fun to eat.

1590
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,082
It's like <i>tteokguk </i>too.

1591
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,751
Sung-jun, will the sugar melt?

1592
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,253
-It'll melt.
-It will?

1593
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,587
-My oil.
-It'll melt if I borrow this.

1594
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,356
I hope the sugar turns out nicely.

1595
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,992
-Wait!
-What's wrong?

1596
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,194
-What? It crystallized!
-Three minutes!

1597
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:39,862
-You can't make <i>basi</i> with that.
-It's solid.

1598
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,365
-No.
-It has to melt all the way, right?

1599
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:45,034
-It crystallized already.
-They look way too solid.

1600
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,703
I think it already crystallized.

1601
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,071
Then what? Is he done?

1602
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,205
-He's done.
-You're done.

1603
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,306
No, I can save it.

1604
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,308
-Can you save it?
-He can't do that.

1605
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,644
-One more time.
-Not even the best out there can.

1606
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,678
One more time.

1607
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,914
HE REDUCES THE AMOUNT
TO CUT DOWN TIME

1608
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,816
Wait, as we speak,

1609
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,952
Chef Eun-yeong is making churros again.

1610
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,387
Why are you remaking those?

1611
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,022
These look a bit burnt.

1612
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,724
Try one and see if it's burnt.

1613
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,159
I had a bit of time, so I wanted to retry.

1614
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,928
Don't they look too dry?

1615
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,097
-Try it. Why is she redoing this?
-Okay.

1616
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,398
Are you okay, Sung-jun?

1617
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,633
-No.
-Try the churros.

1618
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,136
I feel so uneasy between them.

1619
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,170
They're bickering.

1620
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,473
Let me try the churro again
and see why she's retrying.

1621
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,241
-Okay.
-It should be good as is.

1622
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,309
Churros.

1623
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,945
Why is she retrying?

1624
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,747
-It's good.
-Is it?

1625
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,582
I thought it wouldn't be enough.

1626
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:33,483
Is it good?

1627
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,651
-Never mind. I'll keep these.
-It was good.

1628
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,220
Yes, it should be good.

1629
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:40,123
Jung-hwan thinks
she doesn't need to redo them.

1630
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,657
Just put sugar on it.

1631
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,261
FIRST AID ON THE SUGAR COMPLETE!

1632
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,430
-He saved it.
-He saved it. That's the color.

1633
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,432
-Just a little more.
-No, it'll begin to burn!

1634
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,667
-That's enough. It'll burn!
-Enough.

1635
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:52,902
I can save this!

1636
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:53,936
Turn the heat off.

1637
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,572
-He could save it.
-Did you add oil into it?

1638
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,841
-That's how he saved it.
-Yes, he saved it.

1639
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,146
Be careful, everyone.

1640
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,747
-Careful, everyone.
-He saved it.

1641
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,718
-He's making <i>basi</i> now.
-He has melted the sugar.

1642
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,253
He has to be careful.

1643
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,754
That's dangerous work.

1644
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:14,524
-He'll need more time.
-I think it'll drop if he turns it over.

1645
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,725
Right?

1646
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:20,396
How will he turn that over?

1647
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,965
-He's cooling it down.
-1 minute and 15 seconds.

1648
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:26,202
Will Sung-jun be able to make <i>basi?</i>

1649
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,739
13. COAT CHURROS WITH SUGAR

1650
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:33,242
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you help him make <i>basi?</i>

1651
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,612
-You should put ice below that.
-No.

1652
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,347
He needs ice below that?

1653
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,316
-You got no time.
-You know nothing about <i>basi.</i>

1654
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,551
STAB

1655
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,786
You have a minute left!

1656
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,087
"You know nothing about <i>basi</i>."

1657
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,623
-This is just…
-She's a Chinese chef.

1658
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,658
Are you doing okay?

1659
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,060
-I'm fine.
-Is this okay? I don't really know.

1660
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,628
I don't either, so I lost.

1661
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,931
-She didn't know, so she lost.
-What now?

1662
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,499
She didn't know, so she lost.

1663
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,301
It's falling!

1664
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,002
It's working!

1665
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,637
She didn't know, so she lost.

1666
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,039
It's falling!

1667
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,674
It's happening!

1668
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,477
<i>Plan to Lose Again by </i>Basi<i>?</i>

1669
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,914
It's falling too quickly.

1670
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,783
-It's way too fast.
-Is it?

1671
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,750
That's good.

1672
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,819
-It doesn't look so bad.
-That's it!

1673
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,322
WHEN IT TURNS AS THIN AS THREAD!

1674
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:22,425
-He's doing it!
-Thirty seconds!

1675
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,798
He's over the dessert now. He's doing it!

1676
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,633
I can't believe I'm seeing this again.

1677
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,069
-This is it!
-That's <i>basi!</i>

1678
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,104
You're so cool, Sung-jun!

1679
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,906
You can't do this, can you?

1680
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,674
Twenty seconds left.

1681
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,676
NIGHTMARE

1682
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:42,912
-Her trauma.
-Fifteen seconds!

1683
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,447
Fifteen seconds. Are you done, Eun-yeong?

1684
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:46,649
-I am.
-Ring the bell, then.

1685
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,284
My trauma made me nauseated.

1686
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,585
Eun-yeong is done.

1687
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:52,054
-Five. Four.
-You can't do this, can you?

1688
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:55,024
-Three. Two. One.
-Three. Two. One.

1689
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,827
-He's done!
-Sung-jun is done!

1690
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,896
SUNG-JUN FINISHES
PLAN TO LOSE AGAIN BY BASI?

1691
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,632
-That was crazy.
-It looks nice.

1692
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,166
That looks nice.

1693
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,036
He'll get sent to a hospital
if he finishes that today.

1694
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,871
I'm good with sweet foods.

1695
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,474
-You must be shocked.
-You did a great job.

1696
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,143
-I can't believe it.
-It looks like a Christmas tree.

1697
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,444
AGAIN, SOMETHING FROM NOTHING!

1698
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,013
-Great work.
-They look great.

1699
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,014
Good one.

1700
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,916
-My gosh.
-Yes.

1701
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:20,950
That's amazing.

1702
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:25,621
All dishes were finished just for Woo-jae.

1703
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,623
I'm dying to know what they taste like,

1704
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,759
especially those churros,

1705
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:33,062
as well as this one,
because I have no idea what it's like.

1706
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,797
Know Your Woo-jae.

1707
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:37,466
CHINESE SUJEBI MADE FROM SCRATCH

1708
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:41,637
CHURROS MADE
WITH PEANUT BISCUITS

1709
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:46,242
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
KNOW YOUR WOO-JAE

1710
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,312
-Take a picture.
-Right, I have to.

1711
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,147
DIDN'T FORGET THE PICTURE
THIS TIME

1712
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,917
Chinese <i>sujebi</i>, dough-drop soup,

1713
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:58,788
is usually made with tomato
and many kinds of vegetables.

1714
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,557
But I just tried to recreate the taste.

1715
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:07,096
It's like porridge that smells like onion.

1716
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,664
She stir-fried onion.

1717
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,067
It's Chinese home-cooked <i>sujebi.</i>

1718
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,404
MMM

1719
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:17,807
What's it like?

1720
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,477
It's like delicious porridge,

1721
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,512
but the texture is so different.

1722
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,981
So it doesn't feel like porridge.

1723
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:28,484
<i>-The dough is really unique.</i>
<i>-Isn't it?</i>

1724
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,252
It's hard to see the beads,

1725
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,255
but when you eat it,
you can feel every single one.

1726
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,024
-You've tried it.
-It was a surprise.

1727
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,561
SAVORING THE SOUP AGAIN

1728
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,630
It'll almost feel like well-done risotto.

1729
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,865
It must have a unique texture.

1730
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,200
Where did you get beef?

1731
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,634
Beef?

1732
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,736
It was in the <i>ramyeon.</i>

1733
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,971
<i>-The vegetable flakes.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

1734
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,473
<i>-I didn't know I had it.</i>
<i>-Soy meat?</i>

1735
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,174
He even had meat.

1736
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,043
-He had meat.
-He had the ingredients.

1737
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,011
He had meat?

1738
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,312
I had brought everything.

1739
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,813
Yes, you had it all.

1740
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,116
He always tastes the tiniest flavor,

1741
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,017
just like bacon bits.

1742
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,885
-Yes, he tastes it.
-He tasted beef.

1743
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,188
The beef tastes like
the kind of beef you find in soup.

1744
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,390
LAUGHING

1745
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,159
-Like brisket?
-Yes, like beef cooked in soup.

1746
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:13,796
I guess light eaters
can feel and taste everything.

1747
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,265
Although I asked her not to use my fridge,

1748
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,835
this bowl can definitely take care
of my hearty dinner.

1749
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:21,871
-It feels hearty.
-I see.

1750
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,839
It's quite delicious.

1751
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,175
-And churros.
-Churros.

1752
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,378
I didn't add any flour.
It's just peanut cream biscuits.

1753
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,481
Those look just like regular churros.

1754
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,883
He took a bite of that tiny thing.

1755
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,988
So? Is it too sweet?

1756
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,890
-It's nutty.
-Nutty?

1757
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:47,363
The texture is just like the churro
you can get at an amusement park.

1758
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,931
It's crispy on the outside,

1759
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:52,668
but the snack on the inside is soft.

1760
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,305
So honestly speaking,
if there were regular churros and these,

1761
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,041
-I would take these.
-Was it that good?

1762
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,443
I expected these

1763
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:03,579
to taste just like
the peanut cream biscuits,

1764
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:07,183
but there were other flavors
that made the churros richer.

1765
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,086
<i>It must be because they were deep-fried.</i>

1766
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,588
Something delicious was fried,
so it must be even better.

1767
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:13,923
-It was good.
-Was it?

1768
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,157
See?

1769
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,258
You could do it.

1770
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,561
-That was random.
-Give it a try.

1771
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,963
See? She made a meal and a dessert.

1772
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,932
-He's brazen.
-"You could do it."

1773
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,501
-Great work.
-Excellent job.

1774
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,304
Next, Chef Sung-jun's dish.

1775
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,605
Look at that.

1776
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,508
HOLIDAY MOOD
WITH 15-MIN CROQUEMBOUCHE

1777
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:38,047
A CHRISTMAS TREE
MADE WITH SNACKS AND BASI

1778
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:43,252
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S
PLAN TO LOSE AGAIN BY BASI?

1779
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,421
It feels like the Christmas season.

1780
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,823
Visually speaking,
Chef Sung-jun's dish makes a statement.

1781
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,758
-It's overwhelming.
-It is.

1782
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,894
These seem like the tree lights.

1783
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,630
-You're right.
-Everyone here

1784
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,166
is allowed to be grateful for me.

1785
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,302
It feels like the holiday season,
thanks to me,

1786
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,770
as the days get colder in November.

1787
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,772
-Sure.
-Sure.

1788
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,341
In a way,

1789
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,010
it looks like a pile of gray hair.

1790
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,045
Don't ruin my appetite.

1791
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:13,315
-He imagines the weirdest things.
-He has an odd appetite.

1792
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:17,086
-Let me try.
-Try the <i>basi</i> as much as you want.

1793
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,022
Then dip the snack
in the sweet potato cream.

1794
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,357
That's pure sugar.

1795
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:22,791
JUST THE BASI

1796
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,193
It's like he's eating hair.

1797
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,962
It looks like he's eating hair.

1798
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,366
-He's like a vampire.
-He loves sugar.

1799
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,067
It's so good.

1800
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,036
FEELS DEJECTED

1801
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,173
Just pour sugar over everything you make.

1802
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,141
It's so delicious.

1803
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,342
This is what moves you.

1804
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,144
My gosh. This is spectacular.

1805
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,314
That's just sugar.

1806
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,883
-He's only eating sugar.
-Stop that and eat what's inside.

1807
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,351
The inside? Okay.

1808
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,287
-The cream is the key.
-He can just eat the sugar.

1809
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,289
-He's only eating the sauce.
-Wait.

1810
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,990
It's coming apart.

1811
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,459
Gummy candies are stickier than they look.

1812
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,994
-Of course.
-It's strong.

1813
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:02,998
I'll eat the puffs
with cream made with sweet potato chips.

1814
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,433
That's a big bite.

1815
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,435
A BIG BITE

1816
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,038
-He knows how to eat food deliciously.
-He eats it like that?

1817
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,141
He eats the snack
as if he's eating a lump of meat.

1818
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,676
I thought he was Choo Sung-hoon.

1819
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,010
He eating well.

1820
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,246
I've never seen anyone
eat snacks so deliciously.

1821
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:21,116
PAUSE

1822
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,785
What's it like?

1823
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,221
What is it? He had to look at it.

1824
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,056
What is it?

1825
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:30,693
-Is it not that good?
-That cream was made with chips.

1826
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,962
He keeps trying
the sweet potato chip cream.

1827
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,897
Gosh, it's the <i>basi.</i>

1828
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:35,965
It's so amazing.

1829
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,500
A HALF-HEARTED COMPLIMENT

1830
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,170
I get what you mean by that.

1831
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,272
-What's the snack like?
-It's not that.

1832
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,976
-Does it get stuck in your teeth?
-Does it?

1833
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,410
It's not that it's bad.

1834
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:52,114
<i>He melted gummy candies</i>
<i>and used it as glue, right?</i>

1835
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:54,316
It's gluing my teeth together.

1836
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:55,851
GLUING SNACKS AND TEETH

1837
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,186
That's why.

1838
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,722
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

1839
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,490
That's it.

1840
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:02,891
"That's it"?

1841
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,093
Wasn't it a mistake?

1842
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,929
Dessert is best when it's so sweet
and it feels like you'll get cavities.

1843
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,731
But these are too sticky.

1844
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,799
It'll last three more days in there.

1845
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,268
Just the puffs and cream.

1846
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,337
He'll need to see a dentist.

1847
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,905
-Mmm.
-Yes?

1848
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,742
This sweet potato mousse? It's this cream.

1849
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:23,946
The mix of that and the puffs
make it taste very delicious.

1850
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:28,250
-I think this should be a product.
-As glue?

1851
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,551
-At a stationery store.
-Really?

1852
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,754
Yes, or on TV shopping.

1853
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,322
TV shopping?

1854
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,091
I don't want to sound like I'm joking,
so would you like to try one?

1855
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,226
This would be

1856
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,194
stronger than glue sticks.

1857
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,730
-I see.
-We'll all have to see a dentist, then.

1858
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,333
-Are the greens the glue?
-The gummies.

1859
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,168
-It's not glue.
-The puffs are the main thing.

1860
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,436
They're gummies.

1861
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,705
Isn't that too much?

1862
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,608
A FULL BITE

1863
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,376
Soon, it'll sound sticky.

1864
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,445
TREMBLING

1865
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,981
He doesn't look too happy.

1866
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,050
Your cheeks are trembling.

1867
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,385
-He's blinking fast too.
-Right?

1868
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:04,720
Your teeth are one, aren't they?

1869
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:06,188
Don't they come together?

1870
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,757
This side is stuck.

1871
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,292
-Glued.
-It must be good.

1872
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,493
-It is good.
-It is.

1873
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,861
It's really sweet, though.

1874
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:16,765
It's like the candies you can find
at Christmas markets in Europe.

1875
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,836
You can enjoy it for days
when it gets stuck in your teeth.

1876
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,438
My upper teeth are all stuck.

1877
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,541
-Was it…
-You're acting!

1878
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,077
-I'm not.
-I'm not joking around.

1879
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,511
You can't eat this.

1880
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,412
SMACK!

1881
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,049
My amalgams are going to fall out.

1882
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,052
Yes, I'm telling you.

1883
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,287
It's that bad?

1884
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,423
Does anybody have an old tooth?

1885
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,958
To see it fall out?

1886
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,793
Sam, isn't it about time
you got rid of your canine?

1887
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,096
NOT YET…

1888
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,498
I thought it'd only taste like the puffs,

1889
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,968
<i>but with the sweet potato cream,</i>
<i>it died down quite a lot.</i>

1890
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,837
It's really good
when you pick out a good part.

1891
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,572
You just have to avoid the greens.

1892
01:12:56,638 --> 01:13:00,175
When the gummies were boiled,
it lost all its moisture,

1893
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:03,112
and it was only left
with the adhesive nature of the candy.

1894
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:04,513
It's really strong too.

1895
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,014
I'll give you a solution.

1896
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,717
You can have it
with hot coffee or hot water.

1897
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:11,687
-That'd be the case.
-It will melt right away. No problem.

1898
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,622
You should've served hot tea.

1899
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,190
He can eat your soup.

1900
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,327
Yes, you should've served tea.

1901
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,397
They bicker once again.

1902
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,499
That's Chef Eun-yeong's Know Your Woo-jae.

1903
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:25,734
Is it good?

1904
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,102
-It's so good.
-Is it?

1905
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,605
-Is it good?
-I want to keep eating just this.

1906
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,273
It tastes like <i>tteokguk</i>, rice cake soup.

1907
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,609
-It feels like that.
-Yes, it does.

1908
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,612
People who have bad teeth
and can't eat rice cake can enjoy this.

1909
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:38,180
It melts in your mouth.

1910
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,214
It melts?

1911
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,417
The biggest strength for that dish

1912
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,152
is that it's easy to eat.

1913
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,853
You can easily just chow it down.

1914
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,090
It's like porridge, but even those
who dislike porridge would love it.

1915
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,224
There's some texture.

1916
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,560
-It has some texture.
-Yes, it comes with texture.

1917
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,295
I also love the sesame oil.

1918
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,764
<i>-I added some sesame oil.</i>
<i>-A bit.</i>

1919
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,366
When it comes to the dough-drop soup,

1920
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,803
<i>you pour the dough into the soup</i>
<i>without kneading it tightly.</i>

1921
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,839
<i>So when you put it into seasoned soup,</i>

1922
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,276
<i>it creates an interesting mix</i>
<i>of smooth and chewy textures.</i>

1923
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:11,113
She made an accurate depiction of that,
and it was good.

1924
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,783
-Dough-drop soup versus <i>basi?</i>
-Yes.

1925
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,318
It's time to decide.

1926
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,054
Which one will rise as the winner?

1927
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,722
<i>Press one for Park Eun-yeong,</i>

1928
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,925
<i>and press two for Kwon Sung-jun.</i>

1929
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:26,161
Please make your decision
and push the button.

1930
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,264
An unprecedented order,
"Chef, Not My Fridge."

1931
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,999
See? You could do it when you tried.

1932
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,835
-They could do it.
-Try, and you'll do it.

1933
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,336
-Did you press one?
-I did.

1934
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,338
Who did he choose?

1935
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,173
Let's find out the result.

1936
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,542
Chef, Not My Fridge.

1937
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,110
Will it be Sung-jun or Eun-yeong?

1938
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,346
They're both at seven wins right now.

1939
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,682
The winner takes the eighth victory first.

1940
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,252
Woo-jae's order was "Chef, Not My Fridge."

1941
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,221
Who won?

1942
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,891
Eun-yeong versus Sung-jun.
Sung-jun versus Eun-yeong.

1943
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,193
Show us the result!

1944
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,362
PARK EUN-YEONG WINS

1945
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,798
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
KNOW YOUR WOO-JAE WINS

1946
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:05,634
-Eun-yeong takes the eighth win.
-I thought <i>basi</i> would win.

1947
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:06,835
Good work.

1948
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,805
She finally won against <i>basi.</i>

1949
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,441
I thought he'd like the dessert better.

1950
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,478
Sung-jun would've won
if this were a school supply battle.

1951
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,314
But it was a food battle,
so it's just unfortunate.

1952
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:22,784
-So I had no other choice.
-It was like a daily supply?

1953
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,554
Chef Eun-yeong is the winner.

1954
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,122
Congratulations!

1955
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,825
Chef Eun-yeong takes the lead
and beats Chef Sung-jun.

1956
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,760
This is her eighth star!

1957
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,563
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1958
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,266
Great work, Eun-yeong!

1959
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:38,967
That's our thumbnail.

1960
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,502
IN SHOCK AND TERROR

1961
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,939
FRIDGE OWNERS
PUT THE CHEFS IN DISMAY

1962
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,641
Please welcome Tzuyang and Haetnim!

1963
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:49,011
<i>She cultivated 12.6 million subscribers</i>
<i>just by doing </i>mukbang<i> shows.</i>

1964
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,946
I have four fridges.

1965
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,315
Everything is filled.

1966
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,584
-I drink five liters a meal.
-Five liters a meal?

1967
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,319
We're pretty much at the meat market.

1968
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,454
It won't take me a week
if I set my mind on it.

1969
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:00,689
Good for you.

1970
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:01,723
You don't get sick of it.

1971
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,891
I have a poor appetite,

1972
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,561
so I get sick of <i>ramyeon</i>
by the time I eat seven bags.

1973
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:06,795
Seven bags?

1974
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,097
<i>The two biggest </i>mukbang<i> creators in Korea.</i>

1975
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,899
<i>They're big in the fine dining industry,</i>

1976
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:12,301
<i>so they'll make it taste good.</i>

1977
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,036
You didn't give her enough quantity.

1978
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,204
-She's almost done.
-What?

1979
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,306
-It's gone.
-She's done.

1980
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,007
-Do you have another bowl?
-Another bowl?

1981
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,375
THEY CAN'T BACK DOWN LIKE THIS!

1982
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:21,910
-Is this for a cafeteria?
-What's that?

1983
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:25,080
-How many servings is this?
-One. One serving for Tzuyang.

1984
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,083
CHOMPING ON EVERYTHING

1985
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,084
In one bite.

1986
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:31,086
CHEFS VS TZUYANG

1987
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,421
-It's an emergency.
-Look at her.

1988
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:33,655
CAN THEY TRULY FILL HER UP?

1989
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:34,790
She finished everything.

1990
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,491
<i>She eats so well.</i>

1991
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,929
-It goes so well with soda.
-Of course.

1992
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,764
So this is how she likes to eat.

1993
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:45,233
How does she chug soda like that?

1994
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,436
-That was carbonated!
-I can't believe it.

1995
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:50,105
-She finished everything.
-No.
