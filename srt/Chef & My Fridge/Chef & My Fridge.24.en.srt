1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,250
You're here with idol stars celebrating
their tenth anniversaries,

2
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,419
WOOZI and HOSHI of SEVENTEEN
and Mimi of OH MY GIRL.

3
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:23,556
Mimi became
the most popular variety show personality.

4
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,560
-Show producers have their eyes on you.
-Their eyes on me?

5
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,962
You're the new star on the rise.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,097
I'm very grateful for that.

7
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,466
I'm doing my best
not to let this get to my head.

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,201
-I see.
-Get to her head?

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,504
I always ask my agency
to schedule whatever comes my way.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,806
I can work anytime.
My head is still as clear as day.

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,241
Your head is still clear?

12
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,276
People can be like this
when they get conceited.

13
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,846
-That's something older people would say.
-Right?

14
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,948
The program that helped you become

15
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,851
the rising star is <i>Earth Arcade</i>,
produced by Nah Yung-suk.

16
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,889
There's a game on the show
where she shines the brightest.

17
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,558
-Right.
-It's called Random Play Dance.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,695
<i>You have to automatically do the dance</i>
<i>for whatever random song is played.</i>

19
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,532
<i>So you have to know lots of music</i>

20
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,068
<i>-as well as the choreography.</i>
<i>-You have to know it already?</i>

21
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:12,372
We can say she's the dance jukebox
of all K-pop choreographies.

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,007
-She doesn't think so.
-Not at all.

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,010
Another thing that made you
the hottest star

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,379
in the variety show industry is

25
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,082
<i>your personal YouTube channel.</i>

26
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,752
<i>She runs a channel titled MimPD.</i>

27
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,053
<i>You're right.</i>

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,623
<i>Your creativity on the channel was</i>
<i>what got you a spot on the show.</i>

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,960
Are you in charge
of both shooting and editing?

30
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,362
Yes, in the beginning, I shot, edited,

31
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,766
and did everything by myself,
including the theme of the channel.

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,302
I now have a production crew,

33
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,771
-so we've been working as a team.
-Really?

34
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,905
What do you usually do?

35
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,174
I love to eat, so it's mostly eating.

36
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,509
I'd eat overseas,

37
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,044
do an ASMR <i>mukbang</i> video,

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,545
and what I eat in a day.

39
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,715
It's pretty much about food.

40
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,318
Let us show you how much she can eat.

41
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,886
-Yes.
-We have a video.

42
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,321
What's that?

43
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,290
IS SHE POURING ALL KINDS
OF CHOCOLATE SNACKS INTO A BOWL?

44
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,493
I really love to eat snacks.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,362
You're going to eat that now?

46
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:10,897
Can you hear the it?

47
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,565
ASMR

48
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,800
Whoa.

49
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,869
-She's eating it like that?
-I love it.

50
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,171
-Does she like sweet food?
-They're all cakes.

51
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,539
-Yes, I have a sweet tooth.
-You must like sweet things.

52
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,874
SHE DRENCHES CAKE WITH MILK

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,975
This is insane.

54
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,343
<i>You're only eating desserts.</i>

55
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,479
<i>-You must like desserts.</i>
<i>-I love them.</i>

56
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,181
Why did you mix cake with milk?

57
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,383
It's good when you mix it with milk.

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,618
-With milk?
-Yes.

59
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,420
The layers absorb all of the milk,

60
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,922
so it becomes so soft.

61
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,024
-Yes, it's really good.
-It's really good.

62
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,793
And now, let's find out
what's in the fridge

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,428
<i>of this dessert lover</i>

64
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,532
and the <i>mukbang</i> creator, Mimi.

65
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,867
-You live alone, right?
-Yes, I do.

66
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,903
So I use that fridge alone.

67
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,572
I'm sorry to say something like this,

68
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,141
-but I'm half excited and half worried.
-Right.

69
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,509
What if she only has desserts?

70
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,144
We might only see desserts.

71
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,181
-Don't be worried. Just enjoy it.
-Okay. Let's take a look at her fridge.

72
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,316
We present Mimi's fridge.

73
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,985
WHAT KIND OF INGREDIENTS DOES SHE HAVE?

74
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,120
Mimi's fridge.

75
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,755
PRESENTING MIMI'S FRIDGE

76
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,923
It's not so bad, right?

77
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,823
It's not.

78
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,559
-And some meat.
-She has some stuff.

79
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,260
-It's a bit empty.
-She has some things.

80
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,728
There's more room on the right side.

81
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,531
-Where's the divider here?
-It's gone.

82
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,201
There should be a divider
and a door there.

83
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,836
Yes, it's usually like this,
so that you can open it like this.

84
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,405
Yes, but it's open.

85
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,608
-It's gone.
-Yes, there should be something here.

86
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,577
One day, I left some kombucha

87
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,413
at room temperature for a while,
and then put it back inside.

88
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,281
But it exploded
as soon as it went into the fridge.

89
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,716
OH MY

90
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,719
-Kombucha is fermented, so…
-That happens with kelp tea?

91
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,354
Yes, it's fermented.

92
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,122
I didn't know, either, so I left it warm.

93
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,124
But it's all in the product warning.

94
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,461
It wasn't the kombucha.
It was just my fault.

95
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,029
This is kombucha, right?

96
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,865
-Yes, that's the one.
-So this completely exploded?

97
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,735
-The glass bottle?
-It flew off, and the bottle shattered.

98
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,836
It must've exploded.

99
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,238
-I'm glad you weren't hurt.
-That's scary.

100
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,806
So you lost the door.

101
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,309
But it's much easier to get things
just by pressing one button.

102
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,245
-Just having to open this.
-Right.

103
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,981
-It's easier?
-It is. It's not so bad.

104
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,317
Is it because of the explosion?

105
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,518
There are no sauces.

106
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,753
-I don't keep sauces.
-Do you eat food as is?

107
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,154
I rarely season my food.

108
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,923
I eat everything when I eat out,

109
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,459
but at home,
I try to use just salt and pepper.

110
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,893
Simple seasoning.

111
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,128
Let's take a look.

112
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,663
In the very front…

113
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,232
-That's probably salad.
-I see.

114
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,635
-Did you make it yourself?
-Yes, I did.

115
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,638
It's a Mediterranean-style salad.
A Greek salad.

116
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,906
It's great for your health.

117
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,243
I used olive oil, lemon juice, and honey,
and finished it off

118
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,646
with salt and ground pepper.
I can whip it up quickly.

119
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,182
I didn't think I'd see this
after what I saw you eat in the video.

120
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,218
-I make sure I eat healthy.
-Is this true?

121
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,654
I'm in my thirties now,

122
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,821
so I must look after myself.

123
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,723
So I've been eating these on purpose.

124
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,991
-Not just desserts.
-No.

125
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,426
She has veggies here.

126
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,128
There are lots of vegetables back here.

127
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,931
And some fruits. Mango, banana, and apple.

128
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,166
What's this? Wait.

129
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,669
Did she put this here for show?

130
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,537
No, I really eat that.

131
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,540
Your fridge looks completely different
from what we expected before.

132
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,908
That's purée.

133
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,645
It's a mix of beets, fruit,
carrots, and celery stalks.

134
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,780
I blended everything.

135
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,182
-It's like sorbet.
-It's a healthy juice.

136
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,785
-Did you make it yourself?
-Yes, just blend everything.

137
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,688
I love blueberries, so I put in lots.

138
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,923
-I drink that.
-I see.

139
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,992
When you get thirsty while eating bread,

140
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,226
I swallow it down with that.

141
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,128
It helps me feel refreshed
so I can start again.

142
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,930
-I see.
-So I can eat the bread again.

143
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,099
May we try and evaluate this?

144
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,868
-Sure, go ahead and try it.
-I want to try it too.

145
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,371
Why do you seem worried?

146
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,141
-It's a new batch.
-It looks new. Mimi made this.

147
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,676
I have a feeling it'll be sweet.

148
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,080
It helps her feel refreshed
when she eats bread.

149
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,748
It's not as sweet as I expected.

150
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,882
No, right? It's like sorbet.

151
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,552
-It's so refreshing.
-It's good.

152
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,454
-It's perfect.
-She gave me her approval.

153
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,822
-I can use it to cook.
-Any thoughts, Chef Tae-hun?

154
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,323
Me? It's not my style.

155
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,993
You're not my type.

156
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,161
EXCHANGING DISSES

157
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,263
-Sung-jun, do you like it?
-They're feisty.

158
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,466
It's totally my style. I love it.

159
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,401
You're my type too.

160
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,369
EXCHANGING COMPLIMENTS

161
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,037
That's what you need to do to win a star.

162
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,939
-It's good as is.
-It's good.

163
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,041
-Yes, it's good.
-It's really good.

164
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,311
It's really good.
I think it can be a tad bit sweeter.

165
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,047
-It's good.
-Exactly.

166
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,649
Here's the thing. It's good.

167
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,084
But when it goes down…

168
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,553
-It's too late.
-You're too late.

169
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,257
-I found some meat too.
-Yes.

170
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,426
-Beef?
-I found beef.

171
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,762
-Drumsticks and pork belly.
-Yes.

172
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,097
-I found duck too.
-Yes, I have duck.

173
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,665
I throw it into milk.

174
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,767
Milk?

175
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,102
I wash it in milk.

176
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,205
-To get rid of the fat smell.
-To get rid of the smell.

177
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,776
I wash it in milk
and just season it with salt and pepper,

178
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,879
then dip it in chogochujang when I eat it.

179
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,147
I see.

180
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,582
-There they are.
-And it has begun.

181
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,419
The first shelf had a bit of food,

182
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,220
but this one is like a convenience store.

183
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,523
I have two different sides.

184
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,991
-Whoa.
-What?

185
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,460
-Sung-jun!
-What?

186
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,729
Sung-jun, did you do something like this?

187
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,697
-That's really good.
-Since when?

188
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,466
-That's really good.
-Where did you get it?

189
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,035
There's a really great convenience store
near my house.

190
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,739
They order new products very quickly,
so I got it from there.

191
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,407
I see. Can you share the information?

192
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,809
I can't.

193
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,544
Why not?

194
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,313
-I thought you'd share.
-I can't let more people know.

195
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,148
-There are these places?
-There are.

196
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,184
-I didn't know.
-What a great convenience store.

197
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,218
Yakgwa.

198
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,220
-I love that.
-I see.

199
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,388
You love everything that's sweet.

200
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,723
-She has lots of these.
-It's a popular convenience store snack.

201
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,092
-It's probably bread.
-Salt bread.

202
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,528
It's cream-filled bread

203
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,298
from a bakery that I really love.

204
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,033
How many days do these last?

205
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,568
I can eat everything at once.

206
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,336
-Gosh, all these?
-Yes.

207
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,438
How much rice do you eat in every meal?

208
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,506
I don't eat rice.

209
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,408
-You don't?
-I don't eat rice.

210
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,909
-You don't?
-No.

211
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,312
It's because I eat too much bread.

212
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,380
I wouldn't be a decent human
if I also had rice.

213
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,449
CONTROLLING THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL
LIKE A DECENT HUMAN

214
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,420
The only grains I have are
Emmer wheat and chickpeas.

215
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,955
-Chickpeas.
-We found chickpeas.

216
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,025
I eat them with Mediterranean salads.

217
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,861
I don't eat any other grains.

218
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,395
-So you don't eat rice.
-I don't.

219
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,464
Do you often fill your stomach
with snacks?

220
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,067
I start with the chocolate cake snack,

221
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,768
next, the chocolate-covered pie snack,

222
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,506
and then I have
some cheese-flavored potato chips.

223
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,208
After that, that chocolate pie snack
with strawberry filling,

224
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,910
the instant noodles-shaped snack,

225
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,945
throw in some ice cream in the middle,

226
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,081
-and then I reset with the purée.
-It's a course meal.

227
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,383
I would've been really mad
if you were my daughter.

228
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,751
HEHE

229
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,086
What about your health?

230
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,489
-I did the blood… Is it the blood test?
-Yes, the blood sugar test.

231
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,757
The blood sugar test. I'm fine.

232
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,559
Don't you crave rice?

233
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,727
I don't.

234
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,029
Stop lying. I see these side dishes here.

235
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,732
How can you not eat rice
with these side dishes?

236
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,334
-Those are…
-Come on.

237
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,103
-It's kimchi.
-Come on.

238
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,938
That's pickled bitter lettuce.

239
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,640
-Green onion kimchi.
-Yes, green onion kimchi.

240
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,741
I like bitter lettuce.

241
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,942
Yet you don't eat rice?

242
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,144
-What do you eat it with?
-I can eat it with bread.

243
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,713
-With bread?
-With bread?

244
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,383
-I eat it with bread and salad.
-This will be a tough day.

245
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,417
What kind of bread?

246
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,019
The cream-filled bread. That one.

247
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,587
-This and green onion kimchi?
-It's good.

248
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,656
-My gosh. Are you serious?
-Yes.

249
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,625
-Try it.
-Sure, I'll try it.

250
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,794
-You better finish it.
-I really do that.

251
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,463
-It's a cream-filled bread.
-I'll get mad if you don't eat it.

252
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,499
-I don't think they'll go well.
-It's good.

253
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,302
She's about to eat green onion kimchi
and cream-filled bread.

254
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,704
She's eating it deliciously.

255
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,639
-The green onion kimchi.
-Really?

256
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,041
Yes, it's good.

257
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,342
-It looks good.
-Goodness.

258
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,712
The elders in rural areas
actually eat it like this.

259
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,280
What kind of older person
eats bread like this?

260
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,915
-They did this in the old days.
-Try it just once.

261
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,217
-It's good.
-They used to eat bread like that.

262
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,353
-It's really good.
-Jung-hwan.

263
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,088
Try it just once.

264
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,291
-I really don't get this.
-It should be good.

265
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,060
You try it, Poong.

266
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,162
-I like eating it like that.
-Don't be so weird.

267
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,165
-It's really good.
-Eat it with green onion kimchi.

268
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,601
-You have to chew them together.
-They just ate it.

269
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,337
If it's not good, let's get mad at her.

270
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,572
It may taste weird at first.

271
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,141
-Chew it with the cream.
-Yes.

272
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,876
It's not so bad, right?

273
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,211
Is it all right?

274
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:13,879
Why do you do this?

275
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,017
See? Why do you eat it like this?

276
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,120
HE TRIED IT,
BUT IT WAS JUST AS HE EXPECTED…

277
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,855
It's good.

278
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,824
-I seriously…
-You should eat rice.

279
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,726
That's what kids would love.

280
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,295
-Yes, only kids. The kimchi ambassador.
-But it's good.

281
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,998
The kimchi ambassador will
evaluate this mix.

282
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,265
Try it.

283
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,601
Keep the bread in your mouth
and try the green onion kimchi.

284
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,170
-You have to chew everything together.
-This is just…

285
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,141
The kimchi ambassador.

286
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,778
Should she eat green onion kimchi
with cream-filled bread?

287
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,215
-I like it.
-Right?

288
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,918
-They hit it off.
-They had the same taste.

289
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,487
Hey!

290
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,390
-I told you that it was good.
-It's good!

291
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,626
But for now, the kimchi ambassador

292
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,595
-approved of this.
-He approved.

293
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,030
It's really good.

294
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,433
I've been keeping this to myself
until this day.

295
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,236
I thought people would lash out at me
if I said something like this.

296
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,805
-I was just like that.
-Right?

297
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,141
-But I can say it confidently now.
-Yes.

298
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,443
Kimchi goes well with bread and cake!

299
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,945
-Yes, really.
-Yes, it's good.

300
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,981
They're set on it.

301
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,517
-I found abalones.
-Yes, I have abalones.

302
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,953
-Do you like abalones?
-Yes, I do.

303
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,556
It's my favorite seafood.

304
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,024
When I'm low on energy,

305
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,427
I just roast it in butter,
salt, and pepper.

306
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,029
-And scallops. How do you eat these?
-Scallops.

307
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,364
I eat it with pork and kimchi.

308
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,467
-I eat it with pork belly and kimchi.
-The mix.

309
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,668
And now,

310
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,771
you're about to see
all kinds of ice cream.

311
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,808
My gosh. There are many different kinds.

312
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,844
-I've never seen this before.
-This is ice cream, and so is this.

313
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,246
-In a day, usually, how many…
-Do you chomp down?

314
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,981
-Chomp down?
-There are some popsicles too.

315
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,317
I've had 10 to 15 at most.

316
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,420
The biggest problem is
that I never get sick of it.

317
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,989
What's your recent favorite?

318
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,425
-I like that ice cream sandwich.
-The sandwich.

319
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,527
-This is really good.
-I see.

320
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,864
She had a bit of concern left.
She eats low-sugar ice cream.

321
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,966
That brand is famous for low-sugar.

322
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,569
-But does it matter?
-She has some.

323
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,472
That was all for Mimi's fridge.

324
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,774
I wonder what her orders will be.

325
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:25,611
Let's find out her orders. Show us!

326
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,512
Tudum.

327
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,850
Mimi's first order. I heard a bit of ASMR.

328
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,320
<i>I heard a bit of ASMR</i>

329
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,855
TINGLING

330
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,656
I run a YouTube channel,

331
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,292
so I want to eat something
that's perfect for an ASMR video.

332
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,230
I want you to make me something

333
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,198
that's crunchy and slurpy.

334
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,233
And it can't be too hot.

335
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,268
If it's too hot,
I'd get burnt while eating it.

336
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,603
-Burnt?
-I mean…

337
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,139
-She'll burn her mouth.
-Yes, my mouth.

338
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,374
-Yes, she'll burn her mouth.
-Not herself.

339
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,743
-She'll burn her mouth.
-I get it.

340
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,913
-You'll burn your mouth.
-Yes, right.

341
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,249
Please focus on the ASMR aspect.

342
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,617
What's the second order?

343
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,787
-Dessert, my blood sugar spiked up.
-I knew it.

344
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,524
<i>Dessert, my blood sugar spiked up</i>

345
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,692
Is this related to the blood sugar level?

346
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,196
Yes, I plan to give up
on maintaining my blood sugar level today.

347
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,633
Well, I never really cared for it anyway.

348
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,402
I want to taste
the sweetest thing in history

349
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,839
-that also has great balance.
-I see. With great balance.

350
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,107
Good grief.

351
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,011
-If she were my daughter…
-I keep thinking of your parents.

352
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,448
Now, the chefs who must cook
with Mimi's ingredients.

353
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,552
Kim Poong, Jung Ho-young,
Jung Ji-sun, and Lim Tae-hun.

354
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,254
Tae-hun wants to fight Ji-sun.

355
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,624
THE STUDIO GETS HOT
WITH THE CHINESE CUISINE BATTLE

356
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:50,496
I opened my first restaurant ten years ago
in a basement level.

357
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,399
-That's when <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> first aired.
-I see.

358
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,837
And I always had the dream
of fighting one of the chefs on the show.

359
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,440
I had to both cook in the kitchen
and deliver,

360
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,509
so I made the food and had it delivered

361
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,077
in just 15 minutes.

362
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,712
REALLY?

363
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,215
-Let's see how he does.
-Let's watch him.

364
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,551
-He'll go, "The delivery already left."
-Let's find out.

365
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,754
Will he fall into trouble
or will he deliver the food on time?

366
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,425
Which one? The ASMR video
or the blood sugar level?

367
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,628
I'll go with I heard a bit of ASMR.

368
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,330
He did the tune.

369
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,531
Is that okay? The ASMR video?

370
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,267
I'll make sure she hears it a lot,
not just a bit.

371
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,769
-He said he didn't like my purée.
-Wait.

372
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,974
It was good, but…
I have to clarify this first.

373
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,077
-I'll prove it with my dish, then.
-I'll forget it.

374
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,813
There's a strict hierarchy in the kitchen,

375
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,748
so I must keep a frisky kid under control.

376
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,485
He was too frisky!

377
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,355
-So you'll teach him a lesson?
-Yes, I'll do that.

378
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,923
-I see.
-Okay.

379
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,793
Then automatically, Poong
and Ho-young take the next round.

380
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,864
-This will be fun.
-Yes.

381
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,302
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with Mimi's ingredients.</i>

382
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,971
The Queen of Chinese Cuisine,
Chef Jung Ji-sun,

383
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,807
is up against Lim Tae-hun,
aka Self-Made Chef.

384
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,643
THE NEW CHINESE CUISINE ROUND
LIM TAE-HUN VS JUNG JI-SUN

385
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,912
-This is the first round this week.
-This is so cool.

386
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:17,416
It's titled "I heard a bit of ASMR."

387
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,920
-Mimi has an ASMR microphone before her.
-That's right.

388
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,955
SHE STARTS THE ASMR RIGHT AWAY

389
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,657
Please make an ASMR video

390
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,926
-when you eat their dishes later
-Okay.

391
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,361
-and enjoy it as much as you want.
-All right.

392
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,865
This is Chef Tae-hun's debut
here on <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

393
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,167
He said he could cook
and deliver in just 15 minutes.

394
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,970
-I told you that because it was true.
-It was true?

395
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,338
That's what he did.

396
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,707
You wanted to fight Jung Ji-sun today.

397
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,410
He said it out in the open.

398
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,713
-He already won against Chef Lu Chinglai.
-Yes.

399
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,016
So he wants to destroy
Chef Ji-sun on <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

400
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,117
The Chinese chef sniper.

401
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,653
But Chef Ji-sun isn't an easy fight.

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,256
She easily took down
a junior Chinese chef,

403
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,525
<i>Chef Eun-yeong, quite brutally.</i>

404
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,528
-Brutally? She was brutally destroyed.
-She taught her a lesson.

405
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,763
Eun-yeong tried picking a fight with her,

406
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,532
but after that last loss,

407
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,034
she wouldn't budge from Hong Kong
when Ji-sun came.

408
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,336
<i>You're right.</i>

409
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,404
Ji-sun thought her challengers were gone,

410
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,807
but Tae-hun showed up
and began to get frisky.

411
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,443
-What a troublesome life.
-This is a huge mess.

412
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,045
Tae-hun said something like this
when he was interviewed

413
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,648
-by one of our writers.
-What did he say?

414
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,652
"I can't lose against Chef Ji-sun
when it comes to taste."

415
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,688
Are you serious?

416
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,124
"I'm a self-made man
who started from the bottom!"

417
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,159
Yes.

418
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,894
Did you say this or not?

419
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:40,032
I'm someone who cooks
whatever the mass public likes.

420
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,600
But Ji-sun is someone

421
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,136
who makes actual Chinese food
like dim sum.

422
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,506
So I thought I had a chance
when it came to what the laypeople liked.

423
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,408
He's saying she only makes dim sum.

424
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,344
He cooks what the public likes,

425
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,015
-But Ji-sun only cooks for certain people.
-I see.

426
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,616
No way. That's not it.

427
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,952
Ji-sun seems offended.

428
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,721
He'll never leave his restaurant
after today.

429
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,324
Just as Eun-yeong is in Hong Kong,
he'll stay in his restaurant.

430
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,192
I'll shut you up inside!

431
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,828
-I'll leave you in there.
-Back inside.

432
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,997
I'll prove what I can do during the round.

433
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,565
-The battle is fierce.
-Yes.

434
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,234
Chef Tae-hun,

435
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,770
-we'll offer you a perk today.
-He gets a perk.

436
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,838
You can choose to use it or not.

437
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,673
If you do, which one?

438
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,308
I don't think he'll use it.

439
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,377
I'll fight her fair and square.

440
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,713
That's so cool.

441
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,481
Is he serious?

442
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,316
You probably should.

443
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,484
You'll only look cool if you win.

444
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,653
What if he ends up crying in the middle?

445
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,022
CHEF JI-SUN'S INGREDIENTS:
RAW MOZZARELLA, CHEDDAR,

446
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,657
OYSTER MUSHROOM, STRIP LOIN,
SHIITAKE, CELERY, ENOKI, CARROT

447
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,493
Let's hear about Chef Ji-sun's dish.

448
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,429
First of all, it's called

449
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,330
Fry for Mimi.

450
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,999
-Fry for Mimi?
-Fry for Mimi?

451
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,935
It sounds like her restaurant,
"Tian Mimi."

452
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,071
-Fry for Mimi?
-Is this a promotion?

453
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,872
-She has an ulterior motive.
-The thing is,

454
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,574
Chinese cuisine is all about crunchiness.

455
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,210
So I thought of that and Mimi,
so Fry for Mimi.

456
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,611
That Mimi.

457
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,447
Something fried for Mimi.

458
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,981
I get it.

459
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,250
And the honor of her restaurant
is at stake too.

460
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,652
If you lose, Tian Mimi loses.

461
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,754
Is that how it'll be?

462
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,689
If you lose, change the name to Lost Mimi.

463
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,927
It's not so great for me, either.
Lost Mimi?

464
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,562
What are you going to fry?

465
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,464
I'll deep-fry some rice

466
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,867
with eggs and starch
to make scorched rice.

467
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,102
-I see.
-You'll deep-fry rice?

468
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,570
-Like scorched rice.
-Deep-fried scorched rice?

469
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,373
And right underneath,
I'll serve all kinds of vegetables.

470
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,543
Then I'll top it with some cheese
and burn it like crème brûlée.

471
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,680
-You can break it as you eat it.
-What?

472
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,848
A DISH THAT YOU CRUSH

473
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,783
Just hearing about it makes me intrigued.

474
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,318
When you deep-fry rice,

475
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,653
not only does it become crunchy,
but it's also chewy.

476
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,224
So I wanted to prepare
two different textures for you.

477
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,860
CHEF TAE-HUN'S INGREDIENTS: DRIED SHRIMP,
OYSTER MUSHROOM, SOYBEAN SOUP, ZUCCHINI

478
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,628
DRIED ANCHOVY, INSTANT NOODLE SNACK,
CHICK PEA, CARROT, SCALLOP, AND MORE

479
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,564
Tae-hun, what's your dish called?

480
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,400
Okay. Who Ordered White Jjamppong?

481
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,369
Who Ordered White Jjamppong?

482
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,505
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
WHO ORDERED WHITE JJAMPPONG?

483
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,140
-White jjamppong?
-That's what he says when he delivers.

484
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,609
Did he start delivering before doorbells?

485
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,011
Did he go, "Who ordered Chinese food?"

486
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,981
You'll make white jjamppong
for an ASMR video?

487
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,017
I want to bring out
the chewy texture of the noodles.

488
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,553
-You'll make it chewy?
-If it's chewy, it'll be amazing.

489
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,689
I heard Mimi isn't good with spicy food.

490
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,492
-No, I can't take spicy food.
-I'll leave out red pepper powder

491
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,227
and make white jjamppong.

492
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,097
I'll use black soybean soup

493
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,365
and make hand-pulled noodles.

494
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,033
-Hand-pulled?
-You'll pull them?

495
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,203
-And I have one more secret dish.
-A secret dish.

496
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,005
I'll make <i>basi</i> with chickpeas.

497
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,840
-Whoa.
-<i>Basi</i>?

498
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,742
Is this an attack on Chef Ji-sun?

499
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,410
That's right.

500
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,978
This is feisty.

501
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,547
Can you do that in 15 minutes?

502
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,115
He might call out for UNICHEF.

503
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,783
He might give up on making <i>basi</i>.

504
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,653
-"I can't make <i>basi</i>!"
-"I give up on <i>basi</i>!"

505
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,324
And now, let us begin the ASMR round.

506
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,094
A man who can
cook and deliver in 15 minutes,

507
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,231
the prince of Dongpo pork,
Chef Lim Tae-hun.

508
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,166
She'll teach a lesson
to the frisky Tae-hun

509
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,402
and re-established order
in the Chinese cuisine industry.

510
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:07,072
The Queen of Dim Sum,
Chef Jung Ji-sun is up against him.

511
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,076
Who'll be the new star of Chinese cuisine?

512
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,679
And now…

513
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,480
The ASMR…

514
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,452
The ASMR round begins.

515
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,588
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

516
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,594
This is Tae-hun's debut.

517
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,630
-Good luck.
-He refused to use a perk.

518
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,931
-Yes.
-He did.

519
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,901
I see. He's using that to make broth.

520
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,302
-Dried shrimps.
-Dried shrimps.

521
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,670
Dried shrimps and anchovies.

522
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,973
Abalone. He's using abalones.

523
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,041
They went into the broth too.

524
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,509
It must be for the broth.

525
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,311
SLAM

526
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,480
THE SLAMMING METHOD

527
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,649
TAE-HUN DESTROYS MUSHROOMS

528
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,217
He destroyed them!

529
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,286
He's getting a head start!

530
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,221
Ji-sun, are you watching this?

531
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,889
Do your best.

532
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,959
-That way, it'll give off more flavor.
-Yes, it'll give out more juice.

533
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,761
That was so cool.

534
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,197
SHE REMAINS CALM DESPITE HIS PROVOCATION

535
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,932
WARMING UP INSTANT RICE

536
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,134
Hmm.

537
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,803
Chef Ji-sun begins by beating an egg.

538
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,039
And there's the rice.

539
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,742
Are you making scorched rice?

540
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,943
Yes, it's scorched rice.

541
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,178
She's making circular shapes.

542
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,481
She's making balls like arancini.

543
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,050
She begins to deep-fry them.

544
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,419
The oil isn't too heated yet.

545
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,489
On the other hand, he's making two dishes
without using the perk.

546
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,524
-He's making jjamppong and <i>basi</i>.
-Yes.

547
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,626
We'd be amazed if he made just one.

548
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,462
Things are different when you cook here
compared to your own kitchen.

549
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,930
Completely different.

550
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,033
What's Chef Tae-hun doing?

551
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,038
He's making the noodles.

552
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,839
-I see.
-He's using black soybean soup.

553
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,408
-Chef Tae-hun!
-Yes?

554
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,942
You must talk when you're on this show.

555
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,477
Right. I'm sorry!

556
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,547
-It's tough to hear you.
-He's so strict.

557
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,349
HE'S QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS DEBUT

558
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,420
So I'm using black soybean soup
because it'll make the noodles

559
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,889
-taste much lighter.
-Lighter?

560
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,991
And she said she didn't like spicy food.

561
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,993
-Right.
-I'm going to add Cheongyang pepper.

562
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,094
-I see.
-I see.

563
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,629
-Add what?
-Cheongyang pepper.

564
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,531
-You'll throw that in?
-Yes.

565
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,099
But she doesn't like spicy food.

566
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,435
"You hate it, right?
So I'll add Cheongyang pepper."

567
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,503
What is he talking about?

568
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,638
What's this nonsense?

569
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,139
You deceived us all.

570
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,909
He's saying he'll make it taste
just refreshing, not spicy.

571
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,711
Good luck, man.

572
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,081
For now, he's done with the dough.

573
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,183
-He'll let it rest too?
-He will.

574
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,985
Chef Ji-sun is much quieter
compared to him.

575
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,521
OYSTER MUSHROOM

576
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,357
CHOPPING

577
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,126
This can be another ASMR video.
It sounds so nice.

578
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,895
-Yes.
-Yes, it's like an ASMR video.

579
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,831
THIS TIME, SHE CHOPS A CARROT…

580
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,499
CHOPPING

581
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,869
Tae-hun begins to chop too.

582
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,372
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

583
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,272
SCOFFS

584
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,908
Ji-sun begins to chop too.

585
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,411
The two Chinese kitchen knives.

586
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,646
THE CHINESE KITCHEN KNIVES FIGHT

587
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,848
"If you do it, I'll do it too."

588
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,950
They're both doing ASMR videos.

589
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,718
Chinese chefs use

590
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,854
-such scary knives.
-They do.

591
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,655
They're both working on carrots.

592
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,459
It's as if two horses are
running on either side.

593
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,662
It's as if two horses are
running on either side.

594
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,899
GIDDY-UP

595
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,869
THEY BOTH FINISHED WITH THE CARROTS
AT THE SAME TIME

596
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,404
It's been three minutes.

597
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,907
It took them three minutes
to prepare the ingredients.

598
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,710
They prepare all ingredients first
when making Chinese food.

599
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,179
Look at the even thickness
Tae-hun is making.

600
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,116
THE BLACK HORSE GALLOPS
ON THE CUTTING BOARD

601
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,786
He's julienning the vegetables.

602
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,320
That's so amazing.

603
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,855
Look at Tae-hun chopping.

604
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,057
This is so much fun.

605
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,759
He's using Cheongyang pepper.

606
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,262
You'll cut them into such thin pieces?

607
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,266
She doesn't like spicy food,
so he adds spicy Cheongyang pepper.

608
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,335
SLAM

609
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,337
GARLIC CLOVES

610
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,238
GET DESTROYED

611
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,441
THE SPECTATORS ARE

612
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,642
AMAZED

613
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,578
DESTROY THEM

614
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,681
"Chef Ji-sun, do you know what it's like
to run a basement restaurant?"

615
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,750
"Have you ever worked underground?"

616
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,785
"Have you delivered the food
in just 15 minutes?"

617
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,821
CHOPPING WITH PENT-UP ANGER

618
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,258
His techniques are so flashy.

619
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,361
THIS TIME, GREEN ONION

620
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,930
He's really fast.

621
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,165
Chef Tae-hun works very quickly.

622
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,067
Does he? Tae-hun?

623
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,237
Chef Ji-sun chops some peppers

624
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,206
-with a huge knife.
-She doesn't like spicy food, so a bit.

625
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,707
Thin slices.

626
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,309
CELERY

627
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,979
ENOKI, SHIITAKE

628
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,982
She's preparing the ingredients first.

629
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,051
It's kind of touching to see

630
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,155
that they're turning my ingredients
into these awesome dishes.

631
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,892
-Like the ingredients are coming alive.
-Yes.

632
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,861
They spent over five minutes
just preparing.

633
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,965
Are you deep-frying chickpeas?

634
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,933
-He'll make <i>basi</i>.
-He said he'd make <i>basi</i>.

635
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,569
-To add crunchiness?
-He's making them crunchy.

636
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,304
The noodles.

637
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,740
He even let the noodles rest
in this short while.

638
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,276
-He's spreading the dough.
-He's going to spread it.

639
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,611
He's spreading the dough.

640
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,879
That's amazing.

641
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,647
It does look a bit darker.

642
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,284
-Will it work?
-It'll be nuttier and lighter.

643
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,352
THE HEAT IS OFF

644
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,686
Why is this turned off?

645
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,388
Why is the heat off?

646
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,590
DID YOU DO THIS?

647
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,727
He looked at Chef Ji-sun
as he asked why the heat was off.

648
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,229
It wasn't me!

649
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,664
Did you turn the heat off?

650
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,367
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

651
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,736
She's holding him in check!

652
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,738
FIGHT, FIGHT

653
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,872
Yes!

654
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,108
-You should've managed.
-This is crazy.

655
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,777
The world of Chinese cuisine is
crashing down.

656
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,379
He got suspicious right away.

657
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,015
RAW MOZZARELLA

658
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,284
She's using cheddar.

659
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,852
I love cheddar too.

660
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,587
She's using cheddar.

661
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,322
He begins to cut the noodles.

662
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,224
TAE-HUN BEGINS TO CUT THE NOODLES

663
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,960
-He's making the noodles.
-They're thicker than I expected.

664
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,028
Are they?

665
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,663
-It's intentional.
-It is?

666
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,097
You have eight minutes left.

667
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,833
The noodles are usually thicker
for white jjamppong.

668
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,570
THE WATER ISN'T BOILING YET

669
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,071
Gosh, that was awful.

670
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,573
No, the water has to boil!

671
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,840
The water should be boiling.

672
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,208
The pot Ji-sun turned off won't boil.

673
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,811
-The water isn't boiling yet?
-No, it's not boiling.

674
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,479
Oh, no.

675
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,881
Which one? I'll light it up for you.

676
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,083
Should we conduct a video challenge?

677
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,819
Did Chef Ji-sun turn the heat down,
thinking the pot was important?

678
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,990
TAE-HUN MOVED THE BOILING WATER
AS SOON AS HE STARTED

679
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,894
THEN HE FORGOT TO TURN THE HEAT ON

680
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,297
Would you like to use the perk now?

681
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,133
-He can't hear you.
-He can't hear you.

682
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,335
I won't.

683
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,836
He's using pork belly.

684
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,938
You have seven minutes left.

685
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,809
He won't be able to deliver to Mimi
in 15 minutes.

686
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,877
Please just keep an eye on me for now.

687
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,546
BUT THE OWNER OF TIAN MIMI LOOKS RELAXED

688
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,115
She looks so relaxed.

689
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,884
Chef Ji-sun isn't making a big serving.

690
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,586
She's making just a little.

691
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,656
She's only cooking for Mimi.

692
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,058
Gosh, Fry for Mimi.

693
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,827
<i>Fry for Mi</i>

694
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,161
She grabbed some meat.

695
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,597
-Which cut is that?
-It's strip loin.

696
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,767
4. STIR-FRY CHOPPED STRIP LOIN AND VEGGIES

697
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,137
AND THEN ADD SUGAR

698
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,241
-There they are.
-The fried rice.

699
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,677
We thought it'd be flat.

700
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,846
It's my first time eating scorched rice
on my ASMR video.

701
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,049
-Scorched rice sounds amazing.
-It does.

702
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,586
He's now straining the broth.

703
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,488
-The abalone.
-The abalone.

704
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,556
He has to make <i>basi</i> on top of this.

705
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,991
The noodles will take a while to cook.

706
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,660
He would've been fine if the heat was on.

707
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:42,761
The noodles are thick, so…

708
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,964
-Will he give up on making <i>basi</i>?
-Will you give up?

709
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,766
-No.
-You won't?

710
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,502
-Will he give up on making <i>basi</i>?
-Gosh.

711
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,437
Did he remove the teeth from the abalones?

712
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,538
Did he remove them?

713
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,707
I can eat the teeth. It's fine.

714
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,144
-I can eat the teeth.
-For the ASMR video.

715
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,781
BUT THE WATER IS STILL NOT BOILING

716
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,783
-The water isn't boiling.
-The water isn't boiling?

717
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,252
-But he has to throw them in.
-The noodles go in.

718
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,887
-The noodles.
-The noodles go in.

719
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,788
Five minutes!

720
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,690
-Tell us how it's going!
-Okay.

721
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,425
-Yes.
-Oh, no!

722
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,260
-Oh, no.
-The troubled Chinese culinary world.

723
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,494
Let's go!

724
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,096
Will the world of Chinese cuisine
regain its order?

725
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,864
-All right.
-Is he adding water?

726
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,767
Water? Why did you put water in there?

727
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,402
Whoa, what is this?

728
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,137
He's making <i>basi</i>.

729
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,839
-He won't have enough time to make it.
-<i>Basi</i>.

730
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,274
What about the jjamppong?

731
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,376
He's… The water!

732
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,712
-No idea.
-He's… The water!

733
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,248
-The heat went off.
-You killed the heat!

734
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,484
-Hurry up!
-Put the heat back on!

735
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,886
The stove went off.

736
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,521
-This is bad!
-The stove went off.

737
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,757
-The sugar is burning!
-The heat!

738
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,459
-Sung-ju.
-Yes?

739
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,094
He looks pale!

740
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,263
You're right.

741
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,533
Yes, you look pale.

742
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,568
He looks pale!

743
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,603
-His dark complexion is gone.
-No.

744
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,605
He looks so pale!

745
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,574
His soy sauce complexion
turned into white jjamppong!

746
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,409
You're right.

747
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,145
His soy sauce complexion
turned into white jjamppong!

748
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,280
The peas are burning!

749
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,949
The peas are burning!

750
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,317
-It's not.
-It's not burning?

751
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,351
-Are the peas not burning?
-No.

752
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,220
-The peas are burning!
-They aren't?

753
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,155
Come on!

754
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,625
Why are things so hectic?

755
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,827
You have three minutes and a half.

756
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,529
-The heat control.
-The peas.

757
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,565
Chef Ji-sun remains calm.

758
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,338
5. SPRINKLE SUGAR OVER GRILLED CHEESE
AND MELT IT WITH A TORCH

759
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,840
What's that?

760
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,843
CUTTING OFF THE TOP
OF THE SCORCHED RICE BALL

761
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:44,015
She cut it, hollowed it out,
and deep-fried it again.

762
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,751
That's how she's making the scorched rice.

763
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:47,986
What's this for?

764
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,387
It's the filling. Try it.

765
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,123
-The filling? Let me try it.
-Try it.

766
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,591
WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE?

767
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,462
Will she re-establish order
in the world of Chinese cuisine today?

768
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,931
Will she re-establish order
in the world of Chinese cuisine today?

769
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,933
I think she will.

770
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,701
Oh, no!

771
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,837
LET'S BRING BACK THE HIERARCHY

772
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:06,738
This is bad.

773
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,540
It's perfect. My gosh.

774
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:12,410
It reminds me a bit of jjajangmyeon.
It's amazing.

775
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,179
AND THE DONGPO PORK PRINCE…

776
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,747
What's that? Instant noodle soup base?

777
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,550
-It's the instant noodle snack.
-He's using the noodle snack?

778
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,918
It's for <i>basi</i>.

779
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,786
-It's for <i>basi</i>.
-It's for <i>basi</i>.

780
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,687
That's not a bad idea.

781
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,856
DEEP-FRIED CHICKPEAS

782
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,825
Over here.

783
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,793
He threw in the chickpeas.

784
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,428
He made the <i>basi</i>.

785
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,163
I think he'll run out of time.

786
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,901
When will you make the jjamppong?
You have three minutes left.

787
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,271
Tae-hun is busy.
You have 2 minutes and 40 seconds left.

788
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,240
-Wait, is that tteokbokki?
-What?

789
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,343
-I've seen that before.
-The loaches.

790
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,879
-Aren't they loaches?
-They're the loaches!

791
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,080
My loaches!

792
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,682
Let me take a look at the noodles.

793
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,184
My loaches are over there!

794
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,653
What's that? My loach!

795
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,889
-The loaches.
-My loaches are over there!

796
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,329
Does it make delicious noises
worthy of an ASMR video?

797
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,464
-What are the noodles like?
-Is it cooked?

798
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,700
-It must be cooked.
-Is it cooked?

799
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,701
Is it chewy?

800
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,169
It's too chewy.

801
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,906
It's too stringy!

802
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,174
Shouldn't you cook it some more?

803
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,943
-You like soggy noodles, right?
-Yes, I do.

804
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,778
-I don't have to.
-Is it okay?

805
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,048
You have a minute and 45 seconds.

806
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,250
You have two minutes.

807
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:32,090
7. ADD COOKING WINE, GREEN ONION, GARLIC,
PORK BELLY, VEGETABLES, AND STIR-FRY

808
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:32,991
Fire!

809
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,897
THE PRINCE OF FIRE

810
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,433
Is that okay?

811
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,736
FROLICKING

812
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:45,637
Is that okay?

813
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,805
Are you on fire? Is that okay?

814
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,309
Are you all right?
Did you catch on fire? Tae-hun!

815
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,412
Tae-hun isn't even surprised.

816
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,914
-You're doing well.
-A minute and 30 seconds.

817
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,115
Good work!

818
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,917
A minute and 30 seconds.

819
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,785
A minute and 30 seconds to make jjamppong!

820
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,420
You can make jjamppong in a minute?

821
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,756
ADDING ABALONE

822
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,225
-A minute and 30 seconds.
-You can make it in a minute?

823
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,260
The white jjamppong

824
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,096
I told you to use the perk!

825
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,532
ON THE OTHER HAND,
HIS NEIGHBOR IS FINISHING UP

826
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,935
ADDING THE SMOKY FLAVOR

827
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:22,340
SHE BEGINS TO SERVE THE DISH

828
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:27,979
7. SPREAD THE STIR-FRY ON THE PLATE
AND TOP IT WITH THE SCORCHED RICE BALL

829
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,148
-Ji-sun?
-I'm almost done.

830
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,382
-You're almost done?
-I'm done.

831
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,651
Ji-sun is too quiet compared to him.

832
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,153
-I'm done.
-She's almost done.

833
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,854
It might be better to hit the bell later.

834
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,256
Right?

835
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,158
The white jjamppong.

836
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:43,494
-What about the soup?
-He's getting the broth.

837
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,430
-A minute.
-One minute!

838
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,166
-Just pour it in!
-He's using a strainer.

839
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,968
-You have to season it!
-Fifty seconds!

840
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,703
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 1 MINUTE

841
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,905
Someone call the firefighters!

842
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,306
Ground pepper!

843
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,841
-Ground pepper!
-You have to finish up.

844
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,710
-Fifty seconds!
-Ground pepper!

845
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,777
Over here.

846
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,247
Give it to him! The ground pepper!
You have 45 seconds!

847
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,716
-Jeez.
-You have 45 seconds!

848
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:05,683
Serve it.

849
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,052
Don't forget the noodles! The noodles!

850
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,289
You have 40 seconds left!

851
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,924
The noodles. Get the noodles!

852
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,693
-The noodles? Are those the noodles?
-The noodles.

853
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,830
-You need the noodles.
-The loaches. Those are loaches.

854
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,467
-The loaches.
-You have to taste it to see if it's good.

855
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,204
You have to taste it to see if it's good.

856
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,107
-Let me try it.
-Is it seasoned?

857
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,676
-I think it'll be bland.
-How is it?

858
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,444
-It's too salty!
-It's salty!

859
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,581
-More broth! Yes.
-Yes, that's it. Good one.

860
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,384
FRY FOR MIMI IS ALMOST DONE

861
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,287
TOPPING IT WITH SUGAR AGAIN AND MELTING IT

862
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,556
You have 16 seconds, and 15!

863
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,993
-Fifteen seconds. Ji-sun is relaxed.
-Fourteen.

864
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,295
-Ji-sun remains elegant.
-Ten. Nine.

865
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,698
-Eight. Seven. Six.
-Eight. Seven. Six.

866
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,834
-Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.
-Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

867
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,370
-Hurry up and serve it.
-Five. Four.

868
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,106
-Three. Two. One.
-Ji-sun won't ring the bell.

869
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:06,210
-Hurry up and serve it. Three. Two. One.
-Ji-sun won't ring the bell.

870
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,912
-It's over!
-He's done.

871
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,783
HE BARELY MANAGED
TO GET THE DELIVERY GOING

872
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,317
-That was so exciting.
-Tae-hun just finished.

873
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,553
He made jjamppong
in a minute and 30 seconds?

874
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,988
THE FINAL SPURT WAS EXHILARATING

875
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,057
Tae-hun did it.

876
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,925
That was amazing.

877
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,660
Right. I left out Cheongyang pepper.

878
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,896
Wait, he left out Cheongyang pepper.

879
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,564
No, I'll serve it as is.

880
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,500
-She doesn't like spicy food.
-Don't put it in.

881
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,103
Why did you want to do that
although she doesn't like spicy food?

882
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,671
I need to add a refreshing note

883
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,706
-to make the dish more savory.
-That's true.

884
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,942
So I wanted to add
a bit of Cheongyang pepper.

885
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,678
Do you think
Cheongyang pepper is refreshing?

886
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,914
-Do you?
-That sounds spicy.

887
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,715
Both dishes

888
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:48,419
for Mimi's ASMR videos are finished.

889
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,489
-Thank you for your hard work.
-That was great.

890
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,658
I thought he would fail

891
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,326
with a minute and 30 seconds left.

892
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,228
But he did it in that time.

893
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,363
Tae-hun, what are your thoughts
after your debut?

894
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,233
Now that I tried cooking
in just 15 minutes,

895
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,669
I finally realized it was way too short.

896
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,407
-That's the twist.
-Time flows differently on this show.

897
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,109
Look at how sweaty he is.

898
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,044
He said he could deliver
within 15 minutes,

899
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,880
but he didn't have
any time to deliver the food today.

900
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,249
Chef Ji-sun finished first,

901
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,185
so she'll try Fry for Mimi first.

902
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,121
SCORCHED RICE BALLS AND CRUNCHY CHEESE,
PERFECT FOR AN ASMR VIDEO

903
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,792
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S FRY FOR MIMI

904
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,595
HOSHI, WOOZI, and other chefs.

905
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,863
Please put the earphones on.

906
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,698
-The ASMR.
-The ASMR aspect is important.

907
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,032
That's the most important.

908
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,236
Please listen to it with me
and be the judge.

909
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,571
She'll be the judge of the taste.

910
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,607
-We've never done this before.
-I'll start craving it.

911
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,942
-I can hear everything so well.
-Whoa.

912
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,812
CLANG

913
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,250
Let me begin the ASMR video.

914
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,752
THE TINGLING RING IN THEIR EARS

915
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,487
TAP!

916
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,722
This is important.

917
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,191
You need that tapping noise.

918
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,295
It's really crunchy.

919
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,663
Is that so?

920
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,931
Let me try it.

921
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,301
CRUNCH

922
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,038
THE CRUNCHINESS TINGLES THE EARS

923
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,873
WIDE-EYED

924
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,807
That was amazing.

925
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,042
This is so good.

926
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,778
It wasn't just crunchy.

927
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,847
MUNCH

928
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:25,917
MUNCH

929
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,385
Crunch, crunch.

930
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,819
Wow, that sound.

931
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,088
-It's nice to listen to.
-How do I eat this?

932
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,557
Break it and eat everything together.

933
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,392
Let me break this.

934
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,493
Okay.

935
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,228
WHACK!

936
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,263
OH, NO

937
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,533
She can probably use that
to drive a nail into something.

938
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,969
-It sounded like shattering glass.
-It's really hard.

939
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,807
THE SCORCHED RICE BREAKS WITH A CRUNCH

940
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,842
It sounds so crunchy.

941
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,381
CRISP

942
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,451
THE SOUND OF THE CRUNCH IS INSANE

943
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,588
COMPLIMENTING WITH HER EYES

944
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,957
THANK YOU, HEHE

945
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,694
-My mouth is watering.
-Yes, it makes your mouth water.

946
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,030
She's putting the stir-fry on the cheese.

947
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,665
CRUNCH

948
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,301
-Nice.
-That sounded even better.

949
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,836
That was insane.

950
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,339
This is too painful.

951
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,707
-I wonder what it's like.
-I have to tell you.

952
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,742
Yes, please tell us now.

953
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,978
-What was it like?
-How was it?

954
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,947
What was the cheese made with? Eggs?

955
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,382
I grilled the cheese,

956
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,951
-sprinkled sugar, and torched it.
-A torch.

957
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,686
She grilled the cheese.

958
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,256
-I see.
-Like actual crème brûlée.

959
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,325
Yes, crème brûlée.
It smells like crème brûlée.

960
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,861
I also love things that are crunchy,

961
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:48,499
and it was like the crunchy part
of French toast.

962
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,468
-It's like a mix of the crunchiest parts.
-Well-toasted parts.

963
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,637
-Yes, a well-toasted bread.
-Yes.

964
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,506
And the balance
with the stir-fry was amazing too.

965
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,942
It feels like I'm eating dessert
and a meal at the same time.

966
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,844
-You love desserts.
-It's so good.

967
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,546
What was the filling like?

968
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,950
As you said,
it smelled just like jjajangmyeon.

969
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,386
It wasn't too much,

970
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,322
and it was perfect for my appetite.

971
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,857
You didn't have any sauce,

972
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,825
so I just stir-fried doenjang in oil

973
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,495
and seasoned it
only with sugar and soy sauce.

974
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,964
But it tastes like black bean sauce.

975
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:23,267
-It smells like black bean sauce.
-It does.

976
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,635
It looks good.

977
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,737
It's perfect for an ASMR video

978
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,806
because the vegetables are still crisp.

979
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,641
-I see.
-So she got

980
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,010
both the crunchiness and the crispness.

981
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,378
She meant to do that.

982
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,680
It was perfect.

983
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,049
It was good.

984
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,651
And next, Chef Tae-hun's dish,

985
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,253
Who Ordered White Jjamppong?

986
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,691
CRUNCHY CHICK PEA BASI
AND WHITE JJAMPPONG FULL OF SEAFOOD

987
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:51,762
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
WHO ORDERED WHITE JJAMPPONG?

988
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,864
-Here.
-Thank you.

989
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,169
-He made this in a minute and a half.
-Yes, toward the end.

990
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,770
If this turns out well,

991
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,007
people will begin to order
jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

992
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,875
People will crave it in this hour.

993
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,143
Let me try it.

994
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,445
I'll try the scallop first.

995
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,247
BLOWING

996
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:11,982
BLOWING SOME MORE

997
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,522
IT'S SO HOT

998
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,158
-It's hot!
-It's hot!

999
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,960
OH, NO

1000
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,061
-It's an ASMR video.
-It's hot.

1001
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,697
-Was it hot?
-She says it's hot in an ASMR video.

1002
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,767
-If it's hot, she'll get burnt.
-She'll get burnt.

1003
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,268
If it's hot, she'll get burnt.

1004
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,503
That's right.

1005
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,472
Yes, it'll burn my mouth.

1006
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,573
Be careful.

1007
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,776
-I'll be more careful.
-Try the noodles.

1008
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,277
-She tries the noodles.
-Whoa.

1009
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,179
BREAKS?

1010
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,482
-Wait.
-Wait. What?

1011
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,951
It does look like a loach, doesn't it?

1012
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,285
IT'S TIME TO TRY THE WHITE LOACH

1013
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,820
It's nice to see you.

1014
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,356
The key to noodles <i>mukbang</i> is

1015
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:56,093
not letting the noodles break off.

1016
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,195
You can focus on the texture.

1017
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,031
-It's for an ASMR video.
-I'll go with the texture.

1018
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,370
SLURP

1019
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,407
REPLAYING THE SLURPING SOUND

1020
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,809
CHEWY

1021
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,978
IT SOUNDS SO CHEWY TO THE EARS

1022
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,680
-It sounds so chewy.
-Listen to that.

1023
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,615
It sounds chewy.

1024
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,016
I want to make ramyeon now.

1025
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,252
-What about the abalone?
-The abalone.

1026
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,586
She tries the abalone.

1027
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,622
That sounds so good.

1028
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,190
SHE EATS THE CHEWY ABALONE IN A BITE

1029
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,559
We're all listening so intently.

1030
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,429
This is why there are many ASMR fans.

1031
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,098
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

1032
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,733
It's good.

1033
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,569
SLURP

1034
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,239
-That was like a TV ad.
-It's the soup.

1035
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,908
THE SLURPING OF THE SOUP HITS THE EARS

1036
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,244
My gosh. It was all about the soup.

1037
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,315
-The soup is amazing.
-Wasn't it too hot or spicy?

1038
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,750
It's not too hot.

1039
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,552
It wasn't spicy, either. It's perfect.

1040
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,421
I think not adding Cheongyang pepper was
probably the right choice.

1041
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,823
-Rather?
-Yes.

1042
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,191
It might've been spicy, then.

1043
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,293
I'm glad it wasn't so refreshing.

1044
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,396
I rarely drink the soup
whenever I order jjamppong,

1045
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,131
but this soup is fantastic.

1046
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,467
It's so good. I can eat this forever.

1047
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,569
-I want to mix rice in this.
-Great job.

1048
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,838
-But you don't like rice.
-I don't.

1049
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,607
-The <i>basi</i>.
-Please try the <i>basi</i>.

1050
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,877
He made this <i>basi </i>for the ASMR effect.

1051
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:21,946
CRUNCH

1052
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,115
THAT CRUNCH WAS INSANE

1053
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,885
THE HIGHLY STIMULATING AND TINGLING SOUND

1054
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,187
It hits my ears differently.

1055
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,523
I'm so glad he made this.

1056
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,024
That had the best ASMR effect.

1057
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,731
I need to open a bag of raw <i>ramyeon</i> today.

1058
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,266
This is too painful.

1059
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,136
APPLAUDING AS A COMPLIMENT

1060
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,539
It's so good.

1061
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,309
I want to keep
a bag of chickpeas next to me

1062
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,878
and keep munching on it like popcorn.

1063
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,646
The chickpeas are really good.

1064
00:41:55,713 --> 00:42:00,150
Let's try
Chef Ji-sun's Fry for Mimi first.

1065
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,120
-Listen to the sound.
-Mmm.

1066
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,290
It's so good.

1067
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,492
Isn't it?

1068
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,462
-It's so crunchy.
-Yes.

1069
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,931
It tastes like black bean sauce.

1070
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,000
There's sweetness in jjajangmyeon, right?

1071
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,202
The sweetness of the cheese
blends into the stir-fry

1072
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,870
while the texture is crunchy.

1073
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,040
It feels like I'm eating
black bean sauce-flavored snack.

1074
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,042
But everything goes very well together.

1075
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,444
There's this Chinese dish

1076
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,714
-with meat inside the bun.
-Yes, <i>cha siu bao.</i>

1077
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,384
-The one with XO sauce?
-Yes.

1078
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,486
It feels like
a Koreanized version of that bun.

1079
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,856
I think it's because she scorched the rice

1080
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,791
and the sweet flavor.

1081
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,428
That was a delicious and new kind of dish.

1082
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:48,632
Next, Chef Tae-hun's dish,
Who Ordered White Jjamppong?

1083
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,167
Who Ordered White Jjamppong?

1084
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,469
It's Chef Tae-hun's dish.

1085
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,772
-The delivery came a bit too late.
-Yes.

1086
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,873
Next time you order,

1087
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,508
-I'll give you free fried dumplings.
-Thanks.

1088
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,645
TRYING THE SOUP FIRST

1089
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,314
-My gosh.
-I see some scallops.

1090
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,884
-That was killer. The soup killed it.
-My gosh.

1091
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,554
It tastes like seafood extract.

1092
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,056
-Yes.
-I could taste

1093
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,726
the flavor of all kinds of seafood

1094
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,163
-all at once in this soup.
-Yes.

1095
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,365
I realized the confidence he showed was

1096
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,435
something that came from his diligence.

1097
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,036
Thank you.

1098
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,038
He'll see the light out of the basement.

1099
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,609
-He'll go upstairs now.
-Start writing some lyrics too.

1100
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,712
That was an excellent line.

1101
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,246
How was it, WOOZI?

1102
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,083
If he added Cheongyang pepper,

1103
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,552
-it would've been my best today.
-I see.

1104
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,686
-Me too.
-Also,

1105
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,123
the noodles were really fun
because it was almost like sujebi,

1106
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,293
-but it was chewy like knife-cut noodles.
-Knife-cut noodles.

1107
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,928
It was captivating.

1108
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,097
-Like kal-jebi, kal-guksu and sujebi.
-Yes.

1109
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,065
I see.

1110
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,102
If I had a Chinese restaurant like this
in my neighborhood,

1111
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,137
I would've bookmarked it already.

1112
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,038
Yes.

1113
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,940
I'd want to order it every day
if you were nearby.

1114
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,675
-He won't be able to lose weight.
-No.

1115
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:05,743
That's over anyway.

1116
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,645
ALREADY GAVE THAT UP IN THIS LIFE

1117
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,715
Chef Ji-sun, you tried some too, right?

1118
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,351
He did a great job.

1119
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,621
Can you elaborate?

1120
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,523
She feels threatened.

1121
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,558
I didn't want to make him more conceited.

1122
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,661
-I won't be conceited.
-Just in case.

1123
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,196
-Good one.
-Thanks, Ji-sun.

1124
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,464
She approved of his dish.

1125
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,833
You must make your choice now.

1126
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,770
-You enjoyed eating them, didn't you?
-It's time.

1127
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,904
Exactly.

1128
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:34,938
Between the two,

1129
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,908
press one for Tae-hun

1130
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,643
and press two for Ji-sun.

1131
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,611
-This is hard.
-It's hard.

1132
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,213
Please press the button.

1133
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,182
GOOGLY-EYED

1134
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,652
-I pressed it.
-I think she pressed both.

1135
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,287
-She pressed it.
-So the results are random.

1136
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,157
Let's find out which one Mimi chose.

1137
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,591
-Show us.
-Don't do this to me!

1138
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,161
I heard a bit of ASMR.

1139
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,063
Aren't you nervous?

1140
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,265
-This is no joke.
-Of course, he is.

1141
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,334
This round was
between two renowned Chinese chefs.

1142
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,438
But who did Mimi choose?

1143
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,772
This was Tae-hun's debut round!

1144
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,909
Show us the result!

1145
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,644
Who's the winner?

1146
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,413
JUNG JI-SUN WINS

1147
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,383
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S FRY FOR MIMI WINS

1148
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,351
She hasn't lost yet.

1149
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,920
It was Ji-sun.

1150
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,955
CONGRATULATIONS

1151
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,758
She won all three times.

1152
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,493
The jjamppong was excellent,

1153
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,996
and I loved Fry for Mimi too.

1154
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:37,201
But the crunchiness has
a better advantage for ASMR videos.

1155
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,636
Instead of slurping?

1156
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,073
It's easier to make crunchy sounds
compared to slurping.

1157
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,577
I chose Chef Ji-sun in that aspect.

1158
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,346
-He lost but fought well.
-I see.

1159
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,916
Chef Tae-hun,
any thoughts after your debut today?

1160
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,319
It feels like a dream
to be in this studio.

1161
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,588
I made my dream from ten years ago

1162
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:01,425
come true by standing right here now.

1163
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,893
So if you'll have me back…

1164
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,596
-We'll see you again in ten years.
-All right.

1165
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,931
-In ten years?
-You're awful.

1166
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,368
You and I will be gone by 2035.

1167
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,404
-We'd be gone by then.
-Yes, right.

1168
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,775
Please put a star on Chef Ji-sun.

1169
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,644
If she lost, she would've had to change
her restaurant name to Lost Mimi.

1170
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,480
-Congratulations, Ji-sun!
-Congratulations!

1171
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,815
Three consecutive wins.

1172
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:31,588
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Mimi's fridge.</i>

1173
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,826
-She came to the show for this round.
-You're right.

1174
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:38,896
Dessert, my blood sugar spiked up.

1175
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,633
Chef Jung Ho-young is
up against Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

1176
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,001
Do you both eat lots of dessert?

1177
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,470
It wouldn't be an understatement to say

1178
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:50,007
my bones, flesh, and blood were
all formed thanks to dessert.

1179
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,477
I always make sure
I keep ice cream and potato chips around.

1180
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,280
-Right?
-It's the mix of sweetness and saltiness.

1181
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,849
-He knows what's up.
-Yes.

1182
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,117
I'm looking forward to this.

1183
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,952
There's something I'm worried about.

1184
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,954
You have to be careful of Poong.

1185
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,190
-He has no work ethic.
-He doesn't.

1186
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,091
-I'm not a chef.
-I'm fine with that.

1187
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,661
-I just need it to taste good.
-All right.

1188
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,763
Then your veins will get clogged.

1189
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,431
What's your plan today, Poong?

1190
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,500
I know the feeling of clogged veins

1191
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,002
better than anyone here.

1192
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,805
-You've had such food.
-Precisely.

1193
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:25,642
I'll make you feel the same way today,

1194
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,978
and be careful on your way home.

1195
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,414
Bees may flock to you.

1196
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,416
You'll smell way too sweet.

1197
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,384
SHE'S NEVER HEARD SUCH A WARNING BEFORE

1198
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,953
The sweet smell.

1199
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:40,324
Chef Ho-young is a man
with a strong work ethic.

1200
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,192
Can you really win against Poong?

1201
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,328
I haven't had too many sweet desserts,

1202
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,464
so I'm still unsure
about how sweet it should be.

1203
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,465
Listen to that.

1204
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,568
-He may be at a disadvantage.
-Exactly.

1205
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,204
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS: BANANA, MILK,
CRÈME BRÛLÉE SPREAD, VANILLA ICE CREAM

1206
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,906
CHOCOLATE SANDWICH ICE CREAM,
CARAMEL SANDWICH ICE CREAM, YOGURT, MANGO

1207
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,575
ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS: BLUEBERRIES,
SPREAD, CHOCOLATE, CREAM BREAD, KIMCHI

1208
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,344
First, Chef Ho-young?

1209
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,512
The dish I'll make today is this.

1210
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,480
<i>Sweet Sweet</i>

1211
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,616
<i>Sweet Sweet Dance</i>

1212
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,984
<i>Sweet Sweet Dance</i>

1213
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,320
-What was that?
-Sweet Sweet Dance?

1214
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,221
Not "Dun Dun Dance"?

1215
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,557
<i>Sweet Sweet Dance</i>

1216
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,627
"DUN DUN DANCE" BY OH MY GIRL

1217
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,896
<i>Sweet Sweet Dance</i>

1218
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,331
I love it.

1219
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,833
He's like a marshmallow.

1220
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,736
He's so endearing.

1221
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:28,338
-So it's Sweet Sweet Dance?
-Yes, Sweet Sweet Dance.

1222
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,109
There are many desserts in Japan
that use fruit.

1223
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,412
So I'll use mangoes and bananas today.

1224
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,149
-I see.
-I'll also make sweet custard

1225
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,919
and let you scoop it out with a spoon.

1226
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,955
Lastly, I'll melt some sugar,

1227
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,357
turn it into angel hair,

1228
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,959
and wrap it in a crêpe

1229
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:53,230
to let you get the sweet taste
as soon as you take a bite.

1230
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,233
Webtoon Artist Poong is against him.
What's your dish?

1231
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,268
My dish is called…

1232
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,737
<i>Get Splashed by Poong</i>

1233
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:05,008
<i>Da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da-da, hey</i>

1234
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,811
GET SPLASHED BY POONG

1235
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,047
-That was perfect
-I even lost with the dance.

1236
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,516
OH MY GIRL VER.

1237
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,952
KIM POONG ON FIRE VER.

1238
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,454
-Something about that move…
-No, no.

1239
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,457
WHAT ABOUT IT?

1240
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,926
SQUIRM

1241
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,294
It's so gross.

1242
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,296
Don't be so gross!

1243
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,665
-His hips are so free-spirited.
-Yes.

1244
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,300
I can't watch this.

1245
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,102
I'll think of this right before I sleep.

1246
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,237
How will you splash her, then?

1247
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,074
I'll make dough and make donuts.

1248
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,976
-That sounds good.
-I'll make donuts

1249
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,411
that look more like churros.

1250
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,647
I'll serve it with three different creams.

1251
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,315
-Three?
-I'll use

1252
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,085
the cream in the cream-filled bread

1253
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,088
and make blueberry cream, chocolate cream,

1254
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,491
and another cream with the biscuit spread.
I've never tried it, either.

1255
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,493
-It'll taste good.
-But I thought it'd be good.

1256
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,029
I'll serve it with three creams
for you to dip it in.

1257
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,230
-That sounds good.
-Yes.

1258
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,165
Why do you have garlic and green onion?

1259
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,301
Last week, I saw Fabri

1260
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,537
<i>show off his skills</i>
<i>with truffle oil and radish kimchi.</i>

1261
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,139
It was quite impressive.

1262
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:13,643
So I wanted to make green onion oil
and mix that with kimchi on the side.

1263
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,180
I thought it'd be good with the donut.

1264
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,482
Will you have enough time?

1265
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:22,252
-I'll have to try.
-You can't guarantee it?

1266
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,453
-You'll have to try.
-Yes.

1267
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,921
What's your dish again?

1268
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:29,226
<i>Get Splashed by Poong</i>

1269
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:34,064
<i>Da-da-da-da</i>

1270
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,933
<i>Da-da-da da-da-da, hey</i>

1271
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,169
-It's so hot.
-I'm pleased.

1272
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,704
That was crazy.

1273
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,741
Anyway, that felt good for now.

1274
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,743
And now,

1275
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,048
it's time to fill Mimi's order,
"Dessert, my blood sugar spiked up."

1276
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,751
He's here to present an addictive dessert
as sweet as his sweet sweet dance,

1277
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:58,321
the blood sugar fairy of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
Chef Jung Ho-young.

1278
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,358
But sugar flows through this man's veins.

1279
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:04,728
He's here to give you
the most unethical sweetness in history.

1280
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,963
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong is
up for the challenge.

1281
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:11,701
Which one of them will give Mimi
the highest blood sugar spike?

1282
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,672
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1283
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,708
Begin!

1284
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,844
MILK, BUTTER

1285
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,913
HO-YOUNG BEGINS WITH MILK!

1286
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,382
-Pa, pa, pa.
-Please make delicious desserts.

1287
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,584
POONG BOILS BUTTER IN WATER

1288
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,620
-Is that butter?
-Yes, it's butter.

1289
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,223
I thought it was a soap from this far.

1290
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,392
You're using that much butter?

1291
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,827
Is that sugar?

1292
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,063
WATCH OUT FOR THE BLOOD SUGAR SPIKE

1293
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,898
-He needs to use that much.
-Isn't that too much?

1294
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,667
Whoa, look at that.

1295
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,969
My gosh, Ho-young.

1296
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,506
-He also pours it in to win.
-Yes.

1297
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:53,310
-But desserts naturally use lots of sugar.
-That's true.

1298
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,345
ADDING CREAM TO MILK!

1299
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,080
What's that cream?

1300
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,048
Ice cream.

1301
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,618
He's making cream by using ice cream.

1302
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,619
Whoa.

1303
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,856
He's using eggs now.

1304
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,858
Ho-young uses just the egg yolks.

1305
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,695
AND ADDS SUGAR HERE TOO

1306
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:13,730
2. MIX EGG YOLKS AND SUGAR

1307
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,266
He's mixing egg yolks and sugar.

1308
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,802
When you pour hot liquid inside,
the egg will get cooked.

1309
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,305
-So he's coating it with sugar.
-I see.

1310
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,340
So that's why.

1311
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,742
-He's making custard cream.
-Yes.

1312
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,144
BREAKING

1313
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,613
GREEN ONION AND GARLIC CLOVES

1314
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,981
Isn't that green onion?

1315
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,749
What's Poong throwing in?

1316
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,285
-I'm making green onion oil.
-You'll make that?

1317
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,286
Yes, I'm going to try.

1318
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,089
You should focus on one dish.

1319
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,191
WATER, BUTTER, AND SUGAR

1320
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,426
Whoa, Poong. What's that?

1321
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,495
It's the batter.

1322
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,397
SO CURIOUS

1323
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,599
I think he'll make the batter
and fry that.

1324
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,701
It already looks too sweet.

1325
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,337
I don't think
the batter is in the right ratio.

1326
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:58,008
-Is that the right amount?
-It looks a bit too dry.

1327
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,744
When we watch health programs,
we see shapes like those

1328
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,112
when they show a replica of body fat.

1329
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,613
THE BODY FAT REPLICA?

1330
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,716
-Those shapes?
-Right?

1331
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,385
-When they try to explain something?
-Yes.

1332
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,153
It's like, "We have this in our body."

1333
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,288
Whoa.

1334
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,822
Poong's dish looks evil.

1335
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,457
It looks evil.

1336
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,693
There's no work ethic here.

1337
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,061
That doesn't look right.

1338
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,363
Mango looks good.

1339
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,732
-He's using mango.
-Yes.

1340
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,302
WHILE HE PREPARES MANGO…

1341
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,170
BOILING

1342
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,173
BANANA

1343
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,741
SUGAR

1344
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,877
AND MORE SUGAR ON BANANA

1345
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,546
Over here.

1346
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,882
He's making banana flambé.

1347
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,450
This is delicious. Banana flambé.

1348
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,886
-Bananas are better when roasted.
-It's banana flambé.

1349
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,655
AND A FLASHY PERFORMANCE

1350
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:47,857
Banana flambé.

1351
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,494
POONG IS DONE MAKING THE GREEN ONION OIL

1352
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,632
-He's making green onion oil.
-He's an expert at that.

1353
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,001
Poong also uses an egg.

1354
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,302
DROPPING THE SUGAR BATTER INTO THE EGG

1355
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:03,607
-I think he'll blend that.
-He added an egg at the very end.

1356
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,542
With just the yolk?

1357
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,344
-No, whole egg.
-The whole egg.

1358
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,981
Is it not blending? Are you done?

1359
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,282
He forgot the blades.

1360
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,285
-He forgot the blades.
-He forgot.

1361
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,088
PLEASE DON'T FORGET THE BLADES

1362
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,290
Don't get flustered. You're fine.

1363
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,391
What did you do?

1364
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,626
Don't get flustered.

1365
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,094
BLENDER ON

1366
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,929
It's working.

1367
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,698
What is that?

1368
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,901
We can do this. Please.

1369
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,437
-You know you can do it.
-He's asking the blender to hang in there.

1370
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,941
You can do it. It's okay.
Don't get flustered.

1371
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,909
HOW DID IT GO?

1372
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,144
Okay.

1373
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,546
THE DONUT BATTER IS FINISHED!

1374
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,449
Chef Ho-young is making caramel.

1375
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,318
I see. I love caramel.

1376
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,287
But it looks burnt.

1377
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,889
It'll taste bitter instead of sweet.

1378
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,326
-Doesn't it look burnt?
-Yes, and it'll taste bitter

1379
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,894
instead of sweet.

1380
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,629
Ho-young, is the caramel burnt?

1381
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,132
What's up?

1382
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,033
HE SUDDENLY TALKS CASUALLY

1383
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,034
What's up?

1384
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,306
I asked you in respectful language.

1385
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,608
Why are you suddenly answering casually?

1386
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,444
Would I feel offended or not?

1387
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,247
-You'd feel offended.
-He's out of it.

1388
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,548
He did that on purpose.

1389
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,317
-He's out of it. Please understand.
-I'm sorry.

1390
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,918
I understand.

1391
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,753
It looks too burnt and scorched.

1392
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,322
-It's fine.
-It's okay.

1393
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,424
He's making caramel.

1394
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,028
4. MIX CRÈME BRÛLÉE SPREAD, SUGAR,
AND YOGURT TO MAKE YOGURT CREAM

1395
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,265
WHAT ABOUT THE CARAMEL?

1396
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,402
5. SPREAD CARAMEL ON A TRAY AND COOL

1397
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,339
Chef Ho-young, what are you up to?

1398
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,708
-He's making custard cream.
-Custard.

1399
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:45,809
Custard.

1400
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,344
AMAZED

1401
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:52,882
6. POUR VANILLA CREAM INTO THE SUGAR
AND EGG YOLK MIX, AND STIR

1402
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,552
Poong is done blending the batter.

1403
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,754
-It looks nice.
-It does.

1404
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,422
It looks much better than before.

1405
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,591
-It looks good.
-It does.

1406
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:05,061
-He's putting it into a plastic bag.
-It looks good.

1407
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,763
-He's doing well.
-Will he fry that?

1408
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,199
-Will you deep-fry that?
-It's like churro batter.

1409
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,834
-Yes, it's like churros.
-Whoa.

1410
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,402
-Churros.
-Make it long.

1411
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,337
Poong often does stuff like that.

1412
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,573
He loves that shape.

1413
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,377
<i>Get splashed again, da-da-da-da</i>

1414
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,513
He always makes us take it the wrong way.

1415
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,249
I hope it comes out nicely.

1416
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,685
<i>Get Splashed by Poong</i>

1417
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,720
It looks chewy.

1418
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,455
It already looks good.

1419
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,057
It's hot!

1420
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,526
Is that a snake?

1421
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,562
<i>Da-da-da-da da-da-da</i>

1422
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,531
<i>Da-da-da, ooh</i>

1423
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,032
Is that a rope?

1424
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,102
-It's hot.
-What's that?

1425
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,872
DROPS

1426
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,507
IT'S AN EMERGENCY

1427
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,510
Stop it.

1428
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,645
-It popped out.
-It dropped.

1429
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,913
No, it's okay.

1430
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,715
It'll be fine if he doesn't burn it.

1431
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,916
That's so cool.

1432
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,152
Chef Ho-young, isn't that too thin?

1433
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,587
No, it'll be fine once it cools down.

1434
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,122
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

1435
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,324
-He doesn't have enough arm strength now.
-No.

1436
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,161
-His face is flushed.
-You're right.

1437
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,062
Gosh, my arm hurts.

1438
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,265
Okay, good.

1439
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,766
-Cream.
-Okay, cream.

1440
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,935
-I'll do this first.
-The cream.

1441
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,770
ASSORTED CREAM: 1. BLUEBERRY CREAM

1442
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,539
Sugar.

1443
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,707
He keeps pouring in more sugar.

1444
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,643
-Full marks for calories.
-Sugar. Yes.

1445
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,313
Both dishes must be unbelievably sweet.

1446
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,150
They've stashed in
everything I know that tastes sweet.

1447
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,387
-It looks good.
-It looks nice.

1448
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,122
The churro is coming along.

1449
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,056
-It looks good.
-It's so cool.

1450
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,092
HIS ENTIRE BODY ACHES

1451
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,929
It's okay. I can do this.

1452
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,632
What did you throw in, Poong?

1453
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,601
-I'm melting chocolate.
-Chocolate.

1454
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,470
He's using the microwave.

1455
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,539
HO-YOUNG GETS HELP FROM A MACHINE

1456
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,908
What are you blending?

1457
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,279
I mixed milk and egg to make crêpe batter.

1458
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,981
Crêpe batter.

1459
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,082
I'm dying to try it.

1460
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,084
-It needs to be thin, right?
-Yes.

1461
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,886
7. MIX MILK, EGG, AND FLOUR
TO MAKE CRÊPE BATTER

1462
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,788
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds left.

1463
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,424
Is Chef Ho-young toasting the crêpe?

1464
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,593
-The crêpe.
-The crêpe.

1465
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,629
-Pull it out.
-Already?

1466
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,165
-You have to pull it out now.
-I do?

1467
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,100
It'll turn smaller if you keep frying it.

1468
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,035
-Whoa.
-All done.

1469
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,238
Whoa, what's this?

1470
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,206
It looks like a piece of art.

1471
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,241
It looks like intestines.

1472
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:34,744
-It's like tripe.
-Yes, like tripe.

1473
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,212
-Tripe.
-Yes.

1474
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,981
That's why he's using
green onion and garlic.

1475
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:42,018
ICE CREAM SANDWICH

1476
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,587
EMPTYING OUT THE INSIDE

1477
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:48,124
I see. He's using just the sandwich shell.

1478
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,694
-He just served only the cookie shell.
-Yes.

1479
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,097
And he's topping that with cream.

1480
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,132
-Custard.
-It goes on top.

1481
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,601
It's a mix of yogurt and that…

1482
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,802
That other thing.

1483
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,871
-What other thing?
-Other thing?

1484
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,740
You have to tell us what it is, Chef!

1485
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:07,010
How am I supposed to find out
if you say it's just the other thing?

1486
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,611
-What is it?
-It's some cream.

1487
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,280
-The egg yolk?
-Some cream?

1488
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,115
IT'S NOT EASY TO REMEMBER,
THE CRÈME BRÛLÉE SPREAD

1489
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,516
And is that mango?

1490
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,984
-That's mango.
-Mango goes up.

1491
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,119
It looks good.

1492
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,787
He has six minutes left.

1493
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,790
-Six minutes left.
-Already?

1494
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,325
BISCUIT SPREAD

1495
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,427
ASSORTED CREAM: 3. BISCUIT SPREAD CREAM

1496
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,663
The cream-filled bread.

1497
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,531
I think he's just using the cream.

1498
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:29,899
He gets the cream-filled bread.

1499
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,601
-Just the cream of the bread?
-I need the cream.

1500
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,136
-What?
-Just the cream.

1501
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,939
-Tiramisu.
-I think you're copying someone.

1502
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,975
He's going to win today.

1503
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,777
-Maybe.
-I have a good feeling about this.

1504
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:45,148
HE'S DONE MAKING
THE BISCUIT SPREAD-FLAVORED CREAM

1505
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,316
Good.

1506
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,451
LET'S SEE

1507
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,020
Wait, what you're doing…

1508
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,256
-It's too hard.
-It already hardened.

1509
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,625
-It's too hard?
-You can't do that.

1510
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:56,893
It can't happen.

1511
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,795
I have a way.

1512
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,531
-He wanted to do it like <i>basi</i>.
-It should've dripped like <i>basi</i>.

1513
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,466
It's too hard now.

1514
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,668
-Will he use just a few pieces?
-I guess.

1515
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:06,769
You can always do that.

1516
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,072
Chef Ho-young is in trouble.

1517
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,974
-I have a plan B.
-Five minutes.

1518
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,177
Five minutes, Jung-hwan.
Please go out to the kitchen.

1519
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,812
That's the time already?

1520
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,480
I can smell the sugar from here.

1521
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,718
-What's Poong doing?
-He's blending blueberries.

1522
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,886
He's blending blueberries.

1523
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,822
I need to throw in the bread too.

1524
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:29,125
5. BLEND BLUEBERRIES, SUGAR,
THEN CREAM-FILLED BREAD TOO

1525
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,426
That's amazing.

1526
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:35,999
I hope this got cooked.
Has it been cooked?

1527
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,836
It looks fine.

1528
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,004
The banana.

1529
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,706
-The problem is the caramel.
-The caramel?

1530
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,308
-Is it not working?
-It was supposed to be like…

1531
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,442
No, I don't want to say it.

1532
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:48,778
I don't know what your plan was.

1533
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,416
THE CRÊPE IS READY

1534
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,285
This looks better than I thought.

1535
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:59,155
-The churro.
-Are you using just the cream?

1536
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,957
The melted chocolate.

1537
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,859
You said you'd make three assorted sauce.

1538
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,627
What happened to the kimchi?

1539
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,897
-Just the cream.
-That's a lot.

1540
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,166
Gosh, this is…

1541
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,869
This is just…

1542
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,838
You'll be on the verge of death
after you have a bite of this.

1543
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,273
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

1544
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,408
Try that.

1545
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,308
Shall I?

1546
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,712
-Try and see what it's like.
-Okay.

1547
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,149
-What's it like?
-I should do my job, right?

1548
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,517
Will you be on the verge of death?

1549
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,685
That doesn't matter.

1550
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,054
Or your eyes might open widely.

1551
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,757
Is it giving you a blood sugar spike?
Or just high blood pressure?

1552
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,560
Is it giving you a blood sugar spike?
Or just high blood pressure?

1553
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,363
So this is what it feels like
to have a clogged vessel!

1554
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,366
-My gosh.
-Clogged vessels?

1555
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,501
I'm getting hyper.

1556
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:46,969
-Here we go!
-I got hyper.

1557
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,739
This is really sweet.

1558
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:50,840
You have three minutes.

1559
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,943
BISCUIT SPREAD CREAM
AND CHOCOLATE CREAM ARE DONE

1560
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,978
The blood sugar level is skyrocketing.

1561
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,480
Over here.

1562
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,948
Look at that balance.

1563
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,516
That thing in the cup looks good.

1564
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:03,052
Wait, his dish was too sweet,

1565
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,855
so if this is less sweet,
it'd probably taste bland.

1566
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:06,789
That can happen.

1567
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,426
Now, Jung-hwan. What's it like?

1568
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,496
Is it sweet or not too sweet?

1569
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,431
What's it like?

1570
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:16,566
My gosh. What is this?

1571
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,903
He has abandoned his work ethics.

1572
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:26,109
WORK ETHIC? WHAT'S THAT.

1573
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,879
-It's twice as sweet as Poong's dish.
-Really?

1574
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:30,980
Come on, Ho-young!

1575
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,448
-What is this?
-My gosh.

1576
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,017
He used an entire bowl of sugar.

1577
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,086
-He used it all?
-Like this.

1578
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:40,223
I thought this would taste bland
after I tried this one,

1579
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,924
but this was worse.

1580
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,727
-Poong, make it much sweeter.
-That's crazy.

1581
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,163
I can even feel the sugar with my teeth.

1582
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,698
YUM

1583
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,234
-Man, this is sweet.
-See?

1584
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,903
Mimi will have to like this.

1585
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:59,475
9. PUT BROKEN CARAMEL
ON TOP OF THE CRÊPE AND ROLL

1586
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,911
CUT OFF THE TIPS

1587
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,615
AND FINISH THE CARAMEL CRÊPE

1588
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,051
You have two minutes left.

1589
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,620
Kimchi.

1590
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,156
What will you do with kimchi?

1591
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,357
I'll mix it with green onion oil.

1592
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:17,393
You'll just mix green onion oil
with regular kimchi?

1593
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,463
He just thought it'd taste good.

1594
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,398
-Will it help him or not?
-I wonder.

1595
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,300
-Sugar.
-Anyone can see…

1596
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,968
He's adding more sugar.

1597
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,471
-What is that?
-Just…

1598
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,606
He added sugar to kimchi?

1599
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:35,711
Mimi, I hope you stick around
for a long time in the industry.

1600
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:38,114
Will it help him or not?

1601
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,515
Did the sugar melt?

1602
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,584
-He tops it with the banana.
-You have a minute left.

1603
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,152
One minute.

1604
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,655
-It'll be nice to add some lemon zest.
-She didn't have any.

1605
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,390
Last minute!

1606
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,459
-That one looks good.
-Yes.

1607
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,628
-What about the rope?
-The rope!

1608
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,197
-The rope.
-Serve the rope.

1609
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,599
-Is that it?
-Just like that?

1610
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,968
Is that supposed to be an Imugi?

1611
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,438
-That's the blueberry cream.
-Yes.

1612
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,508
Sir, two servings of beef tripe, please.

1613
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,443
-Four sauces, including kimchi.
-Yes.

1614
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,544
My gosh.

1615
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,012
KIMCHI0

1616
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,814
You have 30 seconds left.

1617
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:15,084
-He's done! Ho-young!
-Are you done, Ho-young?

1618
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,820
In that while, Ho-young finished first.

1619
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,455
And Poong looks relaxed.

1620
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,791
He left 20 seconds before he ended.

1621
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,295
If it's seriously sweet,
that kimchi may be the savior.

1622
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,964
That might be true.

1623
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,367
-It'll taste too greasy.
-I'm looking forward to this.

1624
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,102
Poong's dessert looks pretty.

1625
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,637
It is. Churros.

1626
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,039
-Churros and dips.
-Three different kinds.

1627
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,708
-And he served kimchi too.
-Yes.

1628
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,909
That kimchi.

1629
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,644
-Yes.
-It looks really good.

1630
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,213
Chef Ho-young finished first,

1631
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,916
so please try Sweet Sweet Dance first.

1632
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:50,653
CRÊPE MADE WITH EVERY GRAIN OF SUGAR
AND CREAM-BASED DESSERT

1633
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:55,791
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S SWEET SWEET DANCE

1634
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,594
I hope she begins to dance.

1635
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,363
This looks really sweet.

1636
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,798
Dig the spoon
all the way down to the bottom.

1637
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,533
Right? Like this?

1638
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,602
-My gosh.
-That looks so sweet.

1639
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,837
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

1640
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,007
-It has to be delicious. Yes.
-Are you sure?

1641
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,643
My gosh, Mimi.

1642
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:16,012
A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR

1643
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,147
THE VIEWER'S POV

1644
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,182
WIDE-EYED

1645
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,517
-Mmm!
-Yes?

1646
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,252
-Is it good?
-What is it?

1647
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,453
It's good!

1648
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,988
-Isn't it too sweet?
-It's not too sweet.

1649
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,124
-It's not?
-It's not sweet?

1650
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,293
My heart is still racing so fast.

1651
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,229
That one bite was already too sweet.

1652
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:36,732
You said it was really sweet,
so I expected it to be sweeter.

1653
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,135
But this is my usual level of sweetness.

1654
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,770
So it's not too sweet for her.

1655
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,838
-This is your usual sweetness?
-Yes.

1656
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:47,009
What was that again? The caramel?

1657
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,078
<i>The sugar candy.</i>

1658
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,781
You said it seemed burnt, but not at all.

1659
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:52,715
It's good.

1660
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,550
-It wasn't burnt.
-Doesn't it taste bitter?

1661
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,419
What's at the very bottom?

1662
01:05:56,485 --> 01:06:00,389
It's a mix of mango, yogurt,
and cream sauce.

1663
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,492
You even torched the banana pieces.

1664
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,728
I should mash this before I eat it.

1665
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,129
-Yes, mix it up.
-Yes.

1666
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,899
-Yes, right now…
-It looks so sweet.

1667
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,935
She found something again.
You keep finding things.

1668
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,837
She takes yet another bite.

1669
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,840
Can you feel the blood sugar level rising?

1670
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,275
-It's good.
-Is it?

1671
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,876
She begins to applaud.

1672
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,579
She must like it.

1673
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,047
If it's good,
show us the sweet sweet dance.

1674
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,684
TIME TO DO THE SWEET SWEET DANCE

1675
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,453
HE SUCCESSFULLY RAISED
HER BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL

1676
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,656
-It must taste really sweet.
-Okay, and?

1677
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,325
-Hold it in your hand and take a bite.
-Her hand?

1678
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,594
-That must be sweet too.
-He made it with banana.

1679
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,628
Banana.

1680
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,797
Mmm.

1681
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,866
I hope she took a good bite.

1682
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,336
She doesn't look happy.

1683
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,871
Was it too hard?

1684
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,573
It's bitter.

1685
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,709
-It's bitter.
-It's bitter?

1686
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,445
It must've hardened like taffy.

1687
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,518
-Did you say it was hardened like F-word?
-No.

1688
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,688
He should've turned the sugar
into something like <i>basi</i>, the angel hair.

1689
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,156
But it was hardened, right?

1690
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,725
-So it must've turned into taffy.
-Yes, right.

1691
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,861
-Taffy, not F-word.
-It turned into taffy?

1692
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,662
I thought she could use some bitterness

1693
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,197
in the midst of the sweetness.

1694
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,433
THE BITTERNESS WAS A PART OF THE PLAN(?)

1695
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,369
-It's like black coffee.
-Yes, coffee.

1696
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,271
-Then I'll eat it like this.
-How?

1697
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,074
-I'll dip it in here.
-You'll dip it?

1698
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:29,879
-Oh, no.
-Ho-young made a fatal mistake.

1699
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,214
What's it like after dipping it in there?

1700
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,216
It's still bitter.

1701
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,653
You shouldn't have served the crêpe.

1702
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,856
But the crêpe skin is chewy and delicious.

1703
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,459

WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
GET SPLASHED BY POONG

1709
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:01,043
You can start
with the biscuit spread cream,

1710
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,112
then the blueberry cream,
and lastly, the chocolate.

1711
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,981
If you crave kimchi at times,
feel free to try that too.

1712
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,216
-It looks good.
-Try it however you like.

1713
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:10,152
-I'll use my hands.
-Yes, just rip it out.

1714
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,788
-I wondered what the dough would be like.
-Right?

1715
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,925
-The color looks so good.
-That donut has to be good.

1716
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,327
-Mmm.
-I see.

1717
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,029
Is it sweet?

1718
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,131
It tastes very light.

1719
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,233
-I'll dip it.
-But what if you dip it in the cream?

1720
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,801
So she should dip it in the cream now.

1721
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:27,703
Will it taste dangerously sweet?

1722
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,206
-The coffee-flavored one.
-Coffee.

1723
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,742
Mmm. It's good.

1724
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,611
-Is it?
-It's good?

1725
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,047
I don't even need to say it.

1726
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,749
-Blueberry cream.
-Blueberry cream.

1727
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,885
Blueberry cream.

1728
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,888
-I love the color.
-She can pick and choose as she likes.

1729
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,024
EYES WIDENED

1730
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,326
She was surprised.

1731
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,027
This is good.

1732
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:54,663
It tastes like blueberry yogurt.
It's really good.

1733
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,599
So it's really good?

1734
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,501
-What's the last one?
-Chocolate cream.

1735
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,170
-Chocolate cream.
-It's the sweetest one.

1736
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,373
-Chocolate cream.
-It's good.

1737
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,776
-It's not too sweet, either.
-It's not?

1738
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,412
This one is moderately sweet,

1739
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,882
and this was a bit refreshing.

1740
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,550
I can keep rotating among them.

1741
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,486
-Can you try the kimchi?
-Try the kimchi.

1742
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:21,056
You can eat kimchi
while you eat the cream and donut.

1743
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:25,261
-With the cream?
-Or top it on the donut. As you like.

1744
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,929
The chocolate cream was good.

1745
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,265
SHE TAKES A BITE

1746
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,568
If the kimchi was good,
then show us Poong's dance.

1747
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,537
He put sugar in there too.

1748
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,539
-He put sugar in kimchi?
-Yes, he did.

1749
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,008
He mixed it with green onion oil.

1750
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:40,709
So? Were you splashed by Poong?

1751
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,811
One, two, three, four.

I CAN'T WATCH THIS

1757
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:53,722
Why are they so different?

1758
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,391
-It's good.
-Is it?

1759
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,893
Does kimchi go well with the dessert?

1760
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,196
-Of course, it does.
-Really?

1761
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,731
-I guess she already eats bread with that.
-Yes.

1762
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,500
I really hope you try this.

1763
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,771
Then we'll try Chef Ho-young's dish,
Sweet Sweet Dance first.

-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1768
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,616
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

1769
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,018
It's unbelievably sweet.

1770
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,053
It's too sweet.

1771
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,422
-This isn't sweet for you?
-It's not sweet for you?

1772
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,190
It is, but it's deliciously sweet.

1773
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:31,193
My tongue almost felt like
it was paralyzed.

1774
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,528
His tongue was paralyzed.

1775
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:33,829
When something's too sweet,

1776
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:38,100
-there's a moment when you taste nothing.
-Yes.

1777
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,868
I felt that.

1778
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,137
WOOZI had a moment
when he couldn't taste anything.

1779
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,206
His tongue was paralyzed.

1780
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,075
My gosh. This is…

1781
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:49,411
Why? Do you mean that
in a good way or a bad way?

1782
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,014
-It's too sweet for me.
-Right?

1783
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,515

1790
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,031

-The churro.

01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,599
-What is this?
-Isn't it good?

1792
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:11,667
It's so good.

-The batter was perfect.

-Crunchy outside, soft inside.
-I like it.

1795
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:19,208
Don't just eat the donut.
You have to dip it in the cream.

1796
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,910
It wasn't too sweet to eat, right?

1797
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:27,650
I think this was better for me.
It's my limit when it comes to desserts.

Poong was the one
who stuck to the work ethic.

Oh, no. My gosh.

1801
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,260
-I guess I had the ethics from that era.
-Yes, you won't cross over the line.

1802
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,695
Did you sell these back then?

1803
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,097
-I didn't.
-If you had, it wouldn't have gone under.

"Gone under"?

How's the kimchi?

1808
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:53,909
It's really good. I didn't know
green onion oil could be used like this.

1809
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,645
I see. The kimchi wasn't a bad addition.

1810
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:59,148
WOOZI tries it too.

1811
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,916
WOOZI is at it.

I want to eat the kimchi separately.

1817
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,864
-We have different preferences.
-They were different.

1818
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,167
-It's not up to you two.
-No.

1819
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,202
-It's personal preference.
-They had different opinions.

-I do.

-You got this!
-This is Sae-dol's stone.

1874
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:30,432
We hear he has a particular appetite.

1875
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,467
I don't eat cheese.

1876
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,068
-I rarely eat fried food.
-No fried food?

1877
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,136
What if you must use one?

1878
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,404
Neither.

1879
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,638
I'm in trouble.

1880
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,608
-I don't prefer a sweet flavor.
-They can't use even a bit of sugar?

1881
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,477
Nothing with sugar. Zero sugar.

1882
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,644
That's all I ask for.

1883
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:45,214
Will you be able to take down
Sae-dol's ironclad appetite?

1884
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,282
-I'll use fruit to add sweetness.
-Did you leave out sugar?

1885
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,517
-Of course.
-Can he win?

1886
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,252
-He took it too far!
-Too far?

1887
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,487
What do I do?

1888
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,921
I'm in a hurry. Hurry up!

1889
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,123
Sae-dol, what's that in your fridge?

1890
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,225
Right behind you.

1891
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,726
HE BEGINS TO CHEAT

1892
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,694
It's about 65 points.

1893
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,262
These don't go well. It's too sweet.

1894
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,030
-He has an ironclad appetite.
-How scary.

1895
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,499
Frankly speaking…

1896
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:06,502
-He'll be frank.
-He's going to be honest.

1897
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,206
I never knew I was this particular.

1898
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:12,975
This is a difficult job.

1899
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:26,989
