1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,583
We're here today with the queen
and the king of romantic comedy,

2
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,152
Lim Yoona and Ahn Bo-hyun.

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,653
Not only is Bo-hyun

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,589
the king of romantic comedy,

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,858
he's also the king of self-sufficiency.

6
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,093
-From what we heard,
-Self-sufficiency?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,230
this is the 23rd year he has lived alone.

8
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,398
-Really?
-Yes.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,967
I moved out when I was 15.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,568
-When you were 15?
-Is that possible?

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,871
-I used to be an athlete,
-Yes?

12
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,272
a boxer.

13
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,342
I graduated from a sports high school
with a dorm.

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,979
So I spent many more years living alone
than living with my parents.

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,014
You must've been an elite boxer

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,717
if you went to a sports high school
with a dormitory.

17
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,685
I've won a gold medal
in a national championship.

18
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,455
-In your age group?
-Yes, and a bronze medal too.

19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,058
-That's not easy to do.
-I'm originally from Busan,

20
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,693
-so I represented Busan.
-You were the best in Busan?

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,462
WHOA

22
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,731
Then you must be pretty confident
in your punches.

23
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,766
Why? Do you want to be punched?

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,835
DO YOU WANT A TASTE
OF HIS PUNCH?

25
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,805
If it isn't too much to ask…
It's not that we don't believe you.

26
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,207
You just said
you won a gold medal and all.

27
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,341
Should I hit someone?

28
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,409
No.

29
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,279
-Why would we make you do that?
-People usually…

30
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,314
Sung-jun, didn't you say
you were Bo-hyun's fan?

31
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,849
-Bo-hyun?
-Yes.

32
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,351
CALCULATING…

33
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,121
I should say I'm his fan
to let him hit me lightly.

34
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,722
-I'm actually a fan of yours.
-I see.

35
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,725
-You can take his punches like this.
-Just the hands?

36
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,761
-One, two.
-If you're a fan,

37
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,263
-let him hit your solar plexus.
-Your solar plexus?

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,398
HA. HA. HA.

39
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,201
-He'd die.
-Forget that. How about your philtrum?

40
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,069
DO NOT SHOW THEM MERCY

41
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,373
-So we thought of a punching machine.
-Like at the arcade?

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,608
Yes, at the arcade.

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,544
So we got one of those machines.

44
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,946
This sounds fun.

45
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,049
Let's find out
how strong Bo-hyun's punches are.

46
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,585
Ho-young also has a strong punch.

47
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,588
I'm sure Nam-no
and Sung-jun are pretty strong too.

48
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,423
-How cute.
-I'll take volunteers.

49
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,658
-Only volunteers can have a shot.
-You're taking your watch off?

50
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,860
I want to try.

51
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:11,231
And now, let us begin the <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
Punching King Competition.

52
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,032
Let me invite Sung-ju first.

53
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,834
We'll start off with a layman.

54
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,138
-We have to set the bar.
-Just to test it out.

55
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,406
-Oh, man.
-Jeez.

56
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,276
I hope the score isn't too high.

57
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,712
I used to be pretty good at this.

58
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,580
TAKE THIS

59
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,749
THE GUY WHO'S THE SAME AGE
IS HAVING FUN

60
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,017
-I'll go now.
-Sure.

61
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,854
A LIGHT PUNCH!

62
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,091
-What's the number?
-I just pushed it lightly.

63
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,760
-I went over 800? It's 837.
-It's 837.

64
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,462
-Really?
-He got 837 points.

65
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,797
I have some strong bones.

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,433
-It was 837. It's your turn.
-He got 837 points?

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,870
Bo-hyun is up next. I got 837 points.
You can't be lower than me.

68
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,906
I'm a lefty, but I'll use my right hand.

69
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,874
THE FORMER ATHLETE
IS BEING CONSIDERATE

70
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,676
Don't hurt your hand.

71
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,611
-I'll punch it now.
-Bo-hyun is up!

72
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,246
All right. Punch!

73
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,282
Punch!

74
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,683
WHOA

75
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,984
Whoa, Bo-hyun.

76
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,453
Hey, one of these went over.

77
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,988
-Whoa.
-He got 940 points.

78
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,524
-He got 940 points?
-The full score is 999.

79
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,960
-We confirmed his score as 940.
-He got 940 points.

80
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,097
-In that case, our center.
-The center member of the show.

81
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,567
The center is supposed to go last.

82
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,702
I see. Is that so?

83
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,470
Shall we begin with the small fry?

84
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,706
-Sung-jun and Nam-no, come up.
-The brothers.

85
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,774
THE GLITTER BROTHERS ARE UP

86
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,510
STRUTTING

87
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,079
They're like twin waiters at a nightclub.

88
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,182
-Why am I the one embarrassed?
-Nightclub waiters.

89
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,153
All right. Bo-hyun's score was 940.

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,822
It'll be crazy
if Nam-no does better than Bo-hyun.

91
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,924
Nam-no's punch.

92
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,259
Let's go!

93
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,627
POWERFUL

94
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,695
Let's go!

95
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,532
WHAT'S HIS SCORE?

96
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,636
He got 929 points.

97
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,338
PUNCHING KING COMPETITION:
BO-HYUN, NAM-NO, SUNG-JU

98
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,540
Nam-no was quite close to Bo-hyun's score.

99
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,609
11-POINT DIFFERENCE WITH BO-HYUN

100
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,244
May I…

101
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,478
surpass his score?

102
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,080
-Whose score?
-You mean 940?

103
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,514
Try to break my score.

104
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,949
Break my score.

105
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,184
All right, then.

106
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,653
Now, Sung-jun is up for the challenge.

107
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,322
-He might trip over.
-Try to become the punching king! Go!

108
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,423
My gosh!

109
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,558
Go!

110
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,892
My gosh!

111
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,527
HEY?

112
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,596
What's Sung-jun's score?

113
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,897
It's 935.

114
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,768
He beat Nam-no with the score of 935.

115
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,171
Ho-young is walking out.
He has a strong punch too.

116
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,408
You'll get a high score if you slam this
at full speed from ten meters away.

117
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,610
That's awful.

118
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,146
Ho-young is up. Go! Hey!

119
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,882
TEETH-CLENCHING PUNCH

120
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,019
It wasn't so bad.

121
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,687
Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

122
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,821
-Jeez.
-He got 906 points.

123
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,791
You got 906 points.
I'm disappointed, Ho-young.

124
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,593
-Disappointed?
-Disappointed?

125
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,595
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT IT WAS FUN

126
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,131
-He gets 906 points and takes 4th place.
-I couldn't do it.

127
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,400
Bo-hyun, Sung-jun, and Nam-no.

128
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,603
Just as we speak,
Jong-won slowly sneaks up.

129
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,772
He works out a lot.

130
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,541
-Yes.
-He's my center member.

131
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,843
Bo-hyun is currently first place,

132
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,546
followed by Sung-jun and Nam-no.

133
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,249
How will Jong-won do?

134
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,650
How will Jong-won do?

135
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,654
SHOCKED

136
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,424
POWER PUNCH

137
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,994
-Whoa. Did he break the record?
-Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

138
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,663
He gets 953 points!

139
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,598
Jong-won gets 953 points!

140
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,102
GOOD VIBES TURN

141
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,505
-Jong-won takes first place!
-Hey!

142
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,475
-What just happened? What is this?
-My gosh!

143
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,910
Now that's what a center should be!

144
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,378
GOOD VIBES + GREAT POWER

145
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,680
Let's decide on our center
according to the result.

146
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,649
-Let's do this.
-Yes, it'll decide our center.

147
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,353
Hyun-suk becomes our center
if he breaks Jong-won's record.

148
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,588
Hyun-suk was our center until last week,

149
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,624
but if you fail to break 953 points,

150
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,093
you'll be pushed to the side.

151
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,363
-Hyun-suk, the side dish.
-The side dish.

152
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,264
Looking great.

153
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,334
No, you can't use your foot.
Just your hand.

154
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,269
I wonder how Hyun-suk will do.

155
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,772
He's quite athletic too.

156
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,742
He plays baseball, golf, and goes bowling,

157
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,344
and he's good at everything, even wu shu.

158
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,714
That's it. Hyun-suk surely is something.

159
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,250
-He's an athletic guy.
-Good one!

160
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,120
-He's good. He's so talented.
-What's with him today?

161
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,422
If you tie with him with 953 points,

162
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,524
we'll give it to Hyun-suk. He's older.

163
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,193
-Yes, his age is important too.
-You have to give it to him.

164
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,261
We can't help it.

165
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,029
Take the aging curve into consideration.

166
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,265
-All right, then.
-We agree.

167
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,934
He got everyone hyped up. Choi Hyun-suk.

168
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,936
Hyun-suk, go!

169
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,305
Here he goes! Choi…

170
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,807
-What was that?
-Jeez.

171
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,776
Here he goes! Choi…

172
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,111
SLIGHT TAP

173
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,780
Here he goes! Choi…

174
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,648
PFFFT

175
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,185
THIS IS WHY HE'S OUR CENTER

176
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,587
-Wait a second. Come on!
-He got 123 points.

177
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,822
MADE THE (LOWEST) RECORD

178
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,260
<i>-Don't do this, Hyun-suk.</i>
<i>-It's because he's too tall.</i>

179
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,461
IT WAS FUNNY,
SO LET'S REPLAY IT…

180
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,264
-That must've been intentional.
-He's a genius.

181
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,765
Was that supposed to be a shadow punch?

182
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,736
The winner
of the Punching King Competition was

183
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,471
Chef Son Jong-won!

184
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,175
This will make the shoot uncomfortable.

185
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,746
-Bo-hyun gladly visited us today…
-I'm sorry.

186
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,281
-…but he did that to his face.
-You're right.

187
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,217
It's not like I couldn't get 900 points.

188
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,052
Come on, man.

189
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,221
Did you see
how Hyun-suk missed the target?

190
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,289
Chef Jong-won

191
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,925
has good power
because he works out and all,

192
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,059
but he doesn't read the room.

193
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,428
No, he doesn't.

194
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,232
So? Are we editing Jong-won out?
Are we keeping him out?

195
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,333
I have to do another take.

196
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,136
The winner is Bo-hyun!

197
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,704
-With 940 points!
-Yes!

198
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,773
-He can't be beat.
-He was a former athlete.

199
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,309
-I knew it.
-Bo-hyun wins.

200
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,110
-The pride of Busan.
-You can't beat an athlete.

201
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,445
-You can't do that.
-No way.

202
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,814
GIGGLE

203
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,016
OKAY, CUT!

204
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,551
RELIEVED

205
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,922
Bo-hyun is the king of romantic comedy,
boxing, and self-sufficiency.

206
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,124
We're sharing his many sides.

207
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,496
According to our sources,
he gets a second house every winter.

208
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,699
I often like to pitch a tent
for the season

209
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,834
when it turns winter and go camping.

210
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,136
So I found a camping ground
for long-term pitching

211
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,839
<i>in Yangpyeong because it's the off-season.</i>

212
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,008
I call my acquaintances and friends

213
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,344
<i>and cook there as we camp,</i>

214
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,045
<i>barbecuing lots of meat.</i>

215
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,581
I'd begin around the end of October

216
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,484
and remove the tent around March.

217
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,520
-You live in the tent for half a year?
-For half a year?

218
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,156
Does anyone go with you in that period?

219
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:48,427
Fellow actors such as Bae Jung-nam,
Yim Si-wan, and Jung Hae-in.

220
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,831
I'd grill some meat
and make drinks to feed them.

221
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,268
Is there a chef here you want to take

222
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,236
when you camp long-term?

223
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,973
-Please take me.
-Do you want to invite anyone

224
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,543
to eat, stare at the fire together,

225
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,211
and chat about stuff?

226
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,116
I've grilled lots of meat
and made pasta dishes when I camped,

227
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,751
but I've never tried Chinese food.

228
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,586
DOES THAT MEAN…

229
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,288
That means…

230
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,189
-I'd like to ask Chef Eun-yeong.
-Eun-yeong?

231
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,025
Wouldn't it seem weird?

232
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,060
That's why I dwelled on it for a bit.

233
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,229
Did Eun-yeong finally find someone?

234
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,397
I'm getting married first.

235
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,464
And return soon.

236
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,532
Return?

237
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,701
-She'll be a part of the group.
-A group setting.

238
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,771
-They aren't going alone.
-It's fine if they're in a group.

239
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,041
It'd be too awkward
for her to camp with me alone.

240
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,542
All right, then.

241
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,712
I wonder what Bo-hyun keeps in his fridge.

242
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,682
He might have leftovers
from his camping trips.

243
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,785
The crew came home
and actually emptied out my fridge,

244
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,320
so I was really shocked.

245
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,788
Everything.

246
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,557
They brought five coolers
and took everything I had.

247
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,659
Were you surprised
that we took everything?

248
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,962
They came home
and literally took everything.

249
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,464
I begged and said,
"Please leave the bananas,

250
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,568
and a few other things like peanut butter,

251
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,805
because I'm on a strict diet right now."

252
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,139
But they took the rest.

253
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,774
He's lived alone for 23 years,

254
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,845
-so how does he stay healthy?
-He must have a secret.

255
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,580
He was also a former athlete,

256
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,616
and he's still keeping himself in shape.

257
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,652
I wonder what he eats on a daily basis.

258
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,388
And now, it's finally time

259
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,758
-To open!
-to open Bo-hyun's fridge!

260
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,793
OH?

261
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,329
-It's full.
-It's not bad.

262
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,931
It's rather full.

263
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,567
-He has a garden inside.
-He must harvest those.

264
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,535
The first thing I saw was a garden.

265
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,904
What's this? Is this for show?

266
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,172
This is pretty unique.

267
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,175
-Those are…
-I thought it was a garden.

268
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,910
-Is this for TV?
-It's real.

269
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,079
-It's in a drink carrier.
-That's a good idea.

270
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,583
My friend who lives in Jeju
sent me those sweet corns.

271
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,718
When the kernels touch the ground,

272
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,521
they'd quickly become runny or spoiled.

273
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,058
I saw that drink carrier at home,
so I thought it'd be a good idea.

274
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,159
-It is.
-It's a good idea.

275
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,995
But is this true?
Does corn last longer with the husk?

276
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,464
-They do.
-You need to keep them vertically.

277
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,667
-He has to keep these vertically?
-With the husk on?

278
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,437
-I heard this helps them last longer.
-It's a great idea.

279
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,072
The first shelf.

280
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,409
You're on a strict diet,
but you have some beer here.

281
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,811
I do like to drink,

282
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,982
so I try to keep myself away.
But I still wanted to quench the craving,

283
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,450
so I got non-alcoholic beer.

284
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,985
Does it help quench the craving?

285
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,853
The craving stopped
when I stopped drinking.

286
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,689
He was an athlete, so he has good control.

287
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,992
Weight division is everything
when you're a boxer, right?

288
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,594
-Everything depends on a few grams.
-Yes.

289
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,730
Some people shave off their hair,

290
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,766
and some even chew gum to spit out

291
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,069
-even 200 g of spit.
-Whatever they can shed.

292
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,072
In my case, I can tell how much I weigh

293
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,641
when I hold my wrist

294
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,811
or when I gnaw on my cheek
inside my mouth.

295
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,279
GIVING IT A TRY

296
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,081
Inside your mouth, right?

297
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,918
-Because your cheeks get fatter too.
-My cheeks feel thicker or thinner.

298
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,521
-You bite your cheek when you gain weight.
-You're right.

299
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,691
-Really?
-Come to think of it, when I gain weight,

300
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,359
-I do gnaw on my cheek.
-You bite it there.

301
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,529
-I'd bite it while I eat my food.
-Yes, that would happen.

302
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,665
-It happens every day.
-That's because of my weight?

303
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,469
-The inside of my cheeks is torn.
-That part puts on some fat too.

304
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,804
Ho-young, what about you?
Do your cheeks feel thicker?

305
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,640
There's a hefty load.

306
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,976
-There's a whole patch of it.
-A whole patch?

307
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,112
That's a lot of gill meat.

308
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,180
It's like gill meat on a fish.

309
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,949
It looks sturdy.

310
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,985
-I always save some meat here.
-I see.

311
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,788
Do you eat bread,
although you're on a strict diet?

312
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,225
-I really love dessert and bread,
-I see.

313
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,828
so I'd eat 16 chocolate pies a day
while serving in the army.

314
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,930
-Sixteen?
-Sixteen of those?

315
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,100
I could even eat 24 in one sitting.

316
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,203
Then I came across konjac bread.

317
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,505
-This is konjac bread?
-Konjac bread?

318
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,373
-There's such a thing?
-It's a thing?

319
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,644
Oddly, it doesn't become hard
even when you microwave it.

320
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,614
-It turns chewy, and it's low in calories.
-It must be soft.

321
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,749
He did his research.

322
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,151
This must be spaghetti.

323
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,686
-It's dark.
-It's whole wheat pasta.

324
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,754
Whole wheat?

325
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,723
Oats.

326
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,159
-I picked it up recently.
-That's good for you.

327
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,593
That's really good.

328
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,928
I recently picked it up.

329
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:20,533
I grind it with banana, blueberries,
peanut butter, and protein powder.

330
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,600
That sounds good.

331
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,937
It helps me when I have to bulk up.
It's really filling.

332
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,108
Bananas, apples, and blueberries.

333
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,377
I eat those reluctantly.

334
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,078
-Reluctantly?
-Yes.

335
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,282
I don't like the texture of apples.

336
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,050
-Why not?
-What about it?

337
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,120
When I eat raw apples or cucumbers,

338
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,122
they make my teeth ticklish.

339
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:47,159
-I know what that is.
-That's odd.

340
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,530
-It makes me want to brush my teeth.
-It does?

341
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,065
-Really?
-Yes, so,

342
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,201
-The acid can do that.
-I try to eat only a bit.

343
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:59,338
I heard somewhere that apples
and peanut butter are good for you.

344
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,173
The crunchy texture
makes me feel that way.

345
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,609
I have a great idea. You were a boxer,

346
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,512
so you should eat it
with the mouthguard on.

347
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,714
It won't tickle your teeth.

348
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,850
Are you in the kimchi business?

349
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,086
-You must be in the business.
-That's not the case.

350
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,388
You have lots of side dishes.

351
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,025
Cheongyang pepper sauce
and marinated shrimps.

352
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,027
I have to try the products I model for,

353
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,263
so they sent me some,
and I bought some myself.

354
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,366
I had much more,
but I gave out some to my friends

355
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,434
and only left what I'll eat.

356
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,669
Low-sugar sauces. <i>Chogochujang</i>.

357
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,372
And wasabi. Do you like these sauces?

358
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,707
I'm like Yoona.

359
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,644
I like the tangy flavor
in wasabi and mustard.

360
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
I love those.

361
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,115
I add lots of vinegar
when I eat <i>bokguk</i>, pufferfish soup,

362
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,919
and not just that,
into all kinds of different soups.

363
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,787
You have lots of <i>chogochujang</i>.

364
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,156
I like that sauce,

365
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,058
but here's something I must tell you,

366
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,393
something that runs in my family.

367
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,096
My family tends to sweat
when we see something red.

368
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,065
-What?
-Like spicy food?

369
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,533
By just looking at it?

370
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,004
When I was younger,
I saw my dad break out in a sweat

371
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,541
when someone scooped gochujang on TV,
and I didn't get it.

372
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,579
But after my younger sister
and I became of age…

373
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,747
-That's genetic?
-…we would

374
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,617
also break out in a sweat
even at the sight of stew boiling.

375
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,487
-Just seeing some spicy food?
-Is it because you know how it feels?

376
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,589
-It's…
-What about this can of cola?

377
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,291
-This is fine.
-So this is fine.

378
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,293
-I see.
-That's odd. It's genetic?

379
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,360
Down here.

380
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
TO THE FREEZER!

381
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,164
-He had chicken breasts here.
-Chicken breasts.

382
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,166
Do you enjoy dry meat?

383
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,534
Actually,

384
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,802
I don't like chicken.

385
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,904
-What?
-You don't like chicken at all?

386
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:42,274
-I've never ordered fried chicken.
-That's crazy.

387
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,676
He's very unusual.

388
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,843
LAUGHING

389
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,713
-I order it for other people, but…
-You don't eat fried chicken?

390
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,283
…I really don't like chicken breast.
It isn't my usual preference.

391
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,520
-I eat it reluctantly.
-To stay in shape?

392
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,655
-I'm on a fixed diet.
-Right now?

393
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,258
I eat 200 g of rice
and 8 pieces of chicken breast.

394
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,328
-You eat eight of these? In a day?
-Yes.

395
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,264
-How do you eat eight of those?
-I see why he doesn't like it.

396
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,301
I eat about 6 to 8 of those,
so 600 to 800 grams.

397
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,737
Isn't this also chicken?

398
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,740
This is duck breast.

399
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,344
I always keep other protein such as fish,

400
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,079
which I probably ran out of.

401
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,714
I have lots of other protein products.

402
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,751
-What are these?
-Easy to use products for camping.

403
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,753
-Lamp chops.
-This is lamb.

404
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,821
I love it.

405
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,923
The grease splatters everywhere
when I cook it at home,

406
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,792
-so I cook it outside when I camp.
-At a camping ground. Yes.

407
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,528
I either cook it over charcoal or a stove.

408
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,263
-When you go camping?
-Yes.

409
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,000
What do you usually eat
when you go camping?

410
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,302
I resort to meal kits.

411
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,771
-Meal kits?
-There are

412
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,908
lots of great meal kits out there,
and I love starchy dishes,

413
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,978
-so I get scorched rice soup with seafood.
-Those dishes.

414
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,713
THAT'S A GOOD ONE

415
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,482
Bo-hyun's fridge is

416
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,951
mostly filled with products
for his diet or camping food.

417
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,486
It's kind of embarrassing.

418
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,756
We got to learn many new sides of Bo-hyun.

419
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,724
That was all for his fridge.

420
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,661
What kind of dishes does he want?

421
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,464
Let's find out his orders. Show us!

422
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,600
The first one.

423
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,504
We got to see both.
Bo-hyun needs carbs, protein, and fat.

424
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,106
Bo-hyun only loves camping food.

425
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,574
-I see.
-Bo-hyun.

426
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,078
As I mentioned before,
I always eat the same thing,

427
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,782
about 200 g of rice and 200 g of chicken.

428
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,117
I want to ask you to make

429
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,288
something I can enjoy deliciously
with the ingredients I have,

430
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:41,226
while keeping the adequate ratio
of carbs, protein, and fat.

431
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,563
Next, Bo-hyun only loves camping food.

432
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,899
I always end up cooking

433
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,801
the same kind of food when I go camping.

434
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:53,639
I want to ask the chefs
to use camping gear

435
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,075
so that I can learn

436
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,910
how to cook a different dish.

437
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,146
-It's romantic to cook while camping.
-It is.

438
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,516
Yes, everyone has their eyes only on me.

439
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,555
To be honest, I sometimes put a meal kit
in a different container and cook it.

440
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,225
-But today, I want to learn a real recipe.
-Please do that.

441
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,028
-The process is important too.
-He wants to learn something.

442
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,132
There are four chefs left.
Hyun-suk, Sam, Nam-no, and Eun-yeong.

443
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,767
-I'll go first.
-Hyun-suk.

444
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,036
-Bo-hyun only loves camping food.
-Whoa.

445
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,370
-Camping food?
-Yes.

446
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,374
-He wanted to see a fancy process too.
-That romance.

447
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,610
So I'll include that in my recipe.

448
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,579
-That sounds great.
-How cool.

449
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,982
I also want to try making camping food.

450
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,052
-What?
-Are you sure?

451
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,955
I often go camping with my staff
and cook delicious dishes.

452
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,523
-You do?
-You did that?

453
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,092
That means Hyun-suk is up against Sam.

454
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,231
That means Nam-no and Eun-yeong's fight
has been decided.

455
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,434
THE YOUNG GUNS WILL BEGIN FIRST

456
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,872
<i>This is the first round of cook-off</i>
<i>with Bo-hyun's ingredients.</i>

457
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,241
The two young guns
of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> are up.

458
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,177
She doesn't care about seniority
when it comes to victory.

459
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,046
Like a moth to a flame,
Chef Eun-yeong longs for victory.

460
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,883
This maniac doesn't care about anything
when it comes to winning.

461
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:15,687
Like a bulldozer,
Chef Yoon Nam-no is up for the challenge.

462
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,858
Chef Nam-no, didn't you already go
during Yoona's episode?

463
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,427
No, he was a different man.

464
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,330
-It's confusing, but it wasn't him.
-All right.

465
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,733
If you look at them from here,

466
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,068
it looks like Nam-no is staring at Nam-no.

467
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,037
THE DOPPELGÄNGER
OF COOKING MANIAC

468
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,207
It's like, Nam-no's here,
but he's over there too.

469
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,709
The gray-haired man on this episode is

470
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,180
the real Cooking Maniac, Chef Yoon Nam-no.

471
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,116
Chef Nam-no versus Chef Eun-yeong.

472
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,653
You two both have four stars.

473
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,322
There are four young guns
here on <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

474
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,590
<i>Bae Gyeong-jun,</i>

475
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,991
Park Eun-yeong,

476
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,259
Kwon Sung-jun,

477
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,594
-and me.
-Yes, right.

478
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,697
And I'm the captain among the four.

479
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,300
-You're the captain?
-I am.

480
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,804
I'm the eldest among the chefs
who were born in the nineties,

481
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,540
-and I should rise to the top.
-He has a point.

482
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,876
The captain of the young guns.

483
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,245
I'll acknowledge you as the captain
if you win today.

484
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,180
-Let's put our hairstyle at stake too.
-No.

485
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,749
STOP PUTTING YOUR HAIRSTYLE AT STAKE

486
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,218
Stop betting your hairstyle.

487
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,954
Why do you keep bringing up
your hairstyle?

488
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,623
He wants to fill the studio
with his hairstyle.

489
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,824
THE YOUNG GUNS
ALL BECOME NAM-NO

490
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,093
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:

491
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,161
SRIRACHA, BUTTON MUSHROOMS,
PARMESAN

492
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,263
WATER KIMCHI, TENDERLOIN,
OATMEAL, TOMATO SAUCE

493
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,098
The dish I prepared today is

494
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,533
My Type of <i>Hotteok</i>.

495
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,135
-My Type of <i>Hotteok</i>?
-Yes.

496
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:42,207
Like something that you love, right?
What's the dish like?

497
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,709
-That's just my type!
-Yes.

498
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,078
I'll use Chinese meatballs

499
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,380
and fill up <i>hotteok</i>
that'll be just his type.

500
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,150
<i>Hotteok</i> is the kind of dish
you don't eat to stay in shape, right?

501
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,988
But I'll make it with oatmeal
instead of flour.

502
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,390
-That batter's going to be tough to make.
-It won't be easy.

503
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,392
I'll fill it with carbs, protein, and fat

504
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,930
to make the perfect <i>hotteok</i> for Bo-hyun,
who has to keep his shape.

505
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,732
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS:

506
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:07,799
DUCK BREAST, WHOLE WHEAT PASTA,
SRIRACHA, WASABI

507
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,867
MUSTARD, CHOGOCHUJANG,
TRUFFLE OIL,

508
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,935
BROTH TABLET, ALMONDS, AND MORE

509
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,937
My dish is called

510
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,071
Cooking…

511
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,241
<i>Stone</i>

512
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,743
-What?
-Stone?

513
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,444
Do you know what that song is?

514
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,348
I starred in <i>Itaewon Class </i>as the villain,
and it's part of the soundtrack.

515
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,716
I SEE

516
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,185
So that's why Nam-no thought it up.

517
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,188
You got a chance to mention <i>Itaewon Class</i>.

518
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,523
What's it called again?

519
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,826
Cooking Stone.

520
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,195
-I see.
-He's good.

521
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,364
How do you make this Cooking Stone?

522
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,366
I'll make it with carbs, protein, and fat,

523
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,069
something delicious and nutritious.

524
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,404
For carbs,

525
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,374
I'll make a cold pasta
with whole wheat pasta.

526
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,644
Next, I'll make a soup dish
with duck meat,

527
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,146
a shabu-shabu dish.

528
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:58,583
Lastly, I'll make sauce with duck fat.

529
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,254
Your body will become as hard as stone
after eating this dish.

530
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,755
-I see.
-I look forward to it.

531
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,457
-Duck's good for you.
-Yes.

532
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,494
Then let us begin their cook-off.

533
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,863
This Cooking Maniac, Nam-no,
has been staying in shape

534
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,199
with balanced meals
consisting of carbs, protein, and fat,

535
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,269
but she's here to destroy
this Cooking Stone.

536
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
Chef Eun-yeong is up against him.

537
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:23,875
Which one of them will satisfy
Bo-hyun's need to stay in shape?

538
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,479
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

539
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,016
Begin!

540
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,451
DISHES TO HELP HIM STAY IN SHAPE

541
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,620
What kind of pasta is that again?

542
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,823
-Whole wheat.
-Whole wheat pasta.

543
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,927
-I never thought I'd eat it cold.
-I see.

544
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,061
I'm curious.

545
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,430
He wanted to eat something
to stay in shape,

546
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,400
so they shouldn't use
whatever ingredients they could find.

547
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,968
-Is that oatmeal?
-She's grinding oatmeal.

548
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,903
She said she'd use that instead of flour.

549
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,439
Will that turn into <i>hotteok</i> batter?

550
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,208
It looks too runny.

551
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,776
Did you use too much water?

552
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,077
Will she mix it with something?

553
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,480
-Starch?
-Starch? She probably needs starch.

554
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,316
MORE OATMEAL

555
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,651
She failed to use
the right amount of water.

556
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,020
She's adding some more oatmeal.

557
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,889
She owns up to her mistake right away.

558
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,991
I don't think even that's enough.

559
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,292
-It's still too runny.
-It's because

560
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,164
it takes time for oatmeal
to become starchy when it soaks in water.

561
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,600
It won't become thick
when she grinds it right away.

562
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,734
It needs time.

563
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:26,171
-Chef Eun-yeong.
-It won't get thicker now.

564
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,141
Poong is giving a lesson to Eun-yeong.

565
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,208
Leave it for a while.

566
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,277
-It'll take some time.
-I'm not sure if he's right.

567
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,679
-Add some more oatmeal.
-Poong has more stars, though.

568
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,248
-Yes.
-Right.

569
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,183
NAM-NO MAKES VEGETABLE BROTH

570
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,152
1. BOIL ONION, GREEN ONION,
CHEONGYANG PEPPER, AND GARLIC

571
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,920
It does look healthy.

572
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,589
AND HE ADDS SOMETHING

573
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,857
What's that?

574
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,427
-What's he making?
-A broth tablet?

575
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,995
HIS DOPPELGÄNGER NOTICES HIM

576
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,463
How many did he put in?

577
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,532
The time…

578
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,434
Right away?

579
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,935
-You're doing it now?
-Right away?

580
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,570
It'll probably need more time.

581
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,605
-It looks like a mini crêpe.
-Yes.

582
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,542
-It looks like crêpe.
-Like how she'd make crêpe.

583
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,911
Chef Eun-yeong has a plan too.

584
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,346
I've done something similar before,

585
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,714
and it turns into something

586
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,585
similar to pita as it blows up a little,
although not as high as rice puffs.

587
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,821
-Like a hollowed bread?
-Yes.

588
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,423
-Hollowed bread, no?
-Hollowed cake.

589
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,826
-Hollowed… Hollowed-out cake.
-Hollowed-out bread?

590
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,094
-Hollowed-out bread.
-Like hollowed-out cake?

591
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,097
-But she has to leave it for a while.
-She does?

592
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,166
It takes a long time to cook this,

593
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,202
so I have no time to soak it.

594
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,803
-It'll take a while to cook.
-She has no time.

595
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,871
It'll take a while.

596
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,473
It looks like a pancake.

597
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,575
I'll make the sauce first.

598
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,410
2. MIX CHOGOCHUJANG AND SRIRACHA
TO MAKE SHABU-SHABU SAUCE

599
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,779
They're both moving fast.
The dishes must be healthy.

600
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,482
Bo-hyun has his eyes on both of them.

601
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,251
Chef Nam-no keeps making something.

602
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,286
-He's making the sauces.
-Are those sauces?

603
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,554
He makes the sauces first.

604
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,056
Sauces are important.

605
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,059
He's making the sauces.
He used ginger and soy sauce.

606
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,096
1. MAKE MEATBALL BY GRINDING
TENDERLOIN AND EGGS

607
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,465
-Is that meat?
-Yes, it's tenderloin.

608
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,735
-Tenderloin.
-Tenderloin. That's the protein.

609
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,370
Why are you using just the yolk?

610
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:10,408
It's to make the meatball softer.
Chinese meatballs are better when soft.

611
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,945
ADDING GREEN ONION
INTO THE MEATBALL

612
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,781
-It must've been too thick.
-More eggs.

613
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:21,119
I'm trying to make it softer
by kneading it in.

614
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,222
She's kneading it
and letting the meat soak up the eggs.

615
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,091
MEATBALL MIXTURE, READY TO GO

616
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,460
Duck breast.

617
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,563
-The duck. Duck breast.
-Is that the duck? It's the duck.

618
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,533
Nam-no is removing the fat.

619
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,934
Are you using the fat too?

620
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,569
Yes, I need to make duck oil.

621
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,404
He said he'd make sauce with the fat.

622
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,274
-He's removing the skin.
-Look how powerful he is.

623
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,341
STONE FOREARMS

624
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,409
He rips it off the meat.

625
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,711
Someone save the duck.

626
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,246
Look at Nam-no go.

627
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,915
The duck skin.

628
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,216
4. GRILL DUCK SKIN AND MAKE OIL

629
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,617
He's cooking just the skin.

630
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:56,388
-What's he doing now?
-He's removing the silverskin

631
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,123
and slicing the meat thin.

632
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,591
He's slicing it thin.

633
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,960
-For shabu-shabu.
-Right. Shabu-shabu.

634
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,063
He said he'd make duck shabu-shabu.

635
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,701
-He's making cuts too.
-Right.

636
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,770
There are the cuts.

637
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,939
It looks fresh enough to eat raw.

638
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,474
Nam-no's knife skills are extraordinary.

639
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,946
-He'll serve it like that for shabu-shabu.
-I guess so.

640
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,547
It won't be a finished dish.

641
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,016
The grease is burning.

642
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,485
-The duck grease is burning.
-What?

643
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,688
-Just let it burn!
-The duck grease is burning.

644
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,656
-Is that okay, Nam-no?
-She's so tough.

645
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,492
Whoa, it looks pretty burnt.

646
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,262
-Why won't you tell me?
-Just let it burn.

647
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,964
Tell me when you see it.

648
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,265
I hope yours gets burnt too.

649
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,100
THIS BIG GUY
ISN'T AS TOUGH AS HER

650
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,802
Mine won't burn.

651
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,403
THE VIGOR OF THE TOUGH GIRL

652
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,138
She's calm.

653
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,142
-She's cooking the Chinese meatballs.
-She's different.

654
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:55,146
The shape will look perfect
if she pushes them down as she flips them.

655
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,482
Is it okay to use oil to make a dish
to keep him in shape?

656
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,084
Fat is a part of the three.

657
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,920
He needs all three,
carbs, protein, and fat,

658
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,788
-to help him get bigger.
-I see.

659
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,491
So that's how you make Chinese meatballs.

660
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,859
MAKING THE FINAL SAUCE

661
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,694
5. MIX EGG YOLKS, MUSTARD,
MINCED GARLIC,

662
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,962
MINCED GINGER, WASABI,
AND DUCK OIL

663
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,131
Nam-no is focused on the sauce.

664
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,799
What's this sauce?

665
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:18,370
-I'm going to mix egg yolks and duck fat.
-I see.

666
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,872
We often use cooking oil
to make mayonnaise.

667
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,207
I cooked these lightly.

668
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,844
-He's using duck oil instead of that.
-He's using duck oil instead.

669
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,013
It's to help him stay in shape.

670
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,650
-He's using duck fat.
-And it'll sterilize the egg yolk too.

671
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,654
He said he'd put
a lot of work into the sauces.

672
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,356
There's not enough time.

673
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,394
-It looks good.
-That came out nicely.

674
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,561
Is that the oatmeal thing?

675
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,797
-The oatmeal cake.
-The oatmeal.

676
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,699
She only used oatmeal and water.

677
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,200
That's a wonder.

678
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,802
It came out like bread.

679
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,637
-You can probably make that.
-I probably can.

680
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,206
-Gosh.
-It'll rise over time.

681
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,176
-So she'll put the meatballs in there?
-I think so.

682
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,279
-That sounds good.
-I see. I finally get it.

683
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,449
-It's like a hollowed-out pancake.
-It is.

684
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,619
You're about halfway done.

685
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,423
6. ADD COOKING WINE
AND SOY SAUCE INTO A POT

686
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,758
-What? Seven minutes?
-Seven minutes.

687
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,828
-Whoa. Careful.
-Don't get so worked up.

688
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,263
Nam-no became worked up.

689
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,998
Your time is halfway done.

690
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,168
Nam-no has to make two dishes.

691
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,303
He keeps pouring something.

692
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,640
That vegetable broth contains lots of MSG
just like the one

693
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,775
-Poong had previously made.
-I see!

694
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,044
I saw him throw in eight broth tablets.

695
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,346
That'll be delicious. Indeed.

696
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,048
-He's making veggie broth, right?
-Yes.

697
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,349
Pretending to be veggie broth.

698
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,851
Why did you tell everyone that?

699
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,520
Nam-no just exposed Nam-no.

700
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,322
Only I noticed it.

701
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,491
When Sung-jun looks that way,

702
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,960
-it looks like Nam-no staring at Nam-no.
-It does.

703
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,462
I'll also eat a lot in this episode.

704
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,666
Look at the way he chops.

705
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,035
BOIL ONION, GREEN ONION,
BUTTON MUSHROOM,

706
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,471
AND KING OYSTER MUSHROOM
IN THE BROTH

707
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,240
That must be the shabu-shabu base.

708
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,908
MAKING STIR-FRIED VEGETABLES
TO STUFF THE HOTTEOK WITH

709
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,877
2. COOK MINCED GARLIC,
BUTTON MUSHROOM,

710
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,846
ONION, TOMATO SAUCE,
AND SRIRACHA IN A PAN

711
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,014
-Please don't make it too spicy.
-I won't.

712
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,550
Bo-hyun isn't good with spicy food.

713
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,921
The meatballs are about to burn.
The heat is too high.

714
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,289
They almost got burnt.

715
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,126
Eun-yeong is in a rush.

716
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,660
Aren't the meatballs too burnt?

717
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,462
They aren't burnt yet.

718
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,298
-The meatballs almost got burnt.
-They look great.

719
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,000
3. BOIL MINCED GARLIC,
GREEN ONION,

720
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,668
SOY SAUCE, AND WATER
IN AN OILED PAN

721
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,838
She's burning the soy sauce a little

722
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,240
before adding water.

723
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,542
-Hey, the meatballs.
-It must be the sauce.

724
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,944
-Did she just throw it in?
-She added sugar.

725
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,546
-Sugar?
-What?

726
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,915
-I used only a bit of sugar.
-Only a bit?

727
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,483
-She had to use a little.
-She did.

728
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,385
-We need some sugar too.
-Of course.

729
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,287
Six minutes.

730
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,189
-Look.
-It's burnt!

731
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,857
BLACKENED

732
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,426
-It's burnt!
-No!

733
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,462
It's burnt!

734
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,264
-It should've risen.
-Isn't that burnt?

735
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,366
-It should've risen by now.
-It looks quite burnt.

736
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,134
It's a little burnt.

737
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,736
You have only five minutes or so.

738
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,771
Carbs, <i>tan</i>, also sounds like burnt.

739
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,706
-Was that why?
-It's burnt.

740
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,009
If that were the case,
she made the right move.

741
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,411
I see. So that was the order.
Burnt protein and fat.

742
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,881
Yes, right. Eun-yeong looks flustered.

743
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,049
-Oh, no.
-Jeez.

744
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,617
The oatmeal bun is burnt.

745
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,520
It must be quite burnt.
She looks rather flustered.

746
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,355
SIGH

747
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,124
THE NOT-SO-TOUGH GUY
ALWAYS LOOKS FLUSTERED

748
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,725
The whole wheat pasta.

749
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,395
-That'll turn into pasta.
-Yes.

750
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,698
He's using whole wheat pasta
to make the cold pasta.

751
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,534
CHECKING THE NOODLES
BY TASTING SOME(?)

752
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,769
You have five minutes left!

753
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,572
Jung-hwan, please go out to the kitchen
for the interim check.

754
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,340
You have five minutes left!

755
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,143
Jung-hwan, please go out to the kitchen
for the interim check.

756
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,611
Let me check
your carbs, protein, and fat dish.

757
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,780
-The carbs, protein, and fat dish.
-What?

758
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,417
You can't force it to open. Is it working?

759
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,019
-Check the oatmeal bun, Jung-hwan.
-The oatmeal.

760
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,187
-It looks serious.
-The oatmeal.

761
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,657
She needs to make a pocket
in the middle of the bread.

762
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,526
It did separate, though.

763
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,195
-Was it ripped?
-It did separate, though.

764
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,030
No, wait!

765
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,599
THEY CAN SENSE A DISASTER

766
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,834
-It's ripped.
-It's an emergency.

767
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,204
-It's ripped.
-It's an emergency.

768
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,506
-Things are chaotic!
-Oh, no. Eun-yeong!

769
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,108
-Don't give up!
-It's separated and ripped.

770
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,210
-Cook it lightly over low heat.
-Don't give up.

771
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,311
What will she do now?

772
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,280
Please don't let your hands tremble.

773
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,183
She's forcing it open right now.

774
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,486
-She managed to put it in.
-Eun-yeong's hands are shaking!

775
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,687
Her hands are quite shaky.

776
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,190
-Everything is ripped.
-It's all right.

777
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,325
-She gets more oatmeal.
-What's that?

778
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,526
You're sticking it in there?

779
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,061
-What's that?
-You're sticking it in there?

780
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,129
It's oatmeal.

781
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,530
Her hands are trembling violently.

782
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,099
What do I do now?

783
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,400
OH, NO

784
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,369
She can't get it to stand still.

785
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,472
-Eun-yeong, what now?
-She faces a difficult moment.

786
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,441
Aren't you two too harsh on her?

787
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,943
You're too harsh on her.

788
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,412
SHE MAKES A FINAL ATTEMPT
WITH THE OTHER HALF

789
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:55,980
CUTTING CAREFULLY

790
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,483
Jung-hwan, anything you can taste?

791
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,287
-The other half failed again. It just…
-What is that?

792
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,422
-What is that?
-What is that?

793
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,392
-It got stuck.
-It got stuck! It's a mess!

794
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,127
-Jeez.
-It's a disaster.

795
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,595
It's a disaster.

796
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,531
-Oh, no.
-How will she overcome this?

797
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,266
-I can't save that.
-That's not <i>hotteok</i>, then.

798
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,168
Why can't she save the oatmeal pancake?

799
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,638
She's trying to warm it up
in an attempt to save it.

800
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,473
This is my biggest crisis yet.

801
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,809
8. MIX OLIVE OIL, SOY SAUCE,

802
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,979
TRUFFLE OIL, COOKING WINE,
AND SESAME OIL

803
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,214
Nam-no!

804
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,117
Nam-no is
quietly pouring in lots of sugar!

805
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,687
-Did you catch that?
-Yes, I totally did.

806
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,021
It's just carbs, protein, and fat.

807
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,023
9. MIX TRUFFLE DRESSING
AND WHOLE WHEAT PASTA

808
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,625
At least it'll taste good.

809
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,926
You have three minutes!

810
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,596
-I'll taste Chef Nam-no's soup.
-Can you do that?

811
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,265
-This is for shabu-shabu, right?
-Yes.

812
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,833
The shabu-shabu soup.

813
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,671
Is he truly the Cooking Maniac?

814
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:57,308
-It's a bit too salty.
-Oh, no.

815
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,245
It can make your teeth tingle
just as an apple does.

816
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,081
-I'll brush my teeth.
-It can happen.

817
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,949
-But it's good.
-Is it?

818
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,751
Is it salty
because he has to cook duck in it?

819
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,921
That might be the case.
But it's too salty for my taste.

820
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,590
You said it's too salty,
but that must be intentional.

821
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,226
-This side is the problem.
-Did Eun-yeong save her dish?

822
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,729
-Eun-yeong.
-I'm patching it up.

823
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,797
I couldn't put it inside,
so I'm stacking these.

824
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,300
-She decided to stack these.
-Two minutes left.

825
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,003
-She decided to stack these.
-Two minutes left.

826
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,905
How will Eun-yeong
overcome this difficulty?

827
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,208
Nam-no seems relaxed.

828
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,610
-Nam-no.
-Nam-no!

829
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,813
-He's chopping almonds.
-Almonds.

830
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,083
-Almonds are a good kind of fat.
-Roasted almonds.

831
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,454
This side is the problem. Will it work?
She's chopping cabbage now.

832
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,423
I wanted to use pickles,

833
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,493
so I'm using Bo-hyun's delicious kimchi.

834
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,695
Eun-yeong said
she'd make <i>hotteok</i> that's just his type.

835
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,731
But she's made a fool of yourself.

836
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,234
-This is my biggest crisis.
-Poong had a point back there.

837
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,502
-Right?
-Yes.

838
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,004
-He kept saying it wouldn't rise.
-I did.

839
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,040
-What now?
-One minute.

840
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,674
No, please.

841
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,910
-What now?
-You have under a minute!

842
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,913
-Nam-no, you have a minute left!
-One minute!

843
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,548
Hurry up!

844
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,517
You have under a minute left!

845
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,118
You have 56 seconds.

846
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,020
She got cheese.

847
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,588
BEGINS TO GRATE CHEESE

848
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,391
She should've made <i>hotteok.</i>

849
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,926
It should've become <i>hotteok.</i>

850
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,896
-She's covering everything.
-It doesn't look like <i>hotteok.</i>

851
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,063
She's hiding the <i>hotteok.</i>

852
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,899
It's an open <i>hotteok.</i>

853
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,536
He's adding green onion.

854
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,404
It was called My Type of <i>Hotteok,</i>

855
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,072
-but it's not <i>hotteok.</i>
-She's covering it.

856
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,675
It's definitely not <i>hotteok.</i>

857
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,110
If you eat it together, it's <i>hotteok.</i>

858
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,012
Well, if he eats it together,
I guess it is.

859
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,383
The oil. Truffle oil.

860
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,451
The oil.

861
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,553
THE SIGHING DOESN'T STOP

862
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,988
He's adding green onion.

863
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,790
Chef Eun-yeong finishes first.

864
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,460
Eun-yeong finishes after twists and turns.
There are 20 seconds left.

865
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,795
-Twenty seconds.
-That's amazing.

866
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,697
NAM-NO REMAINS ALONE

867
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,432
ADDING GREEN ONION
TO SHABU-SHABU

868
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,067
Are you done, Nam-no?

869
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,969
-He is.
-He's done.

870
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,538
NAM-NO FINISHES COOKING STONE

871
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,475
-I've never seen her so flustered.
-I really was.

872
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,510
-What now, Eun-yeong?
-She's supposed to be tough.

873
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,279
It's not My Type of <i>Hotteok,</i>
but Ripped <i>Hotteok.</i>

874
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:19,016
-Ripped <i>Hotteok.</i>
-Poong had a point.

875
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,854
-Some <i>hotteok</i> end up popped, so it's okay.
-True.

876
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,758
Both dishes were finished
just for Bo-hyun.

877
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,529
One side looks very abundant,

878
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,332
whereas the other side seems very simple.

879
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,168
-Why did you make so much food?
-What?

880
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,036
That's how much I usually eat.

881
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:43,541
-Chef Eun-yeong finished first, right?
-Yes.

882
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,710
But your expression…

883
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,778
You don't look so well. What do we do?

884
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,615
I feel like
I've been to my worst nightmare.

885
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:54,285
I wanted to serve the <i>hotteok</i>
with nice filling on the inside,

886
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,087
but it didn't rise.

887
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,156
I had no choice but to stack everything.

888
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,091
Here's one thing I want to say.

889
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,394
Please don't forget that
you're trying to stay in shape.

890
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:05,897
What is she saying?

891
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,533
She's telling him not to eat too much.

892
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,068
It's better not to eat too much, right?

893
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,138
The first dish is by Chef Eun-yeong.

894
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,073
<i>It's called My Type of</i> Hotteok.

895
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,979
OATMEAL HOTTEOK
TOPPED WITH CHINESE MEATBALLS

896
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,917
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
MY TYPE OF HOTTEOK

897
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,818
Should I cut it up?

898
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,321
-Yes, cut it up and have it in a bite.
-Okay.

899
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,389
Everything is outside,

900
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,990
but imagine that everything is inside.

901
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,325
It's the same once you eat it.

902
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:38,029
How is he supposed to imagine
what's outside is actually inside?

903
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,264
-It's the same once you eat it.
-She's gaslighting him.

904
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,134
You can't try to control the guest's mind.

905
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,070
Imagine that the <i>hotteok </i>is inside out.

906
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,273
-Is this reversed <i>hotteok?</i>
-Reversed <i>hotteok.</i>

907
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,741
-Just say it's reversed.
-Yes.

908
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,877
It looks good, though.

909
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,745
It's cooked well all the way.

910
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,380
My Type of <i>Hotteok.</i>

911
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,650
Carbs, protein, and fat.

912
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,821
He wanted a delicious dish
full of carbs, protein, and fat.

913
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,357
It's very hard for him
to stay on a strict diet.

914
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,026
-I had lots of oatmeal in my fridge.
-Yes.

915
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,963
I was shocked that oatmeal can be used
to make bread-like texture.

916
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,365
I see. That's the first impression.

917
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,667
I also saw that

918
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,770
-you only used oatmeal and water, right?
-You're right.

919
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,608
She ground those to make this,
and it has a texture like bread.

920
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,376
It doesn't feel like a strict diet.

921
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,378
-It doesn't feel like it.
-But just a regular dish?

922
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,847
You said you often had oatmeal,

923
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,582
so you could just toast it like this.

924
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,851
It brings out a different texture.

925
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,287
Chef Eun-yeong,
is this easy to make at home?

926
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,789
It's hard, so I failed.

927
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,359
It is hard.

928
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,994
-It would've been good if she didn't fail.
-Right?

929
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,863
It would've been great if she succeeded.

930
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,599
But I'm imagining that
everything is inside.

931
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,134
Is that how you're eating it?

932
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,270
That's how I'm eating it.

933
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,538
What are those reddish fillings?

934
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,141
I mixed sriracha and tomato sauce

935
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,176
<i>and made a vegetable stir-fry.</i>

936
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,345
It's made with tomato,
so it's not too spicy.

937
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,948
It tastes delicious
with the right amount of sriracha.

938
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:08,185
I have a feeling that
your forehead is starting to sweat a bit.

939
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,089
-It happens when I see something red.
-That's uncanny.

940
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,959
-It happens when I see red food.
-That's why.

941
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,495
-But it's not spicy.
-It was true.

942
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,929
-I see.
-That's a wonder.

943
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,698
But he keeps going back.

944
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,566
HE CONTINUES TO EAT MORE

945
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,637
-That's a wonder.
-The meatballs were

946
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,573
also cooked perfectly,
and I love the texture.

947
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,077
It looked burnt before,
but it doesn't taste like it at all.

948
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,012
-Does it smell burnt?
-Not at all.

949
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,749
I see. Next up, Chef Nam-no's dish.

950
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,885
<i>Cooking Stone.</i>

951
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:46,524
3 DIFFERENT SAUCES TO PICK
AND CHOOSE FROM

952
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,963
DUCK AND WHOLE WHEAT PASTA
TO MAKE HIS BODY HARD AS STONE

953
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,667
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S COOKING STONE

954
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,269
Is this really for his diet?

955
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,970
-It's a full table.
-It is.

956
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,339
He has three different sauces.

957
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,642
Dip the meat in the soup
like you're eating shabu-shabu

958
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,811
and dip it in the sauce you like.

959
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,045
-Gosh.
-Whatever you want.

960
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,113
Duck shabu-shabu.

961
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,283
And he even made some cuts here.

962
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,551
It looks delicious.

963
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,586
Fifteen seconds should be enough.

964
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:20,591
He pulled the fat off
and made cuts on the meat.

965
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,659
It looks good.

966
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,261
-There's beauty in waiting.
-Yes, right.

967
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,263
-Try the soup first.
-The soup?

968
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,666
Yes, please try the soup first.

969
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,702
-It was a bit too salty for me.
-Was it?

970
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,873
He would've sweated a lot
if the soup were red.

971
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,941
It looks so good.

972
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,443
-That's so uncanny. He's not sweating now.
-No.

973
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,611
That's odd.

974
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,150
It's the kind of broth I like.

975
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,820
-I can eat this both cold and hot.
-Vegetable broth.

976
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,322
-The vegetable broth.
-He's not sweating.

977
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,957
Vegetable broth is important.

978
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,325
You're right.

979
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,061
-He's checking on the meat.
-It looks ready.

980
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,397
First, dip it lightly in the ponzu sauce,

981
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,434
the one that looks like soy sauce.

982
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,272
INTO HIS MOUTH

983
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,141
Bo-hyun is on a strict diet.

984
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,309
Duck shabu-shabu.

985
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,813
It's my first time
trying duck shabu-shabu.

986
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,784
I thought it might smell a bit gamey,

987
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,519
but it doesn't smell at all.

988
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,654
But duck meat usually smells.

989
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,756
It tastes healthy.

990
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,558
The meat itself. The meat.

991
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,195
It's not as tough as chicken breast,
so I like the texture.

992
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,733
Also, the sauce brings out
much more flavor in the meat.

993
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,935
Next, please try
the king oyster mushroom, duck,

994
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,770
and dip it in the egg yolk.

995
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,505
He grabs a piece of king oyster mushroom.

996
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,975
-The egg yolk sauce.
-Yes.

997
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,410
That sauce looks good.

998
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,478
It looks good.

999
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,381
-It looks so good.
-Does it taste delicious?

1000
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,615
He served three sauces.

1001
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:55,219
-It'd be great if he likes one of them.
-That's right.

1002
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,254
This is the one.

1003
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,025
The egg yolk sauce looked good.

1004
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,227
It tastes rustic.

1005
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,497
This is just what I like.

1006
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,065
What's in the sauce?

1007
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,267
Egg yolk and duck grease.

1008
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,603
<i>-He made the duck grease before.</i>
<i>-That one?</i>

1009
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,004
<i>Just those two?</i>

1010
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,841
<i>-Didn't you add mustard and wasabi?</i>
<i>-Yes, Dijon mustard.</i>

1011
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,309
ANOTHER BITE
OF HIS FAVORITE SAUCE

1012
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,778
-What's the last sauce?
-<i>Chogochujang </i>and sriracha.

1013
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,580
<i>Chogochujang</i> and sriracha.

1014
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,582
-Cho-Sri.
-Cho-Sri.

1015
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,421
It's really tough for him
to eat just the chicken breast.

1016
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,858
He did mention
the other sauce was his favorite, but…

1017
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,694
-It's quite strong.
-Is it?

1018
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,462
I like <i>chogochujang,</i>

1019
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:42,199
but I've never had it with duck.

1020
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,869
-It's delicious.
-Is it?

1021
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,938
It was the one in the door bin, right?
He must've used that.

1022
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,673
There's one more dish.

1023
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,841
The cold pasta.

1024
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:54,211
Lastly, try the pasta
like you're having <i>naengmyeon</i> for dessert.

1025
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,614
Did he bring out
the flavor of whole wheat pasta?

1026
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,217
It reminds me of perilla oil noodles.

1027
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,553
Does it taste good?

1028
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,759
Look at him. He's enjoying the dish.

1029
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,729
-What does that smile mean?
-He's smiling.

1030
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,097
Is it because it's bad?

1031
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,565
No, it looks good.

1032
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,033
What was this dressing again?

1033
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,804
I mixed soy sauce, vinegar,
and truffle oil.

1034
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,040
-Is it okay?
-I like this flavor.

1035
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,175
That must be better than the shabu-shabu.

1036
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,645
It kick-starts my appetite.

1037
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,481
I mentioned before
that I really like vinegar,

1038
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,449
-and this tastes very clean.
-I see.

1039
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,852
-That's why it's a perfect refreshment.
-That's great.

1040
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,488
Try some shabu-shabu, Yoona.

1041
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,957
I really like shabu-shabu too.

1042
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:41,926
Did it disappear?

1043
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,561
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

1044
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,262
There it is.

1045
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,265
The egg yolk sauce.

1046
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,201
YUM

1047
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,904
She's trying a bite.

1048
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,175
It's very tender.

1049
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,810
-Is it? Is it not tough?
-Yes.

1050
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,779
It's not tough at all.

1051
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,648
It doesn't smell bad at all.

1052
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,617
-I see.
-It tastes very light.

1053
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,652
-It's good.
-Now, as we speak,

1054
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,488
Chef Eun-yeong finished making her dish
for us to taste.

1055
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:15,759
-This one?
-This was what she wanted to do.

1056
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,028
This is yours, Yoona.

1057
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,531
This one looks much prettier.

1058
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,567
-This is for Yoona.
-It's just for her to taste.

1059
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,269
Really?

1060
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,738
-Shouldn't we get a shot of this?
-An insert shot?

1061
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,840
-You should.
-Isn't this the right shot?

1062
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,675
This was what she wanted to do.

1063
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,244
-Do you want me to take a picture?
-Please do.

1064
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,846
He asked me to take a picture.

1065
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,482
Everything should've been in the pocket.

1066
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,352
But it was ripped back there.

1067
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,520
And it's…

1068
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,588
PRYING

1069
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,224
Bo-hyun looks jealous.

1070
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,493
You should take a look at it.

1071
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,664
He didn't get to try that, although it was
made with food from his fridge.

1072
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,600
Imagine that was what you had.

1073
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,502
Do I have to grab it?

1074
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,372
-You can eat it like a burger.
-Like <i>hotteok.</i>

1075
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,042
This was what she wanted to do.

1076
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,343
It looks great.

1077
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,580
It's like a half-cut <i>hotteok.</i>

1078
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,715
Yes, so…

1079
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,417
A BIG BITE

1080
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,221
Something popped out.
Something's in there.

1081
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,455
Onion.

1082
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,491
It's the same vegetable stir-fry.

1083
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,558
Vegetable <i>hotteok.</i>

1084
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,893
She responded differently.

1085
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,163
The texture is amazing. The oatmeal…

1086
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,534
-It just melts in your mouth.
-Did it?

1087
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,269
While I chew on other fillings,

1088
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,905
the oatmeal bread is

1089
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,307
-already gone.
-You're right.

1090
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,842
If she served it like that,

1091
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,111
you might not have sweated.

1092
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:45,349
-He wouldn't have seen the red.
-Yes, everything was hidden.

1093
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,185
ANOTHER BIG BITE

1094
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,887
-It looks like <i>hotteok.</i>
-It does.

1095
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,655
It really looks like <i>hotteok.</i>

1096
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,658
I feel bad for eating
the actual completed dish.

1097
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,761
-I feel bad.
-It can't be helped.

1098
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:00,731
Now, it's the moment of truth.

1099
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:05,235
Which dish did you like better?

1100
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,337
<i>Press one for Yoon Nam-no</i>

1101
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,273
<i>and two for Park Eun-yeong.</i>

1102
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,309
Make your decision and press the button!

1103
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,746
STARING

1104
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,015
He just looked at this.

1105
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,185
-Did you press it?
-I did.

1106
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:24,822
Let's find out Bo-hyun's choice. Show us!

1107
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,492
Bo-hyun needs carbs, protein, and fat.
The two young guns were in a battle.

1108
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,927
Park Eun-yeong versus Yoon Nam-no.

1109
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,162
Will Nam-no take an easy win?

1110
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,331
Or will there be a twist?

1111
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,800
What's Bo-hyun's choice?

1112
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,136
Who's the winner?

1113
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,705
YOON NAM-NO WINS

1114
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,407
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
COOKING STONE WINS

1115
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,176
It was Nam-no.

1116
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,445
Nam-no won.

1117
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,582
Personally,

1118
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:56,720
I loved how she could make
this fresh dish with oatmeal.

1119
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,289
But Chef Nam-no's dish was fun

1120
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,960
because I got to pick and choose
to eat different ingredients.

1121
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,763
And the cold pasta played a big role.

1122
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,298
-I see.
-If I get another chance,

1123
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,200
I'd love to try the <i>hotteok</i> again.

1124
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,437
And now, the captain of the young guns is

1125
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,472
secured as Yoon Nam-no.

1126
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,208
Why don't you
let Eun-yeong call you Captain?

1127
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,743
Will you do that?

1128
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,046
Great work, Captain.

1129
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,283
-Whoa, that was respectful.
-It was.

1130
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,252
-She's cool about it.
-She accepted her defeat.

1131
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,554
Please put a star on Chef Nam-no!

1132
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,191
-Nam-no takes his fifth victory.
-Congratulations!

1133
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,626
Nam-no's fifth win.

1134
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,693
A HUG

1135
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,433
<i>This is the second cook-off</i>
<i>with ingredients from Bo-hyun's fridge.</i>

1136
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,669
He ordered camping food

1137
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,472
from these two chefs.

1138
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,741
Showoff Chef who only cares about romance,

1139
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,609
Choi Hyun-suk.

1140
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,179
Up against him is Sam Kim,

1141
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:58,682
who only cares
about going into the darkness.

1142
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,818
They're the two elders of the show.

1143
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,653
It's the fight between veterans.

1144
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,822
<i>They're long-standing rivals.</i>

1145
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,990
We called you two rivals

1146
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,894
because you fought 11 times
during the previous season,

1147
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:15,365
<i>and Sam took six wins and five losses.</i>

1148
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,801
-He won.
-You took the lead.

1149
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,938
-That's who Sam is.
-I didn't know.

1150
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,141
In this season,
they fought each other once,

1151
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,009
<i>and Hyun-suk had won.</i>

1152
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,713
So over the entire series,
their score is now six to six.

1153
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,583
-Whoever wins today takes the lead.
-It's a neck-and-neck race.

1154
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,953
However, Chef Hyun-suk is currently

1155
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,721
-leading the show.
-He is.

1156
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,591
-Look at how confident he seems.
-Check out his face.

1157
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,192
How many stars do you have now?

1158
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,927
-My stars?
-Stars.

1159
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,495
I've never counted them. Let me try.

1160
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,231
HE BLUFFS BY COUNTING THEM NOW

1161
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,132
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1162
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,169
Right. The big star stands for five wins.

1163
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,503
-I have ten.
-Ten stars.

1164
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,172
HE DOES HAVE A LOT

1165
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:59,977
Sam returned from Italy yesterday,
so he's drained right now.

1166
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,612
Which area did you visit?

1167
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:05,816
-I went to five different regions.
-Five regions?

1168
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,951
-He even went to my former town.
-He did?

1169
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,152
Do you know what he said?

1170
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,788
"I don't think you should return."

1171
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,024
-How can you say that?
-It's been a while.

1172
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,592
They still remember you?

1173
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,129
-Jung-hwan's goal against Italy?
-He told me that.

1174
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,132
I went to study olive oil in Umbria,

1175
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,902
and I said, "There was
this soccer player who used to…"

1176
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,037
The moment I began,

1177
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,407
-they already said, "Ahn?"
-"Ahn!"

1178
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,042
-They all know you.
-They do?

1179
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,746
So as soon as I saw him, I said,
"You shouldn't go back."

1180
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,649
-He shouldn't.
-They still remember him.

1181
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,385
Why do you think he went to Italy?

1182
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,452
-To learn.
-Yes.

1183
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,788
He took Poong down last week,

1184
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,924
and he's after Hyun-suk now.

1185
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,626
That's why he went abroad
to study urgently.

1186
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,028
You're right.

1187
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,998
In this round,
they'll have to make camping food,

1188
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,768
so they can't use
the microwave or the oven.

1189
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,169
No, they aren't around.

1190
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,205
But you can use charcoal.

1191
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,007
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
FROZEN FRIED RICE,

1192
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,075
KONJAC BREAD,
BUTTON MUSHROOM, CREAM

1193
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,143
CHODANG CORN, LEMON JUICE,
GREEK YOGURT,

1194
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,210
LAMB CHOP, BLUEBERRIES,
MUSTARD, AND MORE

1195
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:11,715
I prepared a dish
called Fetch Me the Star, Lamb.

1196
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,483
-Fetch Me the Star, Lamb.
-Fetch Me the Star, Lamb.

1197
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,687
-It's a lamb dish.
-The lamb chop.

1198
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,423
I'll cook lamb chops using two methods.

1199
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,492
I plan to make one stew-like dish,

1200
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,128
and as for the other one,
I'll stick it in oil,

1201
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:28,298
raise the temperature,
and then cook it over charcoal.

1202
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,967
I'll also make a salad

1203
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,136
with dressing made
with Chodang corn and onion

1204
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,304
to serve in the middle.

1205
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,007
I thought you could use something sweet,

1206
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,777
so I'll heat up blueberries
and serve them like sauce

1207
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,679
mixed with Greek yogurt.

1208
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,648
-In 15 minutes?
-That's a lot.

1209
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,450
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS:

1210
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,517
PARMESAN, LEMON JUICE,
WASABI, POTATO CHIPS

1211
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,585
APPLE-STRAWBERRY
FLAVORED POPSICLE,

1212
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,653
KONJAC BREAD, CREAM, LAMB CHOPS

1213
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,356
-My dish is called…
-Yes?

1214
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,191
…The Sheep-tar Is Mine.

1215
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,560
-The Sheep-tar?
-The Sheep-tar Is Mine.

1216
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,729
-The Sheep-tar?
-Are you using lamb too?

1217
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,832
I'll prepare lamb chops

1218
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,536
with all kinds of garnishes.

1219
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,739
I'll also use one of my secret recipes

1220
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,540
to make mashed potato.

1221
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:13,176
Instead of creamed spinach,
I'll make creamed green onion.

1222
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,747
Also, I'll make glazed onion salad.

1223
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,216
Also, you mentioned before

1224
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,518
that you wanted to look cool
while cooking.

1225
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,821
I'll also offer tips
on looking cool while camping.

1226
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,125
He didn't miss that.

1227
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,627
Most importantly,

1228
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,229
the five-minute interim check

1229
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:36,033
will be conducted by Yoona today.

1230
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:40,237
The second round is
full of many things to look forward to.

1231
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,640
-Yes.
-Then let us begin the cook-off.

1232
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,977
A man who set out a long-term pitch
on the top of the show,

1233
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,845
Chef Choi Hyun-suk is up.

1234
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:52,416
Up against him is Chef Sam Kim,
who'll take Hyun-suk down

1235
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,951
and stare at his star through the night.

1236
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:58,488
Which one of them will become
the king of camping here on the show?

1237
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,158
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1238
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,660
Begin!

1239
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,364
The two old rivals are
up against each other again.

1240
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,300
Many eyes are on this round.

1241
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,436
He's removing meat from the bones.

1242
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,938
-It must be for the stew.
-You're right.

1243
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,008
-Is that starch?
-Flour.

1244
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,711
He begins by working on the lamb.

1245
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,581
-They're both using lamb?
-Yes, they are.

1246
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,583
HYUN-SUK STARTS
WITH GARLIC CLOVES!

1247
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,954
-He puts garlic on lamb chops.
-Garlic.

1248
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,022
Whoa.

1249
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,791
When you pour oil,
don't just do it like this.

1250
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,026
SHOWOFF LESSON 1:
OIL AT A DISTANCE

1251
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,228
-I see.
-Raise the bottle.

1252
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,996
-Is it okay to spill some?
-Yes.

1253
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,666
-It's a camping ground anyway.
-It'll drop on the ground.

1254
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,502
-Yes, it's the ground.
-That's it.

1255
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,570
Onion.

1256
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,738
They're chopping onion the same way.

1257
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,007
-The shapes.
-You're right.

1258
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,910
You have to cut it into that shape
to make it easy to eat.

1259
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:57,781
The side dishes taste great while camping
before you eat the main dish.

1260
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,917
-Three minutes.
-Look at him pouring the oil.

1261
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,953
-Like this.
-The best habit you can catch is

1262
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,922
oiling your grill before you use it.

1263
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,657
You're oiling the grill.

1264
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,862
I am. And the middle of the grill is
usually the highest in heat.

1265
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,864
So keep your veggies outside

1266
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,866
and put the meat on the inside.

1267
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,635
I get it. There are proper positions.

1268
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,670
-He needs to make the grill pattern.
-Yes.

1269
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,405
Think of this as having fun

1270
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,773
and use salt like this.

1271
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,910
Put your biceps right next to your ear.

1272
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,912
It's not this. Next to your ear.

1273
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,480
And then, sprinkle.

1274
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,416
SHOWOFF LESSON 2: BICEPS
NEXT TO YOUR EAR WHEN SALTING

1275
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,152
Yes, next to his ear. Good.

1276
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,554
-Do it like this, Bo-hyun.
-My biceps.

1277
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,856
-It's not easy.
-Right next to your ear.

1278
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,525
Do it like this as you rebound.

1279
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,127
Put it next to your ear
and throw the salt in.

1280
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,462
It's cool when Bo-hyun does it.

1281
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,098
-He never teaches anyone this.
-It's his best move.

1282
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,000
WATCH ME, STUDENT!

1283
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,067
That's it!

1284
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,103
ACTION!

1285
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,237
SHOCKED

1286
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,407
CAN'T HELP BUT CLAP
AT HIS LESSON

1287
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,910
He doesn't just sprinkle it from the top.

1288
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,479
He starts from the side, and swish!

1289
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,947
They do land on the meat, right?

1290
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,449
We're suspicious of that too.

1291
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,984
But they look pretty good.

1292
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,886
-The meat isn't as salty as you expect.
-No.

1293
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,821
It tastes light.

1294
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,958
When Chef Hyun-suk is done,
it feels like I'm in a sea of salt.

1295
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,026
-Really?
-It's the floor.

1296
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,428
He's focused on doing his thing.

1297
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,630
-It feels like I'm at sea.
-Sure.

1298
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:22,766
CLANK

1299
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,336
He's using blueberries like that?

1300
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:30,006
-Are you cooking blueberries?
-He's adding sugar to make the sauce.

1301
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,808
It'll look cool
if you do that while camping.

1302
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,879
Sam sprinkles oil everywhere.

1303
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,447
Chodang corn.

1304
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,717
-You'll grill the corn over the fire?
-Yes, the corn.

1305
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,252
It feels like we're really camping.

1306
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,254
It's nice to see something
cooked over charcoal.

1307
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,056
I knew it.

1308
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,157
-Yes.
-Butter.

1309
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,159
-That looks good.
-He's using butter.

1310
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,794
That has to be delicious.

1311
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,464
You need to serve that now
as the appetizer.

1312
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:58,501
It feels like we're at a camping ground
with smoke rising.

1313
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,906
-He's leaving it in like that.
-The side dishes play a big role too.

1314
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,041
You're watching these top chefs.

1315
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,110
Hyun-suk is chopping now.

1316
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,945
This is a part of the performance.

1317
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,046
CHOPPING LOTS OF GREEN ONION

1318
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,448
AND INTO THE PAN!

1319
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,849
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER?

1320
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,352
BICEPS GO NEXT TO YOUR EAR!

1321
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,220
-Hey!
-It's that again.

1322
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,588
Remember that.

1323
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:22,158
He said he had a secret recipe
to make mashed potato.

1324
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,594
-That's right.
-A secret recipe?

1325
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:28,665
Start by boiling down cream and butter.

1326
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,367
Add a bit of wasabi.

1327
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,602
-Wasabi?
-Yes.

1328
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,138
Your friend will ask,

1329
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,940
"What are you making, Hyun-suk?"

1330
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,143
-What?
-He can't hear you.

1331
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,511
Your friend is asking!

1332
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,213
What did you ask?

1333
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,448
What's the mix
of cream, butter, and wasabi for?

1334
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,783
This? Mashed potato.

1335
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,551
It's for mashed potato?

1336
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,820
Wait, but I don't see potatoes.

1337
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:51,888
Will he use that?

1338
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,823
-What?
-Is that the secret recipe?

1339
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,891
WHAT'S THE SECRET RECIPE?

1340
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,062
-Potato chips?
-I didn't see potatoes around.

1341
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,797
So he'll use these?

1342
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,034
You can use a stone mortar like this
while you camp.

1343
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,436
Why would he have
a stone mortar while he's camping?

1344
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:10,140
-It's easier to find potatoes.
-Isn't that too heavy?

1345
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,709
But it's not cool to do this,

1346
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,077
so keep a 45-degree angle.

1347
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,745
LOOK COOL!

1348
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,380
That's it. Yes.

1349
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,416
Is this your secret recipe?

1350
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,419
Does he have to
keep one eye closed like that?

1351
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,554
Kids are probably watching this saying,

1352
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,824
"What are you doing
with my potato chips, Daddy?"

1353
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,193
Watch out for the tent strings.

1354
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,628
"Okay, Daddy!"

1355
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,130
"Will that become an actual dish?"

1356
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,466
You can just smash it in the bag.

1357
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,602
-That's what I mean.
-Skip the mortar when you're in a hurry.

1358
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,604
Just like how you'd break raw <i>ramyeon.</i>

1359
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,074
-Make a little hole first.
-The heat.

1360
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,276
-The lamb chop will get burnt.
-Will he burn the meat?

1361
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,713
-No, they look perfect.
-I knew it.

1362
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,849
-He calculated every move.
-The meat almost burned.

1363
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,317
CHEF HYUN-SUK IS GREAT WITH MEAT

1364
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,553
Hyun-suk takes everything into account.

1365
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,056
WHAT ABOUT
THE PAN-SEARED LAMB CHOP?

1366
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,958
IT'S READY TO BECOME STEW

1367
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,893
PERFECTION

1368
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,330
AND LARGE PIECES
OF BUTTON MUSHROOMS FOR THE STEW

1369
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:11,901
5. FRY BUTTON MUSHROOMS
IN OLIVE OIL

1370
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,703
You do that when you're camping.

1371
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,005
ONIONS ARE
IN THE CLASSIC CAMPING STYLE!

1372
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,474
ARE THESE READY?

1373
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,376
WHAT'S HE BRINGING IN THE POT?

1374
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,844
What did you bring?

1375
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,245
The lamb chops.

1376
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:25,348
-The lamb chops?
-Yes, I can't taste it.

1377
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,549
What does this do?

1378
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,518
The outside gets cooked tenderly.

1379
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:31,421
And the garlic flavor will
seep into the meat too.

1380
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,524
BUTTON MUSHROOMS
STIR-FRIED IN OIL

1381
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,660
-He's cooking the skewers tender.
-Yes.

1382
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,062
What are those in?

1383
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:42,799
I mixed olive oil with regular oil

1384
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,367
and cooked it lightly.

1385
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:48,605
-You're removing the confit now?
-Will you grill those again?

1386
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:52,542
They're both using lamb chops,
but Sam had another procedure.

1387
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,945
I just saw Hyun-suk pour oil over the
garlic and then cover it with olive oil.

1388
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,982
-But Sam dunked it all the way in.
-Jeez.

1389
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,751
-Did he learn this in Italy?
-I knew it.

1390
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,487
However, Hyun-suk is
busy salting his food.

1391
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,023
All he can do is sprinkle the salt.

1392
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,858
-He's doing it again.
-Yet again.

1393
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,827
He just did that two seconds ago.

1394
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,296
HE'S THE SPOTLIGHT AND SALT
OF CHEF & MY FRIDGE

1395
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,432
SPRINKLES WITH HIS RIGHT HAND

1396
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,733
AND AGAIN WITH HIS LEFT

1397
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,769
I CAN EVEN USE BOTH HANDS!

1398
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:20,837
Look at him.

1399
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,339
I'M NOT JUST SPRINKLING SALT

1400
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,742
I JUST STAY ON MY RHYTHM
FOR 15 MINUTES

1401
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,844
That was…

1402
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,779
EVERYONE BECOMES ONE WITH SALT!

1403
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,583
-He's trying to stop Sam.
-It's like he's in icy cold water.

1404
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,285
It's not a big deal.

1405
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,054
SAM LOSES PEOPLE'S ATTENTION
WHENEVER HYUN-SUK USES SALT

1406
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,590
FROZEN FRIED RICE

1407
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,692
Now, as we speak…

1408
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,462
The Chodang corn looks so amazing.

1409
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,096
THE BLUEBERRY SAUCE GOES TO THE BURNER

1410
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:51,634
6. GRATE PARMESAN
INTO THE LAMB CHOP STEW

1411
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,506
AND GOLDEN BROWN ONION!

1412
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,175
He's starting to chop the onion.

1413
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,144
Is that onion? It is.

1414
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:04,180
-It looks good.
-He grilled the onion and chopped it.

1415
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,583
-Yes.
-It must be a side dish.

1416
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,351
He said he'd make a salad.

1417
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,719
Yes, the lamb salad.

1418
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,888
Sam is also using konjac bread.

1419
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,124
-Sam uses konjac bread.
-He toasts it.

1420
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,261
There's bread and rice, fried rice.

1421
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,597
You have six minutes and a half.

1422
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,298
The corn,

1423
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,968
the one that his friend sent.

1424
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,170
He wasn't going to serve it whole?

1425
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,340
-It's that old addictive corn dish.
-You're right.

1426
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,642
So that's also in the salad.

1427
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,344
8. ADD CORN INTO THE ONION SALAD

1428
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:38,381
AND MIX CUMIN, MUSTARD,
AND FRIED RICE

1429
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,887
-He's using a popsicle.
-Look, he's using a popsicle.

1430
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,054
A popsicle?

1431
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:46,222
Why are you using that?

1432
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,924
This popsicle is

1433
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,293
-a mix of apple and strawberry flavors.
-Oh, that's right.

1434
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,463
Please call us with a brand deal
for this deliciously twisted popsicle.

1435
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,065
-He wanted to take part.
-Good grief.

1436
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,901
Just focus on cooking.

1437
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:03,239
Anyway, Hyun-suk cooks with chips
and even a popsicle.

1438
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,910
We often take those camping,
so he gets to make use of that.

1439
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:10,079
He's going to make a glaze
with the popsicle.

1440
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,415
-With that?
-He used to be famous

1441
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,218
-for his balsamic sauce.
-You're right.

1442
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,286
So just like that?

1443
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:20,256
-He decided to use a popsicle to do that.
-That twisted popsicle.

1444
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,191
-The twisted popsicle.
-Yes.

1445
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,860
Something smells good.

1446
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,261
You have five minutes left!

1447
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,097
-Yoona will go out to the kitchen!
-Okay!

1448
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,266
YOONA IS HERE TO REPORT

1449
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,702
-The five-minute check.
-I'm coming.

1450
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,170
-Yoona is going.
-Yes.

1451
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,340
-I'll go.
-She shoots herself as she goes too.

1452
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,877
I'll be the five-minute checker.

1453
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,679
She finds something
as soon as she arrives.

1454
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,746
It looks so good.

1455
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,015
Gosh.

1456
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,884
She puts the camera on Hyun-suk.

1457
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,553
-Look into the camera and Yoona.
-Am I doing this right?

1458
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,821
FATALLY CHARMING

1459
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,223
FATAL TO HER EYES!

1460
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,726
KONJAC BREAD OVER THE CHARCOAL

1461
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,828
LAMB CHOPS, OUT

1462
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,863
What's it like out there?

1463
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,498
-That looks good.
-Hey.

1464
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,200
-It was cooked deliciously.
-It was.

1465
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,902
Four minutes and a half, sir.

1466
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,203
You should grill the meat.

1467
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,072
THE LAMB CHOP CONFIT
GOES OVER THE CHARCOAL!

1468
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:13,776
9. GRILL LAMB CHOP CONFIT
OVER CHARCOAL

1469
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,411
POPSICLE GLAZE

1470
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:16,646
-It looks so cool.
-Sure.

1471
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:20,483
Yoona, that's the mushroom potato, right?

1472
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,585
-Can you try that?
-Hey, Hyun-suk!

1473
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,490
SHE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS!

1474
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,758
I can't handle this.

1475
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,693
He looked me in the eyes.

1476
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,029
I get it. But please try that.

1477
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,697
Let me try some.

1478
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,199
ADDING CARBS WITH KONJAC BREAD

1479
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:40,069
-Now, I wonder how it turned out.
-The secret mashed potato.

1480
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,138
He made that with chips.

1481
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,173
Okay, Yoona.

1482
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,243
-How's the mashed potato?
-What's it taste like?

1483
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,678
Is it delicious?

1484
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:53,082
-It tastes like mashed potato!
-It does?

1485
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,451
-It does.
-It really does.

1486
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,054
And he even added the crunchy texture.

1487
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,590
Why is mashed potato crunchy?

1488
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,193
-It tastes richer and more delicious.
-Does it?

1489
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,729
Let's move on to Sam's side.

1490
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:09,132
-The creamed green onion.
-Yes?

1491
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,700
-What now?
-Try some.

1492
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,035
-This one?
-Yes.

1493
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,603
I feel like I must eat it like this.

1494
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,538
Please try that one.

1495
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,507
-What's that, Chef Hyun-suk?
-Creamed green onion.

1496
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,709
-Creamed green onion.
-It's creamed green onion.

1497
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:23,746
Does it taste like
he'll win a star, Yoona?

1498
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,149
But Hyun-suk will go

1499
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,284
-and pick up a star today.
-Will he?

1500
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,820
GIVE HER EVEN MORE COMPLIMENTS

1501
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,191
As I expected,
he's so good at running with a situation.

1502
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,593
You have three minutes left.

1503
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,896
-Sam.
-The heat's a bit low.

1504
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,931
-The heat is too low.
-Sam, look into the camera.

1505
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,167
-The heat is too low.
-Sam, come on.

1506
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,402
-Please look into the camera.
-The camera.

1507
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,738
-Hello.
-The canine tooth.

1508
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,707
Show her the canine tooth smile.

1509
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:52,909
SHOWING OFF HIS CHARM

1510
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,578
GREAT JOB

1511
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,681
-What was that?
-Look into the camera.

1512
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,583
May I try this?

1513
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,820
-The salad. Try that.
-The salad.

1514
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,055
Will it fetch him a star?

1515
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,424
Yoona just tried some.

1516
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,693
Can it fetch him a star?

1517
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,496
Can it fetch him a star?

1518
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,231
Fetch Me the Star, Lamb.

1519
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,202
Fetch Me the Star, Lamb.

1520
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,737
MELTING

1521
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,672
-She's watched us often.
-She has.

1522
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,241
-That's why she's doing so well.
-She is.

1523
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,743
What's this powder?

1524
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,378
Where? It's cumin. It's for… It's cumin.

1525
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,748
-Cumin.
-It's cumin?

1526
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,383
I could smell it right away.
It was absolutely delicious.

1527
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,686
I see. Was it that good?

1528
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,255
-You have a minute and 30 seconds.
-Yes.

1529
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,990
POPSICLE GLAZE, GRILLED ONION

1530
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,960
7. MIX GRILLED ONION
WITH POPSICLE GLAZE

1531
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,295
ON THE CUTTING BOARD!

1532
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,331
NEXT, MASHED POTATO

1533
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,334
GRILLED ONION, CREAMED
GREEN ONION MASHED POTATO

1534
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,837
AND THE LAMB CHOPS!

1535
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:58,941
I'm adding butter to the melted popsicle.

1536
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,044
I'll show you a cool way
to serve your sauce.

1537
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,080
First, lower your head.

1538
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:08,084
-and show your focus.
-As if he's focused. I see.

1539
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,386
But if you lower your head too much,
they can't see you.

1540
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,921
So lift it up just a little.

1541
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,490
Try to get someone
to snap a candid photo of you.

1542
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,859
FINISHING OFF
WITH THE POPSICLE GLAZE!

1543
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,694
Like that.

1544
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,498
As we speak, yes, Hyun-suk is done.

1545
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,467
If his charcoal isn't working well,
he can use Hyun-suk's.

1546
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,804
-He doesn't have much time.
-You can go to his side.

1547
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,705
-It's the stew.
-Yes.

1548
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:33,709
You should use Hyun-suk's stove
if you must.

1549
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:36,145
-How can I help?
-You should serve the dish closely.

1550
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,814
-What do you need?
-Bring me a plate.

1551
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,282
-A plate? Okay.
-Good.

1552
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,350
-You can do it, Sam!
-Jeez.

1553
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,618
Here's the plate.

1554
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:45,488
-You have 20 seconds left. 15 seconds.
-It's not that one.

1555
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,457
-You must finish up.
-Let me know if you need help, Sam!

1556
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:50,626
And ten seconds.

1557
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,563
-Nine. Eight.
-Do you need anything?

1558
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,264
-No.
-Blueberry sauce.

1559
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,134
-Five. Four. Three.
-The blueberry sauce.

1560
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,169
Two. One.

1561
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,672
It's over.

1562
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,776
Great work, both of you.

1563
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,478
He tried hard until the end.

1564
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:10,713
These look so pretty.

1565
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,781
THE CAMPING DISHES
MATCH IS OVER!

1566
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,518
-Thank you for your hard work, Yoona.
-Sure.

1567
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:19,822
And now, the two camping dishes were
prepared just for Bo-hyun.

1568
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,025
Both dishes have been finished.

1569
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,760
That was very helpful.

1570
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,796
I'll be able to make use of this.

1571
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,266
-My friends will try it out of curiosity.
-That's true.

1572
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,334
-I…
-Okay.

1573
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,502
…do not sweat when I see something red.

1574
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,372
I only shed my sweat for my guests.

1575
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,907
Okay. Fine.

1576
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:41,444
The first time, you seem kind of cool,
but you keep doing it.

1577
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,379
-Come on.
-You're right.

1578
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,781
-How long will you go on?
-You're too much.

1579
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:49,418
Please try Chef Hyun-suk's dish,
The Sheep-tar Is Mine.

1580
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:54,757
MANY DIFFERENT GARNISHES
SERVED WITH LAMB CHOPS

1581
01:04:55,958 --> 01:05:00,529
DELICIOUSLY GOLDEN BROWN
KONJAC BREAD AND LAMB CHOPS

1582
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,200
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
THE SHEEP-TAR IS MINE

1583
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,569
-May I eat it with my hand?
-Please do.

1584
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,238
-It's as if he's camping.
-He's at the camping ground.

1585
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:13,009
He's a guy who spends
all winter at a camping ground.

1586
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,679
It smells sweet
and like ground black pepper.

1587
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,782
I can see some salt crystals.

1588
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,651
He sprinkled salt for a reason.

1589
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,753
It wasn't just for show.

1590
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,121
It looks so shiny.

1591
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,557
The lamb chop is the most important.
They both cooked lamb.

1592
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,393
A TENDER BITE

1593
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,261
-Gosh.
-Gosh, that looks good.

1594
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,696
He makes it look so good.

1595
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,500
Look at his happy face.

1596
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:41,871
-That was his real response.
-Is it tough or tender?

1597
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,906
And is it seasoned well?

1598
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,242
Lamb may give off its unique smell.

1599
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,445
-The sauce was the best move.
-The sauce?

1600
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:53,616
-The ice cream sauce?
-The one with the popsicle.

1601
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:54,917
Lamb dishes are

1602
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:57,153
usually served
with a sweet and sour sauce.

1603
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,522
<i>So I mixed the popsicle</i>
<i>with the apple and strawberry flavors</i>

1604
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,123
<i>with lemon juice,</i>

1605
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,225
<i>so the balance has to be good.</i>

1606
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,528
It doesn't give off any smell,

1607
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,730
not even the usual lamb smell.

1608
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,366
-Is it garlic?
-I only used some crushed garlic.

1609
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:14,670
But if you mix garlic and thyme and
let it sit with the lamb for 30 minutes,

1610
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,072
it'll taste absolutely delicious.

1611
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,674
AH-HA

1612
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,110
He's sharing all his tips.

1613
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,345
What should I try next?

1614
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,246
The mashed potato.

1615
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,483
The mashed potato Yoona already tried.

1616
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,218
-It looks real.
-It was good.

1617
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,753
It was just like mashed potato.

1618
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,954
-Really.
-Chewy mashed potato.

1619
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,323
How did he do this with chips?

1620
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,391
Indeed.

1621
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,660
He shows yet another smile.

1622
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,663
-Hyun-suk already gets two smiles.
-Already?

1623
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,733
This mashed potato is

1624
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,835
something I'll really use.

1625
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,938
People always take a bag of chips
when they go camping.

1626
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,339
-We often do.
-We do.

1627
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,041
It'll taste delicious like this.

1628
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,577
You can do that and eat the onion last
to clean out your palate.

1629
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,412
-The konjac bread.
-With everything.

1630
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,382
And he takes a bite.

1631
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,283
FIRST, A BITE OF THE LAMB CHOP

1632
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,119
-He eats deliciously.
-It's probably addictive.

1633
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,921
-It's definitely carbs, protein, and fat.
-Right.

1634
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:10,192
-You're right. Carbs.
-That's carbs, protein, and fat.

1635
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,528
I need to go camping soon.

1636
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,631
-Take a deep scoop to try that.
-Deep?

1637
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,667
Will he like this one?

1638
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,238
It must be good.

1639
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,740
He smiled three times in a row.

1640
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:28,277
My friends often visit with their kids,

1641
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,146
-and they'd love this.
-Right?

1642
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,280
They'll love it.

1643
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,948
-He'll get kudos.
-Yes.

1644
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:37,253
He finally got his cheating day
after a strict diet for four months.

1645
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,755
-I can't stop eating right now.
-I see.

1646
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:40,890
ONE MORE BITE

1647
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:45,461
Next, Sam, who went to Italy
just to fight this battle and win.

1648
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,498
BROILED AFTER CONFITING
THE TENDER LAMB CHOPS

1649
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,936
A DELICIOUS SALAD AND SAUCE
TO REFRESH THE GREASY MOUTH

1650
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:58,274
SERVED WITH LAMB STEW

1651
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:03,612
CHEF SAM KIM'S
FETCH ME THE STAR, LAMB

1652
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,549
-Please try the salad first.
-The salad.

1653
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:10,019
It's a mix of grilled corn and onion.

1654
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,921
Yoona tried the salad before.

1655
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,456
-It's really good.
-Is it?

1656
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:18,027
He put so much butter on it,
so I thought it was almost illegal.

1657
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,395
So?

1658
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:20,996
He just tried the salad.

1659
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,832
We need to see that face.

1660
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:23,933
RELIEVED

1661
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,000
-That's it.
-The real deal.

1662
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,302
It's the cumin.

1663
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,504
The cumin used here was…

1664
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,940
-Why?
-…a stroke of genius.

1665
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,709
It goes so well
with the butter on the corn.

1666
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,511
It's not too greasy, either.

1667
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,547
It already feels like I had the lamb,

1668
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,216
-thanks to the cumin.
-Thanks to the cumin.

1669
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,586
Next, try the Fricassee in front of you,

1670
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,588
usually made with stir-fried chicken
and vegetables

1671
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:48,057
boiled down in cream or butter.

1672
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,328
But I used lamb and mushroom
and boiled it down a little.

1673
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,996
You can dip some bread in it too.

1674
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,966
-Did you use lamb for the stew too?
-I did.

1675
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,271
-I love button mushroom soup.
-He tops the bread with the stew.

1676
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:03,639
It looks good.

1677
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,178
Gosh, he's stuffing himself
for the first time in a while.

1678
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,247
He looks happy.

1679
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,216
He's like, "This is Sam."

1680
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,551
There's a reason

1681
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,086
why he went to Italy.

1682
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,556
-He says you went for a reason.
-I knew it.

1683
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,224
It's a French dish.

1684
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,327
-Technically, yes.
-This is a French dish?

1685
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,796
-Is this a French dish?
-It is.

1686
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,066
Nonetheless, he was there.
Don't nitpick over that.

1687
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,202
Bo-hyun looks pleased.

1688
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,204
Next, the lamb chops.

1689
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,741
-He picked one up.
-That looks the most delicious.

1690
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:42,411
-Try it with the blueberries.
-This one?

1691
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,748
-It's mixed with yogurt anyway.
-He'll need a piece of blueberry.

1692
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,516
-Try it with everything?
-Yes.

1693
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,519
-Will it kill the fatty smell?
-Gosh.

1694
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,888
THE LAMB CHOP RIPS SMOOTHLY

1695
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,357
It looks so soft.
It practically tears apart on its own.

1696
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:56,425
It must be super tender.

1697
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,828
They cooked it differently,
so whose is the tenderer one?

1698
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:03,532
<i>There are probably Hyun-suk's way</i>
<i>and Sam's way of cooking.</i>

1699
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,268
Is there a difference in the tenderness?

1700
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,836
-There is.
-There is?

1701
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,906
-So there is?
-Yes, maybe you shouldn't have said that.

1702
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,409
Chef Sam's lamb was

1703
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:18,447
<i>so soft, as if it were cooked</i>
<i>by using the sous vide method.</i>

1704
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,884
<i>But Chef Hyun-suk's lamb was</i>
<i>definitely grilled.</i>

1705
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,754
So there must be a difference.

1706
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,258
Chef Hyun-suk's lamb
releases more juice as I chew,

1707
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:32,528
but Chef Sam's lamb released juice
the moment I took a bite.

1708
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,630
DIFFERENCE IN MEAT JUICE

1709
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,765
It depends on what you prefer.

1710
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,468
The kind of lamb chop you prefer.

1711
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,470
This is really hard.

1712
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,672
-It's been so long.
-Isn't it?

1713
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,274
Put the forks down, you two.

1714
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,744
Put those down, you two.

1715
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,347
Come to think of it, we don't need a fork.

1716
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,948
-Wait.
-Wait.

1717
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,116
Wait.

1718
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,352
-Wait.
-Wait.

1719
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,654
Wait. Bo-hyun is still eating.

1720
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,623
-Please wait.
-You have to wait.

1721
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,292
This is Chef Hyun-suk's lamb.

1722
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,061
CUTTING THE MEAT ELEGANTLY

1723
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,564
Yoona said she didn't feel too easy
about eating lamb

1724
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,299
because of its smell.

1725
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,134
Yes, a little.

1726
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,304
-She smells it first.
-Please try it.

1727
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,641
-The popsicle sauce.
-He did glaze it though.

1728
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,010
It doesn't smell at all.

1729
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,311
-Nothing?
-No odd smells.

1730
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,446
There are no odd smells.

1731
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:28,384
And the sauce
reminds me of strawberry jam.

1732
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,852
<i>I couldn't tell it was a popsicle.</i>

1733
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,655
<i>It felt like strawberry jam was</i>
<i>used for this dish.</i>

1734
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,224
There must be a lot of fruit
in the popsicle.

1735
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,593
It's really good.

1736
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,396
-I don't feel averse to it at all.
-I see.

1737
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,965
I might be able to finish everything.

1738
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,533
-Jeez.
-She's taking another bite now.

1739
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,402
ANOTHER BITE

1740
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,704
You look so elegant
as you use a knife to cut the meat.

1741
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:51,840
I ate it like I had been starving.

1742
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,542
It could feel like that.

1743
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,612
You're the camping guy,
so she can be the restaurant girl.

1744
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,483
-And it helps me feel full.
-I see.

1745
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,852
-I stole it.
-Next, Sam's dish.

1746
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:05,988
-Wait.
-Yes.

1747
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,124
-Wait, twins.
-Wait, twins.

1748
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:11,393
-I want to try making this.
-Next, Chef Sam's dish.

1749
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:16,265
You have to try the salad first
when it comes to his dish.

1750
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,900
Don't smell it yet. Wait.

1751
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,335
ATTENTION

1752
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:22,538
They really remind me of puppies.

1753
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:24,039
-They're like…
-They're like poodles.

1754
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:27,176
-Try Sam's dish.
-Try it.

1755
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,545
-What's it like?
-Does it smell?

1756
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,549
I honestly thought
this dish would give off a gamey smell.

1757
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,617
-It wasn't grilled over charcoal.
-No.

1758
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,386
-But not at all.
-No?

1759
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,822
-And it's so tender.
-It is.

1760
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,157
It was the most tender,
even compared to these two.

1761
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:44,993
I coated it with flour
to get rid of the gamey smell.

1762
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:48,197
-The secret was flour.
-After that, I'd boil it anyway.

1763
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,932
He had it wrapped up.

1764
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,333
Please try the meat.

1765
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,468
THIS TIME, THE LAMB CHOP

1766
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,670
Chef Sam's meat dish.

1767
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,505
The process was a bit different.

1768
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:59,208
-Look at her face.
-It was cooked in a different way.

1769
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,844
It was grilled over fire,
but it's still refreshing.

1770
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,979
-It feels refreshing?
-Yes.

1771
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:09,184
<i>The yogurt and blueberry helps</i>
<i>keep my palate very clean.</i>

1772
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,820
I've never had meat like this before.

1773
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,589
Now, twins. Dig in.

1774
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,892
-Let us begin.
-Yes, sir.

1775
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,728
We'll hear from the twins in a bit.

1776
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,764
THEY EAT
LIKE IT'S THE FIRST MEAL

1777
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,965
They eat so deliciously.

1778
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,334
-Does it not smell because it was grilled?
-It's smoky.

1779
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,669
What do you think? Does it smell?

1780
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,304
SLAM

1781
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,572
CHUCKLING

1782
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,875
-Whoa.
-The sauce.

1783
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,310
THE TWINS SHARE SO WELL
WITHOUT FIGHTING

1784
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:36,378
A LAMB CHOP IN ONE HAND

1785
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:37,646
AND A FORK IN THE OTHER

1786
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,114
Another dish for the twins.

1787
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,617
-Twins.
-Yes, sir.

1788
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,185
-Woof.
-It feels like they're stealing.

1789
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,253
HEHEHE

1790
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,623
Great job during the shoot today, you two.

1791
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:48,824
Cheers.

1792
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,293
IT'S A PARTY

1793
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,862
THE 2ND TIME DEVOURING

1794
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,564
The two are dining.

1795
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,933
You aren't here to dine!

1796
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,435
Not the bone.

1797
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,104
-Not the bone!
-Not the bone.

1798
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,540
-Don't eat the bone.
-Not the bone, Nam-no.

1799
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,741
You can't eat that.

1800
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,576
You must compare the two dishes.

1801
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,846
Chef Hyun-suk's lamb was like a tough guy.

1802
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,681
It almost smells smoky.

1803
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:15,284
But Chef Sam's dish tasted very delicate.

1804
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:16,685
Tough and delicate.

1805
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:20,255
I loved both the blueberries
and the yogurt.

1806
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,026
It'll depend on what you like.
They're both good.

1807
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,695
Chef Sam's meat must've been tenderer.

1808
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,931
The choice is Bo-hyun's.

1809
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,533
<i>Press one for Sam</i>

1810
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,169
<i>and two for Hyun-suk.</i>

1811
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:37,372
THINKING DEEPLY

1812
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,007
You aren't sweating, are you?

1813
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,642
-I am sweating.
-You are?

1814
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,544
-He's sweating.
-Yes, this is…

1815
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,014
-It was a matter of a small difference.
-A small one.

1816
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,749
-He must have a reason.
-He must.

1817
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,085
Please press the button.

1818
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:53,288
Who did Bo-hyun choose? Did you press one?

1819
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,390
Yes.

1820
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,961
He can't even look at our chefs.

1821
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,530
HEAD DOWN…

1822
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,398
Let's check the result.

1823
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,568
Bo-hyun only loves camping food.

1824
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,471
There's a long-standing rivalry
between Sam and Hyun-suk.

1825
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,773
The current score is six to six.

1826
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,778
Which dish made with Bo-hyun's lamb chops

1827
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,981
seized the victory?

1828
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,316
What's Bo-hyun's choice?

1829
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,552
He finally had a delicious meal
after a while.

1830
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,955
He finally had a delicious meal
after a while. Who took victory?

1831
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,824
CHOI HYUN-SUK WINS

1832
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,225
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
THE SHEEP-TAR IS MINE

1833
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,293
Hyun-suk wins!

1834
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,532
Hyun-suk wins! He wins.

1835
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,700
HIS PEAK ANNOYING CELEBRATION

1836
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,069
-He was ready for that.
-Yes.

1837
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,939
Both dishes had perfect garnishes,

1838
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,941
so I couldn't pick a side.

1839
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,376
But if I were to do this

1840
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,878
while camping,
Chef Hyun-suk's recipe seemed right.

1841
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:53,248
If I wanted to cook lamb at home,

1842
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:56,985
I thought Chef Sam's recipe
would be better.

1843
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:01,223
It was just a ridiculously tiny bit
of a difference.

1844
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:04,259
Chef Hyun-suk takes his 11th victory.

1845
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:08,764
As always, I gave it my best
without realizing I lost some stars.

1846
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,466
-I even lost the big one.
-I see.

1847
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:14,903
May I point out something to Chef Sam?

1848
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,406
I've been to his restaurant
two, three times.

1849
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,641
So he shouldn't just go to Italy.

1850
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,410
He should've come to my restaurant.

1851
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,512
Why didn't you go?

1852
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,714
You must know your enemy to know yourself!

1853
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:28,083
-I guess he never visited.
-I guess not.

1854
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,118
-You must know your enemy.
-Yes.

1855
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,689
Please put a star on Chef Hyun-suk!

1856
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,857
He takes his 11th victory.

1857
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,292
This is his 11th star!

1858
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,595
Congratulations!

1859
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:42,497
Congratulations!
Bo-hyun chooses Hyun-suk's dish.

1860
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:43,599
STAY TUNED FOR THE PREVIEW

1861
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,567
His voice is sweet yet husky.

1862
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:46,935
His dish already seems delicious.

1863
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,804
FRIDGE OWNERS:
CAR, THE GARDEN AND PANI BOTTLE

1864
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,272
You have lots of nicknames.

1865
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,808
Anything goes, whatever you can think of.

1866
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:55,010
-Whoa.
-These are all his nicknames.

1867
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,278
Why are you called Chicken Breast?

1868
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,579
What the heck is Guinea Pig?

1869
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,847
It's a mess.

1870
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,551
<i>Webtoon Artist Kim Poong</i>
<i>versus Chef Choi Hyun-suk.</i>

1871
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,952
-Hey, wait!
-Wait!

1872
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:05,387
He's splattering that everywhere.

1873
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,123
Is this a kitchen or a Shaolin Temple?

1874
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,725
Hah! Hoo!

1875
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,859
He's doing something odd again.

1876
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,527
I get the feeling that I've been had.

1877
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:14,262
What's Poong doing?

1878
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:17,332
Will it be Son, the Korean cuisine chef
or Jung, the Chinese cuisine chef?

1879
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,635
<i>I'll prepare something</i>
<i>to make him feel like a king.</i>

1880
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,770
I am forever grateful
for Your Majesty's grace.

1881
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,339
-Court Lady Kim!
-Are you trying to starve His Majesty?

1882
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,741
Sentence him to death.

1883
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,542
<i>Your table is ready, Your Majesty.</i>

1884
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,645
Hey, who made this?

1885
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,348
<i>There's a thug among us.</i>

1886
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,019
Please chew some more for your health.

1887
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,086
Fine.
