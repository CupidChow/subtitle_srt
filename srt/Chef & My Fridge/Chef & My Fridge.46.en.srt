1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,984
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,755
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,823
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,260
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,731
-It's nice to see you all.
-Welcome to the show.

6
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,901
We're very happy to have
a returning chef with us today.

7
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,171
Chef Antimo is here again!

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,508
Buon giorno!

9
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,344
-Buon giorno!
-He looks even cooler now.

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,713
The chef who's actually from Naples.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,181
Yes, just like me.

12
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,551
<i>He joined us last May</i>
<i>during the Big Asian Match,</i>

13
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>and he has</i>
<i>the 32nd best restaurant in Asia</i>

14
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,856
as a Michelin one-star chef in Hong Kong.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,192
<i>-Back then, he fought against Sung-jun.</i>
<i>-He did.</i>

16
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,227
He easily beat Sung-jun.

17
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,363
<i>-It was so easy.</i>
<i>-Very easy.</i>

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,001
He did that and proved himself
as the actual chef from Naples.

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,904
It didn't have a huge impact on me
because it's not a big deal

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,306
to lose against my fellow Neapolitan.

21
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,341
-He's from your hometown.
-He is.

22
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,409
-Hometown?
-Yes.

23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,945
You didn't even live there for a year!

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,481
-That doesn't matter.
-It's his second hometown.

25
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,716
Did anyone say anything
about your appearance?

26
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,823
Even people in Hong Kong know of us.

27
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,060
We're a world-class show.

28
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,862
I'm looking forward to something today.

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,431
We have Chef Sam
sitting right across from Chef Antimo.

30
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,668
-He's also famous for his pasta, isn't he?
-That's true.

31
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:45,772
It'll be such an awesome match to see
the two Italian chefs against each other.

32
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,507
But Chef Sam studied in America.

33
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,808
OH…

34
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,777
Do you know what he said?

35
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,613
Wait, you can't…

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,517
Oh, man. Should I tell you this or not?

37
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,685
This is a fun one.

38
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,587
There are too many ears in the green room.

39
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,922
-Wait.
-When I meet these chefs,

40
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,892
they all introduce themselves
and the area they're from,

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,461
but if you keep listening,

42
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,030
they all have a dream
of working in America.

43
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,999
-Even your name is an American name.
-Yes!

44
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,567
-He's Sam Kim.
-Sam.

45
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,302
His real name is Kim Hui-tae.

46
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,838
-He's Kim Hui-tae.
-Hui-tae!

47
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,306
That's true.

48
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,042
You're a big shot now, Hui-tae.

49
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,278
He's a big shot.

50
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,947
If anyone recruits you from the States,

51
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,983
do you want to go there?

52
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,988
-My gosh!
-He's like that.

53
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,290
-He's like that!
-He's serious about Italian food.

54
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,093
-You can't paint this picture of him.
-He said, "No, thank you."

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,262
-Money doesn't sway Italians.
-What do you take him for?

56
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,930
He has Italian pride.

57
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,965
LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR MATCH

58
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,268
Let's look forward to their round.

59
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,772
We have two guests that have
polar opposite appetites

60
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,141
-here on the show.
-Do they have a big appetite?

61
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,744
Please welcome the fridge owners!

62
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,745
Come on out!

63
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,047
WHO ARE TODAY'S FRIDGE OWNERS?

64
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,448
These are today's guests!

65
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,484
Please welcome them.

66
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,919
Please welcome them.

67
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,321
The big eater and the light eater,

68
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,858
please welcome Kwaktube and Joo Woo-jae!

69
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,928
KOREA'S TOP TRAVEL VLOGGER

70
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,764
<i>He currently has 2.13 million subscribers</i>

71
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,166
<i>and has accumulated</i>
<i>more than 600 million views.</i>

72
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,369
<i>We thought he was a travel vlogger.</i>

73
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,906
<i>But he's actually an endlessly-eating,</i>
mukbang<i> creator.</i>

74
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,074
Are the portions this small?

75
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,809
The big eater, Kwaktube!

76
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,611
-Hello.
-Welcome to the show.

77
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,712
Hello.

78
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,714
Let me tell you about this guest.

79
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,450
<i>He's known for his boyfriend look</i>
<i>in the world of fashion,</i>

80
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,086
<i>but as an appetite that kills</i>
<i>others' appetites on variety shows.</i>

81
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,854
BARELY NIBBLING

82
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,458
-The light eater, Joo Woo-jae!
-Joo Woo-jae!

83
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,993
The guy who kills appetites?

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,063
Hello, I'm Joo Woo-jae, a <i>mukbang</i> creator.

85
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,865
AN AGGRESSIVE WELCOME

86
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,068
One of our chefs

87
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,737
heard Woo-jae would be joining us today

88
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,872
and flat out refused to come

89
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,741
-to the shoot today.
-Really?

90
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,810
Poong was one of them.

91
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,780
He's infamous for eating in a way
that makes the food look really bad.

92
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,416
-Woo-jae?
-I can't believe that he's here.

93
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,517
Why?

94
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,019
-To your surprise,
-Is that so?

95
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,320
I too didn't want to be here.

96
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,422
LIKEWISE

97
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,291
It's a program I love so much,

98
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,493
and I'm so grateful for the invitation.

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,862
But you'll be shocked
when you see my fridge next time.

100
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,896
-The food?
-It's empty.

101
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,298
Your fridge?

102
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,567
-That fridge…
-The ingredients are covered.

103
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,803
-They're supposed to create something,
-What's in it?

104
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,373
so I wasn't sure
if they could do that with mine.

105
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,807
But the writer said,

106
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,945
"It will happen. Give them your faith.
Don't take our chefs as a joke."

107
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,814
-It can work.
-We just have to pull through.

108
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,350
We can do it, right? We can all do it.

109
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,153
-That's why I agreed to come.
-I see.

110
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,188
-Of course.
-I'm glad you're here.

111
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,257
It's truly one of my favorite programs.

112
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,794
First of all, we have an announcement.

113
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,229
This isn't an easy decision.

114
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,399
He got married just two days ago.

115
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,800
He literally just got married.

116
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,936
<i>We're here today with a newlywed groom.</i>

117
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,838
-Congratulations on your marriage.
-Thank you.

118
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,974
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MARRIAGE

119
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,044
WEDDING SONG BY DAVICHI,
HOSTED BY JEON HYUN-MOO

120
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,713
<i>Many guests were there</i>
<i>to celebrate with him,</i>

121
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,214
<i>and many of them were celebrities.</i>

122
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,451
Shouldn't you be on your honeymoon?

123
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,952
That's true,

124
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,555
but the one show
I wanted to appear the most in my life

125
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,757
was <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
so I couldn't say no.

126
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,359
MOVED

127
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,228
When we first met, he kept saying

128
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,099
-this show always gave him energy.
-He did?

129
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,001
Before I became a content creator,

130
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,837
<i>I worked</i>
<i>at the Korean Embassy in Azerbaijan.</i>

131
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,207
And there are only
about 50 Korean people there.

132
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,876
Naturally, you can't find any Korean food,

133
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,111
so I had to learn to cook.

134
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,547
That's when I watched the show every week

135
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,649
to get inspiration for my meals.

136
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,784
It was the source of joy
while I worked there.

137
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,586
You still should've gone to the honeymoon.

138
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,854
BUT STILL, IT'S YOUR HONEYMOON…

139
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,556
Did your wife gladly let you come?

140
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,925
She also works nine to five,

141
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,827
-so she…
-He called her his wife.

142
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,762
He called her his wife.

143
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,964
HE'S SO LOVEY-DOVEY

144
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,168
So she's taking a leave
after I shoot this show.

145
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,471
Do you call her your wife at home?

146
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,973
-I address her by her name.
-By her name?

147
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,775
What does she call you?

148
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,311
Since when we dated,

149
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,513
-she called me baby.
-Baby?

150
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,549
-Like, "Hey, baby"?
-She calls you baby?

151
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,518
I feel kind of embarrassed to say this.

152
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,988
Do you feel jealous that
your younger friend got married first?

153
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,058
I was at the wedding too,

154
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,528
and I was never the type
who wanted to get married,

155
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,631
but they looked so happy
that I began to think about it.

156
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,768
Because he cried.

157
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,703
-Yes, at the wedding.
-Joon-bin cried.

158
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,772
While he read the wedding vow,

159
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,006
he suddenly choked up.

160
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,908
So people began to murmur.

161
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,545
They were like, "He's even staging this?"

162
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,080
Half of them were thinking that.

163
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,115
Because the tears felt like this.

164
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,919
He said, "My bride and I
will live well together."

165
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,387
"And our baby…"

166
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,323
-He was like that!
-That was a comedy sketch.

167
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,626
-It sounded staged.
-It was like that.

168
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,429
As a husband, I will make sure

169
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,964
my wife is always respected and loved.

170
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,433
GETS READY

171
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,635
We'll stay together forever…

172
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,069
LAUGHING

173
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,471
What are you doing?

174
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,507
Some even said this.

175
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,609
-You rehearse the wedding, right?
-Yes.

176
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,711
I heard that he cried
at the exact same part.

177
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,047
-During the rehearsal?
-If it was rehearsed…

178
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,282
So it was scripted?

179
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,750
Did he practice?

180
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,386
I did cry at the exact same part.

181
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,054
But I felt sad again during the wedding,

182
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,223
so I ended up crying.

183
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,925
HIS TEARS WERE REAL

184
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,027
He now has two things to celebrate.

185
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,462
Not only is he married,

186
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,697
but he'll be a father soon.

187
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,999
CONGRATULATIONS ON BOTH OCCASIONS

188
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,635
And one of our chefs
also has something to celebrate.

189
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,539
This man recently had a cute baby girl.

190
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,774
It's Chef Antimo!

191
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,911
ANTIMO HAS A BABY GIRL

192
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,982
LOOKS JUST LIKE HER DAD

193
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:03,883
She must be adorable.

194
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,053
-She must be so cute.
-She's probably yay big.

195
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,088
You probably know
the baby's gender, right?

196
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,424
-Yes, I'm having a son.
-A son.

197
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,026
Well, everyone was worried.

198
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,195
They say the eldest daughter
takes after her dad,

199
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:21,033
-so many were worried she'd be a girl.
-Worried.

200
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,003
-They were that worried?
-Yes, they were seriously worried.

201
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,472
But it was a huge relief
to know I'm having a son.

202
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,641
-And first sons take after their mother.
-That's good.

203
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:33,112
It's now time
to go through Kwaktube's fridge.

204
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,182
This couldn't have happened
if he weren't a fan of the show.

205
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,650
They were missing their fridge

206
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,185
on the first day of their marriage.

207
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,654
On the day after the wedding,

208
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,891
they came and took it
while I was saying thanks to the guests.

209
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,092
As a fan, I thought,

210
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,828
"They really take everything
and do it properly."

211
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,796
I was deeply moved when you took it.

212
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,165
This is the fridge of a newlywed groom.

213
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,702
So is this still
pretty much the fridge you used alone?

214
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,571
Yes, I lived alone before the wedding,

215
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,706
so it was the fridge I solely used then.

216
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,776
-All right. Yes.
-It smells like newlyweds.

217
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,012
-Smells like newlyweds?
-The fridge is new.

218
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,814
-Something smells romantic.
-Am I even allowed to touch it?

219
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,316
Yes, I wonder.

220
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,785
All right.
This is Kwaktube's newlywed fridge.

221
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,786
-Here it is!
-Here it is!

222
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,555
ALL ATTENTION ON THE FRIDGE

223
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,889
There are lots of things.

224
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,759
I see. There are lots of things.

225
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,460
-It's clean.
-It's neatly organized.

226
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,663
-It seems okay.
-It's rather full.

227
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,398
Why do you have so much salad?

228
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,000
-It's a lot.
-Do you like salad that much?

229
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,702
Paprika salad.

230
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,637
Organic vegetables.

231
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,972
You must like salad.

232
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,407
I despise it.

233
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,475
-He despises it.
-Why do you have so much?

234
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,811
I was on a strict diet
until the day before the wedding.

235
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,013
-He should.
-I did that too.

236
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,783
I've lost about 17 kg

237
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,118
compared to the heyday
of my YouTube career.

238
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,353
That's a lot.

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,121
So that shelf was pretty much my diet.

240
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,923
Yogurt and tofu.

241
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,125
I love ice cream but couldn't have it,

242
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,860
so I thought of eating yogurt.

243
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,929
-But I hate sour food.
-I see.

244
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,665
So I couldn't eat more than two bites.

245
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,467
I really hate sour food.

246
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,836
-If it's sour, it has to be sweet too.
-Sweet and sour.

247
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,405
This stir-fried gochujang
is also low sugar,

248
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,940
as well as this sesame dressing.

249
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,742
I only eat low sugar sauces.

250
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,379
One thing I hated the most was that,
apple cider vinegar.

251
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,513
Yes, ACV.

252
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,282
I had a bite and couldn't continue.

253
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,883
-I'd rather just get fat.
-It's only sour.

254
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,919
-It's just sour.
-I really hate sour food.

255
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,454
Do you not enjoy sour fruit?

256
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,788
I don't like fruit.

257
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,626
My mother had operated
a street stall at a marketplace.

258
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,761
She sold fruit.
Right in front of the street.

259
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,563
Hey, he knows that much?

260
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,365
He knows everything.

261
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,567
I saw you filming
at PANI BOTTLE's place too.

262
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,068
It's like I'm talking to a subscriber.

263
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,970
-You're a stalker.
-He is a subscriber.

264
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,039
-You must be a big fan.
-I wouldn't call myself that.

265
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,509
I just enjoyed watching his videos.

266
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,911
-I've watched him before his big break.
-Thank you.

267
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,913
So our car and our home

268
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,915
always smelled like fruit.

269
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,984
That's why
I naturally began to dislike it.

270
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,085
I would think so.

271
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,453
Because she had a business.

272
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,621
-I get it.
-For a long time.

273
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,058
What about oyster sauce,
ketchup, and mayonnaise?

274
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,626
These can't be for your diet.

275
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,362
Before I went on a diet,
I loved mayonnaise so much.

276
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,530
Mayonnaise.

277
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,666
I believe it's the best,
most perfect sauce out there.

278
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,635
Everything tastes good with mayo.

279
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,003
He loves everything with mayo.

280
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,371
I'm freed from my diet now.

281
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,639
Hey, you have cheese.

282
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,307
Do you like cheese?

283
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,510
My wife loves Western cuisine.

284
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,745
So I cooked for her from time to time,

285
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,347
and I had bought it for that occasion.

286
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,082
These were for his wife.

287
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,451
-There are some side dishes.
-Those are from my mother.

288
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,521
She only made
three of my favorite side dishes.

289
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,523
These are only the dishes he loves.

290
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,725
Does she still live in the apartment
above the hill in Busan?

291
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,060
Yes, she does.

292
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,628
-What the heck?
-What?

293
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,363
Just ask for his autograph.

294
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,597
Are you his family or what?

295
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,999
I don't like him that much.

296
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,133
He keeps denying it.

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,535
He has too much information.

298
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,536
You know my old home.

299
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,038
-She lived right under the hill.
-You're right.

300
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,306
Goodness. Come on.

301
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,608
There's a <i>gukbap </i>place nearby
with four tables.

302
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,543
Yes, four tables.

303
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,678
-One, two, three, four. Four tables.
-My regular spot.

304
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,480
-You sat in a corner.
-This is getting scary.

305
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,651
-Let's move on.
-He should say he's a fan.

306
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,186
Do you cook?

307
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,556
I studied abroad in Russia,

308
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,491
so I had to learn to cook,

309
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,992
and I did it for three to four years.

310
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,894
-This show had a big impact.
-I see.

311
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,163
I can make most <i>jjigae </i>or stir-fry dishes.

312
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,465
I see. What else?

313
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,366
I found some veggies.

314
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,102
Bok choy.

315
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,739
-Mushroom and cucumber. Yes.
-Napa cabbage, onion, and carrot.

316
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,774
While I was on a strict diet,

317
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,410
my wife also
didn't want to gain more weight,

318
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,513
but I didn't want her to starve
because she was pregnant.

319
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,515
So I got those
to make shabu-shabu for her.

320
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,117
-How sweet.
-We made it.

321
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,852
GOSH, SO JEALOUS…

322
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,286
Do you enjoy drinking?

323
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,855
I see lots of drinks here.

324
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,356
-He doesn't.
-You're not a heavy drinker.

325
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,192
I don't like to drink and don't enjoy it,

326
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,963
but PANI BOTTLE brought and left it there,
saying he'll have it later.

327
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,464
You two lived together.

328
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,333
You know that too?

329
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,534
That room was tiny.

330
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,436
THERE'S NOTHING HE DOESN'T KNOW

331
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,670
Give him an autograph later.

332
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,539
Make sure you take a selfie with him.

333
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,740
-Do it.
-I'll take it.

334
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,777
-I don't like him that much.
-I think you do.

335
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,512
-Take one.
-You do like him that much.

336
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,447
It's not that. The videos were funny.

337
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,382
THAT MEANS YOU LIKE HIM

338
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,351
You must've watched it
because you liked it.

339
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,953
Is someone threatening you
not to say you're my fan?

340
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,555
No, I'm not a fan.

341
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,323
ONLY HE DOESN'T REALIZE IT

342
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,892
My goodness.

343
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,195
I have a feeling his phone background
is a photo of Kwaktube.

344
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,565
-It must be his face.
-He must have merch too.

345
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,134
-What's that?
-It looks like leftovers.

346
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,469
Yes, someone had some.

347
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,870
-Is it <i>mulhoe?</i>
<i>-Mulhoe?</i>

348
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,973
My mother recently opened a noodle place.

349
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,308
She did?

350
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,977
-It's the broth of the noodles she made.
-The broth?

351
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:36,348
My wife and mother-in-law
both enjoyed the noodles so much,

352
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,318
so my mom left it here
and told me to make some for them.

353
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,586
-I see.
-For her daughter-in-law.

354
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,457
You're here anyway,
so why don't you promote her restaurant?

355
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,526
-May I do that?
-Of course.

356
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,697
It's in Dongrae, Busan,
and business has been slow lately

357
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,666
because her key menu

358
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,335
-is <i>mulhoe</i> noodles with beef <i>jeon.</i>
-That sounds good.

359
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,704
-But it's kind of seasonal.
-Yes, it's a summer dish.

360
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,472
-It's even better in winter.
-Exactly.

361
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,576
She came up with it herself,
so please show her some love.

362
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,010
-Thank you.
-I should go.

363
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,745
We received a tip
from the production crew.

364
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,982
Her son helped her start this business.

365
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,550
Her son did this for her.

366
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,252
She worked hard for a long time,

367
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,321
so I suggested she retired,
but she wanted to work.

368
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,789
What a great son.

369
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,124
-So I opened one for her.
-Good for you.

370
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,693
-I'll also be like him.
-What else?

371
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,229
-I see lots of seafood.
-He actually has seafood.

372
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,897
I found octopus.

373
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,166
-Octopus.
-Do you like it?

374
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,300
I began to love it

375
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,836
after having a <i>polvo</i> dish in Portugal.

376
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,738
-The one you had on <i>World Dice Tour.</i>
-Yes.

377
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,306
I got hooked on octopus since then,

378
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,343
-so I always like to keep it around.
-Octopus.

379
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,311
-I remember that.
-Yes.

380
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,847
He has lots of squid too.

381
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,182
-I keep them around.
-Do you like it?

382
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,284
-I love all seafood.
-He loves seafood.

383
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,852
I can't have enough of seafood.

384
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,555
And there is a lot of meat down here.

385
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,056
-Is this pork?
-Yes.

386
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,092
I also ate them during my diet.

387
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,027
I just had meat without rice,

388
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,829
and I mostly cooked steak.

389
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,064
I'm kind of sick of steak now.

390
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,866
I got sick of many dishes.

391
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,470
-I only had certain foods for a while.
-Make sure you pick ingredients wisely.

392
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,272
I'm now craving food that'll make me fat.

393
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,874
That was all
for Kwaktube's newlywed fridge!

394
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,709
FINISHED INSPECTING KWAKTUBE'S FRIDGE

395
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,579
We just looked through his fridge,

396
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,382
so it's time to find out
what his orders are.

397
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,716
What's the first order?

398
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,919
Chef and my full fridge.

399
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,487
-Full?
-What do you mean?

400
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,988
I filled up my fridge

401
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,557
with food for my strict diet
before the wedding,

402
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,993
and I'm done with that now.

403
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,430
So I wanted to empty out this full fridge.

404
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,198
-And handle those.
-Please use as much as possible.

405
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,100
-And handle the leftovers?
-Yes, that's right.

406
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,403
I'm looking forward
to eating something hearty.

407
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,904
What's the second order?

408
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,439
The second order.

409
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,509
Capturing my pregnant wife's appetite.

410
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,010
How sweet.

411
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,745
A dish for your wife.

412
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,715
She's pregnant,
so I want to cook more often for her,

413
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,450
and I want to learn something

414
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,985
much more romantic and cool,

415
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,256
something she'll like a lot more.
I wanted to learn the recipe today.

416
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,158
The married guys should do this.

417
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,126
These are Kwaktube's orders.

418
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,095
Next week looks like a tough one.

419
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,031
I don't know who it'll be,
but it's not a great day for those four.

420
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,866
He's trying to scare you.

421
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,337
Whoever that jumps in and takes a slot
would have an advantage.

422
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,282
HE PICKS THE DISH FOR HIS WIFE

423
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,119
-Grazie.
-He's done it before. He has experience.

424
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,621
-A dish for his pregnant wife.
-He can relate.

425
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,590
-Right?
-Sam?

426
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,661
I wish to challenge Chef Antimo.

427
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,830
HE JUMPS HEAD-ON
INTO A GAME WITH ANTIMO

428
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:38,731
No way.

429
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,033
I just got chills.

430
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,369
It's the best
when chefs in the same cuisine fight.

431
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,636
The match has been sealed.

432
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,673
Only two slots remain.

433
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,376
-I'll go.
-Yoon Nam-no!

434
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,244
I'll take his full fridge.

435
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,479
Chef and my full fridge.

436
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,048
If Nam-no is in…

437
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,916
I'LL GO AFTER HIM!

438
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,885
-I'll join.
-Hey, wait.

439
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,087
Everyone was looking around,
but Poong takes it.

440
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,390
I think it's about time that Nam-no

441
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,127
-relapsed into Poongphobia.
-A power move.

442
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,862
You have to keep him in check.

443
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,964
-How dare he choose something first?
-Yes.

444
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,133
-There's a story between them.
-I love this match.

445
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,037
Then let Nam-no and Poong's
15-minute cook-off begin!

446
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,710
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Kwaktube's fridge.</i>

447
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,179
Help him empty out his fridge
and let it get a fresh start

448
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,782
without ingredients
from his bachelor days.

449
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:34,486
The official go-to guy for leftovers,
Chef Yoon Nam-no,

450
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,322
versus the official issue maker
of the show,

451
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,958
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

452
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,128
Chef Nam-no has lost
three games in a row against Poong.

453
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,165
<i>Then he teamed up with Sung-jun</i>

454
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,900
<i>and won against Jong-won and Poong.</i>

455
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,636
So it seemed like
you were freed from Poongphobia.

456
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,638
I've recovered just a little bit.

457
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,840
But I'll work on my own today

458
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,944
-and destroy Webtoon Artist Poong.
-I see.

459
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,546
Mr. Anxiety.

460
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,947
And four straight losses

461
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,917
would soon mean the end of me,
as four, <i>sa,</i> sounds like death, <i>sa.</i>

462
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:08,454
-So I'll give it my all and do my best.
-Just lose once more.

463
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,688
CHUCKLES

464
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,123
You can lose five times in a row.

465
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,425
-You can lose once more, four to five.
-A great idea.

466
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,960
-Yes.
-You can keep losing.

467
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,695
I must win because this is my day job.

468
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,964
Will he break his losing streak?

469
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,201
Last time, I cooked with Chef Jong-won

470
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,869
and came to this realization.

471
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,505
There was a difference
between rounds for national athletes

472
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,073
compared to local leagues.

473
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,476
-Were the rounds different?
-Who are the national athletes?

474
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,711
It felt like
we were a team of national athletes

475
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,913
who haven't played together often.

476
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,616
But we're both excellent
in our leagues, right?

477
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,819
So this individual round
would be considered the local league.

478
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,656
He's saying this
in front of an ex-national soccer player.

479
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,492
-Because…
-Individual rounds are local leagues?

480
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,827
Stop making sports analogies.

481
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,196
-Cut it out.
-Why not?

482
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,898
Am I not allowed to use a word?

483
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,967
Stop using it like that.

484
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,337
I need to use this chance
to teach him a good lesson.

485
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,273
So you can win this one?

486
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,843
-Did he get lucky with the team round?
-Yes, he got lucky.

487
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,013
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
BEEF TENDERLOIN, PORK NECK, BEAN CURD

488
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,115
SOFT TOFU, MIXED SALAD,
CHICKEN STOCK, MAYONNAISE, OYSTER SAUCE

489
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,384
The name of my dish is this.

490
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,954
Refreshing Beef Tartare Whole Cake.

491
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,258
-Refreshing Beef Tartare Whole Cake.
-Refreshing Beef Tartare Whole Cake.

492
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,059
A whole cake.

493
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,929
-Tartar sauce? No, beef tartare?
-Tartare.

494
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,631
Refreshing Beef Tartare Whole Cake.

495
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,667
Of course, the key is beef tartare.

496
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,103
-Beef tartare.
-And something fresh?

497
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,406
He doesn't want the salad anymore,
but he must use up the veggies.

498
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,774
-It's a waste.
-Yes.

499
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,077
I want to give it another texture
by stir-frying everything.

500
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,879
In a nutshell, I'm making a cake.

501
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,752
Because I wanted to celebrate his wedding

502
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,589
-but never made him cake.
-A wedding cake?

503
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,559
I want to use this chance
to do that for him.

504
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,060
Beef tartare cake?

505
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,462
Beef tartare and rice.

506
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,831
-I'll also deep-fry pork.
-So it's a mix.

507
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,901
Poong and I
once starred in a cooking show together.

508
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,469
-What?
-Surprisingly, yes.

509
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,904
-We did.
-Back then…

510
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,707
Well, as soon as he mentioned
the word cake,

511
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,476
my trauma kicked in, my PTSD.

512
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,245
-Did something happen?
-Back then,

513
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,581
he made a cake
with <i>jjajangmyeon</i>, black bean noodles.

514
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,316
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i>?

515
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,418
I remember eating that back then.

516
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,954
If anyone offered
to delete one memory from my life…

517
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,455
A MEMORY HE WANTS TO FORGET

518
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,923
…it would be that one.

519
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,927
It'll basically look like a cake,
and I'll even make cream.

520
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,529
-Goodness.
-The cream…

521
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,964
Will you use lots of ingredients?

522
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,467
I'll make the cream
by using tofu and mayonnaise.

523
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,603
-What?
-What is it?

524
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,072
Poong once gave me a mix

525
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,040
of fresh cream
and black bean sauce <i>ramyeon.</i>

526
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,042
-With fresh cream?
-He fools around a lot.

527
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,777
I threw it all out.

528
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,180
-He threw it out.
-He'll do it again today.

529
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,749
He might bring back
the nightmare from that day.

530
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,584
WILL HE BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE NIGHTMARE?

531
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,587
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS: WHISKY, BEER,
COOKED OCTOPUS, OLIVE OIL, OLIVE, CABBAGE

532
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,823
SALTED SHRIMP, ROASTED EGG, PAPRIKA SALAD,
ORGANIC SALAD, CHERRY TOMATO, AND MORE

533
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,524
My dish is called

534
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,293
Don't Collapse, Octopus.

535
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,862
-Don't Collapse, Octopus?
-An octopus dish.

536
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,065
-I see!
-Don't Collapse, Octopus?

537
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,667
Mr. Kwak Joon-bin

538
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,169
is pretty much in my category.

539
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,672
I can tell what he likes
just by looking at him.

540
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,507
Is he bashing him?

541
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,142
I feel like I'm out there cooking.

542
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,144
You'll eat your dish with that mindset.

543
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,346
I often collapse because I'm not good
with big opportunities.

544
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,317
I'm kind of worried.

545
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,618
I always lose to the same person.

546
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,953
RELAPSING INTO POONGPHOBIA

547
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,655
You must take a different approach.

548
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,256
-Overcome this.
-Excellent.

549
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,791
I'll cook with your favorite, octopus,

550
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,827
and turn it into my style,
the Japanese-French cuisine.

551
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,663
I plan to use all my secrets.

552
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,398
I love Japanese-French dishes.

553
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,668
You mentioned that Portuguese dish, <i>polvo.</i>

554
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,503
-Wasn't that an octopus dish?
-Yes.

555
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,706
That was a Portuguese dish,
but I also love Japanese food a lot.

556
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,975
-I'm feeling good today.
-I look forward to it.

557
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,911
-Chef and my full fridge.
-Don't look at me, Poong.

558
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,179
Let the round begin.

559
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,214
I'm nervous.

560
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,118
-It's so cool, and I'm excited.
-Yes, really.

561
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,687
EVIL LAUGHTER!

562
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,822
CHEF AND MY FULL FRIDGE IS ABOUT TO BEGIN

563
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,624
He looks so evil.

564
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,092
Hey, Yoon Nam-no.

565
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,760
Dang it.

566
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,830
He's here to empty out Kwaktube's fridge.

567
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,866
The official leftovers guy,
Chef Yoon Nam-no!

568
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,537
But this guy is here
to empty out Nam-no's sanity.

569
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,174
The official Nam-no killer,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

570
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,075
How scary.

571
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,945
Which one of them
will give Kwaktube a fresh start?

572
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,082
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

573
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,885
Begin!

574
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,322
SLAM!

575
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,191
Doesn't Poong remind you of a wrestler?

576
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,525
HE USUALLY FIGHTS THE INGREDIENTS

577
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,895
He's making chili oil again.
Poong's chili oil.

578
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,063
As always, the oil first.

579
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,833
From the start?
Wait, the Japanese whisky.

580
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:48,767
That's an expensive…

581
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,436
From the start?
Wait, the Japanese whisky.

582
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,604
That's an expensive…

583
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,905
-It's a pricey bottle!
-Wait!

584
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,274
-Hey, wait.
-He's pouring alcohol!

585
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,112
-Wait, no!
-That bottle is really expensive!

586
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,214
-That Chinese liquor is expensive too!
-That too?

587
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,584
-I got it after a gig in China.
-It was an expensive bottle.

588
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,785
I'll buy you a bottle.

589
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:11,590
But the chefs are allowed to use
everything you brought here today.

590
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,226
-What do you plan to do with that?
-That's an expensive bottle.

591
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,429
I'm making braised octopus
called <i>yawarakani.</i>

592
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,997
THE WHOLE OCTOPUS GOES IN

593
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,199
He's referring to a Japanese braised dish.

594
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,569
The octopus will turn very soft
when you cook it in alcohol.

595
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,470
COOKING WINE

596
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,006
It's for you, Kwaktube.
You'll be eating it.

597
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,576
I'm looking forward to it
because he used so much liquor.

598
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,211
I'm expecting it to be really good.

599
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,747
-What's that now?
-That's olive oil.

600
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,048
That looks expensive too.

601
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,016
Olive oil.

602
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,186
-That's expensive too.
-He gets anxious at every bottle used.

603
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,155
THANKS TO HIM, POONG LOSES ALL ATTENTION

604
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,257
That's a waste.
You shouldn't waste it like that.

605
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,259
Learn to save on the ingredients.

606
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,928
Poong is taking the cost-effective route.

607
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,763
Webtoon Artist Poong uses tofu.

608
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,333
-Yes, it's tofu. Yes.
-He had bought lots of tofu for his diet.

609
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,569
-This is a good call.
-Of course.

610
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,438
NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE TRIES…

611
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,972
Look at the octopus.

612
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,674
-That's insane.
-It looks good.

613
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,943
He puts on a flashy performance.

614
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,479
It feels like a torch relay.

615
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,548
The torch is on fire.

616
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,349
2. BOIL OCTOPUS WITH GINGER

617
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,518
-He added ginger.
-It looks so good.

618
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,588
I came here thinking
I'll watch both of them,

619
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,691
-but I can't help but watch one of them.
-That's the case now.

620
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,193
We have to keep an eye on both,

621
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,328
but Nam-no has stolen
everyone's attention.

622
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,629
He's flashier than usual.

623
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,431
-It feels like he's determined.
-Yes.

624
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,099
He said he'd put in everything.

625
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,101
POONG USUALLY WOULDN'T LOSE THE ATTENTION

626
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,405
It looks like
Poong is about to grind something.

627
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,873
He puts those into a blender.

628
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,076
-Poong, are you not using the meat yet?
-Not yet.

629
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,880
-He needs to use beef tartare.
-We aren't seeing the beef tartare.

630
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,216
I've often had his dishes,

631
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,084
but it was never that professional.

632
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,185
PROFESSIONAL?

633
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,321
He usually threw in
a few sauces and boiled stuff.

634
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,457
-This is an official occasion.
-It's a battle.

635
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,626
-He'll be different.
-It's his new side.

636
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,095
You have about 12 minutes left.

637
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,864
-Time flies.
-Three minutes have gone by.

638
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,198
Three minutes are gone.

639
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,766
Green onion.

640
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,201
I guess he roasted that.

641
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,438
-He's adding green onion.
-He roasts it and throws it in.

642
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,572
Why did you add that?

643
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,040
To add a smoky flavor

644
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,710
and it adds a nice smell too.

645
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,345
He charred it a bit.

646
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,146
That fire is lasting a while.

647
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,848
It'll have a nice flavor.

648
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,617
WHAT ABOUT POONG'S BURNING HEART?

649
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,352
VINEGAR, SUGAR

650
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,320
Poong, is that mayonnaise?

651
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,222
-I love mayo.
-He loves that.

652
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,158
Kwaktube said he loved mayonnaise.

653
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,561
Poong, your dish looks too simple
compared to Nam-no's.

654
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,930
-Yes.
-His recipe is too flashy.

655
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,365
It's like baby food.

656
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,466
He's too flashy.

657
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:38,136
Are you stir-frying garlic cloves
with salted shrimp and olive oil?

658
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,838
It's usually made with anchovies,

659
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,273
called <i>bagna càuda.</i>

660
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,474
But he didn't have any.

661
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,242
No, so I added salted shrimp.

662
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,144
-That looks good.
-My gosh.

663
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,647
Nam-no is definitely on the flashier side.

664
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,081
-The air is so different.
-Right?

665
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,816
It's like a Michelin restaurant

666
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,618
and a school cafeteria.

667
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,887
Poong's dish looks too simple.

668
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,356
-But at times, school food can be better.
-Of course.

669
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,625
He's making beef tartare now.

670
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,261
Are you really making beef tartare?
Is he allowed to eat that?

671
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,697
Of course, it tastes great
when made with beef tenderloin.

672
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,566
-It's like beef sashimi.
-It looks like beef sashimi.

673
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,135
-Is it fresh?
-Is it fresh enough to eat?

674
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,337
-It has to be fresh.
-He just had some.

675
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,873
-He tastes it himself. It's okay.
-It's good.

676
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,709
He usually eats anything and everything.

677
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,744
Please check and see how fresh it is.

678
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,416
As we speak, the octopus is almost ready.

679
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,384
Must the octopus stay for a while?

680
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,154
I'll cook them a bit longer,
and then broil it.

681
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,089
The texture of the octopus
is very important to me.

682
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,491
-Of course.
-I really dread it when it's tough.

683
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,128
I see. Nam-no picked up
many ingredients to use.

684
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,398
-He doesn't spare them.
-He asked to clear out the fridge.

685
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,267
It's been five minutes,

686
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,603
but my heart is moving toward Chef Nam-no.

687
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,804
Look at the way he cuts.

688
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,807
DETAILED CUTS

689
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,277
-Chef Nam-no's recipe gets more attention.
-How scary.

690
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,814
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM

691
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,449
He's mad.

692
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,450
THE FIGHT FOR AIRTIME

693
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,252
It doesn't matter
how much noise Poong makes.

694
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,420
I'm only looking at him.

695
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,989
TICKED OFF

696
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,593
Yes, all of us are wondering
how Chef Nam-no's dish will turn out.

697
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,295
WHAT WILL HE GET RID OF NEXT?

698
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,864
He crushes the eggs with his hand.

699
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,766
I ate a lot of roasted eggs
during the diet.

700
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,934
What is that for?

701
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,037
For sauce ravigote, a French egg sauce.

702
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,705
I want to reinterpret that.

703
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,440
We can't hear him, Poong!

704
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,541
Will you be quiet?

705
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,876
INTERRUPTS BY CHOPPING

706
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,146
I'll chop the eggs and I'm going
to make a sauce called ravigote.

707
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,547
It's a classic French sauce.

708
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,882
Hey, there. Mister!

709
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,019
What? Are you telling me not to cook?
What am I supposed to do?

710
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,121
Just use scissors!

711
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,622
CHOPPING ACCELERATION MODE

712
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,224
Use scissors.

713
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,259
We didn't hear what that sauce was.

714
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,196
Nam-no said he'll cook
like his career depended on this.

715
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,099
It's usually made with olive oil,
but it'll be like tartar sauce today.

716
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,435
Like tartar sauce.

717
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,104
That sauce looks so good.
Did you use mayonnaise?

718
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,372
Yes, I did.

719
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,608
-That looks so good.
-It does.

720
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,476
You have 7 minutes and 50 seconds,
under 8 minutes.

721
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,878
Time flies so quickly.

722
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,513
Time passes by very fast.

723
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,216
I have a general idea
of what Poong's dish will be like.

724
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,486
-First, he made chili oil.
-He did.

725
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,854
I don't have any idea.

726
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,723
I have no idea what he's doing.

727
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,958
He's seasoning beef tartare
with oyster sauce.

728
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,394
Oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar.

729
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,396
Poong puts a lot of work
into the beef tartare.

730
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,799
-He mixes the meat.
-He's done.

731
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,734
You have under seven minutes now.

732
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,269
Can Poong finish within time?

733
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,505
-He's a bit slower today.
-He's falling behind.

734
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,040
Does he get 20 minutes?

735
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,310
Is the octopus ready?

736
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,611
It's ready!

737
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,814
THE OCTOPUS IS OUT

738
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,016
-It looks so good!
-The octopus!

739
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,685
He's now broiling the octopus.

740
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,287
My gosh. It smells good.

741
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,956
-I'm adding the soy sauce I boiled down.
-It smells great.

742
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,558
It smells wonderful.

743
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,993
Did you coat it
with the boiled down soy sauce again?

744
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,195
Yes, and I'll dip it too.

745
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,797
-It's the eel sauce.
-He dips it into the sauce again.

746
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,832
It smells so good.

747
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,934
ADDS THE SMOKY FLAVOR

748
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,435
-It looks so good.
-It does.

749
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,336
It's going back in.

750
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,506
-He's coating it again and again.
-Again.

751
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,176
That's how you cook eels,
putting it in and out of the sauce.

752
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,444
That brings out the flavor.

753
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,279
Is that what he's doing?

754
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,316
I hear you have to coat
the eel 30 times with the sauce.

755
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,584
It smells fantastic.

756
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,918
He's not going to lose.

757
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,453
Poong grabs pork.

758
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,721
-He grabs pork.
-Pork.

759
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,089
Will you serve that raw too?

760
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,557
No, I'll deep-fry this.

761
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,426
-That won't be served raw, right?
-Not that.

762
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,660
I'll deep-fry it!

763
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,862
-You'll deep-fry it?
-Yes.

764
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,763
Deep-fry?

765
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,165
He's serving fried food with raw food?

766
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,201
-Isn't that dangerous?
-It sounds dangerous.

767
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,369
No.

768
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,772
-He's slamming the cutting board.
-He is.

769
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,406
He's mincing the pork
he said he'd deep-fry.

770
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,476
-He's seasoning the pork.
-He's seasoning it before frying?

771
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,411
It's taking him too long to cook today.

772
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,646
Will he finish the cake?

773
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,816
-He grabs a mold.
-Will you deep-fry those in there?

774
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,119
-That's how he's deep-frying those.
-He puts the mold in the oil.

775
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,687
BROKEN REACTION

776
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,091
-He's deep-frying that.
-That's the cake sheet.

777
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,392
I see.

778
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,828
I didn't expect this from Poong.

779
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,163
Will the shape look okay?

780
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:02,100
He'll fail if it doesn't stay in shape.
It's over if they fall apart.

781
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,601
It looks like that's what will happen.

782
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,904
He just blocked it off in there.
I don't think he's making a mold.

783
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,239
-Sung-ju, please report from the kitchen.
-Yes?

784
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,741
Let me go out to the kitchen.

785
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,343
I'm in the kitchen
for Poong and Nam-no's battle.

786
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,681
You only confined them in here.
It isn't exactly a mold.

787
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,950
Is this beef tartare?

788
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,084
-Sung-ju!
-Yes?

789
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,186
Try the beef tartare.

790
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,554
Gosh…

791
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,856
Can you suggest something else?

792
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,491
That's an important aspect.

793
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,860
What if I eat it first and fall ill?

794
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,062
Gosh, is it okay to eat that, Poong?

795
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,497
-Yes, of course.
-Okay.

796
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,467
I'll take courage and try this,
the one I wanted to avoid.

797
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,669
This one.

798
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,671
-Yes.
-I will try the beef tartare.

799
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,339
-Poong's beef tartare!
-Okay.

800
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,340
Beef tartare.

801
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,375
Is the beef tartare refreshing?

802
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,411
Is the beef tartare refreshing?

803
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,812
NIBBLING…

804
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,681
Is it unpleasant?

805
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,082
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

806
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,350
It's unpleasant!

807
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,751
-Is it unpleasant?
-It's unpleasant!

808
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,220
-Why?
-It is unpleasant.

809
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,421
What's wrong?

810
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,389
It doesn't taste seasoned.

811
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,524
Gotcha. You're right.

812
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,059
-Right?
-You're right.

813
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,294
-Was it intentional?
-It was.

814
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,063
It felt like chewing on raw meat.

815
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,498
It wasn't quite seasoned.

816
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,900
WHAT ABOUT NAM-NO?

817
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:13,271
4. MAKE BAGNA CÀUDA BY GRINDING
ROASTED GARLIC AND SALTED SHRIMP

818
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,140
HE GRABS THE BROILING OCTOPUS TOO

819
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,776
-The octopus is out.
-The octopus.

820
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,512
HE CUTS IT INTO LARGE PIECES!

821
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,714
It looks good.

822
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,148
-The octopus.
-Jung-hwan!

823
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,352
-Yes? The sauce?
-This one from before. The sauce.

824
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,620
That looks good.

825
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,889
-I'll try this.
-Nam-no looks relaxed.

826
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,090
HANDING IT TO SUNG-JU

827
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,625
To let him have a taste?

828
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,860
-To let him taste it.
-I must eat it with the octopus!

829
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,362
He looks confident.

830
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,263
He's relaxed.

831
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,199
Will it stop him
from collapsing with Poongphobia?

832
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,269
WILL IT STOP HIM FROM COLLAPSING?

833
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,570
Of course, it's good.

834
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,506
Nam-no has won!

835
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,407
DANCING

836
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,742
Nam-no has won!

837
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,110
SPOILING THE ENDING(?)

838
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,678
Press the button now.

839
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,014
It's so good.

840
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,749
You put up a good fight.

841
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,651
He put a lot of work into the octopus.

842
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,652
Yes.

843
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,921
Nam-no is ready to get revenge.

844
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,724
-Yes, he put his life on the line.
-He came ready to get revenge on Poong.

845
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,693
You have two minutes and 30 seconds!

846
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,228
Is Poong's dish coming together?

847
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,263
He's stir-frying salad.

848
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,698
He's stir-frying it.

849
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,334
HE SURE IS
CLEANING OUT THE FRIDGE

850
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,769
4. MIX SALAD WITH VARIOUS SAUCES

851
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,437
But Poong's coming through.

852
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,605
I didn't see this before.

853
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,540
He's stir-frying
salad greens in chili oil.

854
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,876
NAM-NO BEGINS TO USE UP SALAD GREENS

855
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,412
Nam-no is using up lots of ingredients.

856
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,148
He uses everything in abundance.

857
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,651
Nam-no's recipe is sailing smoothly
compared to Poong.

858
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,487
What are you missing, Poong?

859
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,922
-What are you looking for?
-What?

860
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,290
-What do I do?
-What do you need?

861
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,125
-It's an emergency.
-An emergency.

862
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,694
What do you do with this?

863
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,295
He's scooping it with a spoon.

864
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,964
He couldn't find tongs.

865
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,932
-He couldn't find any tongs.
-Chopsticks?

866
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,300
-Hurry.
-Grab a cloth.

867
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,368
-Get it out.
-No tongs?

868
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,436
-Damn it.
-Poong!

869
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,503
-Get it out.
-No tongs?

870
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,538
-Damn it.
-Poong!

871
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,073
-It came apart!
-Poong!

872
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,741
-Damn it. It's ruined.
-Tongs!

873
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,143
Poong, I found the tongs.

874
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,878
-It's already over.
-It is?

875
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,647
It should've turned into a sheet.

876
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,416
-It all came apart.
-It's okay.

877
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,518
-Is it? It's still too hot.
-It's okay.

878
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,087
You have 1 minute and 20 seconds.

879
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,888
CHECKS THE TIME

880
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,691
Broiled cabbage tastes so good.

881
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,159
He begins to serve the dish.

882
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,794
Nam-no serves his dish.

883
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,831
Poong's dish got ruined,
so I want to root for him.

884
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,202
-What's on the rice?
-Chili oil and rice?

885
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,737
-He's mixing it with rice.
-Chili oil rice.

886
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:26,938
I don't like spicy food.

887
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,440
He's mixing chili oil with rice!

888
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,808
What is this?

889
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,844
-Sung-ju, will you try that?
-Yes?

890
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,312
This?

891
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,080
I don't have to taste it.

892
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,716
-Try it, though.
-What on earth is this?

893
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,418
I've never seen it, either. It's a wonder.

894
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,721
Poong must've thought
Nam-no was such an easy fight.

895
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,158
-The chili oil rice.
-He mixed instant rice with chili oil.

896
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,127
Is it refreshing or unpleasant?

897
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,695
It's totally unpleasant!

898
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,464
What on earth is this?

899
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,433
-Forty seconds.
-Hurry up.

900
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,001
He's in a bit of an emergency today.

901
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,770
Will Poong's dish be ready?

902
00:33:58,836 --> 00:33:59,971
If you watch the show,

903
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,040
everything happens in the last 30 seconds.

904
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,410
-Thirty seconds!
-He spread out rice at the bottom.

905
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,245
It could be delicious together.

906
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,547
Yes, he fried the pork pieces.

907
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,848
-Beef tartare.
-He's building it.

908
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,483
-Hurry up.
-Twenty seconds.

909
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,052
Poong continues to build.

910
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,820
-Hurry up.
-Twenty seconds.

911
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,622
You have to wrap up too.

912
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,990
NAM-NO SPEEDS UP TOO

913
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,694
It looks like Nam-no is almost done.

914
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,962
Fifteen seconds!

915
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,597
-Fifteen seconds!
-Beef tartare.

916
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,733
STILL STEAMING…

917
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,535
-He needs something else.
-The sauce.

918
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,004
-Seven!
-Seven. Six.

919
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,740
-Five. Four. Three.
-Five. Four. Three.

920
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,074
Eight. Seven.

921
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,076
OLIVE OIL

922
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,177
Five.

923
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,112
AND THE BAGNA CÀUDA SAUCE

924
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,613
Two. One.

925
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,183
Please wrap it up. Wrap up.

926
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,517
Nam-no finishes first.

927
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,518
RIP

928
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,454
MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A CAKE IN THIS WHILE

929
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,756
-Just pour it over.
-Two. One.

930
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,425
-He pours the ground sauce.
-The cream.

931
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,761
The sauce he ground finishes the dish.

932
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,029
Okay. Cut!

933
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,065
It does looks like a cake finished.

934
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,700
A MAGICAL 30 SECONDS

935
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,769
It looks like a cake.

936
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,473
The dishes are both ready.

937
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,408
It doesn't look bad up close.

938
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,143
-Right?
-It looks like a cake.

939
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,579
-Fifteen minutes feel different here.
-Right?

940
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,215
It felt like five minutes.

941
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,417
They really only get 15 minutes.

942
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,254
Both dishes are made for Kwaktube.

943
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,756
What was it like
to watch the cook-off in real life?

944
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,825
I got chills when they began.

945
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,861
<i>I was moved by the fact that I was here.</i>

946
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,763
It's a wonder
that he made this in 15 minutes.

947
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,566
But take a look at that.

948
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,203
-Poong's dish looks better than expected.
-It might be good.

949
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,975
I noticed a spark of genius
that Poong had when he topped

950
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,477
the red rice and red raw meat
with white cream.

951
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,513
-It looks like a red velvet cake.
-It does.

952
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,248
-What are you talking about?
-Red velvet?

953
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,416
What does he have on you?

954
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,918
A red velvet cake?

955
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,921
-You noticed.
-You always compliment Poong.

956
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,756
I think he's possessed by a ghost.

957
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,224
That was his intention.

958
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,793
I think he tried to give it
the red velvet cake colors.

959
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,229
-I see.
-I doubt that.

960
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,833
Please try Chef Nam-no's dish first.

961
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,767
Don't Collapse, Octopus.

962
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,504
REFRESHING SALAD MEETS BRAISED OCTOPUS

963
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,810
A VARIETY OF FLAVOR
WITH SAUCE RAVIGOTE AND CABBAGE

964
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,849
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S DON'T COLLAPSE, OCTOPUS

965
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:25,816
May I serve it?

966
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,418
GOING OUT TO SERVE THE SAUCE

967
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,587
IN THAT WHILE, HE TAKES A PHOTO

968
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,389
How did he do this in 15 minutes?

969
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,391
-May I really eat this?
-Of course.

970
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,262
LOTS OF SAUCE

971
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,697
The smell of that whisky.

972
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,933
I haven't tried that sauce.

973
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,635
You can have the salad as a refresher

974
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,903
and if you need more seasoning.

975
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,738
-I see.
-Please enjoy it.

976
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,775
-Enjoy it as much as you want.
-It's for the fridge owner.

977
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,276
He said he loved octopus.

978
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,945
-Yes.
-It looks so good.

979
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,346
I hope it's tender.

980
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,281
He brought a delicious one.

981
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,849
And he puts the sauce on it.

982
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,919
AND A PIECE OF CABBAGE

983
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,157
He tries the roasted cabbage too.

984
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,425
He ate everything at once.

985
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,830
The texture of the octopus,
the flavor of the sauce,

986
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,866
-and the feel of the cabbage.
-I hope the octopus isn't tough.

987
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,902
-He shows no response.
-He doesn't say anything.

988
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,704
-There's this face he makes.
-Yes.

989
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,106
He frowns
when he eats something delicious.

990
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,174
I'm not seeing that.

991
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,944
-You usually do that right away.
-He isn't showing his "delicious face."

992
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,680
-He frowns right away.
-You know that frown, right?

993
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,450
-I guess it isn't that good.
-There's this frown.

994
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,151
Can you try the front?

995
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,987
HE QUIETLY TAKES
ANOTHER BITE OF THE OCTOPUS

996
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,123
-Will he collapse?
-Is it too tough?

997
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,425
Can you try the thinner legs?

998
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,594
-Will he collapse?
-Try the legs.

999
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,962
His Poongphobia!

1000
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,298
UNSURE?

1001
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,100
He seems very particular.

1002
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,935
But it smelled overwhelmingly good.

1003
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,204
It's good. It's so good…

1004
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,740
IT IS GOOD BUT…

1005
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,975
But my expectations were way too high.

1006
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,012
You shouldn't give him the expectation.

1007
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,147
SEEING THE WHOLE PROCESS
RAISED HIS EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH

1008
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,715
-That's insane.
-It looks so good.

1009
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,152
I expected a flavor that'll make me fly
like how they do in comic books.

1010
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,054
Did you expect to be amazed after a bite?

1011
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,356
Yes, so I was wondering
how I should respond.

1012
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,458
It must be subtle.

1013
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,327
You have to chew to find the flavor.

1014
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,461
ANOTHER BITE RIGHT AWAY

1015
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,096
AND ANOTHER

1016
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,999
It's kind of addictive.
I love how it smells.

1017
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,401
Like it was cooked over charcoal.

1018
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,002
<i>I love that smoky flavor.</i>

1019
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,204
It also goes well with the sauce,
and it's absolutely delicious.

1020
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:28,906
It's really good.

1021
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,144
What about the salad?
You're sick and tired of it now.

1022
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,346
No, it goes so well together.

1023
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,248
BOWS

1024
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,484
-A simple salad often eaten in Europe.
-A simple one.

1025
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,421
Overall, these dishes are a bit greasy,
so it goes well together.

1026
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,423
A PERFECT MATCH WITH SALAD

1027
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,758
He makes me curious to hear that.

1028
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,026
The thing is…

1029
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,895
CHEWING

1030
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,596
…it's a bit tough.

1031
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,099
It's a shame
that the octopus was precooked.

1032
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,001
It would've been softer
if the octopus was raw.

1033
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,704
The octopus was very soft
at that restaurant, so this is a shame.

1034
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,172
It's my octopus's fault.

1035
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,507
You have such a beautiful way with words.

1036
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,443
You don't have to collapse.

1037
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,045
-It's so good.
-All right, now.

1038
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,114
Refreshing Beef Tartare Whole Cake.

1039
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:16,354
WEDDING CAKE IN POONG'S STYLE

1040
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,392
A MIX OF BEEF TARTARE, CHILI OIL, AND RICE

1041
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,997
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
REFRESHING BEEF TARTARE WHOLE CAKE

1042
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,467
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

1043
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,770
I should've poured chili oil on top,
but I left it out.

1044
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,839
-It's at the bottom.
-I want it on the top.

1045
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,307
You'll make it bleed on both sides?

1046
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,576
Yes, I have to top it off with this.

1047
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,411
I don't think it's necessary.

1048
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,814
Did he run out of time?
He's bringing out lots of stuff.

1049
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,449
-He's performing.
-What are you doing?

1050
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,184
-It's…
-You know I can't take spicy food, right?

1051
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,153
-What?
-You know I can't eat spicy food.

1052
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,122
-He didn't.
-Well…

1053
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,289
I do.

1054
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,592
IT'S EVIDENT THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW

1055
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,694
Chef Jong-won

1056
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,663
<i>once brought out this candle</i>

1057
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,832
<i>whenever the guest had to celebrate.</i>

1058
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,169
So I borrowed this from him.

1059
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,638
-Because he always has one?
-I always do.

1060
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:08,939
-Just in case.
-Right?

1061
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,207
On the dish?

1062
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,710
He'll stick it on the dish and light it.

1063
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,178
-Just like that?
-That's nice.

1064
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,814
-That looks nice.
-He's creating a narrative.

1065
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,783
-The chili oil.
-Where will that go?

1066
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,419
-My gosh.
-You probably shouldn't have done it.

1067
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,553
-Goodness.
-Why not?

1068
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,823
I don't really like chili oil.

1069
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,325
It looks bloody.

1070
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,961
-So this is my wedding cake?
-Yes.

1071
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,364
Not a cursing cake?

1072
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,667
-Why did he do that?
-Are you happy that I'm married?

1073
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,835
Yes, of course.

1074
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,970
-Well…
-Congrats on your wedding.

1075
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,072
-Thank you.
-The wedding cake?

1076
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,441
I'll blow the candle.

1077
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,277
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1078
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,145
-We wanted to celebrate.
-Yes.

1079
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,046
How can he eat this?

1080
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,649
You just have to lift the plastic cover.

1081
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,551
-This?
-The plastic cover.

1082
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,554
After that, the cream will flow down,

1083
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,656
and it'll melt.

1084
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,825
Yes, that's how it's supposed to be.

1085
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,859
-Okay.
-Pull it out.

1086
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,262
It didn't melt.

1087
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,332
-Oh, no.
-It didn't melt.

1088
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,367
-It looks like strawberry syrup.
-It didn't melt.

1089
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,937
-It's tough to eat.
-Can he cut through that?

1090
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,372
He brought a cake knife. Oh, man.

1091
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,374
-Since it's a cake.
-Yes, it is.

1092
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,877
-You two should cut it together.
-Shall we?

1093
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,013
-They're cutting it together.
-Thank you.

1094
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,049
-I love you.
-I love you.

1095
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,820
It looks like the cake is falling apart.

1096
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,456
I hope it doesn't fall apart.

1097
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,825
ANXIOUS

1098
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,894
Was this called Don't Collapse?

1099
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,330
Good. Just like that.

1100
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,198
And now I'll serve it for you.

1101
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,299
QUICKLY GRABS A CAKE SERVER

1102
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,269
You can probably scoop it with a spoon.

1103
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,705
-Is that bibimbap?
-He better just eat it as is.

1104
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,341
-It looks awkward.
-It's actually a dish you eat

1105
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,276
by mixing everything.

1106
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,012
That cake was going to get mixed anyway.

1107
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,449
He's mixing everything,
including the beef tartare

1108
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,117
and deep-fried pork.

1109
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,952
It's a better reflection of the order.

1110
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,688
It looks like a dish
that used all leftovers in my fridge.

1111
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,490
-He put in everything.
-He threw in everything.

1112
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,391
I wonder what it's like.

1113
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,827
It's a mix of tofu and mayo,
so it's not too greasy.

1114
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,495
-He likes mayo.
-He's taking a bite.

1115
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:12,997
Kwaktube!

1116
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,899
WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE?

1117
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,333
It might be delicious.

1118
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,504
He said he threw away
the first dish Poong made for him.

1119
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,906
-He's smiling.
-Wait.

1120
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,340
-He's different from before.
-No way.

1121
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,509
HE SENSES THE USUAL DANGER

1122
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,510
Nam-no looks sad.

1123
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,779
-Why? Again?
-It must be good.

1124
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,448
-It's an endless repetition of this.
-It must be good.

1125
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:33,817
It's so good.

1126
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,388
Is it?

1127
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,590
CAN'T BELIEVE OUR EYES

1128
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,926
You have to be honest about this.

1129
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,194
Everyone could see
that it looked too greasy.

1130
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,229
It's not as greasy.

1131
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,231
The cream was made of tofu,

1132
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,267
so it wasn't like greasy cream.
It tastes clean.

1133
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,103
It only works against the spiciness.

1134
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,371
It must keep the balance.

1135
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,439
The balance is great.

1136
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,741
It has a great balance.

1137
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,144
I thought the beef tartare would be odd,

1138
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,247
<i>but the balance is nice</i>
<i>when it's served with cooked meat.</i>

1139
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,683
It could've been too greasy
if he served just the meat,

1140
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,319
-but he served it with salad.
-Oh, no. Chef Nam-no.

1141
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,754
There's a fad among younger people

1142
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:14,625
<i>of making a wrap of beef tartare</i>
<i>with grilled brisket.</i>

1143
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,294
-With beef tartare?
-It was a trendy dish.

1144
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,932
It didn't taste like anything
when I had just the beef.

1145
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,634
-Is it good?
-It is.

1146
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:24,535
It is?

1147
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,706
It's not greasy, thanks to the salad,
and it adds a nice texture.

1148
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,409
I like the new texture he made
with the boring salad greens.

1149
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,445
BOWING

1150
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:38,449
Please try Chef Nam-no's dish first.

1151
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:41,852
It's good.

1152
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,488
It's not too stimulating,

1153
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,490
-and even a bit bland.
-Bland.

1154
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:47,591
But it tastes classy.

1155
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,762
It's the type of dish you continue to eat
because it doesn't taste strong.

1156
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,098
-That's an aspect.
-Isn't that so?

1157
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,377
The portion of the octopus I had

1158
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,079
was the very front,
so it wasn't too tough.

1159
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,914
I enjoyed it.

1160
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:15,519
Next, let's try Webtoon Artist Poong's
controversial dish.

1161
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,888
Refreshing Beef Tartare Whole Cake.

1162
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,523
You have to try beef and pork together.

1163
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,691
There's fried meat.

1164
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:21,592
Poong.

1165
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,693
I'M TRYING THIS

1166
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,528
Good. I'm proud of you.

1167
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,102
-Wait. Was it too strong for him?
-Swallow it.

1168
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,772
Was Poong's dish too much?

1169
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,073
Will he spit it out?

1170
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,975
Will Poong collapse like this?

1171
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,209
Woo-jae…

1172
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,112
Woo-jae isn't the type…

1173
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,515
-Like pills.
-He swallowed it.

1174
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,718
You must attack Woo-jae's appetite
with a whole different approach.

1175
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,253
I already know that.

1176
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,723
-Woo-jae wouldn't like this anyway.
-I didn't expect him to.

1177
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,459
The beef tartare in this dish

1178
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,328
-felt like tuna in poke dishes.
-You're right.

1179
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:02,032
-And the tofu cream was like avocado.
-It must be true.

1180
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,235
It's like having a bowl of poke
in sunny California.

1181
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,336
Why are you doing this?

1182
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,239
He was reminded of sunny California.

1183
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,008
It reminded me of bibimbap

1184
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,744
and the fried rice you eat
after pork belly.

1185
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,181
It even felt like triangular <i>gimbap</i>
with lots of mayonnaise.

1186
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,949
It was exquisite.

1187
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,819
<i>I thought he halfheartedly shot mayo</i>
<i>into the tofu,</i>

1188
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,153
but the balance was perfect.

1189
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,455
-It's seasoned well.
-It is.

1190
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,823
I realized this as I ate these.

1191
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,225
Of course, my expectations
were worlds apart.

1192
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,594
<i>The octopus didn't meet my expectation,</i>

1193
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,397
while this was much better,
so they're on par now.

1194
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:37,267
The octopus wasn't too strong,
yet it smelled good, so I kept eating it.

1195
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,870
But the mix of chili oil
and mayonnaise was so good.

1196
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,338
After about three bites though,

1197
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,639
I got sick of it a little.

1198
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,910
-It's a close match between them.
-They're so different.

1199
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,679
I see.

1200
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,482
-It's a close match?
-Yes.

1201
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,051
At this point in time, he has the ability

1202
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,320
to make chili oil
like he owned a restaurant business.

1203
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,755
You can even sell it.

1204
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,857
It's good, but just as he mentioned,

1205
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,226
I hesitated before taking another bite.

1206
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,261
You're not supposed to eat a lot of cake.

1207
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,330
You only eat a single slice.

1208
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,397
That's true.

1209
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:11,135
-You have a point.
-And he said he was going to make a cake.

1210
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,170
-Yes, we only eat a slice.
-They're on par.

1211
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,338
It's hard to choose.

1212
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,573
<i>Press one for Yoon Nam-no,</i>

1213
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,208
<i>and two for Kim Poong.</i>

1214
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,944
Press one.

1215
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,814
-It was only a hair's difference.
-A hair of difference.

1216
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,949
Which one of them won?

1217
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,652
Yoon Nam-no versus Kim Poong.
Let's find out.

1218
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,689
Chef and my full fridge.

1219
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,192
-I can't watch this.
-Yoon Nam-no versus Kim Poong.

1220
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,294
Poong won three times in a row
in individual matches.

1221
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,429
Will Nam-no overcome his Poongphobia?

1222
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,632
Or will it become more serious?

1223
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,300
Who did Kwaktube choose?

1224
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,935
Which one is it?

1225
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,105
Who's the winner?

1226
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,107
OH MY GOODNESS

1227
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:51,508
Who's the winner?

1228
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,944
KIM POONG WINS

1229
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,312
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG WINS

1230
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,147
It's Kim Poong!

1231
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,448
WHAT HAPPENED?

1232
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,284
Kim Poong wins!

1233
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,386
His Poongphobia continues.

1234
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,756
-Nam-no lost to Poong four times in a row.
-Four in a row?

1235
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,357
Did we expect too much?

1236
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:11,695
I guess I wanted to eat something
with a stronger flavor right now.

1237
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,731
It tasted similar
to the dishes I ate during my diet

1238
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,700
-Right.
-It was lightly flavored.

1239
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,503
But his dish was very strong,
and I focused on the flavors.

1240
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,972
-I see.
-He's something.

1241
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,273
What now, Nam-no?

1242
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,975
His eye bags are worse.

1243
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,009
I just

1244
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,478
want to quit and go home right now.

1245
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,813
Oh, no.

1246
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,348
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL…

1247
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,750
I want to do away
with the ominous four losses in a row

1248
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,687
by turning it into five very soon.

1249
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,590
-Lose once more.
-Four is an ominous number.

1250
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,592
HE'S SUCH A NICE GUY

1251
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,127
-Please put a star on him.
-Good work.

1252
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,064
-Is this his tenth win?
-Ten stars?

1253
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,700
-It's his tenth star, his tenth win!
-I gave him two digits?

1254
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,837
-Poong takes his tenth victory!
-I hope you'll be happy.

1255
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,041
Four of them are from Nam-no.

1256
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,378
NAM-NO BROUGHT HIM UP BY 40%

1257
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:05,549
<i>This is the second cook-off</i>
<i>with ingredients from Kwaktube's fridge.</i>

1258
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,085
The two national romantics are up.

1259
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,954
From Italy, the romantic of Naples,

1260
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,023
Chef Antimo.

1261
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,424
From Korea,

1262
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:18,629
the lover boy of Ujangsan Mountain,
Chef Sam Kim.

1263
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:19,696
Gosh, Ujangsan Mountain?

1264
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,132
-Yes.
-A great mountain in the Gangseo area.

1265
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,134
Chef Sam is someone

1266
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,303
who goes straight home after a shoot.

1267
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,105
-That's right.
-He never even looks back.

1268
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,207
-For his family.
-He's the first.

1269
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:31,642
He never stays for dinner.

1270
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,044
-He does.
-He must go home early for his wife.

1271
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,046
And you always cook breakfast.

1272
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,215
-Yes.
-I heard that somewhere.

1273
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,585
-How sweet.
-I made my son egg over rice and avocado,

1274
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:45,389
and for my wife, apples,
boiled eggs, and coffee as breakfast.

1275
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,126
I like to drink espresso,

1276
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,627
but she wanted instant coffee,

1277
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,429
so I went to the market and got some.

1278
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,031
GETS SOME FOR HER RIGHT AWAY

1279
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,265
How nice.

1280
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,968
-You should date a guy like him.
-I should. He's the best.

1281
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,136
He's such a romantic.

1282
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,939
But Chef Antimo is also a huge romantic.

1283
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,442
His wife delivered a daughter
just a month ago.

1284
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,089
He says it's a given.

1285
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,892
-But Sam is even more amazing.
-How so?

1286
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,495
He wanted to give good food
to his pregnant wife,

1287
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,031
so he mastered the <i>Dongui Bogam,</i>
a book on traditional Korean medicine.

1288
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,600
-Are you serious?
-Really?

1289
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,536
-Isn't that too much?
-Seriously?

1290
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,137
The food is medicine approach?

1291
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:37,541
-This probably wasn't a joke.
-I think he made that up.

1292
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,776
I did study it in parts.

1293
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,345
For your wife?

1294
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,147
-My wife gets cold easily,
-That's amazing.

1295
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,449
and her hands and feet get cold.

1296
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,484
-I want to date a man like that.
-So I studied that

1297
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,053
to remove everything
that makes your body cold.

1298
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,657
I mostly cooked her food
with the ingredients that warm her up.

1299
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,892
-My gosh.
-How cool.

1300
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,861
-He's such a romantic.
-He really is.

1301
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,029
He's like Heo Jun, the writer.

1302
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,866
-Sam Jun.
-He's Sam Jun.

1303
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,302
-Sam Jun.
-Sam Jun?

1304
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,503
But his last name is Heo.

1305
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,472
-Sam Heo Jun.
-But his last name is Heo.

1306
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,307
CHANGE HIS LAST NAME TO SAM

1307
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,777
Chef Antimo,
do you think you can win against Sam?

1308
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,198
-He'll cancel his subscription.
-He'll cancel his Netflix subscription?

1309
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,700
Hmph.

1310
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,770
CHEF ANTIMO'S INGREDIENTS:
COOKED OCTOPUS, SQUID, MILK, OLIVE OIL

1311
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,972
LOW SUGAR GOCHUJANG,
CHERRY TOMATO, ORGANIC SALAD

1312
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,608
What are you making, Chef Antimo?

1313
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,109
Antiamo.

1314
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,244
Antiamo?

1315
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,680
Ti amo.

1316
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,449
Ti amo, Antiamo.

1317
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,884
-Antiamo.
-With his name.

1318
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,388
He mastered Korean-style jokes.

1319
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,475
It's a fusion dish.

1320
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,579
-It's a fusion dish.
-It sounds good.

1321
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,515
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
BEEF TENDERLOIN, BEEF SIRLOIN

1322
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,584
OLIVE, CHERRY TOMATO,
PARMESAN, OYSTER SAUCE

1323
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,087
The dish I'm making today is

1324
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,988
Safe Delivery Pasta.

1325
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,558
-Safe Delivery Pasta.
-Safe Delivery Pasta?

1326
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,927
SAFE DELIVERY PASTA

1327
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,763
It says women should eat a lot of meat
when they're almost due.

1328
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,664
You're right.

1329
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,700
-And pregnant ladies do eat lots of meat.
-Of course.

1330
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,970
I want to make
braised short ribs in 10 to 12 minutes.

1331
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:50,240
-Braised short ribs?
-Braised short ribs? That's crazy.

1332
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,309
I'll make fresh pasta

1333
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,544
so that you can mix
the leftover sauce with it.

1334
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,079
Really? That sounds good.

1335
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,714
-In 15 minutes?
-And the pasta

1336
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,282
I'm making is called pappardelle,

1337
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,184
a kind of pasta on the thicker side.

1338
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,752
I want to make that fresh

1339
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,021
and hope that she has a safe delivery.

1340
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,057
That's the gist behind my pasta.

1341
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,159
AMAZED

1342
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,794
Is this from <i>Dongui Bogam?</i>

1343
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,329
It is.

1344
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:13,830
This pasta is in that book?

1345
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,366
-It has pappardelle?
-Pappardelle?

1346
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,902
I love the meaning behind both dishes.

1347
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,372
I feel so bad
that I must be the judge of this.

1348
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,840
It's such a huge match.

1349
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,076
-I'm nervous too.
-I see.

1350
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,713
We're about to begin this match

1351
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,315
between Antiamo and Safe Delivery Pasta.

1352
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,085
The romantic boss from Naples,

1353
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,953
Chef Antimo is up for the challenge.

1354
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,356
The fertility deity of Ujangsan Mountain

1355
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,625
who prays for her safe delivery,

1356
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,593
-Fertility deity?
-Chef Sam Kim is also up.

1357
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,897
Who'll win
this national match between romantics?

1358
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,033
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1359
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,273
This is such a significant match.

1360
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,409
He's getting the eggs right away.

1361
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,378
-He put it into milk.
-Milk and egg.

1362
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,579
What? Milk?

1363
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,081
-Olive oil.
-Olive oil? What could that be?

1364
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,885
Scialatielli is a unique pasta
made with milk and eggs.

1365
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,053
Really?

1366
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,222
-In the dough itself.
-In the dough?

1367
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,324
Does it make the pasta taste better?

1368
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,493
It'll add more protein.

1369
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,896
Is that area the only place
where you can eat that pasta?

1370
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,166
All pastas have
their own origin locations.

1371
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,836
That's something you eat in Naples,
to be more specific, in the Amalfi region.

1372
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,238
So it's quite ordinary there?

1373
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,106
Yes, in that area.

1374
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,375
-Is he making pasta?
-It's fresh pasta.

1375
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:34,611
He's making fresh pasta.

1376
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,248
Chef Antimo from Naples

1377
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:40,784
versus Sam Kim,
the best Italian chef in Korea.

1378
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,053
HE STARTS BY CHOPPING ONION!

1379
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,521
ONION, GREEN ONION

1380
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,089
He's not cooking the short ribs.

1381
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,658
-Throw the meat in first.
-Shouldn't you do that first?

1382
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,926
Cook the meat.

1383
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,494
-You need to move quickly.
-Yes.

1384
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,163
He's making the sauce
for braised short ribs.

1385
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,599
Oyster sauce and black pepper.

1386
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:56,800
And minced ginger?

1387
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,101
-Yes, it's ginger.
-Garlic?

1388
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,736
-Minced garlic.
-Minced garlic.

1389
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,205
Sam's moving very quickly right now.

1390
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:07,277
It would be wonderful to see
Antimo's hair get messy in 15 minutes.

1391
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,713
The two sides seem to have
different background music playing.

1392
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,081
You're right.

1393
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,483
Their speeds are different.

1394
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,584
SAM IS FASTER
AT THE 15-MIN COOK-OFF

1395
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,654
It seems like Chef Antimo is cooking
while listening to classical music.

1396
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,890
He looks relaxed after making the dough.
He even switches his gloves.

1397
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,759
He doesn't knead it all the way.

1398
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,794
He stops in the middle.

1399
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,730
He's preparing squid.

1400
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,331
Chef Antimo gets the squid out.

1401
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,500
He must be using seafood for his pasta.

1402
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:31,935
You said you liked seafood.

1403
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,403
He'll use squid and octopus.

1404
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,238
-He's also using the octopus?
-Yes.

1405
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,807
-I'm worried it'll be too tough.
-Right?

1406
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,342
It won't be easy.

1407
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,744
I hope it isn't tough.

1408
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,680
He's using meat now for the braised dish.

1409
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,781
It's sirloin.

1410
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:45,882
-Sirloin.
-With sirloin.

1411
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,150
He's cutting it into small pieces.

1412
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,754
He's using sirloin to make
braised short ribs,

1413
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,988
so he can save some time.

1414
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,857
-It's not actual ribs.
-No.

1415
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,625
-What's that?
-Tenderloin.

1416
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,494
Tenderloin.
He's using both that and sirloin.

1417
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,695
It'll be tender.

1418
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,863
That's nice.

1419
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,832
That'll come out like braised short ribs.

1420
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:03,800
INTO THE PRESSURE COOKER!

1421
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,302
-He'll start cooking.
-Close the lid properly.

1422
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,705
-He's steaming it.
-He's going to steam it in the cooker.

1423
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,876
Chef Antimo seems so relaxed.

1424
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,377
He threw in garlic and onion,

1425
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,713
so he must be making tomato sauce.

1426
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,714
What? Now?

1427
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,182
Really?

1428
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,618
He's going to make
tomato sauce from scratch?

1429
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:22,585
Wait.

1430
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,521
Does he know those are Stevia tomatoes?

1431
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,756
-What?
-Those are Stevia tomatoes?

1432
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,325
He should try it.

1433
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,593
-Really?
-You should try it.

1434
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,896
Those aren't the usual cherry tomatoes.

1435
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,230
WILL HE CONTINUE LIKE THIS?

1436
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,100
He's not listening to music, is he?

1437
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,435
PROVIDING INTERPRETATION

1438
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,769
-Taste it.
-Chef Antimo.

1439
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,906
BUT WHAT IF THE NEAPOLITAN(?) STEPS IN?

1440
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,710
Chef, have you tried the tomatoes?

1441
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,111
What now?

1442
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,313
-Have you tried the tomatoes?
-No.

1443
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,248
Those are Stevia tomatoes.

1444
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,850
He should try it.

1445
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:54,918
Isn't it sweet?

1446
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,554
-It must be sweet. He's okay with it.
-He's okay with it.

1447
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,855
It must taste really sweet.

1448
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,623
It's not bad.

1449
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,492
Chef Sung-jun's Italian was really cool.

1450
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,727
-Really?
-Yes.

1451
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,729
Try some more.

1452
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,930
No.

1453
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,565
I can't have that cool image.

1454
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,934
He's making tomato sauce.

1455
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,869
He's making tomato sauce himself.

1456
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,871
Is he making pomodoro?

1457
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,373
Pomodoro is just tomato in Italian.

1458
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,374
FLINCHING

1459
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,408
-Really?
-Yes.

1460
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,576
Really?

1461
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,144
He makes me feel embarrassed.

1462
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,047
So what now? You're an Italian?

1463
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,248
Look at you.

1464
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,584
-He is.
-Are you the interpreter?

1465
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,486
It's all right.

1466
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,554
-I didn't know either.
-Okay.

1467
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:32,989
I still had to explain it.

1468
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,425
Can you be nicer when you talk?

1469
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,660
He's also using cherry tomatoes.

1470
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,930
These are dishes for his pregnant wife,

1471
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,866
so he's making it with a healthy recipe.

1472
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:46,803
He means that he made this dish
for his wife at home, right?

1473
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,072
-Yes.
-That's what he did.

1474
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,908
He's saying his wife had safe delivery
after eating this.

1475
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,878
This is a round he has to win.

1476
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,212
Anyway, he seems so relaxed.

1477
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,249
He's making the pasta dough now.

1478
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,787
4. MIX FLOUR AND EGGS IN A BLENDER
TO MAKE THE DOUGH

1479
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:04,988
What's going on?

1480
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,523
-It's too wet.
-It is.

1481
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,057
Yes, it's wet.

1482
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,126
-It's too wet.
-What are you making, Sam?

1483
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,294
Pasta dough.

1484
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,796
But it looks too wet.

1485
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,932
-It's very different from Chef Antimo.
-It is.

1486
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,500
This one is wet, but that one is…

1487
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,103
He adds some more flour.

1488
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,071
Will the beef get braised in time?

1489
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,540
The pressure isn't working.

1490
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,774
The heat is too low too.

1491
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,643
Raise the heat. What are you doing?

1492
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,478
-Why is it so low?
-Why are you saving gas?

1493
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,748
He's making me frustrated.

1494
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:32,649
He's mad.

1495
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,551
HE MAKES THE SPECTATORS ANXIOUS

1496
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,053
If the braised beef is tough,
that means you'll fail.

1497
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,756
If you get the viscosity
of fresh pasta dough wrong,

1498
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,525
it's tough to find the balance
and save the dough.

1499
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,993
You'll have to keep adding more stuff.

1500
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,495
More flour.

1501
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:49,532
Sung-jun means that Sam is having
a tough time trying to control the batter.

1502
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,667
That's right.

1503
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,537
-Why are you so calm?
-He seems calm.

1504
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,507
You have eight minutes!
Shouldn't you start cooking the noodles?

1505
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,876
-They both ignore you.
-He's using octopus!

1506
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,644
He grabs the octopus as we speak!

1507
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,680
Unlike me, he's making thin slices.

1508
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,815
I see. He did that on purpose.

1509
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,283
-Yes.
-And squid.

1510
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,351
He's using squid too.

1511
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,120
He removed the skin already.

1512
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:12,689
No, never mind.

1513
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:15,758
-He's doing it now.
-He's peeling it off.

1514
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,961
He heard me and did it.
Do you understand Korean?

1515
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,465
-He's cooking as you tell him.
-He is.

1516
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,800
This is crazy.

1517
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,269
-He's making cuts.
-He only makes cuts.

1518
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,505
I guess Italians do that too.

1519
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,973
He starts cooking them.

1520
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,675
-The octopus goes in.
-The squid… The octopus is in.

1521
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,344
Chef Antimo looks too relaxed.

1522
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,980
He's like a cooking guru,
even his facial expression.

1523
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,548
-He's…
-How cool.

1524
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,751
He's making a dish
often eaten on the seafront.

1525
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,988
-Sung-jun's commentary.
-He continues to cook.

1526
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,789
He even gives it a taste.

1527
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,925
He decides to taste a piece.

1528
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,693
HIS LEISURE GIVES OFF
THE AIR OF A MASTER

1529
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,998
Don't Italians also sing operas?

1530
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:56,566
You're right.

1531
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:57,767
Look at the squid.

1532
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:01,070
It seems as if
he's listening to that as he cooks.

1533
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,607
Italy and Korea are similar
in that all three sides are the sea.

1534
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,609
Italian dishes seem different

1535
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,478
-when cooked by an Italian chef.
-Seriously.

1536
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,647
You're right.

1537
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,549
There's the dough.

1538
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,951
It doesn't look so bad.

1539
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,320
-It looks fine.
-I added more flour.

1540
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,355
You have to keep adding more?

1541
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,425
THE MOIST DOUGH IS EASIER
TO SPREAD OUT THIN

1542
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,495
He's making the noodles.

1543
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,497
-Those are thick pieces.
-The pasta looks thick.

1544
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,899
-Yes, they do.
-The noodles are thicker.

1545
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,569
Antimo also makes pasta.

1546
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,105
Doesn't his dough look a bit drier?

1547
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,274
-It looks like <i>sujebi</i> dough.
-It's not thinning.

1548
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,643
This dough looks rather dry.

1549
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,012
Yes, while Sam's dough was wet,

1550
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,348
Antimo's dough looks dry.

1551
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,984
Can you two mix the dough?

1552
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,587
-Why don't you mix it and split it?
-Yes.

1553
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,422
Yes, be good friends.

1554
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,658
I wonder which texture
Kwaktube will like more.

1555
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,494
IT'S TIME TO OPEN THE BRAISED SHORT RIBS!

1556
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,395
Are you getting it out already?

1557
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,197
-I have to.
-You do?

1558
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,901
-There's no time?
-He's using that soup to make pasta.

1559
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,502
He has to get it out anyway.

1560
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,671
He's removing the lid
in just eight minutes.

1561
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,139
It took about eight minutes.

1562
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,574
ANTIMO STOPS FLATTENING THE PASTA

1563
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:15,445
He's making the tomato sauce from scratch
instead of using a store-bought one.

1564
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,114
-I don't have any.
-Oh, you don't have any.

1565
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,515
This is for his wife.

1566
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,851
-He uses healthy tomatoes for his wife.
-For health?

1567
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,253
Italian chefs never use
ready-made products.

1568
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,855
He says Italians never use them.

1569
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,523
Never a store-bought tomato sauce.

1570
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,726
Is he grinding the tomatoes?

1571
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,893
GRIND TO FINISH THE TOMATO SAUCE!

1572
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,030
He already blended the tomato sauce.

1573
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,798
The sauce is ready.

1574
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,101
Chef Antimo finished making tomato sauce.

1575
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,703
-Gochujang.
-He's using gochujang?

1576
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,472
THE ITALIAN USES GOCHUJANG?

1577
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:43,873
-Gochujang?
-He's practically Korean.

1578
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,441
-That's low sugar too.
-It is.

1579
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:46,743
That's even better.

1580
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,877
I love the colors.

1581
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:48,811
You have five minutes left.

1582
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:52,015
Jung-hwan, please go out to the kitchen.

1583
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,883
I wonder if the tomato sauce tastes good.

1584
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,120
-No, the lid won't open.
-Why won't it open?

1585
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,488
The pressure is too high.

1586
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,555
Let the heat out.

1587
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,090
It's hard to open it right away.

1588
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,959
The braised short ribs should be ready.

1589
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,962
-Hey, the noodles look fine…
-The braised beef!

1590
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,597
The braised beef!

1591
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,898
It doesn't have a lot of soup.

1592
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,234
It seems like it's not cooked thoroughly.

1593
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,602
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1594
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,370
He said he'd use the soup.

1595
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,873
-You should cut it.
-Why?

1596
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:20,109
-Can you take a look at it too?
-Like this?

1597
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,277
It's not fully cooked.

1598
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,112
-It's not fully cooked?
-It's not.

1599
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,881
It's reddish, but it's cooked.

1600
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,883
What happens if a pregnant person
eats something undercooked?

1601
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,185
-It's really bad.
-We can't let that happen.

1602
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,120
Just stir-fry it again.

1603
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,456
-He'll cook it again.
-Yes, cook it again.

1604
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,591
THE COOKING GURU BLENDED THE TOMATO SAUCE

1605
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,293
He's straining the sauce.

1606
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,796
-It's pretty.
-The tomato sauce looks so good.

1607
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,665
-That's amazing.
-You can't use the seeds or the skin.

1608
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,167
I see.

1609
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,837
It looks like rose pasta sauce
after he added gochujang.

1610
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,373
-That looks good.
-He added some gochujang in there.

1611
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,542
And he threw in octopus and squid.

1612
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,343
-Let me try it.
-He hasn't made pasta yet.

1613
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,978
-No.
-When will he cook pasta?

1614
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,847
Will you put it in now?

1615
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,817
-Wait, his pasta…
-It's not even flat yet.

1616
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,018
Am I the only one in a rush today?

1617
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,786
I also feel rushed.

1618
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,989
HE CHECKS THE GOCHUJANG TOMATO SAUCE

1619
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,191
HE ADDS MORE GOCHUJANG IN THAT WHILE!

1620
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,425
What's it like?

1621
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,396
Is it good enough
to capture his wife's appetite?

1622
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,132
I think it's possible.

1623
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,867
-I think it's possible.
-Really?

1624
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:18,901
I KNEW IT!

1625
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,203
It's very tender.

1626
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,370
Can you taste the gochujang?

1627
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,573
I can, but it's not too strong.

1628
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,807
FINALLY FLATTENS THE PASTA DOUGH!

1629
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,909
-It's seasoned nicely.
-In that case,

1630
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,846
-He finishes the sauce for now.
-Does he have time to boil that?

1631
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,781
He only needs to cook it for 30 seconds.

1632
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,117
-It only takes 30 seconds?
-The pasta noodles? Really?

1633
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,018
-You got three minutes left.
-Just one minute is good enough?

1634
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,655
-Until the end?
-Hurry up.

1635
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,491
BOTH CHEFS ARE SLOWLY FEELING RUSHED

1636
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,997
-Jung-hwan, take a look at Sam.
-This?

1637
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,133
-That one.
-It's not cooked thoroughly.

1638
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,034
-Can you try one?
-It's been cooked.

1639
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,537
-Can she have a safe delivery?
-Yes.

1640
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,706
Will his son like it too?

1641
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,842
-Yes.
-In the end, his son should like it.

1642
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,012
That's the braised short ribs.

1643
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,313
What's the sauce like?

1644
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,317
WHAT WILL THE CROSS BETWEEN TOMATO,
BUTTER, AND SHORT RIBS BE LIKE?

1645
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:10,153
She'll have a safe delivery!

1646
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,154
She'll have a safe delivery!

1647
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,255
AMAZED!

1648
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,489
It tastes rich.

1649
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,458
-It does?
-That's so crazy.

1650
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,993
How did he do that in ten minutes?

1651
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,829
The pasta noodles should be cooked.

1652
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,598
-Look at Chef Antimo.
-Antimo!

1653
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,400
My gosh. The pasta is very short.

1654
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,335
-It's too short.
-It's supposed to be.

1655
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,538
Scialatielli is a short pasta

1656
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,007
with a texture just like gnocchi.

1657
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,410
-That's why it's thick.
-A short pasta.

1658
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,645
It's a short pasta.

1659
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,780
Where are you going, Antimo?

1660
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,715
-He gets more flour.
-More flour!

1661
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,984
-He's adding more!
-What's he doing?

1662
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,053
I think they got stuck together.

1663
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,321
The noodles stuck to each other.

1664
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,290
Why is he cutting it again?

1665
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,092
-The first few pieces got stuck.
-I see.

1666
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,928
That's why you're doing it over.

1667
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,297
His hands begin to tremble.

1668
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:55,731
Antimo gets flustered.

1669
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,067
THE CHEF STARTS TO FALTER

1670
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,669
He's moving faster now.

1671
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,971
-Hurry up!
-Hurry.

1672
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,840
SAM PULLS OUT PASTA IN THAT WHILE

1673
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,042
5. BOIL PAPPARDELLE
AND STIR-FRY WITH SHORT RIBS SAUCE

1674
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:07,944
He's suddenly starting to move fast.

1675
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,879
-He runs!
-He begins to run!

1676
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,681
The music has changed!

1677
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,350
Okay.

1678
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,985
Does shaking the pasta

1679
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,587
help it get cooked faster?

1680
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,487
Is that so?

1681
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:19,522
That's not the case.

1682
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,556
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUMAN?

1683
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,191
He's preventing them from getting stuck.

1684
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,027
-That's not the case.
-He just feels rushed.

1685
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,096
ADDING RED PEPPER POWDER!

1686
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,365
-He's adding <i>gochugaru</i>.
-<i>Gochugaru</i>?

1687
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,433
Jung-hwan wanted to check.

1688
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,334
<i>Gochugaru</i>?

1689
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,370
You have a minute left. Please finish up.

1690
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,705
-It's like spicy <i>kal-guksu.</i>
-Yes.

1691
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,240
Time's almost up.

1692
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,508
Look at the colors. This is tomato-based,

1693
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:42,245
while this one has short ribs,
so the colors are different.

1694
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,046
Doesn't it look like soy sauce <i>tteokbokki?</i>

1695
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,982
It does.
And that one is regular <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1696
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,316
His noodles are thicker.

1697
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,753
Those look like soy sauce <i>tteokbokki</i>
and regular <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1698
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,822
Sam begins to serve his dish.

1699
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,523
HE SERVES IT RIGHT AWAY!

1700
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,861
Antimo's dish must be spicier.

1701
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,429
It looks like spicy <i>kal-guksu.</i>

1702
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,899
It looks like rosé pasta.

1703
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,934
But this one is like soy sauce <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1704
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:08,704
-He added <i>gochugaru</i> and gochujang.
-He did.

1705
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,274
Are you doing okay, Antimo?

1706
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,575
He doesn't seem pleased.

1707
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,511
There's <i>ramyeon</i> soup base back there,
so throw that in.

1708
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,747
Poong chimes in
and tells him to use <i>ramyeon</i> soup base.

1709
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,983
-He adds olive oil.
-Olive oil?

1710
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,186
He just made tomato sauce from scratch,
so <i>ramyeon</i> soup base?

1711
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,655
Try putting it in.

1712
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,722
-Why not?
-And now…

1713
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,825
And now…

1714
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,666
-Seven. Six. Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1715
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,268
Three. Two.

1716
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,504
STAYS CALM UNTIL THE END

1717
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,173
-Five. Four. Three.
-Five. Four. Three.

1718
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:47,777
SAM FINISHES SAFE DELIVERY PASTA

1719
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,281
TIME'S UP!

1720
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,983
Antimo finishes first.

1721
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:54,917
ANTIMO FINISHES ANTIAMO

1722
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,286
THE BATTLE OF THE ROMANTICS WAS FIERCE

1723
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,825
Sam finished first,
and then Antimo finished.

1724
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,060
PHEW

1725
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,495
-It looks good.
-Fresh pasta isn't easy to make.

1726
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:08,331
It's tough to make fresh pasta.

1727
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,232
My gosh.

1728
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:14,236
Both dishes were finished for Kwaktube.

1729
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,073
My wife especially loves pasta,

1730
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,642
but I felt bad
for not eating it often with her

1731
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,811
because I eat it often when I'm abroad.

1732
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:25,915
I'll taste both of these,
learn the recipe, and make these for her.

1733
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,117
Sam finished first,

1734
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,020
so please try Safe Delivery Pasta first.

1735
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,521
ITALIAN PASTA MEETS KOREAN CUISINE

1736
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:37,960
FRESH PAPPARDELLE
HOLD BRAISED SHORT RIBS TOGETHER

1737
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:42,498
CHEF SAM KIM'S SAFE DELIVERY PASTA

1738
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,500
I've had a fair share of pasta,

1739
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,169
-but never something that's like <i>sujebi.</i>
-I see.

1740
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,938
Those look like long <i>sujebi</i> pieces.

1741
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,274
It smells like
braised short ribs with cheese.

1742
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,410
-Yes, he grated some into it.
-He did.

1743
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,380
He tries a piece of meat with the pasta.

1744
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,447
It looks like fish cake.

1745
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,249
That looks good.

1746
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:03,386
The texture is everything.
He tries the pasta with some meat.

1747
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,988
Braised short ribs meet pasta.

1748
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,127
The noodles jab your mouth as it goes in.

1749
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,296
Will his wife gain more energy
after eating this pasta?

1750
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,299
-That's the face.
-It's that face.

1751
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,969
-My gosh.
-He's amazed.

1752
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,103
Kwaktube.

1753
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,406
Wait, what is this flavor?

1754
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,474
-It's so good.
-Is it?

1755
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,511
Yes, how did he make this
in just 15 minutes?

1756
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,713
I thought it'd taste like
soy sauce <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1757
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,882
It has much richer flavors.

1758
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,750
I thought he mixed
braised short ribs with pasta,

1759
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,119
but it's unexpectedly
a perfect fusion dish.

1760
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,521
Does it taste different?

1761
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:41,257
It's the rich flavor of braised…
What did he throw in?

1762
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,693
I added butter, cheese,
black olives, and tomatoes.

1763
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,729
-You used olives too?
-Olives.

1764
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,599
It's hard to imagine
braised short ribs with cheese, right?

1765
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,170
<i>But they come together perfectly</i>
<i>to create a rich and classy flavor.</i>

1766
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,571
How was the pasta cooked?

1767
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,641
When I first took a bite,
I thought it might be too thick,

1768
01:07:58,707 --> 01:07:59,775
but it was perfect.

1769
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,145
He says it was perfect.

1770
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,681
Do you think
your wife will enjoy this too?

1771
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,750
She does like Western cuisine

1772
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,618
but in the end, she loves Korean food.

1773
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,487
I still think she'll love this.

1774
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,189
It has a touch of Korean cuisine.

1775
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,125
It tastes like Korean food
and pasta at the same time.

1776
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,994
-I feel bad that I'm eating this.
-Because it's good?

1777
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,197
-You can make it for her.
-Already?

1778
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,599
That's the dish a romantic has made.

1779
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,835
He's enjoying it very much.

1780
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,870
That's Sam's dish.

1781
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,272
He's going to devour the entire thing.

1782
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,941
I can't eat this alone, right?

1783
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,742
-No.
-You can.

1784
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,811
But Chef Nam-no wants some.

1785
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:37,546
It's okay.

1786
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,381
Your name even sounds like leftovers.

1787
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,083
I'd be grateful if you left some.

1788
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,588
Can I try just half a pasta piece?

1789
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,690
-Not one piece?
-Half a piece.

1790
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:50,493
He would've had enough after that.

1791
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,397
I know as a fan of the show
that Chef Sam has been here for a while.

1792
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,166
I always wondered
what his dishes tasted like,

1793
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,567
and it was the taste I dreamed of.

1794
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:02,872
Sam's dish tasted like
something he dreamed of.

1795
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,407
It won't be easy to beat this.

1796
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,110
And now, please try Chef Antimo's Antiamo.

1797
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:12,348
A SPOONFUL OF GOCHUJANG
MIXED WITH TRADITIONAL NEAPOLITAN PASTA

1798
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:17,386
FRESH SCIALATIELLI WITH LOTS OF SEAFOOD

1799
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:21,857
CHEF ANTIMO'S ANTIAMO

1800
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,894
-The presentation is like art.
-Certainly.

1801
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,163
The length of squid
and pasta are the same.

1802
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,466
That's the fine dining technique.

1803
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,835
-He was doing that?
-No wonder.

1804
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,945
-I'm so curious.
-Was it fully cooked?

1805
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,081
He's fluent in English
because he travels all around the world.

1806
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,283
He's good.

1807
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,420
HIS EYES ARE AS BIG AS THEY CAN BE

1808
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,722
-Look at his face.
-What is it, Kwaktube?

1809
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:54,690
Dang.

1810
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,759
-He has certain brows
-He does.

1811
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,494
when he eats something good.

1812
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,563
He doesn't even show a big smile.

1813
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,731
-It's so good.
-His brows go up this way.

1814
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,401
Hey, Antimo.

1815
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,603
How did you cook the octopus so perfectly?

1816
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:08,904
TO YOON NAM-NO

1817
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,072
Wait a second.

1818
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,208
NAM-NO IS FOREVER TORTURED

1819
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,109
Gosh, Chef Nam-no.

1820
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,445
Goodness, Chef Nam-no.

1821
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,547
It's the usual tomato pasta

1822
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,149
with a touch of gochujang.

1823
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,485
-Do they go well together?
-I dislike the sourness of tomato pasta,

1824
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,055
so I liked how rich it became
after adding gochujang.

1825
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,091
-It'd be a good hangover pasta.
-It could even be a hangover cure.

1826
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,659
This tastes so rich.

1827
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,394
Was the spiciness all right with you?

1828
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,730
-It doesn't taste spicy. Not at all.
-No?

1829
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,600
-The tomato cuts away the spiciness.
-I see. That's amazing.

1830
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:38,634
The balance looks nice.

1831
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,604
But gochujang pushes down
the strong tomato flavor too.

1832
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,272
<i>The scent of tomato is kept light,</i>

1833
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,507
-and it's so delicious.
-Do they cancel each other out?

1834
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,642
How are the noodles cooked?

1835
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,944
It's cooked al dente.
The pasta noodles are perfect.

1836
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,346
It's really…

1837
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,581
This is what I call a close match.

1838
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:55,551
WHAT NOW?

1839
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,353
I'm sorry. Wait.

1840
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,121
-Killed you twice.
-He spoke what he was thinking.

1841
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,190
-He meant for you to hear.
-It was about something else.

1842
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,692
Jung-hwan said it was delicious

1843
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,227
after trying his dish,

1844
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,463
but Antimo added even more.

1845
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,765
We wondered why he added some more.

1846
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:10,899
There's one downside.

1847
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,702
There's not enough pasta.

1848
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,004
It's the fine dining experience.

1849
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,905
Why does fine dining
always give you so little food?

1850
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,614
You can't give a mountain of this.

1851
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,449
What will that make of Chef Sam?

1852
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,518
It means he isn't too romantic.

1853
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,087
-No, he's such a romantic guy.
-He is.

1854
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,356
-He wanted to serve lots of food.
-Yes.

1855
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,660
Some wives may not like that.
He just finished everything.

1856
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,264
I'm the most sick of tomato sauce,

1857
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,966
so the gochujang was a killer move.

1858
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,968
I see. It must be that different.

1859
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:49,004
You must've had
a lot of tomato sauce as you traveled.

1860
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,739
-I eat that the most, actually.
-I see.

1861
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,809
-It tastes different with gochujang.
-Why haven't I thought of that?

1862
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,110
And <i>gochugaru</i> too.

1863
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,312
It's so good.

1864
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,380
-It must be hard.
-I want some.

1865
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,249
Who's going to win?

1866
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,216
All right, now.

1867
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:04,253
Let's try Chef Sam's dish first.

1868
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,889
Sam Kim's Safe Delivery Pasta.

1869
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,124
It'll be a huge hit
if it's sold at Gyeongbokgung Palace.

1870
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:12,795
It tastes like royal cuisine.
Is it because it's from <i>Dongui Bogam?</i>

1871
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,130
I feel like it's giving me energy.

1872
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,767
RECHARGING ENERGY

1873
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:19,935
What's it like?

1874
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,770
-Goodness.
-He likes this one.

1875
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,406
Just as Joon-bin mentioned,

1876
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,776
it tastes very Korean yet very exotic.

1877
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,679
It's an exact depiction
of the middle ground.

1878
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,549
I'm going to try adding cheese
when I make braised short ribs now.

1879
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,385
<i>It adds a lot of richness.</i>

1880
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,287
-It makes it savory.
-Yes.

1881
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,756
It's followed by tomatoes and olives.

1882
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:44,026
But it doesn't feel too unfamiliar.
It goes well with the dish.

1883
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,763
You're cutting that pasta piece?

1884
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,432
You were watching me?

1885
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,468
Isn't it too big?

1886
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,770
ALL EYES ARE ON HIM

1887
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,271
Please go back to your thing.

1888
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:58,040
He doesn't like attention.

1889
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,110
I'm not going to eat this.

1890
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,481
DON'T WORRY, HE'S A LIGHT EATER

1891
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:09,918
This time, Chef Antimo's dish, Antiamo!

1892
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,690
It might turn into a battle
between meat and seafood.

1893
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,595
Antiamo.

1894
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:20,763
FINISHES IT ALL IN ONE BITE

1895
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:22,798
He's amazed.

1896
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,299
Woo-jae.

1897
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,069
DEEPLY MOVED

1898
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,704
That was an unusual moment.

1899
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,241
The gochujang really was the kick.

1900
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:37,446
If he made a huge portion,
I would've had a whole bowl.

1901
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,515
-Hey.
-You can eat a lot.

1902
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,850
Sadly, he didn't.

1903
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,985
So I'll just finish this.

1904
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,289
I'm not sure if he meant to do this.

1905
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,525
But in Naples
and other Mediterranean areas,

1906
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,027
people often boil octopus
in tomatoes for a long time.

1907
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:56,899
Then it sticks to one another, gives off
a caramel-like smell and tastes sweet.

1908
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:02,104
I have a feeling he added gochujang
to cut down the required time.

1909
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,407
Chef Sam's dish also felt like
something from Naples,

1910
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:07,009
<i>a pasta called genovese.</i>

1911
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:09,411
<i>It's a dish served</i>
<i>with pieces of braised ribs.</i>

1912
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:12,281
-Really?
-This also feels a bit like Naples.

1913
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,817
He's on a roll right now.

1914
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,552
-The Naples round.
-I see.

1915
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,654
He's talking a lot
once the pasta round began.

1916
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,323
Well, you must admit to it.

1917
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,059
-Now, time to decide.
-Please make a decision.

1918
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,463
I previously said
the other round was a close fight,

1919
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,064
but I'd like to take it back.

1920
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,399
Is this much closer?

1921
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,801
-You already said it.
-Just let us have it.

1922
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:34,336
Both dishes had

1923
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,705
the highest quality possible
when it came to flavor,

1924
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,674
so I'll pick something my wife would like.

1925
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,777
He'll choose a dish
his wife would prefer to eat.

1926
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,812
<i>Press one for Sam Kim,</i>

1927
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,681
<i>and two for Antimo.</i>

1928
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:49,418
He'll make his choice
considering his wife's appetite.

1929
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,419
-Have you pressed one?
-Yes.

1930
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,420
He made his decision.

1931
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:55,791
Which one of them
was chosen by the fridge owner?

1932
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,627
Let's find out the result. Show us!

1933
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,195
-I'm dying to know.
-Right?

1934
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,532
Will it be Chef Antimo from Naples?

1935
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:08,203
Or will it be Chef Sam,
the best Italian chef in Korea?

1936
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,572
Antimo versus Sam Kim!

1937
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,107
Who did Kwaktube choose?

1938
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,509
Which one is it?

1939
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:17,145
Who's the best Italian chef?

1940
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:20,482
Who's the winner?

1941
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:21,817
ANTIMO WINS

1942
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,218
CHEF ANTIMO'S ANTIAMO WINS

1943
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,487
Antimo wins!

1944
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,422
Chef Antimo wins!

1945
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:31,193
Chef Antimo wins against Sam!

1946
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,494
He's a cooking guru.

1947
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,463
I see. Wait!

1948
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,031
-Please return.
-Stay there.

1949
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,068
PLEASE GIVE ME MY STAR!

1950
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:42,337
I chose this because my wife

1951
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:45,507
currently prefers something more spicy.

1952
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,910
I'm sure she'll also love
Chef Sam's dish very much,

1953
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,278
so I'll copy both dishes at home

1954
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:51,013
and ask her to make a choice.

1955
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:56,251
Chef Antimo takes a star
every time he visits <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

1956
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,853
He always wins one.

1957
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,321
How do you feel?

1958
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,561
-So he'll return?
-He'll come back.

1959
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:08,096
-He's ready to come back.
-He is.

1960
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,932
It's a lot of fun when you win.

1961
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,568
Congratulations, Antimo!

1962
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,369
My gosh.

1963
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,371
He wins a star every time he's here.

1964
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,612
I'm like a lash for <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

1965
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,713
Let me warn you in advance.

1966
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,148
You're waiting for huge trouble.

1967
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,749
We present his fridge!

1968
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:30,085
It's an emergency.

1969
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,087
How do you not even make ice?

1970
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,522
This is terrible.

1971
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,324
What are Woo-jae's orders?

1972
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:36,992
Chef, not my fridge.

1973
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,026
CAN'T BELIEVE THEIR EYES

1974
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,862
-I honestly didn't want to come.
-You should've said no to the end.

1975
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,197
THE MOST DIFFICULT YET

1976
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,600
If they make something with this,
it'll be even more fun.

1977
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,135
The toughest fridge yet.

1978
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,670
It's the most advanced round.

1979
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,105
Scrape the cutting board.

1980
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,174
-Even that's invaluable.
-Zero waste.

1981
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,875
He's using veggie flakes from <i>ramyeon!</i>

1982
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:54,876
<i>He had vegetables!</i>

1983
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,578
See? You could find them.

1984
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:57,713
Pick out bacon pieces.

1985
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,281
-There are none.
-None?

1986
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,382
It's such a shame.

1987
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,984
That's a lot.

1988
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,086
He doesn't eat much,
so why is he making a whole lot?

1989
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:05,320
SOMEONE FAILS WITH THE PORTION?

1990
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,556
There he goes!

1991
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,824
This is impossible!

1992
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,125
He's making <i>basi!</i>

1993
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,227
WILL HE SEE MIRACLES?

1994
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,498
You could do it.

1995
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,936
-You could do it, but you haven't.
-Exactly.

1996
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:35,417
