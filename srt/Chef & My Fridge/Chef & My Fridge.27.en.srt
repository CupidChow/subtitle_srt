1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,650
Let's meet today's fridge owners.

2
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:22,822
Two people are here to show us chemistry
from total opposite sides of the spectrum.

3
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,424
Please come on out!

4
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,495
Please welcome today's fridge owners!

5
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,663
The two guests
with extremely polar chemistry!

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,600
Welcome, Sunwoo Yong-yeo and Lee Joon!

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,136
Yes, please come out and take a seat.

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,738
-Long time no see.
-Yes, "long time no see."

9
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,374
SHE ENTERS WITH A LOVELY GREETING

10
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,279
She's the trendiest 81-year-old in Korea
at the moment.

11
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:50,283
<i>She recently opened up her golden age</i>
<i>as the oldest YouTuber.</i>

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,584
Hi.

13
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,621
A celebrity icon on "flexing,"
please welcome Actor Sunwoo Yong-yeo!

14
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,789
Hello.

15
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,391
WELCOME, QUEEN YONG-YEO

16
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,527
What do you mean, the trendiest?

17
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,029
All I did was
show my everyday life to people.

18
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,030
Exactly.

19
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,232
One of them is the icon of flexing,

20
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,601
but the other one is
the icon of frugality.

21
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,671
Our first guest is someone
who drives her Benz

22
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,240
<i>to eat breakfast at a hotel.</i>

23
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,976
The other guest is someone
who drives his bicycle

24
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,113
to eat at a library cafeteria.

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,551
I'm not too picky when it comes to food.

26
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,620
And the cafeteria costs
6,000 won per meal,

27
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,957
where I can eat everything quickly
and save on time as well.

28
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,726
-You eat breakfast at a hotel. 60,000 won?
-It's 60,000 won.

29
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:37,030
-It's ten times as expensive.
-It is.

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,065
I don't have to go there every day.

31
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,202
-I go there three, four days a week.
-About three, four times a week.

32
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,104
-Six times four… Six times two, twelve.
-On other days,

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,039
-I eat a simple breakfast at home.
-Six times four, twenty-four.

34
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,409
As you speak, Joon was mumbling,
"Six times four, twenty-four."

35
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,644
I CAN PAY FOR SO MANY MEALS
AT A CAFETERIA FOR THAT AMOUNT…

36
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,413
He was crunching numbers.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,615
It's better to be frugal
when you're young.

38
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,884
-I'll stay frugal.
-Of course.

39
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,653
But there's no need
for the old to be frugal.

40
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,289
QUEEN YONG-YEO'S PHILOSOPHY

41
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,924
Exactly.

42
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,093
I wondered how people responded to you,

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,830
and it showed
with the count of 3.7 million views.

44
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>The viewers still show</i>
<i>an incredible response to the video.</i>

45
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,036
<i>"I decided to live like her from now on."</i>

46
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,404
<i>"The role model of my life."</i>

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,975
<i>You became the wannabe of Gen Z</i>
<i>with just one video.</i>

48
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,344
My gosh. What is this?

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,947
I thought only people over 81 years of age
would love my videos,

50
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,717
-but the younger generation loved it.
-Yes.

51
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,019
-It makes me so happy.
-I see.

52
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,054
She's receiving lots of love these days.

53
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,390
I saw on a portal website
that your birth date was listed

54
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,159
as August 15th, 1945.

55
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,927
-Yes, Korean Liberation Day.
-On Liberation Day?

56
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,762
-That is when you were born?
-Yes.

57
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,065
-Exactly on Liberation Day?
-That's amazing.

58
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,668
-The Liberation Day kid?
-Yes.

59
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,071
-I was called the Liberation kid.
-That's amazing.

60
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,941
-She is living history.
-That's right.

61
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,512
There is one man who feels anxious
and nervous about today's shoot.

62
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,413
Who is it?

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,416
It's Webtoon Artist Poong,
who's right next to you.

64
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,851
-Really? Why?
-Yes.

65
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,420
-His pseudonym, Kim Poong,
-Yes.

66
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,223
-came from the sitcom <i>Soonpoong Clinic.</i>
-Really?

67
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,191
Really?

68
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,792
-Poong came from that?
-Yes.

69
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,627
-Poong of Soonpoong?
-Yes.

70
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,198
-It was the year 1999.
-The year 1999.

71
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:22,635
I was the vice-sysop of a chat room
for <i>Soonpoong Clinic</i> fans online.

72
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,804
-Really? Wow.
-Yes.

73
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,306
-Sysop? What's that?
-Sysop is

74
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,042
-like the vice operator of a forum.
-A vice operator.

75
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,710
-Did you call it sysop then?
-Sysop is

76
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,012
short for system operator,
the operator of a forum.

77
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,048
-System operator?
-I was the overseer.

78
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,050
-Back during the dial-up era.
-That's right.

79
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,987
I was the vice-sysop,
so I visited the set a few times too.

80
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,423
-"What is this?"
-"What is this? Whatever!"

81
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,991
YONG-YEO'S BIGGEST BUZZWORD

82
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,060
-She was amazing back then.
-Yes.

83
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,829
Do you remember the fan forum's visit?

84
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,797
She wouldn't know.

85
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,199
Back then, all I ever did was work.

86
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,704
It'd be about 5:30 a.m.
by the time I'm done on <i>Soonpoong</i>'s set.

87
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,772
Then my husband would demand breakfast,

88
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,674
so I'd start cooking.

89
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,110
-You were in your early fifties.
-You worked and cooked?

90
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,713
So I'd make food for him
and go back to work right away.

91
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,016
One day, I went home in the morning
after the shoot,

92
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,951
and he said, "I want food."

93
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,586
After you came home from work?

94
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,055
-"I want food"?
-I suddenly snapped at him.

95
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,424
"Why do you demand food from me
every time you see me?"

96
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,793
Wait, that sounds like…

97
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,829
-"Whatever!"
-"Yong-yeo!"

98
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,297
After I did that, I wondered

99
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,133
how he'd respond after the shock.

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,136
-You must've been nervous.
-She must've been scared of the outcome.

101
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,805
He said, "How do I open the refrigerator?"

102
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,841
He couldn't even do that?

103
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,976
-"How do I open the refrigerator?"
-Pull it!

104
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,013
-"Pull it!"
-"Pull it!"

105
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,116
But since that day,

106
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,184
-he stopped asking me for food.
-This is interesting.

107
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,153
-Right.
-He must've served himself.

108
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,921
So I realized

109
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,125
women should raise their voice
every now and then.

110
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,259
You're right.

111
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:58,331
Yong-yeo doesn't flex
just on the breakfast buffet.

112
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,434
She even flexes on overseas day trips.

113
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,303
FLEXING WITH DAY TRIPS ABROAD

114
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,905
Like going to Japan to eat ramen?

115
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,707
Do you really take day trips abroad alone?

116
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,276
-I don't say what isn't true.
-Right?

117
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,578
-Where do you go on a day trip?
-Where?

118
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,915
-Fukuoka is great.
-Fukuoka.

119
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,418
I'd go there on the first flight

120
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,020
and take a taxi when I get off.

121
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,357
Then I ask,
"Take me to the best restaurant."

122
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,992
"Please."

123
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,328
The driver would say okay
and take me downtown.

124
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,798
What do you say to return to the airport?

125
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,667
"To Fukuoka Airport, please."

126
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,235
SHE CAN DO EVERYTHING BY ADDING "PLEASE"

127
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,937
-That was perfect.
-That was easy.

128
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,673
-It's easy. You need just a few phrases.
-It sounds easy.

129
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,608
-A few phrases, yes.
-You only need a few.

130
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,079
Anyway, you have another bucket list item
you want to cross out this year?

131
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:46,979
-Yes.
-What is it?

132
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,749
-I want to see the Northern Lights.
-The Northern Lights? Where at?

133
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,018
-Iceland?
-Iceland.

134
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,087
I want to go there before I die.

135
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,524
I want to feel that experience
in this world before I pass.

136
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,026
With your own eyes.

137
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,862
Going on trips basically means
seeing things with your eyes.

138
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,665
-You leave to taste and see it yourself.
-You're right.

139
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,899
-You're right.
-You can't get it on camera.

140
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,201
Of course not.

141
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,537
I wonder
what Yong-yeo keeps in her fridge.

142
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,274
This one right here is her fridge.

143
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,010
I can already see her pictures.

144
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,614
-My granddaughter and grandson.
-I see.

145
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,150
-But you live alone now, right?
-I do.

146
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,253
Yet you have two fridges here.

147
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,288
I couldn't pull out my fridge.

148
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,890
Then we just take what's inside.

149
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,426
We couldn't put everything into this one.

150
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,695
They pulled out everything from the fridge

151
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,030
and took it in this huge tub.

152
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,866
What did you eat for breakfast today?

153
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,301
I had no choice but to go to a hotel.

154
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,303
So you had hotel breakfast?

155
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,506
Yes, I had a hearty meal.

156
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,641
-The hotel buffet is your cafeteria.
-You're right.

157
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,880
Let's find out what she eats alone.

158
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,181
What does she have here?

159
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,017
We present Sunwoo Yong-yeo's fridge!

160
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,553
-Whoa.
-There's a lot of food.

161
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,656
We present Sunwoo Yong-yeo's fridge!

162
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,226
All right. I see a lot of food in here.

163
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,462
-Even though she lives alone.
-Yes.

164
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,831
You won't have to go to a hotel to eat
with this much food.

165
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,300
I don't see a lot of store-bought items.

166
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,036
-Most of them look homemade.
-You're right.

167
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,406
-You must use lots of pastes to cook.
-That's right.

168
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,375
I just like to eat simple meals

169
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,445
like mixing doenjang with rice.

170
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:29,148
-Just the paste?
-Yes, just the paste and perilla oil.

171
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,983
It's really delicious.

172
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,687
-Do you prefer mixed rice to soup dishes?
-That's right.

173
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,422
I don't really like soup dishes.

174
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,592
She doesn't prefer soup dishes.
Make sure you remember that.

175
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,727
I see some tomato sauce.

176
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,863
-Yes, I…
-How do you use this?

177
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,966
All I need is that tomato sauce
to make spaghetti.

178
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,868
I don't like adding many ingredients.

179
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,703
I just add some onion.

180
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,072
-Just some onion?
-Lots of onion

181
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,175
with just pasta, egg pasta.

182
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,111
-Do you not enjoy flour?
-I say "no thank you" to flour.

183
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,181
-"No thank you" to flour.
-No.

184
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,351
-She doesn't like flour.
-No noodles.

185
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,720
I see some eggs back there.

186
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,388
There's this egg boiler.

187
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,790
-The cooker?
-Yes, the cooker.

188
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,158
<i>-I eat two of those.</i>
-Thank you for the meal.

189
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,560
<i>-Do you boil eggs?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

190
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,762
-Do you not fry them?
-No, I don't like fried eggs.

191
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,731
-I see.
-She likes simple and light food.

192
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,700
-I don't like oil, period.
-Oil?

193
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,035
-No thank you to oil?
-No thank you.

194
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,837
Do you not enjoy fried food?

195
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,739
-I don't eat fried food.
-No?

196
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,708
-No soup, no fried food.
-Don't fry anything.

197
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,244
-No fried food.
-No, thank you, fried food.

198
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,880
-An emergency.
-That's rough.

199
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:38,217
KFC was very popular
back when I emigrated to America.

200
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,319
I pulled off the fried skin
before I ate the chicken.

201
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,322
-I pulled off the fried part.
-She's like Lee Se-dol.

202
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,791
THE MAN WHO REFUSED TO EAT THE FRIED SKIN

203
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,394
A MOMENT TO REMEMBER WITH SE-DOL
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD NOW

204
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,197
-My memory with Se-dol.
-That was another preference.

205
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,432
-I found some salmon.
-Salmon.

206
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,335
I eat that at home
whenever I don't go to the buffet.

207
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,870
I don't fry that, either. I steam it.

208
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,106
-I see.
-She steams the salmon.

209
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,375
-You steam your salmon?
-Doesn't it smell?

210
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,744
-So I sprinkle lots of lemon juice on it.
-That's why.

211
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,946
-Something fresh.
-Fresh and clean.

212
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,814
It's delicious when it's steamed

213
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,349
with lemon juice and ground pepper.

214
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,584
Like the Mediterranean diet.

215
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,586
You have lots of seafood.

216
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,254
I love seafood.

217
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,889
Some abalones.

218
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,993
When I lived in Seoul,
the only kind of seafood I had were

219
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,430
dried yellow corvina or cutlassfish.

220
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,600
Then I moved to Haenam for the first time
after I got married

221
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,802
and tried raw thin-legged octopus
for the first time.

222
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,305
It tasted so delicious.
That, sea cucumber, and abalone.

223
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,506
Thin-legged octopus.

224
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,942
-Is that an octopus?
-Wait, this is…

225
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,143
What's this?

226
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,844
-I found something odd.
-What is it?

227
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,745
Sea cucumber.

228
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,714
-Sea cucumber?
-Sea cucumber.

229
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,650
-Sea cucumber. Red sea cucumber.
-Those are huge.

230
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,485
Isn't this our first time
seeing sea cucumbers?

231
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,887
It's really delicious.

232
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,356
Do you see the yellow stuff in the middle?

233
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,593
It's really good as bibimbap
if you mix it with rice.

234
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,094
How do you eat the sea cucumbers?

235
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,096
-I slice them.
-You just slice them.

236
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,531
-You eat it raw?
-She eats it raw.

237
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,968
Then I put
some wasabi and lemon juice on it.

238
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,236
-You must love lemon.
-I do.

239
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,771
-It's so good.
<i>-Did you see her when she mentioned</i>

240
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,540
-It's so good!
<i>-thin-legged octopus and sea cucumber?</i>

241
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,874
You can remember that.

242
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,843
-It's so good.
-She likes seafood.

243
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,612
-And vegetables.
-Vegetables.

244
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,747
-She has some lemons.
-She does.

245
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,848
There are many lemons.

246
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,517
I don't keep a lot of vegetables.

247
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,420
-Lettuce.
-Lettuce and coriander.

248
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,223
-Coriander? Do you like it?
-I like coriander.

249
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,226
-I like it 100%.
-I see.

250
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,461
She likes it 100%.

251
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,262
Then you must like
Southeast Asian cuisine.

252
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,498
Tom yum soup is one of my favorites.

253
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,200
You said you didn't like soup.

254
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,968
It uses lots of lemon.

255
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,871
-Because of lemons.
-She basically loves lemons.

256
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,073
I'll make lemon soup, then.

257
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,142
-Just lemons.
-Let's make some lemon soup.

258
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,645
-It must be the secret to your youth.
-I guess so.

259
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,279
-Your skin is in great condition too.
-Yes.

260
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,482
She eats lots of lemons,
so her skin is in great condition.

261
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,051
And this one is sugar-free.

262
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,353
-I eat one every morning.
-What's that?

263
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,789
-Yogurt?
-You have lots of these yogurts,

264
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,258
and they're all sugar-free.

265
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,526
Do you manage your blood sugar?

266
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,462
I'm over 80 years old,
and I have high blood pressure,

267
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,264
so I can't develop diabetes.

268
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,867
-So sugar, no, thank you?
-Of course not.

269
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,603
-No sugar.
-No sugar today.

270
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,304
Are you Se-dol's mother?

271
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,507
-They're the same.
-What I hate the most is

272
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,942
-something too sugary and greasy.
-She doesn't like sugar.

273
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,944
Do you not like too much seasoning?

274
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,047
Seasoning, no, thank you.

275
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,481
No seasoning?

276
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,718
-I enjoy the taste of nature.
-The taste of nature.

277
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,087
What's this?

278
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,524
I wanted to ask the chefs.

279
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,093
Someone gave this to me as a present.

280
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,962
I didn't know what it was,
so I kept it in the freezer.

281
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,966
It's thinly sliced kelp
preserved with salt.

282
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,902
-Salted kelp.
-It's salted kelp.

283
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,437
-What is it?
-It's kelp.

284
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,972
You can add a little bit of it
when you make seasoned veggies.

285
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,110
-It adds a lot of flavor to broths too.
-Yes, it's all seasoned.

286
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,812
-It's natural condiment.
-What is this?

287
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,114
-Kelp.
-It's made with kelp.

288
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,615
-It's good.
-Isn't it?

289
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,850
But it's too sweet.

290
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,186
-It's made with salt, though.
-Let me give you some.

291
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,253
Is there a bit of salt?

292
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,689
-It's made with sugar.
-There's a bit of it.

293
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,093
But the savory taste of kelp is
already delicious.

294
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,462
-You can all take a little.
-Really?

295
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,663
This is great.

296
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,698
Can they use it as an ingredient?

297
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes or no? No?

298
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,037
I can taste a bit of MSG,
so I don't really like it.

299
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,941
-You don't have much in the freezer.
-I don't.

300
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,076
I see some bread and fish.

301
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,779
And there's another fridge.

302
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,048
There are all kinds of kimchi.

303
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,116
How many are there?

304
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,219
I made some,
and my acquaintances made some.

305
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,621
I made leaf mustard kimchi

306
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,189
because I really love it.

307
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,494
I always need kimchi with Western,
Japanese, or Korean cuisine.

308
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,531
I always eat steak with kimchi too.

309
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,768
-There were a few don'ts today.
-It won't be easy.

310
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,203
-It sounds hard.
-Really?

311
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,339
It sounds so easy to me.

312
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,040
We just need to put lemon on your dish.

313
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,077
-Right? You don't need to season it.
-Exactly.

314
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,812
We just have to pour lemon juice on it.

315
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,580
You can't just pour it.

316
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,782
Just a little?

317
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,784
What kind of orders
did Yong-yeo put in today?

318
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,287
Let's find out her order. Show us.

319
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,691
-Whatever, I want a luxurious breakfast.
-Whatever!

320
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,594
She wants a luxurious breakfast.

321
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,931
I'm here with such famous chefs,

322
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:23,469
so I thought it'd be great if they made
something very classy to my taste.

323
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,304
-I see.
-Yes.

324
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,039
Let's find out the next order.

325
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,309
-What's this seafood dish?
-What is this?

326
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,877
-What's this seafood dish?
-What is this?

327
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,146
-What is this?
-Seafood.

328
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,283
When I moved to my husband's hometown,

329
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,251
I tried thin-legged octopus
for the first time.

330
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,754
And you couldn't forget it.

331
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,522
-Abalone.
-Abalone.

332
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,491
-Sea cucumber.
-Sea cucumber.

333
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,759
It wasn't just a regular one,

334
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,494
-but red sea cucumber.
-Red sea cucumber.

335
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,863
-It sounds fun.
-The three ingredients.

336
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,699
Thin-legged octopus,
abalone, red sea cucumber.

337
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,135
These are Yong-yeo's orders.

338
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,004
She had many things
she didn't want to eat.

339
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,273
Please make a wise choice.

340
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,975
-It sounds hard.
-Yes.

341
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,144
Gyeong-jun has the least stars,

342
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,947
so we'll let you choose first.

343
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,316
I need to win another star soon,

344
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,352
-so I'll go for the luxurious breakfast.
-The luxurious breakfast.

345
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,288
A luxurious breakfast
that's better than a hotel buffet.

346
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,990
Luxury goes well with him.

347
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,125
When luxury and food come together,

348
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,628
who would suit that order best?

349
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,798
-Son Jong-won?
-It's you, Luxury Choi.

350
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,102
I'll make a luxurious breakfast for you.

351
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,938
Gyeong-jun and Hyun-suk
are up against each other.

352
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,240
-A return match.
-All right.

353
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,141
-It's a return match.
-Next, seafood dishes.

354
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,277
The ingredients are great.
Abalones and red sea cucumbers.

355
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm in Japanese cuisine,
so I should cook with seafood.

356
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,382
I'll go for it.

357
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,751
Ho-young goes for seafood
as a Japanese cuisine chef.

358
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,088
-Fabri.
-Fabri?

359
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,856
-Why?
-Are you going for the seafood?

360
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,957
The seafood.

361
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,628
I was smitten with your charms.

362
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,329
OH, MY

363
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,932
He fell for her.

364
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,635
-I became a fan right away.
-I see.

365
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,305
Chef Ho-young and Chef Fabri

366
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,641
will cook with seafood.

367
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,742
Then, please

368
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,243
let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

369
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:19,351
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with Yong-yeo's ingredients.</i>

370
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,520
The Louis Vui-bleep of chefs,

371
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,789
-Choi Hyun-suk.
-Louis Vui-bleep?

372
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,359
The Pra-bleep of chefs, Bae Gyeong-jun.

373
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,895
The two are up against each other.

374
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,265
Gyeong-jun had his debut two months ago,

375
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:38,037
and at that time, he took down
Choi Hyun-suk the Great and won.

376
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,539
But I heard you weren't so thrilled.

377
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,075
Chef Hyun-suk came to me and…

378
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,743
Keep it up, Gyeong-jun!

379
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,279
You can do it, Gyeong-jun!

380
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,915
It was humiliating.

381
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,118
It hurt my pride a lot.

382
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,820
It must feel awful.

383
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,257
He's never been bothered like that
over his entire career.

384
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,659
-Hyun-suk thought he was a joke.
-Yes.

385
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,962
I rooted for him with all my heart.

386
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,029
CHUCKLING IN DISBELIEF

387
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:08,067
-But he took it in a distorted way.
-Come to think of it, yes.

388
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,135
-It's heartbreaking.
-You must establish order again

389
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,838
-in the world of Western cuisine.
-I'm done for.

390
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,440
But your tone was suspicious.

391
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,108
-Really?
-You can do it, Gyeong-jun!

392
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,409
I'll change my tone.

393
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
You can do this, Chef Gyeong-jun.

394
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,780
-He should've done this.
-Yes.

395
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,582
I think this would be better.

396
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,518
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS: KELP VINEGAR,
CORIANDER, MULBERRY CHEONG, NATTO, LEMON

397
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,587
SEASONED DRIED LAVER, LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI,
BUTTER, SALMON, BEET, YOGURT, RYE BREAD

398
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,990
The dish I'm making is called

399
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,224
Luxury Choice.

400
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,527
With Choi in choice.

401
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,529
When it comes to a luxurious breakfast,

402
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,332
-people often eat eggs Benedict.
-Yes.

403
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,501
-I saw some hearty natto.
-Yes?

404
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,270
I'll use those and make a healthy dish.

405
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,106
-Whoa.
-With natto?

406
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,576
I've made eggs Benedict
only once when I got licensed,

407
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,078
-so it's been 30 years.
-I see.

408
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,581
Do you enjoy eggs Benedict?

409
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,084
CHUCKLES

410
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,053
-Gosh, whatever.
-Whatever?

411
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,521
YONG-YEO CAN'T LIE

412
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,957
I'll have to try it and see.

413
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,725
It was a part of the breakfast, but…

414
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,727
-She's very honest.
-Yes.

415
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,629
Will you use lemons or salmon?

416
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,966
She loves salmon, so yes. And lemons too.

417
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,135
-He'll use salmon and lemons.
-He will.

418
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,271
CHEF GYEONG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: WASABI,
BALSAMIC VINEGAR, TOMATO SAUCE, YOGURT

419
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,640
PICKLED GARLIC, CAULIFLOWER, PAPRIKA,
NAENGMYEON BROTH, SALTED KELP, AND MORE

420
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,576
Up against him is Chef Gyeong-jun.
What's your dish?

421
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,479
My dish is called Yong and Rich.

422
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,448
-Yong and Rich.
-Yes, Yong and Rich.

423
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,283
Not young and rich?

424
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,186
-It's for Yong-yeo, so Yong and Rich.
-It's Yong and Rich.

425
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,288
You had lots of Korean ingredients
in your fridge.

426
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,758
You had doenjang and leaf mustard kimchi,
so I'll use Korean ingredients

427
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,027
and turn it into a luxurious

428
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,962
-Mediterranean-style breakfast.
-Mediterranean-style.

429
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,898
-With Korean ingredients?
-Mediterranean-style?

430
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,866
-I think she'll love it.
-She will.

431
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,001
He'll use lots of lemons.

432
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,669
Are you using any flour?

433
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,805
-No?
-I have to use bread.

434
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,540
-That's flour.
-You're using flour.

435
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,241
-You're using bread?
-Yes.

436
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,843
-It's rye bread.
-Rye bread?

437
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,646
I can leave it out if you don't like it.
It's just a side dish.

438
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,414
-Rye bread?
-He'll use rye bread.

439
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,918
-It's not so bad.
-Not bad?

440
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,753
-It's not bad.
-You're saved.

441
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,988
-Rye is fine.
-It's not bad.

442
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,291
She's very strict.

443
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,760
She didn't want the salted kelp before.

444
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,061
Did you take it?

445
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,197
-Yes, I'm using it.
-Gyeong-jun is using it.

446
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,265
Good grief. Sweet mercy.

447
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,368
She just said, "Sweet mercy!"

448
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,404
-Chef Hyun-suk?
-Why is this here?

449
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,107
I DIDN'T DO IT

450
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,510
HIDING

451
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,078
He's so funny.

452
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,280
Weren't you two going to use it?

453
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,749
I won't use anything
you said no, thank you to.

454
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,884
That sounds great.

455
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,487
And now, let us begin.

456
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,056
-Are we starting now?
-Yes, we're starting.

457
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,326
He wants to defeat Choi Hyun-suk,
the top chef of the show right now,

458
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,263
and become the young and rich chef,
Bae Gyeong-jun!

459
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,166
But he claims no one can discuss
a luxurious dish without him.

460
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,536
The old and rich, Chef Choi Hyun-suk.

461
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,939
Which one of them will make
the most luxurious breakfast?

462
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,710
And now, all you want is
a luxurious breakfast, so…

463
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,411
Whatever!

464
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,915
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

465
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,184
THE LUXURIOUS BREAKFAST ROUND

466
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,987
HE BEGINS WITH SALMON

467
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,955
Hey, with that?

468
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,591
He's marinating salmon with salted kelp.

469
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,528
-She said she didn't like that.
-He used a lot of salted kelp.

470
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,863
She didn't like how it tasted like MSG.

471
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,698
-He just threw in MSG.
-A handful of that?

472
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,601
-Lemon zest.
-He should use it wisely.

473
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,103
Are you adding the fragrance?

474
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,738
Yes, that and seasoning.

475
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,439
That's a wonderful idea.

476
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,208
That's called a dry rub.

477
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,544
-Without oil.
-Dry rub.

478
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,779
HYUN-SUK BEGINS WITH SOME BEET

479
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,081
He's boiling some beet.

480
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,616
-Beet.
-He's boiling it?

481
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,319
Chef Hyun-suk is using bread too.

482
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,921
She didn't say "no, thank you."

483
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,557
HE QUICKLY PICKED IT UP

484
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,192
He's toasting the rye bread.

485
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,928
-He's making a hotel breakfast.
-Yes, right.

486
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,664
1. CHOP CAULIFLOWER AND BOIL

487
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,600
-What's that, Chef Gyeong-jun?
-Cauliflower.

488
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,735
-I see.
-It's good for you.

489
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,337
Yes, it's good for your health.

490
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,772
That's a great ingredient.

491
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,640
STARTING THE TIMER

492
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,342
ORGANIZING EVERYTHING NEATLY

493
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,213
He makes eggs Benedict for the first time
since the license exam.

494
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,348
The poached egg is the most important part
of eggs Benedict.

495
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,382
Both of them.

496
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,884
He's poaching the egg.

497
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,752
This is the important part.

498
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,487
This is the most important part
of eggs Benedict.

499
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,156
He added vinegar,

500
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,659
which helps the egg
stay together and harden.

501
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,695
He's done
if he fails to make the poached egg.

502
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,463
-Isn't that the key part?
-Yes.

503
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,298
THE TIMER RINGS

504
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,536
2. COOL CAULIFLOWER IN ICED WATER AND DRY

505
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,771
Chef Gyeong-jun, why did you break an egg?

506
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,240
-Gyeong-jun?
-I'm poaching it too.

507
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,342
-You'll make a poached egg too?
-Yes.

508
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,811
3. ADD VINEGAR AND CAULIFLOWER WATER
INTO BOILING WATER

509
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,846
SWISH

510
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,583
He's using a whisk
to create a twister in the water.

511
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,818
It went in nicely.

512
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,254
-They're using different methods.
-They are.

513
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,589
-Nice.
-Their styles.

514
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,459
-Their styles are different.
-One used a dish, the other used a ladle.

515
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,127
Fabri, who do you think is better?

516
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,328
WONDERING…

517
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,964
-Using a dish is the fine dining style.
-Yes.

518
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,501
-This is the usual style.
-Fabri liked Gyeong-jun better.

519
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,036
He's the Joseon style.

520
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,504
-The isolated king style.
-Yes.

521
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,673
OLD AND RICH

522
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,708
-That looks good.
-The salmon.

523
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,110
He pulled out the salmon.

524
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,678
They're both using salmon.

525
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,480
Keep an eye on them and see
who's using sugar and oil.

526
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,882
Whoa, was that sugar or salt?

527
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,684
-Salt.
-Salt.

528
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,752
He just salted the salmon.

529
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,820
She said she eats a bit of salt.

530
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,088
READING HER FACE

531
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,590
-Wasn't that too much?
-The salt.

532
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,059
-He's using oil!
-The oil!

533
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,960
Wait.

534
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,763
He needs to use a little bit of olive oil.

535
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,934
THE NEXT COMPETING CHEFS
ARE LISTENING INTENTLY

536
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,804
1. PUT SALMON ON A GRIDIRON
AND GRILL WITH OLIVE OIL

537
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,839
-He can use that much.
-Was that okay?

538
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,875
It'll taste good when it's simply grilled.

539
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,244
The salmon looks amazing.

540
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,980
He coated the salmon with olive oil
and began to grill it.

541
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,216
-The egg is done. Does it look good?
-I hope it doesn't pop.

542
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,384
Does it look good?

543
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,552
A little more time.

544
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,788
OVER THE POACHED EGG,

545
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,822
HE BEGINS TO MELT BUTTER

546
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,058
Did he just put butter in?

547
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,227
CHECKING THE OIL TEMPERATURE

548
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,496
-I see.
-Is that oil?

549
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,598
-Into the oil.
-Into the oil?

550
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,468
Just like that? He's confiting that.

551
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,136
-That's all oil.
-An oil dish.

552
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,271
He's marinading it in oil.

553
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,039
-Everything in there is oil.
-He's marinading it in oil.

554
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,509
-He just threw it into oil with kelp.
-She told him not to do that.

555
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,412
In the fashion of getting steamed in oil.

556
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,448
She told him not to do that.

557
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,883
HYUN-SUK IS FOCUSED ON THE SALMON TOO

558
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,019
Whoa, it's on fire!

559
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,087
Is it burnt?

560
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,556
Is it okay? Oh, no. I think it's burnt.

561
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,424
You'll turn it into some more,
salmon soot!

562
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,893
-Some more and salmon?
-Salmon soot?

563
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,129
THE SALMON IS TURNING INTO SOOT

564
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,897
-No!
-It's stuck!

565
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,867
-You have to save it!
-It's stuck!

566
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,268
ITS SKIN IS STILL STUCK

567
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,236
This isn't good!

568
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,239
-It's turning into salmon soot!
-Salmon soot!

569
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,075
-You have to put it out!
-It's burning!

570
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,643
-Save it!
-No!

571
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,547
-No, it's burnt!
-It turned into salmon soot.

572
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,716
Doesn't it look too dark?

573
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,985
-It's not.
-Is it because it's too greasy?

574
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,886
Is that so?

575
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,254
It's charred.

576
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,022
It's all right.

577
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,858
GYEONG-JUN MAKES SAUCE

578
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,260
Doenjang, sesame oil,
and balsamic vinegar.

579
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:16,895
ALL RIGHT

580
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,397
Gyeong-jun uses lemon too.

581
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,831
He added lemon.

582
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,101
BRUSHING THE SAUCE ON THE CAULIFLOWER

583
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,472
INTO THE OVEN

584
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,408
They only have
9 minutes and 52 seconds left.

585
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,876
-Time is flying too quickly.
-Yes.

586
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,844
-There are nine minutes left.
-Gosh.

587
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,715
2. ADD COOKED BEET AND WATER
WITH AN IMMERSION BLENDER

588
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,251
HE'S ABOUT TO GRIND THE BEET…

589
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,952
THE BEET JUICE FLOWS OUT

590
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,621
-Look at that!
-Hey!

591
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,490
-What's going on?
-It's so scary!

592
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,460
A horror movie! It's like a horror movie!

593
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,262
-It's horrifying!
-How scary!

594
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,063
It's the horror special.

595
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,131
Don't kill it!

596
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,033
-Don't kill it!
-He put in too much.

597
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,568
It's making us uncomfortable.

598
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,037
-What's that?
-The blood is seeping out.

599
00:23:59,104 --> 00:23:59,971
How scary!

600
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:00,939
Is that supposed to happen?

601
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,208
-No, I've never seen that before.
-What are you grinding?

602
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,977
-Beet.
-It was like a horror movie.

603
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,046
Yong-yeo begins to frown.

604
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,149
HER FACE SAYS, "NO, THANK YOU"

605
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,885
-What's he doing right now?
-What's he doing?

606
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,588
-What was that?
-He's using lemons.

607
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,923
He needs lots of lemon juice.

608
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,225
Yong-yeo's favorite, lemons.

609
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,462
He added lemon juice into the beet juice.

610
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,398
-Yogurt.
-What's it for?

611
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,767
-It goes in there?
-He mixes it with beet.

612
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,801
With beet.

613
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,736
-Is he boiling yogurt?
-Sugar-free yogurt.

614
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,939
-He's boiling yogurt?
-That's a pretty color.

615
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:34,940
Can you boil yogurt?

616
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,876
Boiling yogurt will destroy
all its lactic acid bacteria.

617
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,346
-He doesn't care about nutrition.
-Goodbye, lactic acid bacteria.

618
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,548
It's sterile now.

619
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,184
Yong-yeo doesn't look so thrilled.

620
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,254
She doesn't look so happy right now.

621
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,357
Why do you think
she takes lactic acid bacteria?

622
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,758
She eats it for the lactic acid bacteria!

623
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,795
-How can you kill it all? Whatever!
-Whatever!

624
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,332
-What is this?
-No, the yo…

625
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,367
-That's a nice color, though.
-It is.

626
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,468
I'll have to wait and see.

627
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,971
-Things may change drastically at the end.
-Yes.

628
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:06,972
Let's watch until the end.

629
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,575
Gyeong-jun fishes out the salmon.

630
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,746
He's slicing cucumber.

631
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,048
YOGURT, WASABI, AND GINGER JUICE

632
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,353
5. MIX CUCUMBER, SALTED KELP, SAUCE,
AND ADD LEMON JUICE AND ZEST

633
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,822
THE MEDITERRANEAN CUCUMBER SALAD
WITH TZATZIKI SAUCE IS DONE

634
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,824
ABSORBED IN COOKING SALMON

635
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,293
Whoa, yes.

636
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,129
HE FINALLY REMEMBERED THE POACHED EGG

637
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,731
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

638
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,032
It's ruined.

639
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,501
-Do it over.
-It's been overcooked.

640
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,936
-He forgot.
-I forgot.

641
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,238
He's poaching the egg for the second time.

642
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,139
Was it ruined?

643
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,909
-Goodness.
-Oh, no. He's trying again.

644
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,077
Oh, no. He's trying again.

645
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,812
-It's been too long.
-I keep the ladle there

646
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,782
-and watch it until it's poached.
-Exactly.

647
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,618
He should've watched it
even if it took up some time.

648
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,387
It was overcooked.

649
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,556
Yes, so will you be quiet?

650
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,759
Why do you think we're here
if we have to sit quietly?

651
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,928
Why would I be on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?

652
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,197
You might as well cook at home
or at a temple!

653
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,933
Why would you cook here?

654
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,702
GYEONG-JUN CHECKS HIS POACHED EGG TOO

655
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,773
It came out perfectly.

656
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,541
-That's what it's like.
-Gyeong-jun succeeds.

657
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,477
The egg yolk should be translucent.

658
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,913
He's using cucumber.

659
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,415
I think he'll grind that.

660
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,318
He's using cucumber, tomato…

661
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,286
He's using lots of Korean ingredients.

662
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,488
I'm making cold Spanish soup

663
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,757
-called gazpacho.
-It's gazpacho!

664
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,159
He's making gazpacho.

665
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,794
He's using lactic acid bacteria
with kimchi water.

666
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,995
He added kimchi water.

667
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,930
-Lactic acid bacteria are great for you.
-Yes.

668
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,666
It looks like Chef Gyeong-jun got
more points so far.

669
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,168
BUT…

670
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,302
Why won't it work this time?

671
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,571
The blender isn't working.

672
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,474
-I think he needs help.
-Help him.

673
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,610
-I think he needs help.
-Help him.

674
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,144
Can someone help me?

675
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,312
I guess he didn't check.

676
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,615
You're losing lots of time.
You have 6 minutes and 30 seconds.

677
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,284
-He's having trouble!
-Oh, no!

678
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,986
ANXIOUS

679
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,854
-It's like this.
-It is?

680
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,824
-He can't do it!
-That wasn't it!

681
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,025
It didn't fit perfectly.

682
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,827
You have 6 minute and 20 seconds!

683
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,996
-Like this.
-He should've checked.

684
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,365
-He can't grind the soup!
-You lost a minute!

685
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,766
-It's not working!
-No!

686
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,468
FAILED

687
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,535
-What now?
-Oh, no.

688
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,604
EVERYONE HAS A MELTDOWN

689
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,306
KWON SUNG-JUN GOES OUT

690
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,074
LEE JOON GOES OUT(?)

691
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,643
FABRI RE-ENTERS

692
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,211
HE FINALLY SUCCEEDS

693
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,345
Do you need help?

694
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,413
You got it?

695
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,548
RETURNING TO HIS SEAT

696
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,616
It's working.

697
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,218
SIGH

698
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,020
What just happened, Gyeong-jun?

699
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,589
You just lost 40 seconds.

700
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,192
In that while, Chef Hyun-suk
finished poaching the egg.

701
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,061
HE BEGINS TO MAKE SAUCE RIGHT AWAY

702
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,096
Kelp vinegar and egg.

703
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,767
-He's making the hollandaise sauce.
-Hollandaise sauce.

704
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,970
IT SHOULD BECOME SMOOTH LIKE SAUCE

705
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,439
BUT THE EGG YOLK IS TURNING INTO LUMPS

706
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,541
CHECKING FOR TIME

707
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,811
HE THROWS IT OUT

708
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,312
-Did it go well?
-Does it look good?

709
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,681
I failed.

710
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,749
You failed? Why? I thought it looked good.

711
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,918
The egg yolk was ruined.
Well, the poached egg is fine.

712
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,186
Are you doing it over?

713
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,488
A chicken had to go into labor
to lay that egg!

714
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,357
-It had to go into labor?
-The hollandaise sauce?

715
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,459
A chicken had to go into labor
for that egg!

716
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,261
-He's in trouble.
-A whisk.

717
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,462
This is a lot of fun.

718
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,265
And he'll start whisking now.

719
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:24,436
The hollandaise sauce will only look good
with at least three egg yolks or so.

720
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,905
But he's doing it by using just one.

721
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,708
-I think he's in trouble.
-Do you need me to hold your hand?

722
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,877
All right. Okay.

723
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,480
-He's in trouble. It's ruined.
-What is this?

724
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,549
-It was ruined again.
-It's fine.

725
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,783
Be quiet.

726
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,119
He looks the most flustered today.

727
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,754
-Really?
-Among the days I've seen him.

728
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,290
Sung-ju, it's an absolute mess!

729
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,925
Tell us what it's like out there!

730
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,861
-I'll go out and check.
-This is the worst.

731
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,730
-I've never seen him like that.
-Check on him!

732
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,031
He's such a veteran too.

733
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,000
-It was ruined. He said it was.
-It was ruined?

734
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,303
HE WASHED OFF LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI

735
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,072
Goodbye, lactic acid bacteria.

736
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,676
-He just got natto.
-Natto.

737
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,244
He killed the nutrition in that too.

738
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,115
-You're right.
-You killed the bacteria in natto too?

739
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,851
-He sterilized it too.
-Even natto?

740
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,319
A sterilized dish.

741
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,155
The sauce made with ground beet.

742
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,457
-Yes, try that.
-Let me try this one.

743
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,493
The sterilized sauce.

744
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,495
Does it taste luxurious?

745
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,932
Does it taste luxurious?

746
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,401
-Gosh, it's too sour!
-Too sour?

747
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,571
-Too much lemon juice?
-I think so.

748
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:34,906
She likes lemons,

749
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,308
-but it's too sour for me.
-Is it?

750
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,611
-He couldn't keep the balance.
-It may be sour to you,

751
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,212
-but it may not be to others.
-Yes!

752
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,947
Yes, this is strictly my taste.

753
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,983
He just added butter.

754
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,951
She wouldn't like a lot of butter.

755
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,453
-Do you like butter?
-Butter?

756
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,322
-Just let him do it.
-Let him do it?

757
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,391
-Just let him do it!
-Leave him alone.

758
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,126
GIVEN UP ON HIM

759
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,363
-Oh, no!
-Hyun-suk already fell out of her favor.

760
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,899
-This is a lot of fun.
-He's trying to make it delicious.

761
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,535
The leaf mustard kimchi is good.
He put it in here.

762
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,804
He just got the salmon.

763
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,808
Gyeong-jun just blended everything.

764
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:13,111
This blended thing. Let me try this one.

765
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,813
It's a Mediterranean cold soup.

766
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,383
Are you in the Mediterranean?

767
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,418
Are you in the Mediterranean?

768
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,553
I am.

769
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,955
It must taste clean.

770
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,523
But he used Korean ingredients.

771
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,027
-That's amazing.
-I thought I was in Greece.

772
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,361
It's giving Greece.

773
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,530
Gazpacho is made

774
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,366
with red wine vinegar.

775
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,135
<i>But he used kimchi water</i>
<i>for sourness instead.</i>

776
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,103
<i>-To add sourness?</i>
<i>-That's a great idea.</i>

777
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,705
Yes, so it was fermented.

778
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,474
HE PUTS A DISH INTO THE OVEN

779
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,010
RUNNING TO THE FRIDGE!

780
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,012
HE HAD PUT A DISH IN HERE BEFORE

781
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,315
RETURNING WITH THE COLD DISH

782
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,450
-He's using leaf mustard kimchi too.
-He's using it too.

783
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,786
He's going to serve it as is.

784
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,821
He's pouring it now.

785
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,523
FILLING IT UP WITH GAZPACHO

786
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,858
It looks pretty!

787
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,060
-It looks like gazpacho.
-It's pretty.

788
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,995
You have two minutes.

789
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,464
RYE BREAD TOPPED WITH STERILIZED(?) NATTO

790
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,234
AND POACHED EGG ABOVE THAT

791
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,502
FINISHES THE EGGS BENEDICT
WITH DRIED LAVER FLAKES

792
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,638
LASTLY, THE BEET SAUCE

793
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,407
ADDING MULBERRY CHEONG

794
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,076
SERVING SALMON WITH THE BEET SAUCE

795
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,144
They both have similar color schemes.

796
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,448
The salmon goes
on top of the sauce as a whole.

797
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,049
It does look a bit burnt.

798
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,085
-Wouldn't it taste charred?
-No.

799
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,920
-It looks like soot.
-It's not.

800
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,088
He goes back to hollandaise.

801
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,624
He seems a bit pouty.

802
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,858
He's done!

803
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,762
Hyun-suk is done
with a minute and 30 seconds left.

804
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,232
GYEONG-JUN BEGINS TO MAKE SALAD

805
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,168
Gyeong-jun lost 40 seconds or so
while wrestling with the blender.

806
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,437
More lemon.

807
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,539
He added balsamic vinegar.

808
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,975
I think that's the salad.

809
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,778
You have a minute left.
We're only waiting for Gyeong-jun.

810
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,713
HYUN-SUK RANG THE BELL A WHILE AGO

811
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,016
ADDING SALT
DOES HE FORGET THINGS OUT OF HABIT?

812
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,985
Oh, wait.

813
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,187
You rang the bell already.
What are you doing?

814
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,323
-What are you doing?
-I'll take the bell back.

815
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,424
You'll take it back?

816
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,761
-He can take it back?
-It's my first time seeing it.

817
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,764
PULLING OUT THE DISH FROM THE OVEN

818
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,834
-He'll take back the bell.
-I almost let him run with this.

819
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,304
-He'll take back ringing the bell.
-He'll take it back.

820
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,239
Roasted cauliflower.

821
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,308
He cancels ringing the bell.

822
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,410
-He cancels.
-And he's finally done.

823
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,445
In the end, he hid the burnt portion.

824
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,247
TOP SECURITY(?)

825
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,649
-It's not burnt. It's crunchy.
-It's not?

826
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,419
And it's cooked to medium rare
on the inside.

827
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,120
HE MAKES SAUCE FOR THE CAULIFLOWER

828
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,091
8. GRIND CORIANDER, PARSLEY, OLIVE OIL,
BALSAMIC VINEGAR, AND PICKED GARLIC

829
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,926
FINISHED IN NO TIME

830
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,962
TOP THE SAUCE GENEROUSLY
OVER THE CAULIFLOWER

831
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:44,996
Gyeong-jun.

832
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,798
You have 20 seconds left.

833
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,934
You have 20 seconds left.
You must finish within 15 minutes.

834
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,070
THE EGG WHITE SPLITS APART

835
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,905
TREMBLING

836
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,640
-No!
-No!

837
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,775
-No!
-No!

838
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,011
-You must finish within 15 minutes.
-No!

839
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,380
LANDED SAFELY

840
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,048
Hey, you saved it.

841
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,017
THE EGG YOLK IS PEEKING OUT

842
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,219
-It's still intact.
-Eight!

843
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,255
I won't root for him today.

844
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,658
SERVING THE CUCUMBER SALAD

845
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,793
-Five. Four.
-Four.

846
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,695
-Three. Two.
-Oh, no.

847
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,864
-Oh, no.
-Two. One.

848
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,567
And he's done.

849
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,868
Where's the topping?

850
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,970
I should've topped it,
but I didn't have enough time.

851
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,572
I see.

852
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,707
If you had it made, just put it on top.

853
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,609
May I just top it with the salad?

854
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,311
Shouldn't you get my consent?

855
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,545
You're right!

856
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,280
No.

857
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,682
DISAPPOINTED

858
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,884
He's in a tough spot today.

859
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,552
Go ahead.

860
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,221
BUT THE OLD MAN IS STILL GENEROUS

861
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,823
-He already had it made.
-Chef Hyun-suk was considerate.

862
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,059
-He's such a generous man.
-The last touch.

863
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,561
He had trouble with that
because of the blender.

864
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,296
Everything was finished.

865
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,799
THE LUXURIOUS DISHES ENTER

866
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,634
WOW

867
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,303
All right. First, Chef Hyun-suk's dish.

868
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,673
Please try Luxury Choice first.

869
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:08,546
SALMON STEAK
SERVED WITH LEAF MUSTARD AND BEET SAUCE

870
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,384
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S LUXURY CHOICE

871
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,720
-Pop the poached egg and eat it together.
-What?

872
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,422
-Pop the poached egg.
-Pop the egg.

873
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,391
-Pop the egg.
-But I don't want to pop it.

874
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,926
-She doesn't want to.
-It's such a shame.

875
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:26,531
-It looks so nice and…
-Yes, it's a lot of hard work.

876
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,866
You have to pop it
and eat everything together.

877
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,502
-Is that better? Then I'll do it.
-Yes, it is.

878
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,572
-I'm sorry.
-She popped the egg yolk.

879
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,908
-It was cooked perfectly.
-Try it with the egg yolk.

880
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,043
You should dip it in some egg yolk.

881
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,145
-I have to?
-It'll be even better.

882
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,413
You can take a big bite.

883
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,648
That's how she likes it.

884
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,883
She tried the egg yolk too.

885
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,586
GULP

886
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,755
-It's good.
-Is it?

887
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,056
-It's not bad.
-I see.

888
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,693
How does it compare
to your usual hotel breakfast?

889
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,762
That place is just a buffet.

890
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,031
But this was a luxurious dish,
so it's different.

891
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,833
-So they're different.
-Yes.

892
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,236
-He put so much work into this.
-And it's luxurious.

893
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,171
This bread is quite nice.

894
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,307
Does the bread taste nice? The rye bread.

895
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,109
-He had it toasted.
-I see.

896
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,544
She's taking a bite
of bread, egg, and the egg yolk.

897
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,115
It looks good.

898
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,017
-It is.
-I see.

899
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,086
-The main dish is important to me.
-The main dish.

900
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,422
-She loves salmon very much.
-She does.

901
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,159
-Oh, my.
-I made the skin extra-crispy

902
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,662
-and soft and medium-rare inside.
-It's topped with coriander, my favorite.

903
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,932
-Yes, she's not listening.
-It's crispy outside and soft inside.

904
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,836
-She doesn't even listen to Hyun-suk.
-That's almost…

905
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,538
I don't have to eat this part.

906
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,541
SHE PUSHES THE SOOT(?) SKIN OUT

907
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,610
What's wrong?

908
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,478
She won't eat the skin.

909
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,446
She pushed it out.

910
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,449
-I actually love the skin.
-I see.

911
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,619
-But it's too…
-It looks nicely cooked.

912
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,787
-Don't push it out.
-It's not burnt.

913
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,523
The skin must be cooked deliciously.

914
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,159
-Try it with the sauce.
-It'll taste crunchy and delicious.

915
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,428
Please check and see if the skin is burnt.

916
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,063
IS THE SALMON SKIN ALL RIGHT?

917
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,167
It was cooked well.

918
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,535
-It wasn't burnt.
-And…

919
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,136
I thought it burned
when it caught on fire.

920
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,538
TRYING THE SAUCE FIRST

921
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,972
This sauce is delicious.

922
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,042
-"This sauce is delicious."
-"This sauce is delicious."

923
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,811
I knew it.

924
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,649
You said you didn't like
lots of seasoning or strong-tasting food.

925
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,019
It's a little too strong for me,

926
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,488
but it tastes great with lots of lemon.

927
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,890
It was too sour for me.

928
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,259
See? That's why he'll age faster.

929
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,128
You'll age faster.

930
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,197
Eat lots of sour food.

931
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,731
It's delicious.

932
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,567
So you think it's delicious
when it's that sour?

933
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,535
Yes, the sauce is very delicious.

934
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,170
-Gosh.
-Today, that sauce…

935
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,839
My stomach is going,
"Thanks a lot, Yong-yeo."

936
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,575
Oh, boy.

937
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,844
-It's thanking her.
-For putting in delicious food.

938
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,147
Her body is happy. Is it good?

939
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,648
JEALOUS

940
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,017
My stomach is going, "Thank you."

941
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,852
Her body is thanking her.

942
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,355
-It says thanks, not saying no, thank you.
-Thank you.

943
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,792
-I kind of like the sauce.
-She liked the sauce.

944
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,195
Next, Chef Gyeong-jun's dish.

945
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,897
It's Yong and Rich.

946
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,202
DOENJANG CAULIFLOWER STEAK
TOPPED WITH A POACHED EGG

947
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,640
CHEF BAE GYEONG-JUN'S YONG AND RICH

948
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,809
Gosh, this looks good.

949
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,945
Did you think it looked good
as soon as you saw it?

950
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,013
All of a sudden?

951
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,982
I made it with tomato
and leaf mustard kimchi.

952
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,650
WHAT'S LEAF MUSTARD GAZPACHO LIKE?

953
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,553
TASTING

954
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,955
What's it like?

955
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,758
There's perilla oil on top,
so please mix that in.

956
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,593
-There's perilla oil on top.
-Mix it in.

957
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,494
DROPPED!

958
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,429
You know…

959
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,164
You know,

960
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,568
he's done a great job. Here's why.

961
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,272
Leaf mustard is good for you.
It cleanses your blood.

962
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:59,110
It's amazing that he used it
with this sauce and made this.

963
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,112
THE LEAF MUSTARD IS AMAZING

964
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,615
Doesn't it taste like
a Mediterranean dish?

965
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,850
Do you feel that?

966
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,386
We have to learn
from the Mediterranean diet.

967
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,755
-We must learn from their diet.
-We must learn.

968
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:11,822
It's nothing like a buffet.

969
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,524
-It's luxurious.
-It's luxurious.

970
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,726
-A buffet would serve just pumpkin soup.
-Right.

971
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,962
-Or cream soup.
-Yes.

972
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:18,929
It's amazing.

973
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,232
-She's amazed.
-And try the salmon too.

974
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,101
-It'd be nice if you try it with cucumber.
-With cucumber.

975
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,803
-With the tzatziki sauce.
-There's cucumber?

976
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,405
I see. It's down here.

977
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,508
There's that thing.
The thing she didn't like.

978
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,844
-The kelp.
-The thing she told him not to use.

979
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,547
He probably has a reason
for doing what you told him not to.

980
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,984
You should try it with the salmon.
That'd taste too strong.

981
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,319
There's a bit of wasabi.

982
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,689
It is a bit salty.

983
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,325
-Try it with the salmon.
-Try the salmon.

984
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,227
-You have to eat it with the salmon.
-No.

985
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,962
But still.

986
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,597
-Even so, it's too salty!
-You can't do that!

987
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,701
It should be good just as it is.

988
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,704
-Why didn't you put lemon on this?
-Why didn't you put lemon on that?

989
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,771
You didn't use lemon?

990
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,874
THIS TIME, SHE TRIES IT WITH THE SALMON

991
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,844
It would've been perfect
with a dash of lemon juice.

992
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,079
Gosh, the lemon.

993
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,915
-It's a shame that he didn't use lemon.
-The lemon.

994
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,149
Gosh, the lemon.

995
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,417
Now, the last one.

996
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,821
-Pop the egg and eat it together.
-Pop the egg?

997
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,956
-I have to pop this too?
-Yes.

998
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,159
I don't like popping the egg yolk
when I eat poached eggs.

999
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,728
-I see.
-I see.

1000
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,063
-I don't have to do it, right?
-No, you don't.

1001
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,732
She wants to eat it her way.

1002
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,000
AMAZED AT THE QUEEN'S SPIRIT

1003
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,304
It's right for the customer
to eat it however they like.

1004
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,005
You should've boiled the egg!

1005
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,375
Why didn't you get that?

1006
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,010
Hey, you have to stop it.

1007
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,812
You punk.

1008
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,348
I popped this egg

1009
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,650
-because Hyun-suk served it with bread.
-Yes.

1010
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,854
-I liked how it smeared into the bread.
-That's why she popped it.

1011
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,691
But it's kind of weird
to pop it over the cauliflower.

1012
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,993
She has clear preferences.

1013
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,262
It's a bit greasy too.

1014
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,764
A BITE OF JUST THE CAULIFLOWER STEAK

1015
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,601
What's it like, Yong-yeo? Is it good?

1016
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,703
You tried your best.

1017
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,305
He tried his best?
What do you mean by that?

1018
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,341
-You tried your best?
-What does she mean?

1019
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,209
-He did try.
-He tried his best.

1020
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,146
-He tried his best.
-Right? He tried his best.

1021
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,349
She looked at everything
with strict preferences.

1022
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,684
-Do you want to press it already?
-The remote control? Now?

1023
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,487
-She went for the remote control.
-She made her decision already.

1024
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,824
-She went for the remote control already.
-The remote control.

1025
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,726
-She's ready.
-She decides quickly.

1026
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,563
Here's one thing I want to say clearly.

1027
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,231
It's tough to beat experience.

1028
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,833
-Experience.
-It's tough to beat.

1029
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,003
-I see. That was significant.
-Yes.

1030
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,439
Joon, will you try it on our behalf?

1031
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,606
Thank you.

1032
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,475
-It's for Joon.
-I was starving.

1033
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,576
Give him Chef Hyun-suk's dish.

1034
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,013
I'm sorry to ask,
but are you happy because it's free?

1035
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,247
I think you're happy that it's free.

1036
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,617
I was already dying to try it
when they cooked because of the smell.

1037
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,685
SUPER EXCITED OVER THE SMELL

1038
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,253
-How do I eat this?
-Try Chef Hyun-suk's dish first.

1039
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,022
They both tried hard.

1040
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,890
Eat everything together.

1041
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,393
Yes. That's how it's supposed to be eaten.

1042
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,994
A BIG BITE OF THE NATTO EGGS BENEDICT

1043
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,764
What is this?

1044
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,265
NATTO STRETCHES OUT

1045
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,733
-You've never had anything like it?
-What's this?

1046
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,069
-Natto.
-That's natto. Beans.

1047
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,871
-Beans?
-Beans.

1048
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,675
You should've said those were beans.
How is he supposed to know what natto is?

1049
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,111
Young-kyu, he's so clueless.

1050
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,981
That could happen, Father. Come on.

1051
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:29,053
You know,
this flavor is very delicious yet healthy.

1052
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,689
It doesn't taste too strong at all.

1053
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,159
Here's how it feels. Gosh.

1054
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,260
HE FACES A DEAD END

1055
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,761
He has to express this.

1056
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,896
This is…

1057
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,464
How can I put this?

1058
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,832
It tastes like natto.

1059
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,534
It tastes like natto.

1060
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,036
Yes, because he used natto!

1061
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,873
Gosh, he has a perfect sense of taste!
Wow.

1062
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,407
This is the main dish.

1063
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,978
This is the main dish, the lemon sauce.

1064
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,813
-The salmon.
-It's salmon, not the sauce.

1065
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,715
-The salmon is the main dish.
-It's the salmon.

1066
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,084
-Like this.
-It's really good.

1067
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,151
Joon gives it a try.

1068
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,822
WILL IT SATISFY JOON'S APPETITE TOO?

1069
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,657
CURIOUS

1070
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,127
-It feels like I'm at a vacation spot,
-Yes.

1071
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,963
and a very talented local chef

1072
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,999
just made me this under a palm tree.

1073
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,501
-It tastes like a local dish overseas?
-Yes.

1074
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,370
This is amazing.

1075
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,138
-All right.
-Try that one.

1076
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,008
-Give that to him.
-This time, Gyeong-jun's dish.

1077
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,278
CHEF BAE GYEONG-JUN'S YONG AND RICH

1078
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,079
Whoa, this is delicious. What's this?

1079
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,981
He likes this kind of flavor.

1080
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,883
His response is so obvious.

1081
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,552
That's the Mediterranean-style soup.

1082
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,320
Whoa, this soup.

1083
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,489
-How is this so good?
-I see.

1084
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,957
Is it because you've never tried it?

1085
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,960
I think he added
some radish kimchi water too.

1086
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,728
-You're right.
-He did.

1087
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,031
This is a foreign dish, right?

1088
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,934
But its balance with kimchi
is unbelievable.

1089
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,305
Kimchi played a great role in this.

1090
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,839
He's already used up his expressions.

1091
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,408
-He used up his words.
-He's done.

1092
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,710
-Cucumber and salmon.
-Tzatziki sauce.

1093
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,378
NEXT, HE TRIES THE SALMON CONFIT SALAD

1094
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,547
Now, so?

1095
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,050
-Gosh.
-What is it?

1096
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,618
-Do you like it?
-Is it good?

1097
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,687
-It's so good.
-Gosh.

1098
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,121
What is this… It's…

1099
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,590
Is this raw fish?

1100
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,124
Salmon.

1101
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,293
It was cooked lightly.

1102
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,330
I like my food cooked rare.

1103
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,932
-When my mom told me to get bulgogi,
-Bulgogi?

1104
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,167
it smelled so good

1105
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,535
so I ate the raw meat.

1106
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,003
In its marinated state?

1107
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,606
Yes, in its marinated state.
I like that a lot, as well as tofu.

1108
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,873
THE NEXT PARTICIPANTS ARE IN TROUBLE

1109
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,408
-You had that raw?
-Wait.

1110
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,310
IN SHOCK

1111
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,112
But I'm alive and well.
It's not dangerous.

1112
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,615
It suits me fine.

1113
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,050
My checkups always look fine.

1114
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,786
He likes how it isn't cooked too much.

1115
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,722
-Try the egg.
-I'll pop the egg.

1116
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,789
NEXT, THE CAULIFLOWER STEAK

1117
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,658
He's different.

1118
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,026
A BIG BITE

1119
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,327
Does it have a new flavor?

1120
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,665
The cauliflower may taste strange.

1121
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,701
This is rather light.

1122
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,206
This was the first time
he didn't say it was delicious.

1123
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,375
-It's just light.
-It's rather light.

1124
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,778
"You tried hard," and "It's rather light."
What do they mean by these?

1125
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,347
He must like strong-tasting food.

1126
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,317
-People who work out would love it.
-People who work out?

1127
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,786
-They don't care about the flavor.
-No.

1128
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,222
But the choice is Yong-yeo's.

1129
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,125
-Goodness. Sweet mercy.
-Sweet mercy.

1130
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,627
Press one for Bae Gyeong-jun.

1131
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,130
Press two for Choi Hyun-suk.

1132
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,700
Make your choice and press the button.

1133
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,535
Only the fridge owner can press that.

1134
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,237
Gosh, this was…

1135
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,606
-Oh, here we go.
-Here we go. She pressed it.

1136
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,476
Whatever, I want a luxurious breakfast!

1137
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:43,514
Will Gyeong-jun win against Hyun-suk
two rounds in a row?

1138
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,984
Or will Hyun-suk
get his revenge on Gyeong-jun?

1139
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,619
Which chef

1140
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,587
did Yong-yeo choose?

1141
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,922
Whose breakfast was better?

1142
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,390
CHOI HYUN-SUK WINS

1143
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,658
CHOI HYUN-SUK'S LUXURIOUS CHOICE WINS

1144
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,728
Choi Hyun-suk wins!

1145
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,732
AS ALWAYS, HIS SWOOSH OF VICTORY

1146
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,434
FEELS BAD AND AVOIDS LOOKING AT HIM

1147
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,870
-I couldn't help it.
-What was the biggest difference?

1148
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,874
The salmon skin was roasted perfectly.

1149
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,976
It was broiled over fire.

1150
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,679
And I loved the sauce a lot.

1151
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,315
-The beet sauce.
-The sterilized sauce.

1152
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,918
-The sterilized sauce?
-It was a great idea.

1153
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,353
But he only tried his best
with the cauliflower.

1154
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,692
-He tried his best and lost.
-It's over.

1155
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,828
That's why I feel bad.

1156
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,097
And for the salmon,

1157
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:37,634
-I would've liked it if it were more sour.
-More lemon juice.

1158
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,136
Do you have more lemons left?

1159
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,104
I do.

1160
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,106
You should've put more in!

1161
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,174
-I've been regretting it.
-You should've made lemon soup!

1162
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,543
I kept mentioning lemon.

1163
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,378
She kept giving him hints!

1164
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,482
Just add some minced garlic
to lemon juice.

1165
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,051
-Add just a bit of minced garlic.
-Gosh.

1166
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,854
-Then add a whisk of wasabi.
-Yes.

1167
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,589
-Add some wasabi.
-She already gave you hints.

1168
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,592
Then add lots of lemon juice inside.
That's the best sauce.

1169
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,927
-That's the best!
-That's the best sauce!

1170
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,096
I kept mentioning lemon.

1171
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,766
-This is why experience is important.
-Exactly.

1172
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:12,736
Chef Hyun-suk's experience wins,
and he takes yet another star.

1173
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,272
-Please put it on him.
-Really?

1174
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,907
Anyway, congratulations.

1175
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,509
Please put the star on him.

1176
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,178
Why do you have so many stars?
Share a little.

1177
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,982
This is his ninth win!

1178
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,518
Congratulations!

1179
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,020
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1180
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,221
The ninth win.

1181
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,926
<i>Next, the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Yong-yeo's fridge.</i>

1182
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,362
What's this seafood dish?

1183
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,197
-Whatever!
-What is this?

1184
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,432
Yong-yeo has the top three seafood

1185
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,136
she enjoyed the most
over the 80 years of her life.

1186
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,404
Red sea cucumber.

1187
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,472
Abalone.

1188
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,407
-Thin-legged octopus.
-They're all good.

1189
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,876
You'll have to use
these ingredients today.

1190
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,679
The top Japanese chef,
Chef Jung Ho-young is

1191
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,948
up against Chef Fabri,
an Italian Michelin-star chef.

1192
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,384
This is their first round.

1193
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,988
As you have seen already
with Yong-yeo's evaluation,

1194
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,391
-it's not easy to please her.
-No.

1195
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:11,528
That's why I brought garlic and lemon.

1196
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,596
You did that right away.

1197
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,432
She also said in passing

1198
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,402
that she didn't prefer instant rice.

1199
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,803
So I decided to make rice myself.

1200
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,538
LOOK AT HOW CONSIDERATE HO-YOUNG IS

1201
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,506
That's a good move.

1202
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,609
He's such a true chef.

1203
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,948
And among the things she says
when evaluating, you should be scared of,

1204
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,718
-"You've tried your best."
-If she says that, it's over.

1205
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:35,786
"You've done well. Good work."

1206
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,822
-It really hurt.
-"You can't win a star."

1207
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,924
What about you, Fabri?

1208
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,759
Since when I was four,

1209
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,129
I grew up at a seafood restaurant.

1210
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,397
-Really?
-Yes.

1211
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,666
-He must be familiar with it.
-Yes.

1212
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:54,972
-My family ran a seafood restaurant.
-Yes, in Italy.

1213
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,475
He became a Michelin one-star chef
by using seafood.

1214
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,411
-Fabri will win, then.
-Let's just say he won.

1215
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,816
I'm sure no one here uses
as much seafood as I do.

1216
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,785
-You studied in Osaka.
-I did.

1217
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,721
So it's Osaka versus Italy.

1218
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:11,688
THE EAST VERSUS WEST

1219
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,725
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS: WASABI,
SCORCHED RICE, PICKLED PLUM, LEMON

1220
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,960
THIN-LEGGED OCTOPUS, CUCUMBER, ABALONE,
RED SEA CUCUMBER, PERILLA OIL, BUCKWHEAT

1221
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,263
Chef Ho-young, what's your dish?

1222
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,365
My dish is called…

1223
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,768
<i>Sea cucumber, umber, umber</i>

1224
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,373
FATAL CHARMS

1225
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,009
OH, MY GOODNESS…

1226
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,778
<i>Sea cucumber, umber, umber</i>

1227
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,580
It's called Sea Cucumber Lady.

1228
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,149
-Sea Cucumber Lady.
-Sea Cucumber Lady.

1229
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,752
Isn't the samba dance great?

1230
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,087
-Yes, the samba dance is great.
-She's pleased.

1231
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,690
-He likes to dance.
-He does?

1232
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,092
Yes, it's a cook-off, actually.

1233
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,727
If he likes to dance,

1234
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,996
why didn't you get rid of your belly?

1235
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,898
Gosh, she strikes home.

1236
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,934
A CRUEL REMARK

1237
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,403
-He lost a lot of weight.
-He's trying hard.

1238
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,737
He lost a lot of weight.

1239
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,106
You can keep going.

1240
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,542
-Keep going.
-Keep going.

1241
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,412
I'll use sea cucumbers
as my main ingredient.

1242
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,813
In Japanese cuisine,

1243
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,182
there's a sea cucumber dish
made by boiling it in tea.

1244
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:16,586
I'll also make rice in a pot,
and let you top the sea cucumber on rice.

1245
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,557
I also saw pickled plums,
which helps with your digestion.

1246
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,593
I'll turn it into dressing

1247
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,730
and mix the dressing
with thin-legged octopus and abalone.

1248
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,598
Those sound delicious.

1249
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,601
CHEF FABRI'S INGREDIENTS: AVOCADO OIL,
PARSLEY, CAULIFLOWER, RED SEA CUCUMBER

1250
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,870
BEET POWDER, DOENJANG, OMIJA CHEONG,
LEMON, NABAK-KIMCHI, AND MORE

1251
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:38,508
Mine's called Abalone Risotto Ssambap.

1252
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,411
I'M THE DANCING FAIRY TODAY

1253
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,580
-What's going on?
-What is this?

1254
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,682
WIGGLE WIGGLE

1255
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,617
LOOK AT THIS GUY

1256
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,186
Wait, whoa!

1257
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,854
CHALLENGING

1258
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,456
I WON'T LOSE AGAINST YOU!

1259
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,291
FANCY STEPS

1260
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,495
IT TURNED INTO A SAMBA DANCE-OFF

1261
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,230
Samba!

1262
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,132
They're good.

1263
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,301
-They're good dancers.
-She looks pleased.

1264
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,736
He's a good dancer.

1265
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,172
-I'm the new generation.
-I see.

1266
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,074
The new generation of the dancing chef.

1267
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,510
-Abalone Risotto Ssambap?
-Yes.

1268
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:17,581
-Ssambap with risotto?
-I'll make abalone risotto in the style

1269
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,149
of ssambap.

1270
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,684
-I love risotto.
-Can you do it in 15 minutes?

1271
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,587
-She called it very good.
-She said it was very good.

1272
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,490
-Risotto is pretty good.
-That's not all.

1273
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,558
I'll make ceviche

1274
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,528
-with sea cucumbers.
-Ceviche.

1275
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,499
I'll squeeze lots of lemon juice into it

1276
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,000
and make it extra sour.

1277
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,602
He wants to win her favor.

1278
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,338
Lastly, the octopus.

1279
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,740
I'll parboil the octopus

1280
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:47,044
-and top it with cauliflower purée.
-Cauliflower.

1281
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,714
I want to make three dishes
with each type of seafood.

1282
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,483
Samba versus ssambap.

1283
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,686
I wonder who'll win this round.

1284
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,622
From salsa to samba,

1285
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:03,593
Jung Ho-young is here to show
the majesty of the original dancing fairy.

1286
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,431
But this man will show samba dance
on another level with his long limbs.

1287
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,099
The tall dancing fairy,

1288
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,601
Chef Fabri is up against him.

1289
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,937
It's the samba death match
here on <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

1290
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,106
Who'll rise above as the winner?

1291
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,408
-The seafood dishes.
-What are these?

1292
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:22,179
Let the round begin!

1293
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,414
Begin!

1294
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,817
THE SAMBA DEATH MATCH STARTS

1295
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,553
-He's moving quickly.
-He's making rice.

1296
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,957
It's very tough to make
both rice or risotto in 15 minutes.

1297
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,092
It is.

1298
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,493
Both rice and risotto.

1299
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,761
They're busy.

1300
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,997
He's using cauliflower.

1301
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,166
Shouldn't he get started
on the risotto soon?

1302
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,335
Cauliflower is an ingredient
Gyeong-jun used

1303
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,039
and received an evaluation that said,
"You've tried your best."

1304
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:49,940
He should handle it well.

1305
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:52,075
They're killing you many more times.

1306
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,110
Please stop.

1307
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,580
He didn't get a lot of points
for using cauliflower.

1308
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,582
SCORCHED RICE

1309
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,318
-I think he's using scorched rice too.
-I guess so.

1310
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,187
Ho-young is using all four stovetops.

1311
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,124
ABALONE GOES INTO THE THIRD POT,
BOILING WITH COOKING WINE

1312
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,558
Is that buckwheat tea?

1313
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,827
-It is.
-I love buckwheat.

1314
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,195
She likes buckwheat.

1315
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,164
FABRI IS STILL WORKING ON THE CAULIFLOWER

1316
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,699
IN A HASTE

1317
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,467
Wrap. Where's the plastic wrap?

1318
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:18,368
-What?
-Wrap.

1319
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,170
-Plastic wrap.
-Under the counter.

1320
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,638
-Down there.
-Under the counter.

1321
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,273
Do you need plastic wrap?

1322
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,142
He'll cook it by microwaving it

1323
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,245
-Instead of boiling it?
-No.

1324
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,946
WORKING ON THE CAULIFLOWER
FOR OVER 1 MINUTE

1325
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,582
IT FINALLY GOES IN!

1326
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,686
RED SEA CUCUMBER IS UP

1327
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,923
-Red sea cucumber.
-He got the red sea cucumber.

1328
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,993
-It looks really fresh.
-It's huge.

1329
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,828
-Look at the intestines.
-You'll see yellow stuff.

1330
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,697
-What's the yellow stuff?
-The innards.

1331
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,765
The innards?

1332
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,501
-The innards are delicious.
-It's really good.

1333
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,602
That's the real deal.

1334
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,238
There are three delicacies in Japan.

1335
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,506
Sea cucumber innards.

1336
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,941
Gray mullet roe.

1337
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,342
Lastly…

1338
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,111
Anyway, it's one of the three.

1339
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,913
FEELING SELF-CONSCIOUS

1340
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,714
I really love sea cucumber innards.

1341
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,249
WIDE-EYES

1342
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,251
Ho-young must know what to do.

1343
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,553
-He's a Japanese chef.
-So,

1344
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,989
I just mix it with freshly cooked rice.

1345
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,958
It tastes good raw anyway.

1346
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,426
-It's good raw.
-She must love it.

1347
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,895
-It's good raw.
-It's called the ginseng of the sea.

1348
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,931
SURPRISED

1349
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,667
He's using red sea cucumber too.

1350
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,504
Do you eat sea cucumbers in Italy?

1351
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,339
We don't eat anything like this.

1352
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,473
-Not at all?
-No.

1353
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,475
-They don't eat sea cucumbers.
-Not in Italy.

1354
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,878
-No sea cucumbers.
-Maybe abalones.

1355
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,247
It looks like Ho-young is
much better with the sea cucumber.

1356
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,682
You don't even have to explain.

1357
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,551
The Japanese chef has
a different skill set.

1358
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,019
HE GETS HALF OF IT READY TO PARBOIL

1359
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:47,057
THE OTHER HALF IS SERVED RAW

1360
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,328
-He's using a spoon.
-He's scraping the innards out.

1361
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,730
He uses a different skill
to remove the innards.

1362
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,132
FABRI SECURES THE INNARDS TOO!

1363
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,568
-He gets the octopus.
-The octopuses.

1364
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,903
Fabri uses octopuses.

1365
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,304
-The octopuses.
-He'll parboil those.

1366
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,807
He puts the sea cucumber
into the boiling water too.

1367
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,743
-Yes.
-He's cooking the sea cucumber.

1368
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,812
If you cook it, it'll become tiny.

1369
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,680
-It's very tough too.
-It's very tough.

1370
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,148
-It gets tough.
-Really? It becomes tough?

1371
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,150
Yong-yeo looks very concerned.

1372
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,486
-I only had it raw.
-Right?

1373
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,089
But he's cooking it too.

1374
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,757
-He parboiled it too.
-He did.

1375
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,560
-Only briefly, though.
-He parboiled it quickly.

1376
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,128
He says that's a cooking method.

1377
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,831
-He's cooling it off with ice again.
-All right.

1378
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,966
-That'll make it firmer.
-Yes.

1379
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,002
-He's putting it in and pulling it out.
-In and out.

1380
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,171
-He goes back and forth.
-Hot water, iced water.

1381
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,172
It's like a sauna.

1382
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,741
GOSH, THAT FEELS GREAT

1383
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,076
Fabri finishes parboiling the octopuses.

1384
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,212
He cools them in ice.

1385
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,247
HE'S DONE PARBOILING
THE WHOLE SEA CUCUMBER

1386
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,549
I've never seen
cooked sea cucumber before.

1387
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,951
Abalone.

1388
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:48,985
He cooked the red sea cucumber.

1389
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,254
He's throwing in thin-legged octopuses.

1390
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,291
-Chef Ho-young cooks the octopuses too.
-The octopuses.

1391
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:58,094
You're supposed to parboil it.
You can't have that raw.

1392
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:58,995
Yes, that's right.

1393
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,898
-He's parboiling it lightly.
-Very lightly.

1394
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,135
All the ingredients, thin-legged octopus,
red sea cucumber, and abalone,

1395
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,538
-give good energy to people.
-They all give great energy.

1396
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,875
AND SOME CUCUMBER TO SERVE ON THE SIDE!

1397
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,578
Look at the way he chops.

1398
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,448
-Chef Ho-young is working on a cucumber.
-He's making cuts.

1399
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,351
-It'll stretch out like a spring.
-He'll probably salt that.

1400
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,788
He's making just cuts and not chopping it.

1401
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,757
-He'll make it like an accordion.
-It'll stretch out like a spring.

1402
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,594
-It helps it get seasoned better.
-It's easier to season it.

1403
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,663
-Between cuts.
-Yes.

1404
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,098
Here comes his skills.

1405
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,033
WAVY!

1406
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,435
FROZEN!

1407
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,036
The samba dance.

1408
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,171
The samba dancing cucumber.

1409
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,739
He's salting it.

1410
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,041
-It'll make it softer.
-Yes.

1411
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,910
He's using a cucumber too.

1412
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,511
-Cucumber.
-Cucumber.

1413
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,414
Fabri has a different way
of chopping the cucumber.

1414
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,683
He's chopping it differently
from Chef Ho-young.

1415
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,784
Ten minutes.

1416
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,687
-Ten minutes? Already?
-Ten minutes. You're in trouble.

1417
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,823
PARSLEY, LETTUCE

1418
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,559
FABRI IS DONE PREPARING THE INGREDIENTS

1419
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,761
Abalone.

1420
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,965
THE ABALONE IS READY TOO

1421
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,434
-These are the innards.
-The innards.

1422
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,704
He's mixing nabak-kimchi,
sea cucumber innards,

1423
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,805
and lemon juice.

1424
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,174
One second.

1425
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,744
He's blending the innards with that?

1426
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,345
He put the innards in?

1427
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:26,249
He's using it as a part
of the ceviche dressing.

1428
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,752
It's because she said
she liked the innards.

1429
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,020
He's using pickled plums.

1430
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,424
Pickled plums?
It looks like he'll grind those.

1431
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,426
That's plum purée called bainiku.

1432
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:40,163
It's a sauce that's mixed
with mollusks like squid.

1433
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,365
It helps with digestion too.

1434
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,633
It does,

1435
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,169
-and it removes toxins from your body.
-I see.

1436
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,038
-You have to eat that with fish.
-I see.

1437
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:53,710
3. MAKE SAUCE
BY BLENDING SCORCHED RICE WATER,

1438
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:57,680
PICKLED PLUMS, AND BOILED COOKING WINE

1439
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,883
Did the heat go off for your rice?

1440
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,684
What? Why is it off?

1441
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,119
SUSPICIOUS

1442
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,622
-That was bad.
-Was it Fabri?

1443
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,590
-No!
-I don't think so.

1444
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,126
WILL THE RICE BE OKAY?

1445
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,762
-Omija cheong.
-Omija cheong.

1446
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,063
FABRI'S 3 SAUCES: 2. OMIJA SOY SAUCE

1447
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,033
-Soy sauce.
-He's using soy sauce.

1448
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,869
She said she didn't like it
when soy sauce was mixed with other stuff.

1449
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,338
Oh, no. I'm sorry, ma'am.

1450
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,007
It's because I'm a foreigner.

1451
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,742
I couldn't understand perfectly.

1452
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,877
-It's all right.
-She says it's fine.

1453
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,245
You're suddenly feigning ignorance?

1454
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,347
-He says that when he's cornered.
-Only when he's cornered.

1455
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,715
He calls himself a foreigner
when he's cornered.

1456
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,417
I was making an excuse. I'm sorry.

1457
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,556
Chef Fabri mixed
red pepper powder in the soy sauce.

1458
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,357
-No.
-It's not that powder.

1459
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,593
-It's beet powder.
-Beet powder?

1460
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,095
It's beet powder? Not red pepper powder?

1461
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,831
WHY DID I…

1462
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,933
She had beet powder?

1463
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,368
-You had to grind it.
-What?

1464
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,337
You could've used it before.

1465
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,339
Did I try too hard?

1466
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,608
He said I tried too hard.

1467
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,677
No, I didn't say that.

1468
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,347
We thought it was red pepper powder,
but it was beet powder?

1469
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,382
-So it won't be spicy.
-No.

1470
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,852
Yong-yeo doesn't like anything
that tastes too strong.

1471
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,654
HO-YOUNG MAKES HIS STATEMENT WITH GARLIC

1472
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,657
Garlic is often used in Japanese cuisine.

1473
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,759
-Yes, it's good.
-Yes.

1474
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,628
Is that soy sauce and garlic?

1475
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:19,629
Yes, it's soy sauce.

1476
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,131
The parboiled sea cucumber.

1477
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,833
-That looks good.
-Doenjang.

1478
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,735
It looks good.

1479
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:28,872
SLURP

1480
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,476
PARBOILED SEA CUCUMBER IS FINISHED

1481
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,112
-Seven minutes.
-Seven minutes?

1482
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,380
Oh, no.

1483
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,115
He has to make rice.

1484
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,984
He hasn't started on the risotto.

1485
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,252
When are you going to do that?

1486
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,354
-He has less than seven minutes.
-The risotto.

1487
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,556
It's not coming out.

1488
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,358
-What's not coming out?
-The innards.

1489
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,460
He has less than half the time.

1490
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,895
You have 6 minutes and 35 seconds.

1491
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,531
Fabri is still preparing ingredients.

1492
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,366
You have 6 minutes and 30 seconds.

1493
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,034
He's chopping the cooked abalone.

1494
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,069
He's mincing abalone innards.

1495
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,438
Ho-young seems to be much faster.

1496
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,477
-Huh? Why isn't this working?
-Emergency.

1497
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,047
-This is a mess.
-It's a mess.

1498
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,550
Where's the perilla oil?

1499
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,219
-Perilla oil?
-It's never there to begin with.

1500
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,487
Over there.

1501
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,422
Perilla oil!

1502
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:21,658
What?

1503
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,560
-What was that?
-Perilla oil?

1504
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,295
Take it back after using it!

1505
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,063
He has no time to do that.

1506
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,631
He's using scorched rice.

1507
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,568
-Scorched rice.
-He began cooking with scorched rice.

1508
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,803
Scorched rice?

1509
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,607
This can become quite a controversy.

1510
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,710
An Italian chef is
using scorched rice to make risotto?

1511
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,512
I guess he'll make risotto with that.

1512
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,249
But he still only has five minutes.
Can he really do it?

1513
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,319
Is Chef Fabri using lemon cheong?

1514
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,486
-Lemon cheong.
-Lemon cheong.

1515
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,188
DOENJANG, LEMON CHEONG

1516
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,123
OLIVE OIL

1517
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,959
-He's seasoning the abalone.
-Yes.

1518
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,194
5. SLICE THE COOKED ABALONE
AND MIX WITH LEMON CHEONG AND DOENJANG

1519
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,896
He's working on
the red sea cucumber innards.

1520
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,531
Yes, the red sea cucumber innards.

1521
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,433
This is something Yong-yeo loves.

1522
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,735
Handle it carefully, Chef Ho-young.

1523
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:10,206
BECOME SOFTER!

1524
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,276
What will he do
with the red sea cucumber innards?

1525
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:14,777
Is that the dipping sauce?

1526
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,746
Maybe he'll put lemon in it.

1527
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,548
-Wasabi.
-Wasabi.

1528
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,683
-Wasabi and the innards?
-With red sea cucumber innards.

1529
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,952
Adding a dash of wasabi makes it the best.

1530
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,354
She said it'd be best.

1531
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,254
Five minutes.

1532
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,623
You can put in a little more.

1533
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,458
-Jung-hwan, please go out.
-I did.

1534
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,759
All right.

1535
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,195
Osaka versus Italy.

1536
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,631
Ho-young uses abalone too.

1537
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:38,001
He's doing everything neatly
because he's a Japanese chef.

1538
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:42,171
-Thin-legged octopus, abalone…
-Thin-legged octopuses are out.

1539
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:43,573
Scorched rice.

1540
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,544
WHAT WILL SCORCHED RICE RISOTTO LOOK LIKE?

1541
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:49,746
ADDING WATER

1542
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,582
-Will that become risotto?
-Yes, you're right.

1543
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,586
He added abalone innards
into the scorched rice.

1544
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,254
-I see.
-It'll taste great.

1545
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,057
-It's like abalone porridge.
-Like porridge.

1546
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,959
PICKLED PLUM SAUCE

1547
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,962
He's straining the plum sauce.

1548
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,230
What did you blend here? Pickled plums?

1549
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:09,799
-I made sauce by blending pickled plums.
-Blending pickled plums?

1550
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,603
-The pickled plums…
-Ma'am.

1551
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,740
-Ma'am, look at him.
-Hey, you got a thumbs-up.

1552
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,075
-He puts in lemon.
-A thumbs-up.

1553
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,610
-Remove the seeds.
-The seeds.

1554
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,912
It's okay. I eat the seed too.

1555
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:23,980
She likes the seeds too.

1556
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,948
-Did you remove the seeds?
-I did.

1557
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,784
-You put in too much.
-The lemon juice.

1558
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,318
It looks so good.

1559
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,155
-It smells sour.
-Does it?

1560
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:35,491
So? Is it so delicious
that it'll make you do the samba dance?

1561
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,694
Is it so delicious
that it'll make you do the samba dance?

1562
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,796
It's too sour!

1563
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,265
IN SHOCK

1564
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,901
But I think she'll like it.

1565
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,537
-She likes sour food.
-Yes.

1566
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:48,805
It's too sour.

1567
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,507
LIGHTLY SWAYING

1568
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:55,078
Fabri, what are you doing?

1569
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,381
-He's slicing the red sea cucumber.
-The red sea cucumber.

1570
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,084
The ceviche. Where's your sauce?

1571
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:05,221
I mixed nabak-kimchi, innards, and lemon.

1572
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,757
-I see. Lemon.
-He used sea cucumber innards.

1573
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:08,891
I'm curious.

1574
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,594
I've never seen sauce made
with blended sea cucumber innards.

1575
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,730
-That's a first.
-Right?

1576
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,332
Jung-hwan, is there any sauce left?

1577
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,034
-There's lots of it.
-The pink sauce.

1578
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,435
The pink sauce.

1579
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,171
-The color is the same as her clothes.
-It is.

1580
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,207
-That pink sauce.
-The pink sauce.

1581
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:29,378
Does this one make you do
the samba dance too?

1582
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,080
FROWNING

1583
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,149
What's wrong? Is it weird?

1584
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,551
It's not for me.

1585
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,353
It's not for you?

1586
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,255
She might like it, though.

1587
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,991
Chef Hyun-suk won his round
with his pink sauce.

1588
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,226
The pink one.

1589
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,961
It's the kimchi and innards sauce.

1590
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,296
1ST FLOOR, SCORCHED RICE RISOTTO,
2ND FLOOR, SEASONED ABALONE

1591
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,198
3RD FLOOR, LETTUCE,

01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,601

1595
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:58,641
CHECKING FOR SALTINESS

1596
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,478
CHOPPED CUCUMBERS ARE READY TO GO TOO

1597
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,615
7. MIX OCTOPUS, CUCUMBER, AND ABALONE
IN PICKLED PLUM SAUCE

1598
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,416
-It looks really good.
-It does.

1599
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,720
He's mixing octopus with the plum sauce.

1600
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,356
-It looks good.
-This one looks good.

1601
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,592
-It's still too hot.
-The cauliflower.

1602
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,028
-It's too hot.
-It's too hot for Fabri

1603
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,463
CAULIFLOWER

1604
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,397
AVOCADO OIL

1605
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,168

1606
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,602
CHECKING FOR TIME

1607
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,606
SERVING THE SEASONED OCTOPUS AND ABALONE

1608
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,575
-You have 50 seconds.
-You got 50 seconds left.

1609
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,210
Fifty. Fifty seconds left.

1610
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,345
-Fifty seconds.
-Start serving!

1611
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,547
Oh, no.

1612
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,216
-Hurry up. Fabri is in trouble.
-Fabri, add more lemon juice.

1613
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,417
Add more lemon juice.

1614
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,086
-Chef Ho-young is done.
-Add more lemon juice.

1615
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,622
FABRI FINISHES HIS RISOTTO SSAMBAP TOO

1616
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,024
Perilla oil.

1617
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,826
-Perilla oil.
-Are you telling me to do it?

1618
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,795
-Where is it?
-Ho-young is all done.

1619
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,897
-Thirty seconds!
-Thirty seconds!

1620
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,500
You got the perilla oil. Thirty seconds!

1621
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,068
Hurry up.

1622
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,436
Fabri, please hurry up.

1623
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,538
WITH A THIN-LEGGED OCTOPUS IN HIS HAND…

1624
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,774
-Twenty seconds.
-Twenty seconds.

1625
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:08,344
-Fabri is out of it.
-Hurry up.

1626
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,413
-Oh, no.
-Hurry up. What's wrong?

1627
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,648
Ten seconds left.

1628
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:14,617
I can't watch!

1629
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,320
I FOUND IT!

1630
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,322
-Nine. Eight.
-Nine. Eight.

1631
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,490
-Seven. Six.
-Perilla oil.

1632
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,726
Fabri, keep it up!

1633
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:24,727
Fabri, keep it up!

1634
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,930
-Fabri, keep it up!
-Perilla oil.

1635
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,098
-Fabri, keep it up!
-Two!

1636
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,270
-Fabri, keep it up!
-Two! One!

1637
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,539
Time's up!

1638
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,674
FABRI FINISHES ABALONE RISOTTO SSAMBAP

1639
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:39,876
He's done.

1640
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:42,211
EXHAUSTED

1641
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,447
-Fabri had a dramatic finish.
-Place it on.

1642
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,982
HE FINISHES EVERYTHING DRAMATICALLY

1643
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,750
That was such a crazy sight.

1644
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,854
-It looks like stir-fried octopus.
-There's a lot of food.

1645
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,522
How did he make all these?

1646
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,458
-How did he do this in 15 minutes?
-Right?

1647
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:56,592
-But…
-This is insane.

1648
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,995
Gosh, these are amazing.

1649
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,164
Chef Ho-young finished first.

1650
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,466
There's something I want to say.

1651
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:07,036
-What is it?
-If Fabri agrees,

1652
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,071
can she try mine later?

1653
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,240
I want to let the rice sit for a while.

1654
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,277
-You want to let the rice sit?
-I see.

1655
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,946
-Is that okay, Fabri?
-Of course. I'll let him go last.

1656
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:20,283
All right. Then you can try
Chef Fabri's dishes first.

1657
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,388
ABALONE RISOTTO SSAMBAP
MADE WITH SCORCHED RICE

1658
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,724
SERVED WITH THIN-LEGGED OCTOPUS
AND CAULIFLOWER PURÉE

1659
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,629
CHEF FABRI'S ABALONE RISOTTO SSAMBAP

1660
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,933
Wait, he parboiled the sea cucumber right?

1661
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,367
Yes, he did.

1662
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,304
Yet how does it remain so soft?

1663
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,539
It looks soft,
even though it was parboiled.

1664
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:47,410
This is a famous dish
from Central and South America.

1665
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:48,811
Please try a bite.

1666
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,713
YUM

1667
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,815
It was a bit strange to me.
I've never had anything like it.

1668
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,417
What do you think?

1669
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,818
I think…

1670
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,854
it would've been better with more lemon.

1671
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,257
HE DIDN'T USE ENOUGH LEMONS

1672
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,626
I told you to make lemon soup!

1673
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,728
You should've poured more lemon juice!

1674
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,229
-Come on, Fabri.
-Gosh.

1675
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,365
I told you time and time again!

1676
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,400
TELL ME ABOUT IT…

1677
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,770
-Young-kyu, say something to him.
-Come on!

1678
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,306
How many times
must my mother-in-law tell you?

1679
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,908
-Listen to her!
-Try it.

1680
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,176
This is so frustrating.

1681
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,912
You try it, Young-kyu.
See if she needs more lemons.

1682
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,414
How many times do I have to tell you
to use more lemons?

1683
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,849
I don't want this anymore!

1684
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,718
HE'S BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL CHARACTER

1685
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,686
Bring me that. Hey.

1686
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,356
Bring me some wasabi and lemon.

1687
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,191
-She wants those.
-Wasabi and lemon.

1688
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,594
-Bring her some wasabi and lemon.
-Let me have it. Come on.

1689
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,797
Right here. I brought minced garlic too.

1690
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,299
-Here's how I do it.
-Yes?

1691
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,834
Let me show you.

1692
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,803
-This is insane.
-She's adding more lemon.

1693
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,972
-Right in here.
-Okay.

1694
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,209
-A little bit of wasabi.
-A little. And minced garlic.

1695
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,111
-I don't even need to put in much.
-No.

1696
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,813
That looks good.

1697
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,715
Try it now, Young-kyu.

1698
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,617
-Yes, try it now.
-Let me try it.

1699
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,253
Let me try it, Mother.

1700
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,588
-Mmm.
-It looks good.

1701
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,290
Was that better, Yong-yeo?

1702
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,729
-Isn't it good?
-Yes! Whoa.

1703
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,565
It's exploding in my mouth.
It tastes so good.

1704
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,467
-It's not a joke.
-I'm serious.

1705
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,302
You have to try this sauce.

1706
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,771
My gosh.

1707
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:24,206
-It's good.
-You like it very sour.

1708
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,708
She put half a lemon inside.

1709
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,743
Come and try it.

1710
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,311
-That was strong.
-Try this.

1711
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:33,049
-You have to try it.
-It wakes you up right away.

1712
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,084
JOON TRIES A BITE TOO

1713
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,920
-Gosh, that was strong.
-Wasn't it?

1714
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,557
Yong-yeo added some more condiments
to fit her appetite.

1715
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,225
Then it wasn't South America anymore.

1716
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:47,196
It tasted like
a cold Chinese cuisine dish.

1717
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:49,231
-With the garlic…
-I love cold salad.

1718
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:52,034
-The flavor changed.
-I see.

1719
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,269
But I get what you like now.

1720
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:57,239
That's that, but you still have
two more main dishes.

1721
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,241
This one looks really good.

1722
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,544
-Does it look good?
-It does.

1723
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,548
If you try every ingredient together,

1724
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,651
-it'll feel like ssambap.
-I see.

1725
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,220
-Abalone ssambap.
-Eat it with the greens.

1726
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,290
Why didn't you add coriander?

1727
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:17,626
-Coriander!
-How many times do I have to tell you?

1728
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,362
She kept saying
she loved coriander for a while.

1729
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,499
But it's good. This one is good.

1730
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,000
Is it good?

1731
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,735
-Great job with this one.
-This one must've been fine.

1732
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,070
ANOTHER BITE

1733
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,271
-Is it good?
-Yes.

1734
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,707
AGAIN, SHE GIVES IT
TO HER SON-IN-LAW FIRST

1735
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,044
-You care so much about your son-in-law.
-Mothers-in-law do that.

1736
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,512
She takes good care of him.

1737
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:37,646
HER LOVE FOR THE SON-IN-LAW

1738
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,616
-Is it good, Young-kyu?
-Isn't it good? You try it.

1739
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,051
-Try it.
-Is it good, Young-kyu?

1740
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,753
JOON TAKES A BITE

1741
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,390
SUNG-JU HAS A BITE TOO

1742
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,759
WHOA, IS IT OKAY?

1743
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,161
-Isn't it delicious?
-Yes, it's good.

1744
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,062
This is good.

1745
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,097
-I don't really like scorched rice.
-I see.

1746
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:56,699
-You don't?
-But this is really good.

1747
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,834
-It's…
-Scorched rice is so good!

1748
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,437
-I'll try to like it from now on.
-Yes.

1749
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,773
-Anyway, the balance here is great.
-Isn't it excellent?

1750
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,143
It doesn't feel like Korean food.

1751
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,511
Which country is this from?

1752
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,814
-It's just made by Fabri.
-Yes.

1753
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:15,885
-It's like a dish overseas.
-It'll feel like couscous from Italy.

1754
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,287
-But couscous doesn't have…
-He made scorched rice instead.

1755
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,788
I can still feel the texture.

1756
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,725
-What's the last dish made of?
-Octopuses.

1757
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:27,096
<i>I mixed beet powder,</i>
<i>soy sauce, and omija cheong</i>

1758
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,666
<i>and laid the octopuses out</i>
<i>on top of cauliflower sauce,</i>

1759
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,702
<i>something you love very much.</i>

1760
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,605
-This is really good.
-Is it?

1761
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,775
-She must like this cauliflower flavor.
-It's good.

1762
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,077
He saved the cauliflower.

1763
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:43,212
Next, the octopus.

1764
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,015
-He didn't do anything more.
-Wait.

1765
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,984
How did you cook these octopuses?
Why is it so tough?

1766
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,719
A HARSH REMARK COMES RIGHT AFTER

1767
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,455
-Is it too tough?
-Right?

1768
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,990
The octopus.

1769
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,992
SHE GIVES IT A TRY

1770
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,694
What's it like? Yes?

1771
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,129
-It's not tough.
-Is it tough? No.

1772
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,431
-It's good.
-It's not tough.

1773
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,533
-It's not tough.
-It's not tough.

1774
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,702
-It's good. Excellent job.
-It's good.

1775
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,671
-It was delicious.
-Great job.

1776
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,940
-It's not bad.
-It's good.

1777
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,808
-Right?
-It's not tough.

1778
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,946
The cauliflower purée
goes so well with the octopus.

1779
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,515
It's very tender.

1780
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,717
-Yes.
-It's tender and delicious, right?

1781
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,420
It's not tough at all. It's like gum.

1782
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,189
-Like gum?
-That means it's tough.

1783
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,625
-Gum is tough.
-You can't chew it down.

1784
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,527
-Soft gum.
-Do you mean the flavor?

1785
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,697
-It's like chewing gum.
-Right.

1786
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,499
-I loved the texture and smell.
-Isn't it good?

1787
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,434
Yes, it was good.

1788
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,770
Next, please try Chef Ho-young's dish.

1789
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,405
USING LOTS OF RED SEA CUCUMBER,
ABALONE, AND THIN-LEGGED OCTOPUSES!

1790
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,108
ONLY MADE TO SATISFY YONG-YEO'S APPETITE

1791
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,210
+RED SEA CUCUMBER INNARDS

1792
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:53,249
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S SEA CUCUMBER LADY

1793
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,518
Should I serve the rice for her?

1794
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,520
Hey!

1795
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,289
He brought a lemon.

1796
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,058
Everything I love is here.

1797
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,027
What was that one thing you brought?

1798
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,263
-Chef Ho-young?
-I heard the evaluation

1799
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:10,266
and ended up bringing
half a lemon out here.

1800
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,167
Please try it without the lemon first.

1801
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,836
You can try it and be the judge.

1802
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,037
The rice looks great.

1803
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,573
-Does it?
-Put the sea cucumber on top and eat it.

1804
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,275
This is nice.

1805
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,044
Gosh, these look so appetizing.

1806
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,146
-Here's what I do.
-This is it.

1807
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,883
DROPPING LOTS OF SEA CUCUMBER PIECES

1808
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,019
I'm not sure if this is the right way.

1809
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,920
-And this.
-Will you pour that in too?

1810
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,289
It goes in here.

1811
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,391
POURING

1812
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,060
IT LOOKS AMAZING

1813
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,695
-That's it.
-It looks good.

1814
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,797
-Have you never tried it?
-You can have it first.

1815
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:44,833
-We'll eat it later. Please evaluate.
-We'll try it later.

1816
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,304
A POSITIVE SIGN

1817
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,306
It's over.

1818
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,573
SWOOP

1819
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,542
-It's over.
-It's over.

1820
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,044
-It's over.
-She won't have to eat anything else.

1821
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,112
-It's over.
-It's over.

1822
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,081
The smell of the innards

1823
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,151
comes strongly into your nose.

1824
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,287
It feels like I'm in paradise.

1825
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,457
-Like she's in paradise?
-Even paradise?

1826
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,460
-May I try it?
-This was something

1827
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,996
-my husband use to make me.
-I see.

1828
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,265
He made this
whenever we went to a Japanese restaurant.

1829
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,634
I've only dipped it
with white fish before.

1830
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,936
-Isn't it delicious?
-Hey, Young-kyu.

1831
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,872
You don't need to season it anymore.

1832
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,008
The texture is crazy.

1833
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,110
<i>I didn't boil it for a long time.</i>

1834
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,714
<i>If I switch between cold and hot water,</i>
<i>it'll help sea cucumber get cooked softly.</i>

1835
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,248
<i>I parboiled it in buckwheat tea.</i>

1836
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,918
<i>I see why he went back and forth</i>
<i>between cold and hot water with this.</i>

1837
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,620
-Right?
-I've never had anything like it.

1838
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,222
-Sea cucumbers are…
-Whoa!

1839
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,957
-My gosh.
-You surprised us.

1840
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,960
-Sea cucumbers are…
-Whoa!

1841
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,329
-My gosh.
-You surprised us.

1842
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:50,232
-See? I told you!
-That was shocking.

1843
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,367
-I told you.
-This is…

1844
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,969
-It happens to you.
-The sea cucumber shocked him.

1845
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,038
-Whoa.
-It doesn't taste firm.

1846
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,373
Do you like it?

1847
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,275
I've never had anything like this.
It tastes like paradise.

1848
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,044
Yes, this isn't served at a cafeteria.

1849
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,381
-They can't use sea cucumbers.
-This isn't served at a cafeteria.

1850
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:08,584
I've never had that kind of texture
in a sea cucumber.

1851
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,786
-This is interesting.
-It's the texture.

1852
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,354
That was a surprise.

1853
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,524
-Try the next one.
-The octopus dish looks so good.

1854
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,260
Even sick cows would stand back up

1855
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,129
when you feed it raw octopus.

1856
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,597
-Yes.
-It gets up.

1857
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,932
I seriously think she's Se-dol's mom.

1858
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,734
When cows are exhausted,

1859
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:29,538
they'd be recharged
after eating some raw octopus.

1860
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,306
Even sick cows would stand back up
when you feed it raw octopus.

1861
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,108
I seriously think she's Se-dol's mom.

1862
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,710
-The cow getting up again.
-Why?

1863
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,012
WILL IT MAKE YONG-YEO GET UP TOO?

1864
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,614
I seriously think she's Se-dol's mom.

1865
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,616
-The cow getting up again.
-Why?

1866
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:42,050
-It's good.
-Is it?

1867
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:43,585
Do you need more lemon?

1868
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,888
-No.
-No?

1869
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,389
Great job.

1870
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:48,290
This is the best.

1871
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,826
-This is the best.
-This is the best.

1872
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:53,395
-This is the best.
-This is bad.

1873
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:54,830
It must be seasoned.

1874
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:56,532
It's really good.

1875
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,000
-Is it really?
-Yes.

1876
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,535
SHE TAKES ANOTHER BIG BITE

1877
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,770
-Try it.
-Yes, ma'am.

1878
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,739
You care too much about Young-kyu.

1879
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,775
Gosh, my mother-in-law is
giving me too much food.

1880
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,811
Come on, Young-kyu.

1881
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,546
-Good for you.
-Yes, man.

1882
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,181
A HUGE BITE

1883
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,517
-Stop eating so much.
-That's enough. Give it to him.

1884
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,820
-Stop eating so much.
-That's enough. Give it to him.

1885
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,388
Give some to Joon too.

1886
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,457
Tell us what it's like.

1887
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:24,026
The savory taste of octopuses is

1888
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,862
-brought out with the sour lemon flavor.
-Also,

1889
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,430
-it's not tough.
-No, it's not.

1890
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,199
He cooked it perfectly.

1891
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,667
This really is the best.

1892
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,203
And not only is the texture is great,

1893
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,605
but it gets even better as you chew.

1894
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,574
And there's abalone too.

1895
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,976
-Isn't it really good?
-It's really good.

1896
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,511
-Whoa.
-Look at Hyun-suk.

1897
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:43,912
What do you think, Joon?

1898
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,149
It tastes so clean and pure.

1899
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,585
-It's just complete.
-A complete taste.

1900
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,153
Like a desk.

1901
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,956
I can see the ins and outs perfectly.

1902
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,091
-He salted the cucumber a little.
-Yes, the cucumber.

1903
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,461
<i>-That was a great touch.</i>
<i>-That balances everything out</i>

1904
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:02,097
in texture, softness, crunchiness,

1905
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,932
and savoriness of the dish.

1906
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,667
He just said everything I wanted to.

1907
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:07,936
GREAT JOB

1908
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:08,837
Excellent job.

1909
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,672
He said everything she wanted to.

1910
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,007
-Do you agree with him?
-Thanks.

1911
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,177
-Yes, I agree so much with him.
-You agree.

1912
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,612
She agrees.

1913
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:19,615
-The cucumber was salted perfectly.
-Yes.

1914
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,783
Try some more octopus.

1915
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,819
-The more you chew it, the more…
-Joon's eating so well.

1916
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,054
Aren't you eating too much?

1917
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,757
-"Aren't you eating too much?"
-See?

1918
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,893
-It's good.
-It's cooked perfectly.

1919
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,029
Only these four are eating these.

1920
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,764
-Wait.
-My chin is about to drop.

1921
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,533
Our dear Nam-no.

1922
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,035
-Nam-no!
-He needs to eat something.

1923
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:41,303
Mother, can we give it to Nam-no?

1924
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,304
Give it to him.

1925
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,306
HAPPY

1926
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,241
FOOD DELIVERY CEREMONY

1927
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,876
My gosh. This is…

1928
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,878
TAKING A BIG BITE TO FORGET HIS WAIT

1929
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,315
THESE TWO TRY A BITE TOO

1930
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,619
EXHILARATING

1931
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,154
What do you think, Nam-no?

1932
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,990
Pickled plums have
piercing sourness and saltiness.

1933
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,727
When it's mixed with cucumber
and coriander,

1934
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,596
-they all work together.
-Right?

1935
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,331
It's excellent
when it's mixed in your mouth.

1936
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,166
-I see.
-I have nothing to say. He said it for me.

1937
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,935
Do you agree with that too?

1938
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,504
-Yes, I agree with everything.
-You do?

1939
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,440
I can't express it like them,
but I agree with what they say.

1940
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:21,543
-I see.
-Now, shall we hear it from him?

1941
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,079
Let's give a star to Chef Ho-young.

1942
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,849
-Let's hear it from them.
-Fabri.

1943
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,053
-Let's hear it from him.
-We don't need to do this.

1944
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,754
I'm sorry, Fabri.

1945
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,791
-She said sorry.
-She apologized.

1946
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,626
You can't just say you're sorry.

1947
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,361
-She said sorry.
-We don't have to do it.

1948
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,330
-There might be a twist.
-Of course.

1949
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:44,099
-Yes, maybe.
-There could be a twist.

1950
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,801
Press one for Jung Ho-young

1951
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,469
and two for Fabri.

1952
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,705
Goodness, sweet mercy.

1953
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,406
Please press the button.

1954
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,541
-Press it?
-Do it.

1955
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,476
Gosh, this is crazy. I can't help it.

1956
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:55,677
You can't help it.

1957
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,747
You've already decided.
Stop saying you can't help it.

1958
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:01,149
-We have a rough idea
-Yes.

1959
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:02,884
which one of them won.

1960
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,454
-But let's check just in case.
-Of course.

1961
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,423
Let's find out the result. Who won?

1962
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,058
Who could it be?

1963
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,093
I wonder who it is.

1964
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:15,097
What's this seafood dish?
Will it be Fabri or Jung Ho-young?

1965
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:17,165
-What is this?
-Who did Yong-yeo choose?

1966
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:18,300
Who won?

1967
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,702
The winner is…

1968
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:23,071
JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1969
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,374
JUNG HO-YOUNG'S SEA CUCUMBER LADY WINS

1970
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,709
THE SAMBA OF VICTORY

1971
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,646
THAT'S OUR DANCING FAIRY

1972
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,748
Ho-young wins!

1973
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,049
DO YOU SEE THIS, FABRI?

1974
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,717
I'M THE DANCING FAIRY OF THIS AREA

1975
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:37,119
I TOTALLY AGREE…

1976
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,854
That's hilarious.

1977
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,921
A 360-DEGREE END RESULT

1978
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,291
Chef Ho-young received
a great compliment with his victory.

1979
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:44,860
It was an overwhelming win.

1980
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,461
Let's hear from him.

1981
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:50,198
I'm so thrilled that Yong-yeo chose me.

1982
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,067
I'm also happy that I won

1983
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,702
in both dancing and cooking.

1984
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,370
FABRI'S 2 LOSSES

1985
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,939
I know how good it feels
to win both in dancing and cooking.

1986
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,410
-Please put a star on Chef Ho-young.
-Oh, my.

1987
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,545
-Yes.
-How many does he have so far?

1988
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:04,846
This is his third star.

1989
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,015
-That's not so bad.
-Jung Ho-young.

1990
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,818
-He wins against Fabri.
-Congratulations.

1991
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,587
-He wins a star.
-Congratulations!

1992
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,524
-Let's give it up for Fabri too.
-Fabri!

1993
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,527
Joon is famous as the frugal idol star.

1994
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:19,795
I've even had just plain rice.

1995
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,396
I'd watch videos of rice harvesting.

1996
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,131
At times, I eat just rice and kimchi,

1997
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,700
so I watch someone making kimchi.

1998
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,368
If you eat it with that video,

1999
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,170
it tastes really good.

2000
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,305
His mother sent a hand-written letter.

2001
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,740
"He'd say, 'I'm leaving now'

2002
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,041
and arrive home in 15 minutes."

2003
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,510
You're making her do
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> every morning.

2004
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,779
-Mom, I'm leaving now!
-Mom!

2005
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,815
-Wait a moment, my son!
-You're fighting against time.

2006
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,683
<i>I'll make something really spicy today.</i>

2007
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,418
<i>Nam-no! Yoon Nam-no!</i>

2008
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,586
They both add lots of love.

2009
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,021
These dishes are for your son.

2010
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,723
Whoa, what was that?

2011
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,624
-Your son is almost here!
-Please!

2012
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:50,559
There's no traffic.

2013
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,594
This is the Chef & My Fridge cafeteria.

2014
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,629
<i>It's about time he rose up here.</i>
<i>I must fight him and win.</i>

2015
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,732
<i>-I'll do well as a former kitchen police.</i>
-He's fast.

2016
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,633
-How does my sweet and sour pork look?
-It looks bad.

2017
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,535
Yours look bad too.

2018
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:01,436
I have no time.

2019
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:02,971
-Can you finish this?
-Why am I so busy?

2020
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,139
You can't do that now!

2021
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,608
This is just crazy.
