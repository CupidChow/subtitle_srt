1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,151
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,921
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,257
A classy cooking talk show has returned.

4
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,260
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,599
-Hello.
-Look at our awesome chefs.

6
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,634
Until last week,

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:39,472
we had an ongoing battle
between returning chefs and new chefs.

8
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,874
Starting today,

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,245
we'll begin individual rounds
until the best chef wins.

10
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,547
Returning chefs could
fight against each other,

11
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,550
as well as two chefs
from <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

12
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:56,423
But I noticed a new chef in the studio.
Let me introduce him right away.

13
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>This man is known</i>

14
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,294
<i>as the man who's crazy about cooking.</i>

15
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,664
<i>I want to prove why I'm called</i>

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,666
<i>a maniac and a lunatic.</i>

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,134
Shouldn't we start the risotto?

18
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,669
Don't we have to cook risotto?

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,806
<i>The Cooking Maniac, the biggest presence</i>
<i>on</i> Culinary Class Wars,

20
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,608
please welcome Chef Yoon Nam-no!

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,977
I was wondering why he wasn't here.

22
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,480
-He should've been here long ago.
-Yes.

23
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,850
Hello, I'm the biggest star
of <i>Culinary Class wars</i>,

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,518
Cooking Maniac, Yoon Nam-no.

25
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,220
Yes, hello.

26
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,354
AN INTENSE FIRST IMPRESSION

27
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,190
He leaves an intense impression.

28
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,891
Chef Maniac said it was his dream

29
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,161
-to be on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.
-Is that so?

30
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> was
a role model for my generation.

31
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,167
-I see.
-I watched it a lot.

32
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,038
I'm getting chills to do this shoot
with such esteemed chefs.

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,606
I'm quite nervous too.

34
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,877
However, I'll think of this
as my playground and have fun today.

35
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,779
Gosh. I see.

36
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,382
I heard you were quite worried
after deciding to be on the show.

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,085
I don't leave
a good first impression on people.

38
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,820
-I see. You look a bit intense.
-Right.

39
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,922
Those who didn't watch <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>

40
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:08,328
-may misunderstand me for a thug.
-Right.

41
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,297
He looks kind of scary on the outside.

42
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:15,101
Even more so because
of those dark circles around his eyes.

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,672
But he's a guy who cooks like
an athlete showing hustle play.

44
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,374
He flips dishcloth and whatnot,

45
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,842
and he makes big gestures.

46
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,645
I wasn't sure who he took after,
but he has big gestures.

47
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,147
Who did he take after?

48
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,083
But even now, he's rather anxious.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,251
On the inside?

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,652
He's like a baby panda.

51
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,220
Yes, a baby panda.

52
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,823
-What we need is a solid character.
-I see.

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,525
That's the most important.

54
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,059
What was your ranking
on <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>?

55
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,461
I was in the top four.

56
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,862
-The top four?
-Yes.

57
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,365
-What about you, Chef Hyun-suk?
-Don't do that.

58
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,533
I was just curious.

59
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,700
BOTH HANDS

60
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,035
I was in the eighth place.

61
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,637
The eighth place.

62
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,972
Here are the current numbers of stars.

63
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,909
Both Chef Yeon-bok
and Chef Hyun-suk have three.

64
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,178
Chef Kang-rok finally won a star.

65
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,947
-Poong still doesn't have one.
-Poong.

66
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,649
He has lost four rounds in a row.

67
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,552
Meanwhile,
Chef Sung-jun won a star too.

68
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,687
-Yes.
-He appeared as Baby Hyun-suk.

69
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,156
He copied Hyun-suk and won that star.

70
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,859
Back in the green room,
he asked the hair stylist

71
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,295
to make his hair look the same as mine.

72
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,230
-They are the same!
-They are.

73
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,898
-I changed my style.
-I can see it.

74
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,402
He's pretty much possessed by Hyun-suk.

75
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:27,907
I heard Chef Nam-no wasn't so happy
with where he was sitting today.

76
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,677
-What? Really?
-I heard that from our writer.

77
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,145
-Why?
-Why is that?

78
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,414
I'm sitting next to Chef Jong-won.

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,449
-Jong-won? Why?
-Why?

80
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:41,054
I don't like good-looking people
who are even good at cooking.

81
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,056
He's right.

82
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,491
We've become the pathetic two
next to Jong-won.

83
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,394
-My gosh.
-Hey, stop that. That's not the case.

84
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,063
I'll admit to such facts.

85
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,333
-We're just good chefs.
-Just good chefs.

86
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,937
-Are you okay with Chef Sung-jun?
-Is sitting next to Sung-jun okay?

87
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,305
I doubt that.

88
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,740
-What?
-Never mind.

89
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,376
You don't mind Sung-jun.

90
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,779
-He recently became too brazen.
-Sung-jun? I see.

91
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,881
It's the Choi Hyun-suk Effect.

92
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,783
He's becoming more like Hyun-suk.

93
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,819
Again, we have

94
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:17,757
another two guests who'll show
the craziest chemistry here today.

95
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,827
The two have reunited
through <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

96
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,097
Please welcome today's fridge owners!

97
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,498
Come on out!

98
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,403
Who are the two fridge owners today?

99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,474
Please welcome actors Ha Ji-won
and Jang Keun-suk!

100
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,542
It's great to have you here.

101
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,411
Please come on out.

102
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,413
You can take your seat.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,815
This actor is someone who performs

104
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:47,553
every kind of genre with perfection.

105
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,989
The queen of rom-coms, action,

106
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,491
period pieces, and on top of that,

107
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,493
the queen of viewer ratings.

108
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,462
The actor who can do just about anything,

109
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,765
please welcome Ha Ji-won!

110
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,832
Hello.

111
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,167
Welcome to the show.

112
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,235
Gosh.

113
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,504
Hello, I'm Ha Ji-won.

114
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,807
-Thank you very much for inviting me.
-Sure.

115
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,143
And this guy is here.

116
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,678
Now that I met him,

117
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,580
he's even more beautiful up close.

118
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,648
Thank you.

119
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,650
This is the 34th year of his career.

120
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,986
-Yes, he started as a child actor.
-I was surprised too.

121
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,054
-Gosh.
-Right?

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,989
The forever prince of Asia,

123
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,758
-please welcome Jang Keun-suk.
-Welcome!

124
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,027
Gosh, Keun-suk is here.

125
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,163
-I was surprised at the 34th year.
-Right?

126
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,100
-It's as if the two were frozen.
-They haven't aged.

127
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,536
I've seen them on TV for a long time,

128
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,838
-but they look the same.
-They're the same.

129
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,473
Only you and I are aging.

130
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,710
Yes, we're the only ones that are aging.

131
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,181
Keun-suk, I heard you were
an avid fan of our show.

132
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,919
I've watched every single episode
since the very first one.

133
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,456
-From season one?
-Yes, it was one of my favorite shows.

134
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,525
-And I do like to cook too.
-Yes, right.

135
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,227
Cooking for someone is

136
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,129
something meaningful you can do

137
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,433
because you're showing consideration
as you prepare a warm meal for them.

138
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,270
But the thing is,
I was mostly on the cooking end.

139
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:16,275
I thought I'd feel the warmth from someone
if I came on the show today.

140
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,579
I literally applied to be on the show
with such expectation.

141
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,280
He was an applicant.

142
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,116
-Right.
-It's not that easy

143
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,551
to ask our guests
to give up their fridges,

144
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,521
-but he asked us to take his.
-He was an applicant.

145
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,457
-I'm so grateful.
-Yes, we really are.

146
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,795
Actually, Ji-won is the applicant
because <i>jiwon</i> means to apply.

147
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,297
HER NAME MEANS "TO APPLY"

148
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,133
You're hilarious!

149
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,068
Her name already means "to apply."

150
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,371
Ji-won, did you also apply
to be on the show?

151
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,075
I always wanted to apply
to be on the show.

152
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,079
Unlike Keun-suk,
I'm the type who likes to eat.

153
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,783
I love to enjoy dishes
that someone cooked for me.

154
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,018
Was there a chef you wanted to meet?

155
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,988
It's exciting for me to meet them,

156
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,625
as if I'm sitting here with celebrities.

157
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,895
I wonder which one of the chefs is
a celebrity to her.

158
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,199
Who seemed the most like a celebrity?

159
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,901
Why are you so nervous, Nam-no?

160
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,335
-Why are you so excited?
-Don't show it.

161
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,538
-Look at that.
-He keeps saying she's so pretty.

162
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,875
I actually loved Chef Nam-no
on <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>

163
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,079
because of his intense masculine gaze.

164
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,650
-I won't be able to sleep tonight.
-You won't be able to sleep?

165
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,318
Look at how happy he is.

166
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,654
-My heart is racing.
-I see.

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,390
I really wanted to meet Chef Kang-rok too.

168
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,825
-Chef Kang-rok?
-Yes.

169
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,794
-I see.
-Really? What was his appeal?

170
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,097
-He's like an onion.
-"An onion"?

171
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,734
-You have to harvest his face.
-He's turning too red.

172
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,971
-Look at her when she's talking to you.
-Let him talk.

173
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,806
-Let Chef Kang-rok talk.
-Okay.

174
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,708
He's so mysterious,

175
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,045
so the more I get to know him,
the more curious I become.

176
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,481
-He has that charm.
-He does.

177
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,616
-And Artist Poong.
-Poong?

178
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,117
Poong?

179
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,386
I wasn't curious of him,

180
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,955
but…

181
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,023
-What were you curious about?
-What else do you want to know?

182
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,095
"What was he thinking
when he joined the show?"

183
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,730
"Why is that man on the show?"

184
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,967
-Everyone on the show says…
-Yes?

185
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,202
-…his dishes are good, right?
-Yes.

186
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,604
But I always see him

187
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,440
lose the battles,

188
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,176
so I wondered why he lost
if the dish was good.

189
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,677
I wanted to know what your food was like.

190
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,580
-That's exactly what our viewers think.
-Yes.

191
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,816
"If it was good, he should get a star."

192
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,951
"But they say it's good
and never give him a star."

193
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,855
-Exactly.
-Ji-won came to find out for herself.

194
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,857
You have to stay alert today.

195
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,793
-All right.
-Yes, you have to get one today.

196
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,863
-You have to get one.
-You've lost four times in a row.

197
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,931
-I should.
-Yes.

198
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,100
-So he has no stars yet?
-No.

199
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,102
-Not even once?
-No.

200
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,138
They said it was good,
but never gave him stars.

201
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,440
At least stop saying it's good!

202
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,409
Then how are you still on the show?

203
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,911
INNOCENT QUESTION

204
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,547
Right. That's what we wonder too.

205
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,650
You just said something
we couldn't say out loud.

206
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,585
PLEASE WIN ONE TODAY

207
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,488
-I'm in a corner right now.
-Yes.

208
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,492
This meeting is very special
for these two.

209
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,994
Thanks to <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,

210
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,630
they were reunited

211
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,200
for the first time in 19 years.

212
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,802
-What's going on?
-In 19 years?

213
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,472
I found out it had been 19 years
through <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

214
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,875
Wasn't Keun-suk quite young back then?

215
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,844
I had just turned 20.

216
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,012
<i>I see.</i>

217
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,883
From what I heard, back then,

218
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,785
you had a kissing scene,

219
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,020
-and that was your first kiss.
-A kissing scene?

220
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,989
I heard that was your actual first kiss.

221
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,157
-Really?
-As I…

222
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,292
The first time in your life?

223
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,094
-That was his first kiss.
-What?

224
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,563
-Yes, it must've been his first.
-He was 20.

225
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,131
-It was.
-Really?

226
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,803
She was the first actor
I kissed on screen.

227
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,771
-It was true.
-I didn't know.

228
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,907
-The first kiss?
-It was his first kiss.

229
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,108
I feel so bad for you.

230
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,379
-His first kiss was with an older girl.
-Are you serious?

231
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,781
I was that nervous.

232
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,150
You must've been nervous as a 20-year-old.

233
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,887
What was the 20-year-old Keun-suk like
as an actor?

234
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:26,258
-He was so young, innocent, and pretty.
-Pretty.

235
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,394
And he danced for me often

236
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,062
while we were on set.

237
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,198
-I see.
-You danced for her?

238
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,399
-Do you remember?
-For Ji-won?

239
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,935
<i>Why did you dance for her?</i>

240
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,004
-You did it pretty often.
-He did?

241
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,139
You must've wanted to impress her.

242
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,742
I'm the type who has a lot of energy.

243
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,379
I'd show her
the newest dances at that time

244
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,515
-and tried to become good friends.
-I see.

245
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,283
Keun-suk said this.

246
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,919
He could never forget <i>Hwang Jini</i>

247
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,689
because during the production,

248
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:01,293
-he began to have crush on Ji-won.
-I see.

249
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,397
-He said, "It wasn't the case before…
-That can happen.

250
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,233
-…but as the production continued…
-It can happen.

251
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,201
-…I began to fall for her."
-Right.

252
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,903
"But I never got to tell her,

253
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,039
-so it ended as a crush."
-Gosh.

254
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,676
I said one thing,
but it became a long six-line thing.

255
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,277
That can happen.

256
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,747
-We're helping you ease into this.
-We're all people.

257
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,384
This was because I was a child actor.

258
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,120
Back then, Ha Ji-won was an actor

259
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,222
-who seemed too big for me.
-Yes.

260
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,892
She had special presence and aura,

261
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,794
someone who was ahead in her career.

262
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,861
During the production,

263
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,164
sharing <i>gimbap</i> on the way and whatnot.

264
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,234
Back then, I was uncomfortable around her.

265
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:48,140
So I began to wonder
why my heart raced whenever I saw her.

266
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,277
I had those feelings back then.

267
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,445
COUGHING

268
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,913
You notice these things.

269
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,215
-That naturally happens.
-She probably noticed.

270
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,650
-Did you know?
-They had those scenes.

271
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,285
-I didn't.
-You didn't know?

272
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,519
No.

273
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,389
OH, MY…

274
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,859
-But he danced…
-How often did you dance?

275
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,993
She would've noticed

276
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,161
-if he danced that much.
-Right?

277
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,362
What did I dance?

278
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,799
He made me laugh a lot
while we were on set.

279
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,537
What's your ideal type like?

280
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,340
It changed a little
since when I was younger.

281
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,377
But there was one thing
that never changed.

282
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,580
-A good cook.
-I see.

283
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,915
-Yes, a good cook.
-A good cook.

284
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,084
This was something that never changed.

285
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,653
-Why are you so happy?
-Nam-no, why are you happy?

286
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,055
COOKING MANIAC FEELS GOOD

287
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,356
GIGGLES

288
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,858
You liked what you heard, right?

289
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,494
Now that we're on the topic,
some of our chefs say

290
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,331
-Ji-won is their ideal type.
-What?

291
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,599
-Who is it?
-They openly said

292
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,435
they were huge fans of hers
to our production crew.

293
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,371
-Really? That's not easy to bring up.
-No.

294
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,140
-Chef Nam-no.
-Right.

295
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,575
How long have you been her fan?

296
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,179
I've watched many dramas
since I was a teenager,

297
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,247
until I was in the army.

298
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,448
<i>-Damo.</i>
<i>-Damo.</i>

299
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>-Secret Garden.</i>
<i>-Secret Garden.</i>

300
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,151
Lastly, <i>The King 2 Hearts</i>.

301
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,719
MOVED

302
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,088
Do you want to cook
with Ji-won's ingredients today?

303
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,823
-Please.
-Gosh.

304
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,793
-He is practically begging.
-"Please."

305
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,060
That seems enough.

306
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,830
What was your favorite drama,
Chef Kang-rok?

307
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,834
I enjoyed <i>Empress Ki</i>,
and all of that long production.

308
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,269
Thank you.

309
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:28,507
Chef Kang-rok analyzed
exactly what Son Suk-ku's charm was.

310
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,009
No, not his eyes, his eyelids.

311
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,911
They're quite functional.

312
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,015
-I mostly study eyes.
-Oh, he studies eyes.

313
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,283
What about Ji-won's eyes?

314
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,785
TURNS

315
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,587
MAGICAL

316
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,923
WHAT'S KANG-ROK
THE EYE RESEARCHER'S ANALYSIS?

317
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,357
CHUCKLING

318
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,459
What about Ji-won's eyes?

319
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,696
-He turned away.
-He can tell by that glance.

320
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,200
THE EYE RESEARCHER'S
BIGGEST CRISIS

321
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,634
He can't even look at her.

322
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,237
-Please analyze Ji-won's eyes.
-Okay.

323
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,806
ANALYSIS SHUTS DOWN

324
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,041
-He looks so shy.
-Are you done?

325
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,943
I have trouble with the analysis.

326
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,678
You can't analyze her eyes?

327
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,513
No, I have to look into her eyes
for about five seconds.

328
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,014
-Five seconds?
-Go ahead.

329
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,083
-We can look into…
-I can't do that.

330
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,718
ANALYSIS FAILED

331
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,821
He may not get to ask you later,
so please take a picture with him.

332
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,691
-He's not so good with his words.
-Okay.

333
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,959
-Don't you want a picture?
-A selfie?

334
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,794
-I do.
-Yes.

335
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,630
He'll get to take a selfie later.

336
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,534
And now, let's find out
the fridge owner's order

337
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,436
and decide on the contenders.

338
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,672
I wonder what Ji-won's orders are.

339
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,642
Here are her orders!

340
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,111
"Can't you do it in one pan?"

341
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,548
-<i>Something Happened in Bali</i>.
-The soundtrack of that drama.

342
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,650
What's this order about?

343
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,519
I rarely eat delivery food.

344
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,422
I do my best to cook for myself.

345
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,025
I want to learn to make a dish

346
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,794
that leaves the minimum amount
of dirty dishes

347
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,497
yet is simple, quick, and very delicious.

348
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,932
The least amount of dirty dishes.

349
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,501
-Yes.
-A combination of unlikely ingredients?

350
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,870
-I'd love something like that.
-I see.

351
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,706
I think she'll give
lots of points for creativity.

352
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,675
What's Ji-won's second order?

353
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,443
FRAGRANT JINI

354
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,778
-Fragrant Jini.
-Fragrant Jini.

355
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,179
Not <i>Hwang Jini</i>.

356
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,549
<i>Fragrant Jini, fragrant Jini, fragrant</i>

357
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,951
The order is Fragrant Jini.

358
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,220
-Fragrant Jini.
-A fragrant dish?

359
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,189
I'm rather sensitive to smell,

360
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,893
so I enjoy all kinds of herbs.

361
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,362
So I wanted to have a dish
with a good smell.

362
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,064
ORDER NUMBER 2: FRAGRANT JINI

363
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,734
I enjoy exotic herbs like cilantro

364
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,569
and all kinds of herbs.

365
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,138
You must like all spices.

366
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,273
What about smoky flavor?

367
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,742
Does that count as fragrant?

368
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,544
I don't really like smoky flavor.

369
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,646
So, not Chef Yeon-bok.

370
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,149
-Not Chef Yeon-bok.
-I'm sorry.

371
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,718
-It's not like I only make smoky dishes.
-Right?

372
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,553
Okay, then.

373
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,589
We have two chefs

374
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,694
who openly said they were Ji-won's fans,
Choi Kang-rok and Yoon Nam-no.

375
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,995
I'll give the chance…

376
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,063
GRABS HIS CARROT

377
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,798
BURNING WITH DETERMINATION

378
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,335
HE SAVED HIS CARROT PEN
FOR THIS DAY

379
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,938
CAN'T I HAVE THE FIRST CHANCE
TO CHOOSE?

380
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,840
Okay. Kang-rok.

381
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,744
I'll take Fragrant Jini.

382
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,046
-Fragrant Jini.
-Fragrant Jini?

383
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,984
Is there a type of smell
you're best at making?

384
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,686
-<i>Yuja</i>.
-<i>Yuja</i>?

385
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,389
-It's used often in Japanese cuisine.
-Right.

386
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,524
What other fragrances are used
in Japanese cuisine?

387
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,859
There's <i>yuja</i>.

388
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,927
CAN'T I USE YUJA?

389
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,095
What else?

390
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,630
-"There's <i>yuja</i>."
-What if she doesn't have <i>yuja</i>?

391
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,033
He'd like her to have some <i>yuja</i>.

392
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,135
-I hope she has it.
-He'll need that.

393
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,536
Chef Nam-no gets a chance too.

394
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,073
-Well, I am Ji-won's fan.
-Yes.

395
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,743
But I don't think I can make anything
in one pan. My head is spinning.

396
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,177
I'll go with Fragrant Jini.

397
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,412
Fragrant Jini.

398
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,981
You're fighting Kang-rok right away?

399
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,218
What kind of smell
do you like to use when you cook?

400
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,987
I also hoped she'd have <i>yuja</i>
or any citrus fruit.

401
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,222
-<i>Yuja</i>?
-<i>Yuja</i>?

402
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,492
-What will you do if she doesn't have it?
-She better have <i>yuja</i>.

403
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,193
-What if she doesn't?
-She'll need to have some.

404
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,529
-I don't think she has it.
-I don't think so.

405
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,364
I could have some, but I might not.

406
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,567
-Gosh, that sounds like trouble.
-I don't think she has it.

407
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,636
Then, between you two,

408
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,672
only the winner
can take a picture with Ji-won.

409
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,876
-That's a good call.
-Right?

410
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,344
Is that okay? Can you do it?

411
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,580
-I'll cook like my life depends on it.
-Yes, that's the spirit.

412
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,282
Come on. He'll cook like
his life depends on it.

413
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,484
Don't risk your life
over something like this.

414
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,722
BURSTING OUT IN LAUGHTER

415
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,792
Oh, no. He sounds like Confucius.

416
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,694
All right. "Can't you do it in one pan?"

417
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,863
You'll need to use one pan to…

418
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,499
-Are you raising your hand already?
-Yes.

419
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,935
You can't. Tell him that he can't.

420
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,870
-<i>Why can't I do it?</i>
-You can't.

421
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,174
-It's one pan, so he had an advantage.
-He's good at that.

422
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,975
There's a limit.

423
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,078
Not only is the order to my advantage,

424
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,915
Ji-won said she was curious about my food.

425
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,518
-It's really good.
-I wanted to resolve her curiosity too.

426
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,788
-Now, Artist Poong took a spot first.
-He did.

427
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,790
Can't you do it in one pan?

428
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,026
Can't you do it in one pan?

429
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,727
Jong-won. Yes.

430
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,664
-Here.
-Why are you forcing him?

431
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,731
Why me?

432
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,166
Do it with me.

433
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,269
-Please join him.
-Yes, join me.

434
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,737
CAN'T YOU DO IT WITH ME?

435
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,308
-Please join him. One pan dish.
-Yes, join me.

436
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,777
-I'll do it.
-That's right.

437
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,813
-Sam agrees to join him.
-Are you sure?

438
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,582
He has an advantage
if we have to use one pan.

439
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,916
-Poong?
-Yes, him.

440
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,919
But there's something I can do
with one pan too.

441
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,789
Sam Kim and Kim Poong take,
"Can't you do it in one pan?"

442
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,892
The two will have their battle.

443
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,330
And now, let's find out
what's in Ji-won's fridge.

444
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,431
I'm curious.

445
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,299
What did she eat to prevent aging?

446
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,102
She looks exactly like how she did
in <i>Damo</i>,

447
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,438
<i>Something Happened in Bali</i>,
and even <i>Tidal Wave</i>.

448
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,906
You still look the same.

449
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,242
If there's a secret to what you eat,

450
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,311
please share it with our viewers today.

451
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,779
Something that worked.

452
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,248
Yes, there is something.

453
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,782
-There is?
-It's in the fridge.

454
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,385
-It's in the fridge?
-I knew she'd have a secret.

455
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,786
This is big news, everyone.

456
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,556
Let's copy her and stay young.

457
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,558
Who shares the fridge with you?

458
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,226
-My mom.
-Your mother.

459
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,395
You're sharing the fridge
with your mother.

460
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,230
She was quite thrilled

461
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,634
because we usually don't eat
delivery food.

462
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,770
We ordered <i>mala tteokbokki</i> on that day.

463
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,006
-We didn't have the fridge.
-It was gone.

464
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:38,043
-She loved it.
-You got to eat delivery food for once.

465
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,979
The biggest issue
before we open the fridge is

466
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,681
if she'll have <i>yuja</i> or not.

467
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,449
-That's the most important.
-Yes.

468
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,220
Both Kang-rok and Nam-no want <i>yuja</i>.

469
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,988
It'll be trouble if she doesn't have it.

470
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,892
Let's find out
what Ji-won has in her fridge!

471
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:54,960
We present her fridge!

472
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,295
<i>Yuja</i>.

473
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,930
-<i>Yuja</i>.
-What's that yellow thing?

474
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,465
-Does she have <i>yuja</i>?
-What are these?

475
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,934
-These.
-Are those <i>yuja</i>?

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,503
DOES SHE HAVE YUJA?

477
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,505
-These.
-These are lemons.

478
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,541
-She has lemons.
-Not <i>yuja</i>?

479
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,143
Those are lemons, not <i>yuja</i>.

480
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,611
-Wait, right here.
-Yes?

481
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,214
She has preserves made of
bellflower and ginger,

482
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,982
-and <i>omija</i> too.
-Ginger preserves.

483
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,083
She has <i>omija</i> preserves.

484
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,451
-Trifoliate orange.
-No <i>yuja</i>!

485
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,852
-Glasswort extract.
-Lemon!

486
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,588
-There's no <i>yuja</i> preserves.
-No <i>yuja</i>!

487
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,057
-She has no <i>yuja</i> preserves.
-Oh, no.

488
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:29,294
We're not seeing any <i>yuja</i>
from the outside at the moment.

489
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,497
And over here, I see cheese.

490
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,201
Cheese. You must like Western cuisine.
And more cheese.

491
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,004
-Do you use lots of cheese?
-I use it as condiment.

492
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,273
-With cheese?
-What do you use it with?

493
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,841
It doesn't matter what it is.

494
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,779
I don't really like the tastes
of store-bought seasoning.

495
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,082
I don't like artificial flavoring,

496
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,050
so I like to add savory taste with cheese.

497
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:56,288
-I put it over salad and even rice.
-Over rice?

498
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,890
I put rice in olive oil and…

499
00:20:58,957 --> 00:20:59,958
-Rice?
-Yes.

500
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,461
You eat rice in olive oil?

501
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,528
Yes.

502
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,298
That must be her secret to youth.

503
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,333
-This olive oil?
-Yes.

504
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,670
-You eat rice with this?
-Yes.

505
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,171
-That's new.
-This must be a sample.

506
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,340
I put olive oil on soybean paste stew too.

507
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,009
How do you mix it?
Barely covering the rice?

508
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,877
So that the rice is under the oil.

509
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,345
-What?
-What?

510
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,981
You don't just pour it over rice,
but you literally dump it in oil?

511
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,449
It's not that much.

512
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,318
-But covering the rice?
-But enough to cover the rice.

513
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,153
-Kind of like porridge?
-Yes.

514
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,521
It must taste too oily.

515
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,392
I top it with some arugula or herbs

516
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,261
and other toppings I have at home.

517
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,165
In Italy, people do eat cooked rice
like it's salad.

518
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,568
They parboil raw rice
and eat it like salad.

519
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,605
Many people eat that
with a lot of olive oil.

520
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,507
Did someone recommend you that recipe?

521
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,475
Or did you make it up
because you liked it?

522
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,611
-I tried it and liked it.
-You tried it.

523
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,946
-It wasn't a recipe? You did it yourself?
-No.

524
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,715
That may be the secret
to her youthful looks.

525
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,117
-Yes, that may be it.
-She has healthy meals.

526
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:03,121
That was it! That was the secret!

527
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,391
-If you want to look youthful…
-That's crazy.

528
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,228
-…please mix your rice with olive oil.
-Yes, this was it.

529
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,465
-It's unofficial, but…
-That's her recipe.

530
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,768
And I see some herbs. Right?

531
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,537
-I'm seeing some herbs.
-Oh, the herbs.

532
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,106
-These are dills.
-Those are dills.

533
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,075
And rosemary. Basil.

534
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,210
-Arugula.
-Arugula.

535
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,779
-She has lots of herbs.
-All kinds.

536
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,048
Do you eat lots of salad?

537
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,883
It depends on the mood.

538
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,653
I'd top herbs over rice too.

539
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,088
-Why?
-I see.

540
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,190
You top herbs over rice?

541
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,759
-I put it in <i>ramyeon</i> too.
-In <i>ramyeon</i>?

542
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,860
-<i>Ramyeon</i>?
-Herbs in <i>ramyeon</i>?

543
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,961
Rosemary.

544
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,730
-<i>If you put some rosemary in…</i>
-Add rosemary.

545
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,366
-Lime.
<i>-…with some lime, it tastes exotic.</i>

546
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,401
<i>It must taste like</i>
<i>Southeastern Asian food.</i>

547
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,671
<i>-It'll taste like </i>tom yum<i> soup.</i>
<i>-Yes, something like that.</i>

548
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:57,042
I like to destroy stereotypes.
That's just my character.

549
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,011
-And radish kimchi.
-Yes?

550
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,381
It tastes delicious with almonds.

551
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:06,618
-Ji-won is extraordinarily creative.
-What are you talking about?

552
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,053
There's some young radish kimchi.

553
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,055
WE'LL CHECK RIGHT AWAY

554
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,557
What will it taste like
when you eat this together?

555
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,327
She said she liked this pair.

556
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,396
-These two?
-Let's try some.

557
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,197
THE STUDIO BECOMES BUSY

558
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,234
We'll give it out
if you serve them on the dish.

559
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,402
SERVING IT LIKE A CAFETERIA

560
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,469
Rations.

561
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,139
-Rice and oil?
-Almonds.

562
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,907
-Almonds.
-One almond each.

563
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,609
You're giving it out like a pill.

564
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,378
-Put the radish in first, then the almond.
-The kimchi first.

565
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,847
-Chew it together.
-The radish goes in first.

566
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,783
-Radish first.
-Chew the radish first.

567
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,818
Then put the almond in later.

568
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,053
-Instead of one after the other?
-Yes.

569
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,389
-Chew the radish first.
-Yes.

570
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,292
Huh?

571
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,661
-I see.
-It's good.

572
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,263
-It is?
-Yes.

573
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,166
The almond covers that funky smell.

574
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,400
Yes, it does cover it.

575
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,870
The radish sounds refreshing,
but it feels like something's missing.

576
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,772
That's when the sweetness
in the almond comes in.

577
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,209
-It tastes nutty and savory.
-Different flavors.

578
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,144
How many radish pieces are you eating?

579
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,747
It's so good.

580
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,715
Anything else you tried recently?

581
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:15,020
Kimchi stew… I used this kimchi water

582
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,956
and three pieces of radish,
Japanese plum preserves,

583
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,024
and…

584
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,826
fish meat sausage.

585
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,093
Fish meat sausage?

586
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,429
-Fish meat sausage?
-That sausage?

587
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,633
Yes, these. Right here.

588
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,204
I use it often
when I need to whip up a quick meal.

589
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,139
Does this taste good in kimchi stew?

590
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,474
It's not bad.

591
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,376
Look at Keun-suk's face.

592
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,012
There's a reason
why we met after 19 years.

593
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,815
-A lot has happened.
-They had nothing in common.

594
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,318
-There was a palate difference.
-There was a reason.

595
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,221
Ji-won had a peculiar taste in food.

596
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,857
Where did you get napa cabbage like these?

597
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,926
My aunt grew and harvested those.

598
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,128
-These are organic, then.
-Yes.

599
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,531
And what else?

600
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:04,302
Could we say these lemons are
what helped you stay healthy?

601
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,438
Have you had lemon for a long time?

602
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,641
-About 15 years.
-Whoa, 15 years.

603
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,844
-She has a huge load.
-That's a lot.

604
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,012
BAGS OF LEMONS POP OUT

605
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,148
She has a huge load.
How many bags are there?

606
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,316
She has lime too.

607
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,685
She has limes. Gil Ra-im has limes.

608
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,087
You have limes.

609
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,456
-These were blended, I think.
-Or juiced.

610
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,892
This was a soju bottle.

611
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,261
-A soju bottle?
-Yes.

612
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,495
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

613
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,331
She drinks lemon juice after a drink.

614
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,467
My mom prefers that bottle the most.

615
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,903
-It's very sturdy.
-Maybe these were all she saw.

616
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,138
That's a possibility.

617
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,473
You've had lots of these.

618
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,743
If you mix lemon juice into soju,

619
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,546
it won't leave you bloated

620
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,147
or hung over the next day.

621
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,949
Do you only have it as juice?

622
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,451
She has the most lemons
in the history of the show.

623
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,222
I drink it so often that my mom makes
two to three bottles at a time.

624
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,790
Like these.

625
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,326
I'd put it in my tumbler in the morning,

626
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,895
and I sometimes add honey to it.

627
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,497
And you did this for 15 years?

628
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,134
Imagine how she had to drink soju
for 15 years just for the bottles.

629
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,737
I'm sure she didn't need
that many bottles over 15 years.

630
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,339
But she must've used new bottles.

631
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,941
-She does love to drink,
-Yes.

632
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:20,278
but I guess these lemons are
helping her stay young.

633
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,447
There's another bottle here.
Is this lemon too?

634
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,249
That's not lemon.

635
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,584
-Or <i>yuja</i> preserves?
-That's my secret.

636
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,719
-This? What's this?
-What's the secret?

637
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,955
-Is this honey?
-What is this?

638
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,856
It's called royal jelly.

639
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,358
-I see.
-Royal jelly.

640
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,327
-It comes with honey.
-Yes, it's royal jelly.

641
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,530
The small one is the undiluted extract
and is too strong.

642
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,833
-There it is.
-My mom mixed it with honey

643
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,868
and made that mixture for me.

644
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,804
It won't taste too good.

645
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,806
HMM?

646
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,274
It's really sour.

647
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,610
Gosh.

648
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,445
That's the secret to my health.

649
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,947
Do you not have any resistance
to strong flavors that hit you hard?

650
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:59,050
-I love the sour flavor.
-Right?

651
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,820
She made her own path
in search of flavors.

652
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,421
-She does?
-Really?

653
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,656
Was that why she was Gil Ra-im?

654
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,525
She took her own path.

655
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,395
-You'll see something like these.
-Cosmetic products.

656
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,796
Are these cosmetic products?

657
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,665
-Health food.
-Health food?

658
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,301
-Health food for your skin.
-I see.

659
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,703
-Health food for your skin.
-Yes.

660
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,007
I've used that product for over a decade.

661
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,176
I used it for a long time
and loved it so much

662
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,580
that I launched my own line.

663
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,882
And the freezer has seafood.

664
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,219
-These look like webfoot octopus.
-I see.

665
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,321
-I caught those.
-What?

666
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,622
-I did.
-You caught those?

667
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,391
-Did you go fishing?
-I did.

668
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,526
You have lots of seafood.

669
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:45,096
-Pomfret. Yes.
-Pomfret. And salmon.

670
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,198
That's my staple food.

671
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,769
Is there something only you do
when you eat seafood?

672
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,506
I just boil webfoot octopus
and dip it in mayonnaise.

673
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,807
It tastes good.

674
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,809
You dip it in mayonnaise
instead of <i>chojang</i>?

675
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,278
That was an unlikely pair too.

676
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,982
I'll figure it out.
I'll try to understand.

677
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,485
We have an extraordinary fridge owner
with us today.

678
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,288
You must capture her palate.

679
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,191
That was all for Ji-won's fridge.

680
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,093
It won't be easy.

681
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,130
<i>The first round</i>
<i>with Ji-won's ingredients is</i>

682
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,132
a legendary battle you can see

683
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,803
only on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,
the Sam-Poong derby.

684
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,304
The Sam-Poong derby?

685
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,008
<i>The Sam-Poong derby.</i>
<i>Everyone loves their matches.</i>

686
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,777
<i>Let's take a look</i>
<i>at their previous record.</i>

687
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,612
<i>Eight wins and eight losses.</i>

688
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,515
-It's a close game.
-It is.

689
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,418
It shouldn't be a close fight for Sam,
should it?

690
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,721
Exactly. He's up against Poong.

691
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,591
-Yes, I was shocked too. Eight to eight?
-Right?

692
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,861
That was unexpected.
I thought I had the lead.

693
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,465
Should I take another look?

694
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,100
No, it's eight to eight.

695
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,936
Our fight quickly became even

696
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,505
while I let my guard down a little.

697
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,442
I think I should try a little harder.

698
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,880
I kept wondering
if I should share this or not.

699
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:12,350
In the green room,
Sam came to me and said,

700
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,954
"Can you let me win?
I'll give you 500,000 won."

701
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,356
He said that? He wanted to buy you out?

702
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,591
This is so wrong.

703
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,294
He offered the exact amount of 500,000 won

704
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,663
and asked me to lose the battle.

705
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,899
You can't fix the matches.

706
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,300
-This is a huge deal.
-It's not right.

707
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,270
I offered him 500,000 won
and a bottle of extra virgin olive oil.

708
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,738
Yes, right.

709
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,240
You really said that?

710
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,143
-I was there, and I heard it.
-Really? He said that?

711
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,211
So you're asking him to lose?

712
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,247
-I want to win.
-You want to win?

713
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,182
This happened to him because of the star.

714
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,085
Everyone, let's not cook to get stars.

715
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,989
Yes, the stars are what follows.

716
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,159
No one can back off from this battle.

717
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,494
The order is,
"Can't you do it in one pan?"

718
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,563
When it comes to the pan, there's Sylvia.

719
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,899
Sylvia needs to play a huge role today.

720
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,667
Have you gotten used to it?

721
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,203
Well, I wanted to get used to it,

722
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,671
but it didn't work
on an induction cooktop.

723
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,707
It was made of aluminum,
so it wouldn't work.

724
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,644
That's why I bought a portable burner.

725
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,112
Wait, I'm sorry,

726
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,581
-but Sylvia turned brown.
-It did.

727
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,683
It was called Sylvia
because it was silver.

728
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,485
It used to glimmer, but it's now brown.

729
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,153
I need to report him

730
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,555
for a possible abuse.

731
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,124
SUSPICION OF MATCH FIXING
AND PAN ABUSE

732
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,559
It became too dirty.

733
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,894
It's been a month,
but I don't recognize it anymore.

734
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,397
The pan began to go through a lot

735
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,500
after Sam won against Sung-jun.

736
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,204
<i>-That was when he threw Sylvia out.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

737
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,206
<i>And it ended up with Poong.</i>

738
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,575
-<i>That pan was his child.</i>
-<i>He used it for</i> Culinary Class Wars.

739
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,210
<i>I can't help it.</i>

740
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,145
He's serving it in the pan.

741
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,147
<i>Why is it on fire?</i>

742
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,349
<i>The pan was truly cursed!</i>

743
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,052
It's going through harsh training.

744
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,454
I'm going to get Sylvia's revenge.

745
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,556
-It's revenge for Sylvia.
-That's right.

746
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,760
HA JI-WON'S INGREDIENTS: ASPARAGUS,
CAPER BERRY, ROSEMARY, ARUGULA

747
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,364
SALMON, LEMON, DILL

748
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,633
I prepared a dish called

749
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,635
Ha Ji-won Pan Dish.

750
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,005
Ha Ji-won Pan Dish. I see.

751
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,474
Ji-won looks pleased.

752
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,476
Ha Ji-won Pan Dish.

753
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,813
I'll use salmon,
and you said you enjoyed lemon.

754
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,281
It's a classic dish, actually.

755
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:27,051
I'm going to use lemon in butter,
as well as dill.

756
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,821
Also, these will go well with asparagus.

757
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,491
So I'll serve it
with grilled vegetables and salad.

758
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,595
This is actually a dish
that usually requires three pans,

759
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,631
but I'll do everything in one pan

760
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,367
to make it easy for you to try at home.

761
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,468
That's his specialty.

762
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,670
<i>He usually uses lots of pans,</i>

763
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,672
<i>-about three at a time.</i>
<i>-Yes, I do use a lot of them.</i>

764
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,708
-At least three.
-But the order said one pan.

765
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,877
You'll be disqualified
if you use another pan.

766
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,545
-Okay.
-Good.

767
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,181
PARMIGIANO REGGIANO CHEESE,
FISH MEAT SAUSAGE, OLIVE OIL

768
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,550
SPAGHETTI, CHERRY TOMATO, BROCCOLI,
MAYONNAISE, NAPA CABBAGE, LEMON

769
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,986
The dish I'm making is called

770
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:03,821
Marbonara.

771
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,657
-What?
-Marbonara.

772
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,760
-Marbonara.
-Keun-suk broke out in laughter.

773
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:09,961
Marbonara?

774
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,230
He has a way with naming his dish.

775
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,032
Marbonara?

776
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,167
What are you using?

777
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,803
It's "ma" for mayonnaise.

778
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,272
-"Ma" for mayonnaise.
-Mayonnaise.

779
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,640
How do you make it?

780
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,679
You can boil pasta
and some veggies you have at home,

781
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,747
-and in the end,
-Mayonnaise?

782
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,683
I'll put mayonnaise in.

783
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,419
-Wait a moment.
-Right.

784
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,187
You'll put everything and boil them.

785
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,555
He'll mix it with mayonnaise.

786
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,492
And I listened to everything she said.

787
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,895
She said she seasons her food with cheese.

788
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,030
And I'm adding everything she likes.

789
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,231
You said you liked this too.

790
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,568
-You're using that too?
-I am.

791
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,570
You listened to everything she said.

792
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,505
I really did.
I'm putting in everything she likes.

793
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,442
You mentioned lemon,
so I'm putting that in.

794
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,278
And the napa cabbage your aunt grew.

795
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,612
-You're using napa cabbage?
-I am.

796
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,916
-You're putting in everything she likes.
-Only the things I love.

797
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,518
Yes, I chose only the things she liked.

798
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:12,090
Have you ever mixed pasta in mayonnaise?

799
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,859
-No.
-She hasn't.

800
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,062
In that case,
you may be curious about it.

801
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,965
But most importantly, it's so simple.

802
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,867
-That's an important point.
-It is.

803
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,004
On top of that,
I won't use a cutting board.

804
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,240
I'll use only a pair of scissors.

805
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,176
-That leaves no dirty dishes.
-Not at all.

806
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,545
-It's not easy to wash a cutting board.
-No.

807
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,115
Who has the time to wash all of that?

808
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,917
I don't need any plates.

809
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,387
I just need a pan and a pair of scissors.

810
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,691
It'll have as many flavors
as any regular dish

811
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,993
and taste delicious too.

812
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,597
All right. This is another big match.

813
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,401
Today's winner will
take the lead in the Sam-Poong derby.

814
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:01,639
Let us begin the round with the order
"Can't you do it in one pan?"

815
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,244
Gosh.

816
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,513
-Whoa.
-That looks cool.

817
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,548
Let us begin the round.

818
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,883
Artist Poong is

819
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,886
up against the man
who put the curse on Sylvia.

820
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,922
Chef Sam Kim is here today

821
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,258
to destroy both Poong and Sylvia.

822
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,761
Who'll be the winner
of the returning Sam-Poong derby?

823
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,165
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

824
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,602
The 15-minute cook-off has begun.

825
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,072
You can use only one pan.

826
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,074
You can't use any other pan.

827
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,077
Artist Poong begins
by pouring water into Sylvia.

828
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,679
-Sylvia's color has changed.
-Yes.

829
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,780
THE SIGN OF PRACTICE

830
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,516
-Chef Sam pulls out salmon.
-Salmon.

831
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,219
-You said you liked salmon.
-Yes, I love it.

832
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,720
She says she loves it.

833
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,055
How do you usually eat salmon?

834
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,523
I don't grill it.

835
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,661
-I eat it with vegetables, like salad.
-Like salad?

836
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,798
-Lemon.
-He needs to use lemons.

837
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,834
That's the secret to Ji-won's health.
Lemons.

838
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,403
He's juicing the lemons.

839
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,672
Lemons. Are you not using royal jelly?

840
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,073
I wonder.

841
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,310
-It's all right.
-Is it? Just the lemons.

842
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,980
HUMMING
AND HUMMING

843
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,048
HUMMING SOME MORE

844
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,620
KIM POONG BOILS WATER AT EASE

845
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,789
WANDERING AROUND

846
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,857
STOPS

847
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,825
Poong looks too relaxed.

848
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,328
-Look at him now.
-Right now…

849
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,930
-What?
-He's checking the ingredients now.

850
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,433
Why are you looking at that now?

851
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,935
-What's he doing?
-He's reading the instructions now.

852
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,874
COUGHING

853
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,575
-Do you want me to look?
-How many minutes?

854
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,810
How many minutes does it take?

855
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,914
He asks Sung-jun how many minutes
it'll take to cook the pasta.

856
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,184
-I failed with the pasta last time.
-The pasta?

857
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,352
<i>What was the pasta?</i>

858
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,454
<i>It was something different.</i>

859
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,822
LOST 4 TIMES IN A ROW

860
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,825
-Eight minutes.
-Eight minutes?

861
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,460
-Eight, nine minutes?
-Eight minutes?

862
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,328
I'm very picky about pasta.

863
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,063
-The texture?
-She's picky about pasta.

864
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,966
-I'm very picky.
-How do you take it? Fully cooked?

865
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,569
-I don't like it when it's fully cooked.
-Just adequately?

866
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,104
She wants it to be al dente.

867
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,306
The pasta can't be overcooked.

868
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,008
-Al dente?
-It needs to be al dente.

869
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:21,012
IN THAT CASE…

870
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,849
Aren't you going to cook?

871
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,151
-I have nothing to do.
-You're so relaxed.

872
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,854
-Look at him.
-I can't do anything now.

873
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,956
-You're so relaxed.
-Look at him.

874
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,659
I've never seen him so relaxed before.

875
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,994
The water's boiling, so put it in.

876
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,729
-Right now?
-Yes.

877
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,098
It's been two minutes already.

878
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,533
It's a one pan dish,

879
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,168
so he has to cook the pasta first

880
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,437
before throwing in other ingredients.

881
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,839
He's trying to find the timing
to start cooking the pasta.

882
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,908
Do something.
Don't you have anything to cut?

883
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,010
Don't you have anything to cut?

884
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,446
-Gosh, that's so new.
-That's crazy.

885
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,114
It'll take a bit longer.

886
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,350
-It won't even take 15 minutes.
-No.

887
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,253
-No.
-It'll take a little longer.

888
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,888
It'll take longer on that pan.

889
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,924
Sylvia is too small,
so he has to put it in quickly.

890
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,327
-That's…
-Last time, that pasta was…

891
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,196
KIM POONG WAS TRAUMATIZED
BY THE UNCOOKED PASTA

892
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,498
He's studying the pasta.

893
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,468
He keeps pulling it out,
then putting it back in.

894
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,770
We've never seen anyone
that relaxed on this show.

895
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,373
Sam is the only one who's busy.
He's using asparagus.

896
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,675
We have nothing to see on Poong's side.

897
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,711
Sam is

898
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,246
mostly getting the veggies ready.

899
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,615
CUTTING OUT TOUGH PARTS LIKE A PENCIL

900
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,386
2. PUT OLIVE OIL IN AND GRILL ASPARAGUS,
SEASON WITH SALT AND BLACK PEPPER

901
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,322
The pan is small,
so he should put it in sooner.

902
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,558
I see. What are you sprinkling
into boiling water?

903
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,293
-Salt.
-Salt.

904
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,096
If he's using one pan,
wouldn't it be too salty when it's done?

905
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,430
You're right.

906
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,698
I'll toss the water.

907
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,235
I see.
Are you melting salt with pasta?

908
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,870
Gosh.

909
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,305
That's unique.

910
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,507
I'm sure he has a spoon somewhere.

911
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,776
IS HE SHOWING HIS DETERMINATION
NOT TO MAKE DIRTY DISHES?

912
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,011
It's like a brush.

913
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,814
It's so much fun
to watch this in real life.

914
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,250
-No, it's not that.
-Are you using that as a spoon?

915
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,987
If I lay the noodles down,
it'll start to burn.

916
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,823
-It's a bit…
-The pasta is still too stiff.

917
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,727
-Otherwise, it'll burn out of the pan.
-And he can't break it either.

918
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,996
Ji-won likes to see some creativity,

919
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,166
so he can overcook this side
and undercook this side.

920
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,834
BOWING DOWN

921
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,369
It'll give her two textures.

922
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,005
This side is overcooked,
and this side is al dente.

923
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,541
-So she can just grab it and eat it?
-Yes.

924
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,578
It's not going into the pan.

925
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,580
SYLVIA REFUSES TO TAKE THE PASTA

926
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,816
-It's not going in.
-It's too much.

927
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,585
The pan is too small.

928
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,487
-Gosh, darn it.
-No!

929
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:48,459
-Wait, will the pasta get cooked?
-I told you to put it in already.

930
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,527
I did.

931
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,762
The pasta has to get cooked.

932
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,499
All Poong did for five minutes is
boiling water

933
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,867
and putting in pasta.

934
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,903
-He's adding more salt.
-What's important is

935
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,806
that the tips of the pasta
still aren't underwater.

936
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,011
The pasta isn't submerged. It has to be.

937
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,213
I hope it gets cooked thoroughly.

938
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,315
He failed last time because of the pasta.

939
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:15,553
The match should look intense,
but he won't even need 15 minutes.

940
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,555
-Is that butter?
-That's butter.

941
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,256
What will you do with the butter?

942
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,926
I'll chop the dill in
and freeze it a little.

943
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,894
Like dill butter.

944
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,396
What are you chopping?

945
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,797
-Dill.
-Dill.

946
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,499
-Dill?
-Yes.

947
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,101
I see. You're using dill.

948
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,036
LEMON JUICE

949
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,441
He put dill on plastic wrap
and rolls butter on it.

950
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,211
-Where are you going? Freezer?
-I'll freeze it for a bit.

951
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,847
-I see.
-He's hardening it a bit.

952
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,648
You have under ten minutes now.

953
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,684
Sam must love a deal and dill.

954
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:51,655
He tried to make a deal
by offering him 500,000 won.

955
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,923
Wait a moment.

956
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,458
Maybe Poong is cooking halfheartedly

957
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,027
because he already got
500,000 won from Sam.

958
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,095
NO

959
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,697
DENYING EVERYTHING

960
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,466
-Doesn't it seem like it?
-It does.

961
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,168
THE SITUATION SEEMS PLAUSIBLE

962
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,302
It looks suspicious.

963
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,804
-That's why.
-Yes.

964
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,774
-You're different from before.
-Come on.

965
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,209
He stood around for two minutes.

966
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,944
It looks like you're letting him win.

967
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,347
-No.
-Why are you putting in so much salt?

968
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,416
-I have to use lots of salt.
-You do?

969
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,051
-Really?
-Is he putting in lots of salt

970
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,354
-just in case he wins?
-Exactly.

971
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,524
We're going to take a look at everything
if that's the case.

972
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,161
You'll get kicked out immediately
if you try to fix a match.

973
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,129
-Goodness, no.
-You can never come back.

974
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,531
No, that's not the case.

975
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,032
OLIVE OIL

976
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,336
This is a match that uses only one pan.

977
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:43,274
He's grilling asparagus
and salmon in the same pan.

978
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,909
WHOLE BLACK PEPPER

979
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,279
Chef Sam is doing his best to cook.

980
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,880
But this side is too relaxed.

981
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,650
That's how Poong gets the best of him.

982
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,119
That's why I'm not looking at him.

983
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,987
It'd feel like only you were busy.

984
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,989
PEEK-A-BOO

985
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,259
-Yes, Poong is teasing him.
-Come on.

986
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,030
It often got to Sam when he did that.

987
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,066
You have under eight minutes.

988
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,301
CHECKING THE TIME

989
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,170
CALCULATING THE TIME HE NEEDS
TO COOK THE PASTA

990
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,507
NOT YET

991
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,175
WHAT'S SAM KIM'S NEXT INGREDIENT?

992
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,077
-What are you chopping now?
-Rosemary.

993
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,412
-Rosemary.
-Rosemary.

994
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,780
He's adding rosemary too.

995
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,049
Rosemary is a strong smell,

996
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,819
so if he puts in everything he chopped,
it'll smell incredibly fragrant.

997
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,423
The next round is
actually all about fragrances,

998
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,492
but Sam is going for that too.

999
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,695
-Did you put it in?
-I can smell the herbs already.

1000
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,364
You have seven minutes left.

1001
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,967
-Poong, is that broccoli?
-Can you put that in now?

1002
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,235
Shouldn't you parboil it?

1003
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,338
The broccoli… Really?

1004
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,439
He's putting the broccoli in.

1005
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,974
I am.

1006
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,510
-It doesn't get cooked easily.
-No, right?

1007
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,612
-It takes a while.
-It'll get cooked.

1008
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,214
SAM KIM GETS BUTTER AGAIN

1009
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,551
SHOWERING SALMON
WITH ROSEMARY AND BUTTER

1010
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:05,823
6. BOIL CRUSHED GARLIC IN BUTTER
AND MAKE GARLIC BUTTER

1011
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,059
-You have six minutes left.
-Okay.

1012
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,229
THE SALMON STEAK GOES OUT

1013
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,166
I think Sam is almost done.

1014
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,935
-He's almost done.
-He's done.

1015
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,872
7. ADD LEMON JUICE AND CHOPPED DILL
TO GARLIC BUTTER AND MAKE SAUCE

1016
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:25,175
If Sam hits the bell first,

1017
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,878
it'll be a hard blow for Poong.

1018
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,547
ADDING ANOTHER PORTION OF BUTTER

1019
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,517
Can you throw me a strand later?

1020
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,986
-Can you throw me a strand later?
-There?

1021
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,888
Is the pasta done?

1022
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,723
It'll take a while to get cooked.

1023
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,791
Let me try it.

1024
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,562
Yes, Chef Sung-jun is trying the pasta.
Is it cooked?

1025
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:45,763
It'll take three more minutes.

1026
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:46,964
-Three minutes?
-Yes.

1027
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,732
He has 4 minutes and 50 seconds left.

1028
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,535
-Will he have enough time?
-It'll take three more minutes.

1029
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,237
The time will be up by then.

1030
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,739
4. ADD CHERRY TOMATO AS A WHOLE

1031
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,175
-Sung-ju! Please go out to the field.
-Yes?

1032
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,677
Yes, let me go out to the field.

1033
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,545
There's nothing to try.

1034
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,180
I don't think he can try anything.

1035
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,883
Let me check how things are going
out on the field.

1036
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,053
What's that?

1037
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,122
It's hot. Why is this so hot?

1038
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,758
YOU'RE NOT READY TO TAKE ME YET

1039
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,894
-May I try the pasta too?
-Yes, sure.

1040
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,663
You have 4 minutes and 15 seconds left.

1041
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,831
Let me try the pasta.

1042
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,501
HE CHEWS ON THE PASTA CAREFULLY

1043
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,270
Was it cooked?

1044
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,972
I don't think so.

1045
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,175
HE CALCULATED THE COOKING TIME
FOR PASTA

1046
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,409
This is bad.

1047
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,778
-It's bad?
-Poong, this is bad.

1048
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,816
It's not even halfway cooked.

1049
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,285
It's not even halfway cooked.

1050
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,854
SUNG-JUN, YOU SAID 3 MINUTES

1051
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,189
DON'T WORRY

1052
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,991
YOU ONLY NEED 2 MINUTES!

1053
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,959
-Poong, it's not even half done.
-Two minutes.

1054
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,661
Who were you looking at?

1055
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:51,929
-Was it Sung-jun?
-No.

1056
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,697
-It's not even halfway done?
-Not at all.

1057
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,232
It's probably still hard.

1058
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,435
The inside was still completely raw.

1059
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,739
Hold on. What are you throwing in?

1060
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,140
-Cheese.
-Cheese?

1061
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,509
-Cheese.
-Shouldn't you grate it first?

1062
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,577
It'll melt.

1063
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,078
-That's…
-You just tossed it in?

1064
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,014
It's usually powdered first.

1065
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,448
He cut it with scissors.

1066
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,151
POONG GOES BACK TO HIS FIRST DAY
AND COOKS LIKE A MAN LIVING ALONE

1067
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,720
-Wait. Three minutes now.
-The handle is too hot.

1068
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,788
THEN!

1069
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,256
Why is the handle so hot?

1070
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,624
-Use a dishcloth.
-Gosh.

1071
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,160
HE RECEIVES AN ITEM
TO USE ON SYLVIA

1072
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,795
-Aren't you almost done?
-I am.

1073
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:25,863
He's almost done.

1074
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,198
Sam is almost done.

1075
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,466
Why don't you taste the sauce?

1076
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,435
This sauce, made by Sam.

1077
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,370
It looks rather oily.

1078
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,706
-It's butter.
-It's butter?

1079
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,675
He used lots of butter.

1080
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,511
Do you think Ji-won will like it?

1081
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,012
HOW'S GARLIC BUTTER
WITH LEMON JUICE?

1082
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:45,883
It has a strong lemon taste.

1083
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,085
-I see.
-It's sour.

1084
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:52,890
It's very sour, and I think he's set on
how she eats rice with olive oil.

1085
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,058
You're right.

1086
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,360
WHAT ABOUT KIM POONG?

1087
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,761
The fish meat sausage.

1088
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,963
8. CUT FISH MEAT SAUSAGE
INTO THE PASTA

1089
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,136
9. CHOP CABBAGE INTO THE PASTA

1090
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,806
Poong is suddenly very busy!

1091
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,074
What's he doing?

1092
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,509
Poong is suddenly very busy!

1093
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,311
Why are you so busy now?

1094
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,715
He just put
fish meat sausage in there too.

1095
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,516
Let me check the pasta again.

1096
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,418
Poong had been slacking around.

1097
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:26,290
Let me try the pasta again
with two minutes left in the round.

1098
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:32,396
Will Artist Poong get his first star?

1099
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,764
Gosh.

1100
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,266
-Can't you cook it a little more?
-Sure.

1101
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,035
-You have to cook it more.
-It will be ready up front.

1102
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,403
It has to be cooked more.

1103
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,806
Can't you cut the napa cabbage?
Aren't those too big?

1104
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,775
It'll get smaller when it's cooked.

1105
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,945
-Yes, it'll get smaller when it's cooked.
-Yes.

1106
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,981
-A minute and 30 seconds.
-You only have a minute and 30 seconds.

1107
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,617
Okay.

1108
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,185
SWIFT

1109
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,856
-What's that?
-What's that? Sugar?

1110
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,923
Is that sugar?

1111
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,425
PUTTING IN ONLY THE HALF

1112
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,327
-Sugar?
-It's sugar.

1113
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,862
You're adding sugar to pasta?

1114
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,930
He just put in sugar.

1115
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,567
Does this pasta come with soup?

1116
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,836
Mayonnaise!

1117
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,571
Wait a minute.

1118
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,407
He just poured mayonnaise in.

1119
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,712
It's turning into something.

1120
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,981
-It looks like a decent dish.
-Yes.

1121
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,917
It'll taste good when you try it.

1122
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:27,985
MARBONARA BEGAN TO LOOK GOOD

1123
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,820
Look at his Marbonara.

1124
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,822
It's supposed to be like carbonara.

1125
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,490
Poong is becoming busier.

1126
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,858
11. TURN THE HEAT OFF
AND ADD MAYONNAISE

1127
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:35,926
He's mixing.

1128
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,728
But look at the shape.

1129
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,863
-Finally, lemon.
-Scissors on lemon!

1130
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,865
-He's cutting lemon!
-He's using scissors!

1131
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,434
Watch your hand. You might cut your hand.

1132
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:48,772
-You have only seconds left.
-Start juicing it!

1133
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,541
My gosh, look at that.

1134
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,942
THE JUICE EXPLODES

1135
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,010
He got the juice.

1136
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,413
Look at Chef Sam.
He's looking more relaxed now.

1137
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,682
He just pulled those out.

1138
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,984
You have a minute!

1139
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,187
His presentation looks so clean.

1140
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,889
It looks like a dish
at a fine dining restaurant.

1141
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,524
CAPER BERRIES

1142
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,194
9. SERVE WITH ARUGULA, DILL,
AND CAPER BERRIES

1143
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,629
You have 30 seconds left.

1144
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,631
Poong, are you done?

1145
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,732
Serve it now!

1146
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,302
-I need ground pepper.
-Twenty seconds!

1147
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,537
Why didn't you work harder before?

1148
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,674
Poong, the time is almost up.

1149
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,309
You have to finish up!

1150
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,410
-Ten!
-Ten!

1151
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,847
-Twenty seconds!
-Why didn't you work harder before?

1152
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,684
Poong, the time is almost up.
You have to finish up!

1153
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,751
-Ten!
-Ten!

1154
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,919
-Nine!
-Nine!

1155
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,855
-Eight! Seven!
-Sam's done.

1156
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,090
-Six! Five!
-Six! Five!

1157
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,692
Put more mayonnaise in.

1158
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:42,759
-Five!
-Five!

1159
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:43,827
-Four!
-Four!

1160
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:44,895
-Three!
-Three!

1161
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,263
-Two!
-Two!

1162
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,332
-One!
-One! The end!

1163
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,170
He's done. Poong is done.

1164
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,874
He couldn't even serve it on a dish.
You must serve it like this.

1165
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,876
You had no time to serve it on a dish.

1166
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:02,379
SYLVIA RETURNS WITH ITS GREAT PRESENCE

1167
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,281
You must serve it on Sylvia.

1168
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,016
This one.

1169
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,918
You must serve it on Sylvia.

1170
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,787
-You can give her a dish.
-No, put it under the pan.

1171
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,656
-Under the pan?
-Why under the pan?

1172
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,924
Like a saucer?

1173
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:14,992
Like a saucer?

1174
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,293
TEAR

1175
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,695
HE MUST LET SYLVIA GO LIKE THIS

1176
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,797
Wait, isn't it the other way?

1177
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:26,270
The dish was served on one pan too.

1178
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,672
-It looks creamy, though.
-It smells good.

1179
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,375
It's a wonder
that it looks like a real dish.

1180
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,011
-It smells good.
-He knows how to make the flavor.

1181
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,279
It has good flavor.

1182
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,446
It has good flavor when you taste it.

1183
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,016
Poong is weak at pasta.

1184
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,984
It's not that. It's the pan.

1185
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,021
I'll throw it out if I lose today.

1186
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,224
I don't think that pan is for me.

1187
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,528
Please try Chef Sam's dish,
Ha Ji-won Pan Dish first.

1188
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:56,066
A PERFECT HARMONY OF LEMON, DILL,
BUTTER, AND SALMON

1189
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,203
VEGGIES LUSTERING IN OLIVE OIL

1190
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,775
CHEF SAM KIM'S HA JI-WON PAN DISH

1191
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,076
Should I eat everything together?

1192
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,112
Yes, cut the salmon
and try it with the asparagus.

1193
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,481
Wouldn't it be too sour
if he used two lemons?

1194
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,849
This is my first meal today.

1195
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,718
-I see.
-I see. You were waiting for this.

1196
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,987
-I waited on purpose.
-On purpose?

1197
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,589
I'm so glad
Poong's dish isn't the first one.

1198
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,028
He got the idea after hearing that
you like to mix rice in olive oil.

1199
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,197
And Ji-won is taking a bite.

1200
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,565
IT'S HER FIRST MEAL OF THE DAY

1201
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,302
It was overly sour when I had it.

1202
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,372
-Was it too sour?
-It was quite sour.

1203
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,941
-It should be okay with salmon.
-How is it?

1204
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:41,144
I was worried
because he put in two lemons.

1205
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:44,281
-The sourness is perfect for me.
-Is it?

1206
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,617
I want my dishes to be
just as sour as this one.

1207
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,286
-Was it perfect?
-Yes.

1208
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,821
Gosh, he got it right.

1209
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,290
You don't serve it like this
to your customers, do you?

1210
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,626
-Then they'd probably complain.
-They would.

1211
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:57,861
Is this almost too sour?

1212
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,630
-I did neutralize it a little.
-You did.

1213
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,133
Despite that, it's still strong.

1214
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,135
-I was surprised.
-Let me try the arugula.

1215
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,170
-Is that arugula?
-Yes, try it with the arugula.

1216
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,638
Try it with the arugula too.

1217
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,476
Olive oil is dripping.

1218
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,280
Will it please
the fridge owner's appetite?

1219
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,418
-The arugula is good too.
-The arugula is also good.

1220
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,788
It has a new flavor
in the midst of the sourness.

1221
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,357
-It's a new combination.
-Yes.

1222
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,526
Was the salmon cooked well?

1223
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,062
-Well…
-The salmon.

1224
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,532
Look at that.
I knew something was up with the salmon.

1225
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,200
-Salmon.
-Wasn't it overcooked?

1226
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,969
-It could be.
-She must have a preference.

1227
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,704
This butter is good.

1228
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,474
I was asking about salmon,
but you're talking about butter.

1229
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,576
The butter's really good.

1230
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,745
-Was that lemon dill butter?
-Yes.

1231
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,915
I added dill and a bit of lemon juice
on the butter.

1232
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:52,983
It's so good.

1233
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,252
-But…
-But?

1234
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,386
The salmon.

1235
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,391
-It was a bit overcooked.
-Overcooked.

1236
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,459
Is it too dry?

1237
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:07,664
I like it when it's still a little raw
on the inside.

1238
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,833
I was surprised

1239
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,668
because the dish was cooked

1240
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,237
in perfect sourness and oiliness,

1241
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,007
although he cooked for me
for the first time.

1242
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,277
The mix of dill, asparagus, and butter

1243
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:23,880
made me feel like
I was near the Mediterranean Sea.

1244
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:26,616
She was suddenly reminded
of the Mediterranean Sea.

1245
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,920
But the salmon was a bit overcooked.

1246
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,621
It was because I used one pan.

1247
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,623
I would've done better if I used three.

1248
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,726
-Why are you mad?
-Don't be mad.

1249
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:40,697
We were speaking
in respectful language all along.

1250
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,499
"I would've done better!"

1251
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,368
The fridge owner wanted you to use
only one pan. What can we do?

1252
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,204
-We didn't tell you to do that.
-No.

1253
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,773
You were only thinking about
making a deal with 500,000 won.

1254
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,642
Sam went down this low just to get a star.

1255
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,743
My gosh.

1256
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,046
-Goodness.
-This is so unfortunate.

1257
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,247
STILL MUNCHING

1258
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,548
She keeps working on the dish.

1259
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,750
You don't want to
move on to the other dish, right?

1260
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,086
I wanted to try another bite.

1261
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,921
Try to fill up with this.

1262
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,056
I think it'll harden.

1263
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,691
It looks like it'll harden.

1264
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,627
Ji-won will try Artist Poong's Marbonara.

1265
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:15,031
CARBONARA RECONSTRUCTED WITH MAYO,
FEATURING FISH MEAT SAUSAGE

1266
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:20,137
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
MARBONARA

1267
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,204
Gosh.

1268
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,340
You should mix it first.

1269
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:24,741
It looks so dry.

1270
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,009
-Should I mix it?
-Yes.

1271
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,444
-Please do.
-Mix it.

1272
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,979
It looks drier than I thought.

1273
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,082
I thought this was rice cake.

1274
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:37,287
-That's the sausage you like.
-That's sausage.

1275
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,656
It's a bit dry,
so you should mix it in the sauce.

1276
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,025
-It looks like carbonara, though.
-It does.

1277
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,760
-It looks like cream pasta.
-It does.

1278
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,029
This mayonnaise brand in America

1279
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,465
once had a recipe contest
that uses mayonnaise,

1280
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,368
and the winner was
mayonnaise carbonara.

1281
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,337
-Really?
-It has both eggs and fat in it.

1282
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,239
Then the story may change.

1283
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,642
-Does it look like carbonara?
-Yes.

1284
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,177
What's important is the taste.

1285
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,046
-She said she'd be honest.
-Yes.

1286
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,483
She wanted to find out
if Artist Poong's dishes were really good.

1287
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,020
CAUTIOUS

1288
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,557
-She looks suspicious.
-Do you feel dizzy?

1289
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,858
ICH!

1290
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,762
-She's falling into it.
-She's dizzy.

1291
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,830
Please have a bite.

1292
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,233
-I wonder what it'll taste like.
-I wonder.

1293
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,771
What's wrong?

1294
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,105
LAUGHING IMMEDIATELY
WITHOUT HESITATING

1295
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,307
What's wrong?

1296
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,643
The pasta should be cooked.
It should be cooked well.

1297
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,045
Yes, the pasta is cooked.

1298
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,014
-The pasta is cooked.
-What a relief.

1299
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:41,585
It'll be amazing
if he made it taste like carbonara.

1300
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,954
She's taking a bigger bite.

1301
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,556
-Yes, she grabbed more.
-She got more.

1302
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,727
Many viewers are leaning in
to hear what Ji-won has to say.

1303
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,164
What does
Artist Poong's actual dish taste like?

1304
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,900
It has a unique flavor.

1305
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,769
In a positive way or a negative way?

1306
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,039
It's neither.
I've never tasted a flavor like this.

1307
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,775
She has never tasted a flavor like that.

1308
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,811
Does it taste like carbonara?

1309
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:10,780
No.

1310
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,050
How are you going to express this?

1311
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,385
THE EVALUATION IS STILL VAGUE

1312
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,688
It tastes very mischievous.

1313
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,591
It tastes mischievous?

1314
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,193
-At first, it's sour.
-Yes.

1315
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,062
Then it smells a bit like mayonnaise.

1316
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,865
It has a strong personality.

1317
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,501
-I want to try a bite.
-Why don't we let Keun-suk try it?

1318
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,903
-I'd love to try it.
-Please try it.

1319
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,474
-He's a good cook.
-And a gourmet.

1320
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,378
That's Chef Sam's Ha Ji-won Pan Dish.

1321
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,046
A BIG BITE OF SALMON,
ARUGULA, AND ASPARAGUS

1322
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,685
-We are in the Mediterranean Sea.
-We are.

1323
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:53,223
I took a bite thinking it'd be sour,

1324
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,359
but it helps neutralize
the overly oily taste.

1325
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:59,663
It has a good balance with garlic.

1326
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:04,200
I think dill is
the most perfect partner for salmon.

1327
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,268
It's good.

1328
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:08,204
And now, the problematic Marbonara.

1329
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:11,074
Ji-won was surprised at its taste.

1330
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,110
How will Keun-suk respond? Gosh.

1331
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,479
-You haven't even tasted it yet.
-What's wrong?

1332
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,182
-It does smell American.
-It does?

1333
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,384
It has that American smell.

1334
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,119
It looks good, though.

1335
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,156
-Please mix it.
-Try everything.

1336
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,128
HOW IS IT?

1337
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,731
-Okay.
-Hmm?

1338
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,369
He doesn't say anything after eating it.
He's deep in thought.

1339
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,504
The two had the same response.

1340
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,773
A BITE OF BROCCOLI!

1341
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,376
What's he trying to find?

1342
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,510
What is it?

1343
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:51,414
-What is it?
-Everyone laughs after eating his dish.

1344
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,283
What's so funny?

1345
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,086
It could be either positive or negative.

1346
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,188
CHOI HYUN-SUK TRIES A BITE

1347
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:02,726
LAUGHING

1348
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,794
He's also laughing. Why are you laughing?

1349
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,063
Why are you all laughing?

1350
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,933
At least it's a dish
that puts a smile on their faces.

1351
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,702
Poong should open
a restaurant named Happiness.

1352
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,604
A place that makes people laugh.

1353
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:19,042
Everyone who tried the pasta is
responding the same way.

1354
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:23,546
When they eat it,
they fall into deep thought.

1355
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,315
STEP 2: BECOMES HAPPY

1356
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,517
Then, they all laugh.

1357
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,853
It's a dish that makes people laugh.

1358
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,122
Oddly, this has good balance.

1359
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:37,193
The pasta and mayonnaise create
great balance inside your mouth.

1360
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,365
But the moment you eat something else,
wondering if it's good, trouble begins.

1361
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,533
They don't mix.

1362
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,336
I see.
They must all stand out differently.

1363
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,104
Poong, did everything go as planned?

1364
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:49,839
Well…

1365
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,907
Yes.

1366
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,511
-Oh, no.
-So the plan didn't fall through?

1367
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,646
You said the ingredients
didn't mix, right?

1368
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,182
That had to be the case

1369
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,217
because he needed a little more salt.

1370
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,586
If he added more cheese,
he would've had the flavor down.

1371
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,088
-They would've mixed.
-Yes.

1372
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,924
It's now her turn to make a choice.

1373
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,527
Button one is for Sam Kim.

1374
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,163
Button two is for Kim Poong.

1375
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,632
Please press the button!

1376
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:16,866
-I did.
-You did?

1377
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,401
She pressed the button.

1378
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:21,638
I wonder which one she chose.

1379
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,740
Let's find out the result!

1380
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:27,010
This round was
"Can't you do it in one pan?"

1381
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,412
Will it be Sam Kim or Kim Poong?

1382
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:30,980
The two are in a tie, eight to eight!

1383
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,417
Who did Ji-won pick?

1384
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,085
Is it Sam Kim?

1385
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,821
Or is it Kim Poong?

1386
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,156
Who won? Show us!

1387
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,861
CHEF SAM KIM'S HA JI-WON PAN DISH
WINS

1388
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,863
There was no twist. Sam wins.

1389
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:52,068
There was no twist. Sam wins. My gosh.

1390
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,804
But I was very moved.

1391
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,908
It's not so easy
to cook with just one pan.

1392
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,377
It was a bit of a bummer for me

1393
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,879
because I also thought

1394
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:08,384
it would've tasted much better
if it had more cheese flavor.

1395
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,154
-It would've been even better.
-You love cheese.

1396
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,223
Thank you for the dishes.

1397
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,025
-That was the difference.
-It was.

1398
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:20,296
This means Poong now records
five losses in a row

1399
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:22,532
after the new start of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

1400
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,633
I'm so sorry.

1401
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:28,371
And the losing streak continues
with anyone using Sylvia.

1402
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,574
Sylvia doesn't have a star either.

1403
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,476
What will happen to Sylvia?

1404
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,378
Please put the star on him, Ji-won!

1405
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:39,549
Put one star on Chef Sam's chest.

1406
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,552
Sam Kim gets his second star!

1407
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,187
Congratulations!

1408
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,422
Ji-won chose Sam Kim!

1409
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:50,627
Here's the second round
with Ji-won's ingredients.

1410
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,396
These are Ji-won's avid fans.

1411
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,532
Mr. Braise, Chef Choi Kang-rok

1412
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:59,002
versus Mr. Anxiety, Chef Yoon Nam-no.

1413
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,438
-"Mr. Anxiety"?
-They're both Ji-won's fans,

1414
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,241
so along with a star,

1415
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:09,979
only the winner will get to take a picture
and an autograph from her.

1416
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:15,051
Chef Kang-rok,
I heard you became quite confident

1417
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,021
after winning a star last week.

1418
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,790
And your daughter was thrilled, right?

1419
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,160
-Is that right?
-Right. Yes. My daughter gets

1420
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,596
very obsessed about the result.

1421
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:31,568
She was really serious about it.

1422
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,337
I felt timid

1423
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,473
-as a father for the last few weeks.
-I see.

1424
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,976
-But I finally won.
-You did.

1425
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,711
Things are a bit better.

1426
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,113
What did your daughter say?

1427
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,616
"Great job."

1428
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,185
I guess she doesn't talk that much either.

1429
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,720
-"Great job"?
-Two words.

1430
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,591
Please leave a word with her
in this video message.

1431
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:57,660
-Ji-u.
-Ji-u is watching the show now.

1432
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,963
Ji-u is watching the show now.

1433
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,698
Don't take this show too seriously.

1434
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:05,935
A PIECE OF ADVICE
FOR HIS OVERLY SERIOUS DAUGHTER

1435
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:09,372
Your daughter is just happy when you win.

1436
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,375
She's sitting in front of the TV
to watch her daddy.

1437
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,212
She's probably going, "Let's go, Daddy!"

1438
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,748
This is a place in fantasy.

1439
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,717
-"Fantasy"?
-Yes.

1440
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,819
-Don't get too serious.
-It's not serious.

1441
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,854
-You may lose or win.
-Yes.

1442
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,756
He's telling her not to get too serious.

1443
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,124
-This is fantasy.
-So today…

1444
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:31,294
Chef Yoon Nam-no, you're up

1445
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,196
-for your debut match.
-Yes.

1446
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,831
You said it was a dream to be here.

1447
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:40,603
And you get to cook for Ji-won,
someone you loved as a teenager.

1448
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,772
I thought I wouldn't be nervous,

1449
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,140
but I'm so nervous.

1450
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:48,478
-I see.
-And my anxiety is acting up again.

1451
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,980
My eyes and hands are all trembling.

1452
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,048
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1453
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:56,252
Chef Kang-rok was someone
I personally looked up to.

1454
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,654
However,

1455
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,424
I'll consider this fight
with a hip-hop attitude.

1456
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,227
-Age isn't a thing in hip-hop.
-Not at all.

1457
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,361
That's cool.

1458
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,497
I may come off as arrogant,

1459
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:11,100
but I want to win against Kang-rok
in my debut match

1460
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,603
and go for two wins in a row.

1461
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,241
Before we begin,
Kang-rok is like his senior in the show.

1462
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,043
How about a piece of advice?

1463
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,177
GLANCING

1464
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,246
Welcome.

1465
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,714
Isn't it your first time
on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?

1466
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,550
Isn't it your first time
on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?

1467
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,822
"Welcome, isn't it your first time
on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?"

1468
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,324
I see. That was quite significant.

1469
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,360
It won't be easy.

1470
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,662
First of all, this is your debut.

1471
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,632
Only Chef Nam-no will get a perk.

1472
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,400
I'd like to start a minute early.

1473
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,369
-A minute early?
-Sixteen minutes.

1474
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,405
CHEF CHOI KANG-ROK'S INGREDIENTS:
ROYAL JELLY WITH HONEY, ONION JUICE

1475
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,574
LEMON JUICE, POMFRET, BASIL,
CILANTRO, LIME, LEMON, DILL

1476
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,410
Chef Kang-rok, what's your dish?

1477
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:57,146
HESITANT

1478
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,214
Gosh.

1479
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,486
Since When Has Steamed Dish Been
So Pretty, Ms. Gil Lime?

1480
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,657
Since When Has Steamed Dish Been
So Pretty, Ms. Gil Lime?

1481
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,259
Since When Has Steamed Dish Been
So Pretty, Ms. Gil Lime?

1482
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,131
-Not you, but steamed dish?
-Yes, a steamed dish.

1483
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,567
-You're making a steamed dish.
-It's a steamed dish.

1484
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,836
So what are you steaming?

1485
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,004
I'll steam a pomfret

1486
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,274
-with all kinds of herbs.
-Okay.

1487
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,577
-Pomfret.
-It'll be fragrant steamed pomfret.

1488
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,579
-Fragrant steamed pomfret.
-Yes.

1489
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:32,982
And you used the word lime,
so will you use limes too?

1490
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,752
Yes, I'll juice lime
a grain after another.

1491
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,425
I'll design the dish so that
you'll smell every drop of lime juice.

1492
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,661
This must be hard for him.

1493
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,196
Will he go on a winning streak?

1494
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,999
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS: OLIVE OIL,
MACADAMIA NUTS, ROSEMARY, ARUGULA

1495
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,101
WEBFOOT OCTOPUS, ALMOND, BASIL, LEMON,
LIME, BUTTER, CABBAGE, RADISH, DILL

1496
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,170
The dish I'm making is called

1497
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,605
Blind Radish Steak.

1498
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,540
-Blind Radish Steak.
-Blind Radish Steak.

1499
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:02,111
It must mean
he'll go at Chef Kang-rok blindly.

1500
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,347
There's a French dish
called fondant potatoes.

1501
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,049
I'll replace that with radish
and turn it into steak.

1502
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,519
-Radish?
-Radish steak?

1503
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,586
He'll grill radish.

1504
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:12,488
I'll also use
the webfoot octopus she caught

1505
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,091
with her favorites, cabbage and herbs

1506
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:19,162
and make an aromatic dish.

1507
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,863
It was a shame she didn't have <i>yuja</i>,

1508
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,565
so can you recreate the smell of <i>yuja</i>?

1509
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,468
You're telling me
to make <i>yuja</i> smell without <i>yuja</i>?

1510
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,703
I was just asking.

1511
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,507
I was just wondering
if you'd be able to do that, Chef Nam-no.

1512
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,410
-That's blind rage.
-Yes, that is.

1513
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,846
-He does show blind rage.
-Blind rage.

1514
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:41,617
Is there a chef you're more curious about
after hearing the names and descriptions?

1515
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:45,721
I'm leaning toward Blind Radish.

1516
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,758
He seemed to say, "I'm me."

1517
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:53,362
I think he'll cook something
very masculine. I'm curious.

1518
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,398
She's an action star.

1519
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,235
That's why she likes
such roughness and toughness.

1520
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,437
Kang-rok, she likes things rough.

1521
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,673
Give us the title of your dish
in a rough way.

1522
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,909
-Rough and tough! Be strong!
-Rough and tough!

1523
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,078
-He's going to faint.
-Rough and tough!

1524
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:13,015
It's Gil Lime!

1525
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,585
OH… OLD MAN…

1526
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,453
What's he saying?

1527
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,988
"It's Gil Lime!"

1528
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,625
-That's all he can do.
-"It's Gil Lime!"

1529
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,094
-He'll faint at this rate. Let's move on.
-Yes.

1530
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,563
I don't have much energy left.

1531
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,867
I have to keep enough energy for this.

1532
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,001
All right. Sorry about that.

1533
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:36,205
Then, let us begin the cook-off.

1534
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,041
Chef Choi Kang-rok plans to cook

1535
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:42,478
like an artisan and give Ms. Gil Ra-im
every taste he can give.

1536
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,513
He's up against this man

1537
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,450
who's no longer Mr. Anxiety,
but Mr. Bulldozer for his first love.

1538
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,552
Chef Yoon Nam-no is up.

1539
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:54,056
Which one of the two fans
will Ji-won choose?

1540
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:58,394
Chef Nam-no may begin first
with his one-minute perk.

1541
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,096
Please begin!

1542
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,564
You may begin a minute earlier.

1543
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,799
THE HA JI-WON FAN DERBY

1544
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,235
Chef Nam-no begins.

1545
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,071
-He shows his respect.
-Blind Radish.

1546
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:13,743
He must make good use
of the minute he got.

1547
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,144
-He works on the radish first.
-Yes.

1548
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,247
Chef Kang-rok must stay still
without moving.

1549
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,549
The radish pieces will turn into steak.

1550
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,319
-He's using just the center.
-Just the center.

1551
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,187
Radishes taste best in the middle…

1552
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,789
Why won't this come out?

1553
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,624
-It won't come out.
-Chef Nam-no.

1554
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,662
-I thought he'd grill it as a whole.
-Radishes take longer than you think

1555
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:35,264
-to get cooked. He's fighting time.
-The time?

1556
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,034
You have to cook radish
in the gentlest way to give it

1557
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,101
classy texture.

1558
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,971
It's not as appealing
if it tastes a little crunchy.

1559
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,775
-It's impossible to cook in 15 minutes.
-I see.

1560
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,111
-It's similar to braising.
-Yes, that's right.

1561
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,782
-It's like Chef Kang-rok.
-Why won't it come out?

1562
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:55,318
-Take it easy.
-Your time is almost up.

1563
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,153
-You have ten seconds.
-Ten seconds!

1564
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,588
-Already?
-Yes.

1565
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,223
ATTACKED

1566
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,659
What do you mean, already? Five. Four.

1567
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,262
-Three. Two. One.
-Three. Two. One.

1568
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,830
That's it. Chef Kang-rok, begin.

1569
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,565
Chef Kang-rok, begin.

1570
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,967
Chef Kang-rok begins too.

1571
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,002
You both have 15 minutes now.

1572
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,604
He begins with pomfret.

1573
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:20,142
It was caught on an island.
I got it from someone on an island.

1574
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,778
It looks fresh even to my eyes.

1575
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,547
A chef in Japanese cuisine, Choi Kang-rok.

1576
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:27,950
He has a knack for getting fish ready.

1577
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,785
Yes, it looks fresh.

1578
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:33,289
He said he'd steam it
instead of braising it. Steamed pomfret.

1579
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,624
I've only had braised pomfret.
This is a first.

1580
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,727
-Is it your first steamed pomfret?
-Yes.

1581
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,464
Chef Kang-rok is pouring his effort
into getting the pomfret ready.

1582
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,333
-I thought he'd use it as a whole.
-Right?

1583
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,770
-But he's filleting the fish.
-He's making fillets.

1584
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,171
He took it apart.

1585
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,741
Yes, he wasn't steaming it whole.

1586
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,011
I don't think the water is boiling.

1587
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,315
If you parboil it in warm water,
the fishy smell disappears.

1588
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,851
-That's a great tip.
-That's a tip.

1589
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,086
When we steam a whole fish
in Chinese cuisine,

1590
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,622
we keep pouring hot water over it first.

1591
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,760
I see. That was a wonderful tip.

1592
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,195
And Chef Kang-rok knew that!

1593
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,897
-Yes, I knew it too.
-Yes.

1594
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,701
"I know that much!"

1595
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,469
-We were teasing him too much.
-We were.

1596
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,238
-We're sorry.
-We apologize.

1597
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,473
-Sure.
-We agree with you.

1598
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,876
HE ADDS CUTS TO THE RADISH PIECES?

1599
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,978
Why are you making cuts?

1600
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,280
I want these to look like scallops.

1601
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,749
-Like scallops.
-Wow.

1602
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,518
-He adds that detail.
-Yes.

1603
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,852
He's making that image.

1604
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,088
It'll help the radish cook too.

1605
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:41,457
-Adding heat inside.
-And it'll be seasoned too.

1606
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,928
HE DOESN'T FORGET TO PERFORM

1607
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,065
4. PUT OLIVE OIL IN PAN, PUT RADISH IN,
CLOSE THE LID, AND GRILL

1608
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,300
He's grilling the radish.

1609
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:53,936
IS THAT THE LID?

1610
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,505
He's grilling the radish.

1611
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,307
HIS ANXIETY BUTTON GOES ON

1612
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,709
-He treats it like a baby.
-He's confused.

1613
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:02,178
Where's the lid?

1614
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,379
-He's confused.
-Where's the lid?

1615
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,214
-There it is.
-Here's why.

1616
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:08,517
-There it is.
-Boiling it brings it up to 100 degrees.

1617
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:12,521
Boiling water only goes up to 100 degrees,

1618
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,158
but that will go up to 180, even 200,
so it'll cook faster.

1619
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,295
I see. He's using a different way
to cook the radish.

1620
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,396
Butter?

1621
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:24,500
CHOI KANG-ROK DRIES THE POMFRET

1622
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,269
USING SALT

1623
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:33,509
ONE GRAIN OF SALT AFTER ANOTHER

1624
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:37,513
AN ARTISAN CHEF FROM JAPAN,
JUST LIKE AN ITALIAN DESIGNER

1625
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,682
He's shaping it before steaming.

1626
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:43,586
Did you put oil on it?
Or was it vinegar, Chef Kang-rok?

1627
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,654
-It was cooking wine.
-Cooking wine.

1628
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,057
He used that to get rid of the smell.

1629
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,391
He's getting rid of the fishy smell.

1630
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,460
-And it goes into a steamer.
-It's in.

1631
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:55,364
It goes into the steamer when we have
11 minutes and 50 seconds left.

1632
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,234
Whoa. Oh, my.

1633
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:02,138
4. PUT A BAMBOO MAT
OVER THE POMFRET AND STEAM

1634
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:05,274
That's the cabbage her aunt brought.

1635
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,943
The cabbage from Ji-won's aunt.

1636
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,646
-I love napa cabbage too.
-You do?

1637
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:13,048
I like both napa cabbage and radish.

1638
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:17,486
He chopped up the cabbage completely.

1639
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,955
Artist Poong also used some cabbage.

1640
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,924
But he wasn't chosen.

1641
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,326
How will he use the cabbage?

1642
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:27,096
Isn't it better to chop it up
instead of just throwing it in?

1643
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,697
Yes, right.

1644
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:30,733
GLANCING

1645
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,035
Why is the time flying?

1646
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,103
What's that?

1647
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,471
-Basil.
-Basil.

1648
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,106
-It's all about the fragrance.
-Yes.

1649
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,208
This round is titled, "Fragrant Jini."

1650
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:43,846
PASSIONATELY GETTING INGREDIENTS
READY AS HER BIGGEST FAN

1651
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,248
FOCUSED WITH HIS MOUTH CLENCHED

1652
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,383
It already smells good.

1653
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:51,020
-What's that? He uses lots of lemons.
-Lemon.

1654
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,655
He is adding a lot of lemon juice.

1655
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,191
What else did you put in
other than lemon and cabbage?

1656
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,961
Lemon and lime zest.

1657
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,665
I've never seen napa cabbage
cooked with basil before.

1658
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,201
Yes, he'll capture her with that first.

1659
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,638
-What's Chef Kang-rok using?
-What's that?

1660
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,041
-It's onion juice.
-Onion juice?

1661
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,944
-Yes, I saw it in the fridge.
-Yes.

1662
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,180
-Is onion juice different from onions?
-Isn't it the same?

1663
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,082
I thought everything in the fridge was

1664
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,985
something that the fridge owner likes.

1665
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,920
I see. Yes.

1666
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,423
That's the most logical.

1667
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:31,827
That way, it'll be much easier
to make some onion sauce.

1668
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:35,030
He can use that instead of sugar.
It tastes sweet.

1669
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:39,168
It takes a long time to cook onion
until it gives off the sweet taste,

1670
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,904
but the onion juice
already has that flavor.

1671
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,572
It'll taste very sweet
if you boil it down a bit.

1672
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,241
-He's trying to save time.
-Yes.

1673
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,443
-He's using lemon juice.
-Lemon juice.

1674
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:50,179
Yes, that's it. The blended lemon.

1675
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,748
Chef Kang-rok is also good with soy sauce.

1676
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:56,118
How will you use that sauce?

1677
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,822
-For the steamed fish?
-I'll steam the fish and pour this.

1678
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,258
You'll pour it over the fish?

1679
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:03,993
He's putting that in.

1680
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,194
You don't have to answer.

1681
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,163
-Royal jelly!
-Royal jelly!

1682
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,633
-He's using the royal jelly.
-It's going in.

1683
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:13,168
-That sauce seems healthy.
-Yes.

1684
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,437
I've never seen anyone use it in food.

1685
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:20,676
THE KITCHEN SHOWS
TWO DISTINCT ATMOSPHERE

1686
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:24,246
As we speak,
he pulls out some webfoot octopus.

1687
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,048
-The ones she caught.
-Yes.

1688
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,584
The ones she caught with her mother.

1689
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,352
You have ten minutes.

1690
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,754
You have ten minutes.

1691
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,522
That's crazy. Really? Ten minutes?

1692
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,691
Chef Nam-no is in panic.

1693
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,660
Don't say any swear words.

1694
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,295
I know you're in a blind rage
and is a maniac.

1695
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,763
-But you still can't swear.
-Of course not.

1696
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,465
Yes, the entire country is watching you.

1697
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,235
Reduce the heat.

1698
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,403
The butter is too…

1699
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,438
-Isn't it burnt?
-Shouldn't you start over?

1700
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,407
-No. Water.
-Is it okay?

1701
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,475
-It's okay so far.
-It looks fine now.

1702
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,778
-The center isn't cooked.
-It isn't.

1703
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,079
He's adding water.

1704
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,148
Why are you adding water?

1705
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,283
-To steam it.
-To cook it to the center.

1706
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,685
-I see.
-Steaming.

1707
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,353
-Chef Nam-no!
-Yes?

1708
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,855
You have to answer as you cook.

1709
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,157
Otherwise, cook alone at home.

1710
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,192
-I can't multitask.
-You have to answer.

1711
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,429
Do you think we talk as we cook
because we can multitask?

1712
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,364
You should go home and cook alone!

1713
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:17,132
I'll get mad if you don't answer.

1714
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,902
-All right.
-Okay. One second.

1715
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,337
This is bad.

1716
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,642
Sugar.

1717
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:28,877
IN A FRENZY

1718
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:34,083
HIS BREATH GETS
HEAVIER AND HEAVIER

1719
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:38,921
-He puts in a lot of work into the radish.
-Right?

1720
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,791
Hey, almonds. He's using almonds.

1721
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,461
She has to eat that with radish kimchi.

1722
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,564
-She had webfoot octopuses…
-Yes?

1723
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,300
…so I'll mix it with almond
like that squid and peanut snack.

1724
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,268
-Is that all right?
-Yes, that sounds delicious.

1725
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:56,739
She thinks it'll taste delicious, Nam-no!

1726
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,675
He's chopping the almonds into fine piece.

1727
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,712
Chef Nam-no is using macadamia nuts too.

1728
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,047
-Macadamia nuts?
-You had macadamia nuts?

1729
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:08,016
I see. Yes, she had peeled macadamia nuts.

1730
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:11,120
Those nuts will
mix with webfoot octopuses.

1731
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:17,793
8. SEPARATE EGG WHITES

1732
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,596
Choi Kang-rok gets green onion ready.

1733
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:23,599
HE PREPARES GREEN ONION

1734
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:26,402
Yes, Choi Kang-rok is
busy preparing green onion.

1735
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:30,072
There are 8 minutes and 20 seconds left
in this battle.

1736
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,809
It takes Kang-rok forever
to cut some green onion.

1737
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:36,979
-It takes you way too long.
-Eight minutes.

1738
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,547
Did she not have green onion juice?

1739
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:41,550
-No, she didn't.
-Chef Yeon-bok, don't be harsh.

1740
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,787
He gets too shaken up if you do.
Don't be too harsh.

1741
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,589
What will he do with egg whites?

1742
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,258
Well…

1743
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:50,325
TAPPING

1744
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:53,028
-Go back to what you were doing.
-Okay.

1745
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,263
He stops when you ask a question.

1746
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,433
He's adding
chopped green onion into egg whites.

1747
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,134
How will he use this?

1748
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,203
Will he make steamed eggs?

1749
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:05,207
I'll put it over the top and steam it.

1750
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,376
-You're steaming that too?
-I see.

1751
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,612
-On top of the pomfret?
-Yes, over the pomfret.

1752
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,214
-And he uses dill.
-Dill.

1753
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,451
I believe you'll be able to stand
this much fragrance.

1754
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,386
I see. It must have a strong smell.

1755
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,722
I think Chef Kang-rok
just put in cilantro.

1756
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:24,393
I put in all herbs she had in the fridge

1757
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,897
-to make a complicated smell.
-A complicated smell?

1758
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,434
Don't herbs make you dizzy
when it's mixed the wrong way?

1759
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:35,771
I was worried
it might end up too incoherent.

1760
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:39,575
But Kang-rok is sensitive
when it comes to that aspect.

1761
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,878
-You have five minutes left!
-Five minutes!

1762
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,780
THE ANXIETY BUTTON IS GOING OFF

1763
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,783
Jung-hwan, please go out to the field.

1764
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,652
This is the first experience
for Chef Nam-no.

1765
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,088
I can already smell all kinds of things.

1766
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,023
Let me smell the dishes first.

1767
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,494
Tell us which one smells better.
Just the smell for now.

1768
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,561
SIGHING IN MAXIMUM ANXIETY

1769
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,297
-You have 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
-The sauce.

1770
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:05,267
HE PULLS THE WEBFOOT
OCTOPUSES OUT

1771
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,202
SHAKING

1772
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,538
-Go over to Nam-no!
-Nam-no's octopus!

1773
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:13,175
-Webfoot octopus.
-Does the octopus give a smell?

1774
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,377
-Isn't it undercooked?
-No.

1775
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,179
-It's perfectly cooked. It's hot, damn.
-Is it?

1776
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,881
"Damn"?

1777
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,883
You should put on gloves.

1778
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,084
It had eggs in it.

1779
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,819
The webfoot octopuses were too hot.

1780
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,020
Does anything give off smell?

1781
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:27,856
All I can smell here is blind rage.

1782
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,125
He can't smell anything yet.

1783
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,393
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

1784
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,729
Look at Chef Kang-rok's sauce.

1785
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,197
-This one?
-Can you taste that?

1786
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,632
He hasn't even started.

1787
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,433
There are 3 minutes and 30 seconds left!

1788
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,969
-You have to taste something!
-They're running out of time.

1789
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,571
SMELLING THE SAUCE FIRST

1790
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,840
This smells like herbal medicine.

1791
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,209
That doesn't sound good.

1792
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,811
-This smells like herbal medicine.
-Gosh.

1793
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,046
That doesn't sound good.

1794
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,182
-A healthy smell and taste.
-Royal jelly and onion juice.

1795
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,685
Onion juice and royal jelly.

1796
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,153
They're also used in medicine.

1797
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,822
How does it taste in this situation?

1798
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,858
Let me have a taste.

1799
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,493
-Yes.
-What will it be like?

1800
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,131
Do you feel like singing, "Fragrant Jini"?

1801
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,499
-So?
-Yes?

1802
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,235
Do you feel like singing it?

1803
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,771
It's still herbal medicine.

1804
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,240
That sounds like a problem.

1805
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,042
It's still herbal medicine.

1806
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,244
-That sounds like a problem.
-Sugar.

1807
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:25,514
The onion juice is kind of strong.

1808
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,583
The onion juice wasn't mine.

1809
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:31,820
-It's my mom's.
-The onion juice was her mother's.

1810
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,956
-What's that?
-Starch water?

1811
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,223
He's adding starch?

1812
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:38,460
-It tastes like onion juice.
-Did he add too much juice?

1813
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,063
CHECKING ON THE STEAMED POMFRET

1814
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,265
-The pomfret.
-You have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1815
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,933
You don't have much time.

1816
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,102
You have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
The pomfret.

1817
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,371
He's putting it over the fish to steam it.

1818
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:52,708
Will egg whites and everything
get cooked within two minutes?

1819
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,076
-I'm not sure how it'll go.
-Gosh.

1820
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,945
Are you telling me to go away?

1821
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,547
No, I didn't say anything.

1822
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,282
-You didn't?
-Move aside.

1823
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,118
YOON NAM-NO PULLS OUT FOIL

1824
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,587
MOVING SWIFTLY

1825
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,222
HE MAKES A DISH

1826
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:13,161
11. PUT ROSEMARY INTO A FOIL DISH
AND PUT IT IN THE POT

1827
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,496
I hope the radish is done.

1828
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,733
The radish steak. Blind Radish Steak.

1829
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:21,136
He put radish in here
and some herbs too. Right?

1830
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,238
-Yes.
-Herbs and… He's burning it!

1831
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,940
-He's burning it!
-My gosh.

1832
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,742
She said she didn't like the smoky taste.

1833
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,411
-I like this kind of smoky taste.
-She likes this kind.

1834
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,981
-Because it's herbal?
-He puts the lid on it.

1835
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,349
How does it smell?

1836
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,752
This smells like sauna.

1837
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,788
It's like the steam sauna.

1838
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:45,027
It smells like herbal medicine and sauna.
It's amazing over here.

1839
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,496
Everything has a smell here.

1840
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:50,465
-I'm serious. You can smell it.
-That's true.

1841
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:53,235
It smells like an oriental apothecary.

1842
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,604
I'm craving some <i>sikhye</i>!

1843
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,205
I want to smell it too.

1844
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,976
-And some steamed eggs.
-Gosh.

1845
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,377
-It smells so good here.
-Yes.

1846
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,380
You have 1 minute and 25 seconds.

1847
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,516
Doesn't it smell like herbal medicine?

1848
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,017
It smells like sauna!

1849
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,787
It smells like sauna!

1850
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,890
It does, doesn't it? It smells like sauna!

1851
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,892
It's true. It smells like sauna.

1852
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:21,663
It feels like this when you drink
sweet cinnamon punch in a sauna.

1853
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:22,964
-Is that a sauna?
-Yes.

1854
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:26,168
It smells like herbal medicine
and a sauna at the same time.

1855
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,602
Yes, that's a sauna.

1856
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,471
You have a minute left.

1857
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,673
-Oh, no.
-Please hurry.

1858
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,009
You're running out of time. Nam-no.

1859
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,277
NAM-NO SERVES THE DISH

1860
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:40,282
HIS BREATH GETS
HEAVIER AND HEAVIER

1861
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:43,351
He put almonds in.
It must have a great texture.

1862
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:48,023
I'm the most worried
about this steamed dish.

1863
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,658
I wonder if it'll be done.

1864
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,259
He just put in some green onion too.

1865
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,528
-It'll be fishy if it isn't fully cooked.
-Yes.

1866
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:54,629
It'll taste really fishy.

1867
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:57,999
Chef Nam-no has a plan B on his dish,

1868
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,802
but that steamed dish is
the only one for Kang-rok.

1869
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:02,871
THE STEAMED POMFRET IS OUT

1870
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,306
Hey, wait.

1871
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,007
It's cooked!

1872
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,210
-You have 30 seconds left!
-You got 30 seconds!

1873
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,679
-It's too hot.
-Twenty-five seconds.

1874
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,014
-Oh, no.
-He pulls the radish out too.

1875
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,084
-Everything is out.
-The radish is out too.

1876
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:17,285
It's too hot.

1877
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,454
-Fifteen seconds!
-You have to ring the bell!

1878
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:20,622
-Okay.
-Ten.

1879
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:23,325
-Ten. Nine.
-Nine.

1880
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,360
-Eight. Seven.
-The sauce!

1881
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,229
-Six. Five.
-Six. Five.

1882
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,631
-The sauce!
-Seven. Six.

1883
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,299
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1884
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:33,468
-Three. Two.
-It's almost over!

1885
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,704
WHO'LL FINISH FIRST?

1886
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,939
-Three. Two.
-It's almost over!

1887
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,108
-One!
-He finishes first!

1888
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,643
Kang-rok finishes second.

1889
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,879
-Gosh.
-Chef Kang-rok finishes.

1890
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,680
No way.

1891
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,749
-Gosh.
-Did you taste the sauce?

1892
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,718
AMAZED

1893
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,086
-Okay.
-How is that possible?

1894
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:54,122
-They made that happen in 15 minutes.
-Both dishes are ready.

1895
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,223
Let's see what we have.

1896
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,325
-Please send it over.
-It smells great.

1897
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:58,660
It smells like herbal medicine.

1898
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,962
-It's like a Chinese cuisine.
-Yes.

1899
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:04,032
-It's like oriental herbal medicine.
-I told you.

1900
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,802
Gosh, how did they do this
in such a short amount of time?

1901
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,537
SNIFFING

1902
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,272
Does it smell like herbal medicine?

1903
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,073
It really smells like herbal medicine.

1904
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,310
Gosh, I forgot to top it with dill.

1905
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,013
You forgot the dill?
He forgot to top it with dill.

1906
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,448
-You forgot the dill?
-You can't do that now.

1907
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,751
That's why this is his first time.

1908
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,019
-Of course.
-But basil is in.

1909
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,288
Will the dill make a big difference?

1910
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:30,358
It would've been better
with webfoot octopus.

1911
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,460
Any thoughts after your first fight?

1912
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,063
-This is so stressful.
-He's stressed out.

1913
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,798
Four times as much as <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

1914
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:38,166
Four times the previous show.

1915
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,435
It's kind of hard when you talk to me.

1916
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,905
-They don't talk at <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>?
-No.

1917
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:45,640
But we do.

1918
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,509
Anyway, you really

1919
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,578
won't let me cut corners, not at all.

1920
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,047
-Of course not.
-You're done after 15 minutes.

1921
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:56,585
No, if you do more,
we'll give you a penalty.

1922
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:00,288
He made steak with radish.

1923
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,224
And he put webfoot octopus in

1924
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,125
along with lots of fragrant herbs.

1925
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,562
This dish was made by the Cooking Maniac,
Chef Yoon Nam-no.

1926
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,564
It's Blind Radish Steak.

1927
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,133
-May I smell it first?
-The smell first.

1928
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,469
She said it smelled like sauna.

1929
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,873
If you're into saunas,
you're 100% on this side.

1930
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,976
If you're into herbal medicine,
you're 100% on this one.

1931
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,043
-Really.
-Wait.

1932
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,311
Sauna versus herbal medicine.

1933
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,480
-I love the fragrant smell.
-It smells good.

1934
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,916
I already felt like I had a bite
after smelling it.

1935
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,151
She likes the fragrance.

1936
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,621
It looks like she's pleased.
That's the steak.

1937
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,256
I'm curious about the texture.

1938
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,157
I wonder if the radish was evenly cooked.

1939
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,827
The radish will be hot, so be careful.

1940
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,495
Be careful with the temperature.

1941
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,298
-I hope the radish is cooked well.
-It must be.

1942
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,699
If the texture isn't right…

1943
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,003
She's making a mysterious face.

1944
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,905
She looks down at the radish again.

1945
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,039
She's feeling the fragrance.

1946
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,675
The radish is

1947
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,277
filled with fragrance.

1948
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:57,679
The radish is full of smell.

1949
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:01,750
It didn't seem like
he seasoned the radish much.

1950
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:04,352
<i>At first, he grilled it in a pan,</i>

1951
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,121
<i>then he steamed it.</i>

1952
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,958
At the end, he burned herbs with
the radish to give it the smoky flavor.

1953
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,526
<i>-Yes, rosemary.</i>
<i>-You burned rosemary.</i>

1954
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,695
Was the radish fully cooked?

1955
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,264
It's soft on the outside,
but crunchy on the inside.

1956
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,167
-So the texture is kind of fun.
-I see.

1957
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:22,637
You can feel two textures at once.

1958
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:23,772
And the webfoot octopus.

1959
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:26,608
The webfoot octopus she caught
by the sea with her mother.

1960
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:29,911
It's like that squid and peanut snack,
so try it with some nuts.

1961
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,947
And you can finish up with cabbage.

1962
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,582
Finish up with cabbage.
Webfoot octopus and nuts.

1963
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:38,586
Will it taste good?

1964
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:41,790
-So? One more time.
-I need one more taste.

1965
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:46,761
-This makes things complicated.
-Nam-no should get anxious.

1966
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,698
"Should I not have used webfoot octopus?"

1967
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:54,769
This time, I topped it
with a little more almonds and nuts.

1968
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:59,574
Those gave the octopus
much more flavor in my mouth.

1969
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,642
It must be nutty.

1970
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,111
But it's the radish.

1971
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,981
I've never tasted
anything like this before.

1972
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:07,983
But it's really good.

1973
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,318
You had webfoot octopus,
but you wouldn't discuss that.

1974
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:14,289
She went back to the radish
and had another bite of it.

1975
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,690
-Does it mean…
-That was a good point.

1976
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,893
-I want another bite of the radish.
-Another bite of the radish.

1977
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,198
The webfoot octopus has no place
while that radish is around.

1978
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,600
It would've been bad
if he didn't have the radish.

1979
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:30,705
The radish also tastes great
with nuts and cabbage.

1980
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,241
The radish tastes good
no matter what you eat it with.

1981
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:37,312
The radish tastes good,
but the octopus gets in the way.

1982
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,615
There's a certain taste you imagine
when you think of webfoot octopus, right?

1983
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,752
There's a limit
to the kind of smell it can take.

1984
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:47,489
But it must be
because of what radishes are like.

1985
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,491
It took the smell in all the way.

1986
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,359
-It sucked it in.
-Yes.

1987
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:55,230
There's the flavor of radish
when you eat braised dishes,

1988
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,431
so how do they compare?

1989
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,867
-This is better?
-Yes.

1990
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:02,303
In Korean cuisine,

1991
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,940
braised radish will taste spicy outside,
then refreshing and juice inside.

1992
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,008
But this one

1993
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,978
contains the fragrance all over itself.

1994
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:14,049
Next, Chef Kang-rok's Since When Has
Steamed Dish Been So Pretty, Ms. Gil Lime?

1995
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:15,850
TENDER STEAMED POMFRET
WITH FRAGRANT SAUCE

1996
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:21,189
CHEF CHOI KANG-ROK'S SINCE WHEN HAS
STEAMED DISH BEEN SO PRETTY, MS. GIL LIME?

1997
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,059
Whoa, it's so pretty.

1998
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,126
-Is it?
-Yes.

1999
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:28,296
-Wait, this is called pretty, right?
-That's right!

2000
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,198
-It is pretty!
-This steamed dish is pretty!

2001
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:31,966
It's pretty!

2002
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,469
-It goes with the name.
-It's perfect with the name.

2003
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,237
It looks great.

2004
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:37,972
WILL IT SMELL PRETTY TOO?

2005
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,808
She smells it.

2006
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,209
He said it smelled like herbal medicine.

2007
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:43,411
No?

2008
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,213
-No.
-No?

2009
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,948
-What does it smell like?
-It smells good.

2010
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:50,385
-It smells so delicious.
-It smells delicious?

2011
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:54,889
-It smells so romantic.
-It smells romantic!

2012
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:58,093
-Kang-rok, you're a romantic!
-What are you looking at?

2013
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,063
-You're a romantic, Kang-rok!
-What was he looking at?

2014
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:05,733
Ji-won just said the dish was romantic.

2015
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,670
This kind of smell is satisfying
even without a bite.

2016
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,774
It smells so good as if I had some.

2017
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,845
I think the smell was
overwhelmingly better.

2018
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,446
How do I eat this?

2019
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,484
Pomfrets are also known as butterfish.

2020
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,220
-Really?
-It's that soft.

2021
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,555
So you should eat it with a spoon.

2022
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:28,957
Eat it with a spoon.

2023
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:32,393
-It's that soft.
-Yes, she uses a spoon.

2024
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,662
-She's taking a bite.
-Butterfish.

2025
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,464
-Yes.
-Steamed pomfret.

2026
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:38,700
GASP!

2027
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,535
It must be really good.

2028
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:41,903
She gasped.

2029
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,538
Look at that face.

2030
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:46,374
Where's the fish? I want more of the fish.

2031
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:48,977
-I wanted to eat a big bite.
-A big bite?

2032
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:51,513
-She keeps looking for more fish.
-Gil Ra-im.

2033
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,415
It may taste different
when you eat it with the fish.

2034
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,351
STARING

2035
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:57,418
OOF!

2036
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:02,457
She's staring at Chef Kang-rok
as she eats it.

2037
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:05,426
Your ears are brighter than most lights.

2038
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,762
-Yes.
-His ears are red.

2039
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:08,863
They're so red.

2040
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:11,533
His ears go red
whenever Gil Ra-im stares at him.

2041
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:14,302
You didn't season the pomfret, right?

2042
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:17,739
I salted it
and put some cooking wine over it.

2043
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:20,742
The mix of green onion, egg whites,

2044
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:24,179
the fish, and the sauce is

2045
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,314
-so good.
-It's so good?

2046
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,382
-Yes.
-Really?

2047
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:31,786
It tastes like a beautiful memory.
It tastes pretty.

2048
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:35,156
It reminds her of a beautiful memory.

2049
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,824
Keun-suk, do you want to try it?

2050
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,226
-I want to.
-Try some.

2051
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:40,461
-He goes for the radish first.
-Yes, try the radish.

2052
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,932
She said the radish tasted amazing.

2053
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,166
From a chef's point of view.

2054
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:49,037
HOW DOES BLIND RADISH STEAK TASTE?

2055
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,772
I wonder what they'll say.

2056
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,374
You made cuts on the radish, right?

2057
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:56,277
The fragrances are
all mixed into the cuts.

2058
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:59,280
The dead center

2059
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:01,816
isn't crunchy in a way
that makes you appalled.

2060
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,252
You can feel that crunchiness

2061
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:09,257
as the juice and the fragrance
fills up your mouth.

2062
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:11,292
I was worried about its bitterness.

2063
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,428
But he used the greener parts.

2064
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:15,663
Radishes have a green side
and a white side,

2065
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,266
and the white side is spicier,
whereas the green side is sweet.

2066
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:22,537
-That's why he used that part.
-He used the green part.

2067
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,572
Try the webfoot octopuses.

2068
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,608
Webfoot octopuses and nuts.

2069
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,846
The radish is cooked very well.

2070
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:38,720
The webfoot octopuses
taste exactly like how you expect.

2071
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:41,222
The radish has a fabulous smell.

2072
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,091
You said the same thing.

2073
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:46,628
How dare you try to hide
the webfoot octopuses behind the radish?

2074
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:48,763
Here's the thing with the octopuses.

2075
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,599
The webfoot octopuses

2076
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:52,867
-weren't seasoned.
-No.

2077
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,069
THE WEBFOOT OCTOPUSES
WEREN'T SEASONED

2078
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:59,874
The radish will stand out in this dish
with its fragrances and all.

2079
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,177
Next, Since When Has Steamed Dish Been
So Pretty, Ms. Gil Lime?

2080
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,782
Apparently, it smells nostalgic.

2081
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,617
-It's different from before.
-It is?

2082
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:11,786
-It's no longer herbal medicine.
-No, right?

2083
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:13,955
You sprinkled something at the end.

2084
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:18,059
The smell of lime will
make the dish smell unique.

2085
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,094
That was part of the plan.

2086
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:22,530
And there was green onion.

2087
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:25,700
That green onion helped neutralize
the medicinal smell.

2088
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:28,136
It felt like a trip back in time
like you see in animations.

2089
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:29,671
I'm living here now,

2090
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,939
but it feels like a dish
I'm eating back in time.

2091
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,842
-I think I get it.
-You do, right?

2092
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:38,012
It has that cheerful demi-glace flavor

2093
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,715
that reminds me of family restaurants
I went to as a child.

2094
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:43,651
-It's taking me back in time.
-Right?

2095
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,054
I feel like I'm going back to early 1900s.

2096
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:49,657
It tastes like a Western dish,

2097
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:53,494
but the texture is like
a mix of Japanese and Chinese cuisine.

2098
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,164
Overall, it has a wonderful balance.

2099
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,000
-I see. Right.
-Will it be romance or radish?

2100
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:01,803
-Romance or radish?
-Romance or radish?

2101
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:04,739
It's time for her decision.

2102
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:08,042
The chef chosen by Ji-won

2103
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,344
will receive a star

2104
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,014
and a photo with her right on the spot.

2105
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,717
This is so hard.

2106
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:19,320
The order was Fragrant Jini.

2107
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,023
Press one for Yoon Nam-no,
two for Choi Kang-rok.

2108
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:25,159
-Who will it be?
-The chefs can't look at her.

2109
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,295
I came here with no pressure.
Why am I so nervous?

2110
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,363
Yes.

2111
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:30,598
-Okay.
-Did you press it?

2112
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:31,933
She did.

2113
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:35,436
-It was so hard to choose.
-Was it?

2114
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:39,240
Let's find out which one Ji-won chose!

2115
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:43,678
Which chef's dish did she like more?

2116
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:46,481
A commemorative photo shoot is
also at stake.

2117
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:48,449
Will Chef Nam-no win his debut round?

2118
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:50,218
Will Chef Kang-rok win twice in a row?

2119
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:53,187
Who did Ha Ji-won choose?

2120
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:56,157
Which chef did she choose?

2121
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,327
Who's the winner?

2122
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,461
Why am I so nervous?

2123
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,933
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
BLIND RADISH STEAK WINS

2124
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,871
Yoon Nam-no! Yoon Nam-no wins!

2125
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:12,573
-Yoon Nam-no wins his debut round!
-Oh, no.

2126
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,543
-He won?
-That was a twist.

2127
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,513
His radish won against pomfret.

2128
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,783
-It was really hard to choose.
-I see.

2129
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:24,419
But the theme was fragrance.

2130
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:28,256
Chef Kang-rok's dish had a great balance,

2131
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:33,361
and I loved how the delicious flavor
took me back in time.

2132
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,931
But in this short while,
he cooked this tiny radish

2133
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:40,101
to feel like it was this huge

2134
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,636
the moment I had a bite.

2135
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:45,006
It was that intense.
That was absolutely delicious.

2136
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:47,775
He put a lot of work
into making it fragrant.

2137
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,178
Ji-won will put a star on him

2138
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:52,980
and do a commemorative photo shoot.

2139
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:55,416
-Don't go too far.
-Right out front.

2140
01:30:55,483 --> 01:31:00,655
This is his first star.
Ji-won puts the first star on him.

2141
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,725
Please stand there for a photo.

2142
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,861
One, two, three.

2143
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:09,597
I'M FINE

2144
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:11,599
-That was great.
-Thank you.

2145
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:12,800
Congratulations!

2146
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,236
<i>Nam-no, you're a big shot now!</i>

2147
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:18,105
It's showtime!

2148
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:20,308
He's the original show-off.

2149
01:31:20,374 --> 01:31:21,709
It was witty humor.

2150
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:23,277
-I'm having fun.
-You are?

2151
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:25,379
I've never thought
anything I had was spicy.

2152
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:27,114
I've never been drunk.

2153
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,183
He's never been drunk?

2154
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,451
Thai chili.

2155
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:32,320
I pop it in like a snack.

2156
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:34,789
-Gosh.
-You eat this as a snack?

2157
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:35,923
It's sweet.

2158
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:38,493
That was bluffing.

2159
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,662
<i>-He's so sexy!</i>
<i>-Look at that guy!</i>

2160
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,631
HE OVERWHELMS THE AUDIENCE
WITH HIS PERFORMANCE

2161
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:44,999
STANDING UP AUTOMATICALLY

2162
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:47,535
What is this? My gosh!

2163
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,837
<i>How did you do this in 15 minutes?</i>

2164
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,839
<i>I'll drop an A-bomb of spiciness.</i>

2165
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:53,641
<i>I'll make everything spicy.</i>

2166
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,611
-Have some milk!
-Drink milk!

2167
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,045
FROWNING

2168
01:31:58,112 --> 01:31:59,881
People are dying here!

2169
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,015
Did the bomb go off?

2170
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:03,818
-It's an A-bomb!
-It's an A-bomb!

2171
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:06,354
That's it. It's good now.

2172
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,055
HOW WILL IT SATISFY
SHOW-OFF KEUN-SUK'S PALATE?

2173
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:11,325
-It must be spicy.
-The spiciness hit him.

2174
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,827
<i>Are you crying?</i>

2175
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:16,964
Chef Sung-jun is almost done.

2176
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,967
-It's as if he went to a sauna.
-Why is he holding that bottle?

2177
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:34,382
