1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,917
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:21,588
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,656
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,993
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,599
-Hello. Welcome to the show.
-You're all so amazing.

6
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,634
Some say <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,169
isn't a cooking show,

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,539
but a show about different characters.

9
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,209
Many of our viewers began to consider
our chefs as different characters.

10
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,212
-First, we have the irreplaceable bluffs.
-The bluffs.

11
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,148
Hyun-suk and Sung-jun.

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,849
They're splitting images of each other.

13
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,818
-I'm against this.
-Why?

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,753
-Against this?
-I'm not a bluff.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,488
In animations, there are leaders

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,757
-that overpower everyone.
-Sure.

17
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:58,958
I'm like that.

18
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,027
This is why we call you a bluff.

19
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,430
-This is why.
-He never fails to deliver.

20
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,498
We also have other unrivaled characters.

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,668
-They sit in the realm of light and dark.
-Light and dark?

22
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,871
The exceptional male lead of a drama
and the perky female lead,

23
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,907
Jong-won and Poong.

24
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,876
He always dies laughing
whenever Poong begins to cook.

25
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,711
It's because
he's never seen a dish like mine before.

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,482
HE'LL SPEND ANOTHER DAY
ADDICTED TO PERKY POONG'S ANTICS

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,350
What's he doing?

28
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,452
Get something delivered.

29
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,455
Nothing good will come
from getting involved with Poong.

30
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,823
He's like stinky tofu.

31
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,591
Stinky tofu?

32
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,927
-Stinky tofu, you keep craving it.
-That sounds about right.

33
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,430
Please look forward to seeing
many more characters form in the future.

34
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,966
The guests we've invited today are known

35
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,337
for their extraordinary characters,
as remarkable as our chefs.

36
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,840
Let us present today's fridge owners.

37
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,274
Come on out!

38
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,145
WHOA, ALL RIGHT!

39
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,216
Please welcome
the two final boss-level actors,

40
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,285
Jo Woo-jin and Park Ji-hwan!

41
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,488
Slice this off.

42
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,557
He slayed the film industry
as Director Jo of<i> Inside Men.</i>

43
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,426
You must've been a hero in the past.

44
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,596
Then he slayed the drama scene
through <i>Guardian</i> and <i>Mr. Sunshine.</i>

45
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,132
<i>And today, he's here to slay</i>
Chef & My Fridge,

46
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,500
so please welcome Jo Woo-jin!

47
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,068
Hello, nice to meet you.

48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,570
WELCOME TO THE SHOW

49
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,873
-He has such presence.
-I'm already getting excited

50
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,575
-to meet them up close.
-I see.

51
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,845
-It's such an honor.
-He's already excited.

52
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,514
When he chopped off Lee Byung-hun's arm,

53
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,883
-it felt like he chopped off mine.
-It was so scary.

54
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,152
-He does this.
-This guy.

55
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,020
COPYING THE FAMOUS SCENE

56
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,023
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

57
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,258
He looked the same.

58
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,994
Did you use that?

59
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,862
SO SIMILAR THAT HE WANTS TO SEE HIS TOOLS

60
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,698
-Hey, put that thing away.
-He noticed it right away.

61
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,268
Put your knife away.
He will chop something off.

62
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,969
I'm good at noticing these tools.

63
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,305
-Hyun-suk looks scared.
-See? He notices.

64
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,174
-He hid his hands.
-He put his arm away.

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,142
ANOTHER FINAL BOSS AMONG THE ACTORS

66
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,443
It wasn't me.

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,846
<i>He played Jang Yi-soo of</i> The Roundup,
<i>a film franchise</i>

68
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,148
<i>-that grossed 40 million audiences,</i>
-You drive me crazy.

69
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,451
<i>as well as the seemingly cold</i>
<i>yet warm-hearted dad of</i> Our Blues.

70
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,389
-You crazy-ass punk.
-Please welcome Park Ji-hwan!

71
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,191
THE LOOK-ALIKE(?) WELCOMES HIM GLADLY

72
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,127
-This is awesome.
-He looks so cool.

73
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
It wasn't me.

74
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,897
HEY, THAT'S JANG YI-SOO!

75
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,066
Let's keep it down now.

76
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,936
-That was amazing.
-We're here with two excellent actors

77
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,972
-who add life to many Korean films.
-You're right.

78
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,742
Ji-hwan, I hear
the actor you admire the most

79
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,377
-is Woo-jin.
-Yes.

80
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,613
I always end up feeling moved

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,282
whenever I work with Woo-jin
in a production.

82
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,485
He's always very considerate

83
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,956
of other actors and staff members,
and he never leaves anyone hurt.

84
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,057
I always share my feelings.

85
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,560
-"You know I love and adore you, right?"
-My gosh!

86
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,028
I see.

87
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,897
He's the endearing type.

88
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,865
His real voice is different.

89
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't say that. No!

90
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,402
INCHING INTO JANG YI-SOO'S VOICE

91
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,804
-Is he older?
-Yes.

92
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,273
Is Woo-jin older by a lot?

93
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,909
-No, just by a year.
-By a year.

94
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,144
I know I tend to look much older.

95
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:09,649
There's a special reason
why they visited us here today.

96
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,285
<i>Boss,</i> a comedy action film,

97
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,321
is scheduled to premiere on October 3rd.

98
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,690
Most films about criminal organizations

99
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
are centered around the power struggle

100
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,894
to become
the boss of the organization, right?

101
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,863
But we played a contrarian move.

102
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,398
I'd like to resign.

103
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,267
-<i>No one wants to do it.</i>
-You don't want to be the boss?

104
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,268
-No.
-No.

105
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,403
<i>I'm the runner-up</i>
<i>as the potential next boss,</i>

106
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,207
<i>but I don't want to be the boss</i>
<i>to pursue my dream of becoming a chef.</i>

107
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,342
So I tell others to do it.

108
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,810
My character is…

109
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,911
Will you let me do it?

110
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,613
-No!
-No!

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,282
…a guy who's ready to give up my life.

112
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,084
-But the gang keeps telling me not to.
-Even if you want to?

113
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,654
I'm willing to give up even my limbs,
but they tell me to keep them.

114
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,890
That's how the film becomes comical.

115
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,358
-It sounds funny.
-It does.

116
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,460
-Let's watch it together.
-Do you want to?

117
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,463
I heard you were taught

118
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,434
by Chef Lu Chinglai
and Chef Park Eun-yeong for this film.

119
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,935
-Really?
-You were?

120
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,672
-Did you play a Chinese chef?
-For three months before the shoot.

121
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,507
It's been a while
since I've seen my teacher.

122
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,409
-I see.
-She's your teacher.

123
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,879
<i>I tried my best to learn</i>
<i>how to make noodles, use water, use fire,</i>

124
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,548
and and other basic skills.

125
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,584
He kept asking
how he should practice at home,

126
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,154
and actually went home
and came back after practicing.

127
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,588
I tried doing it at home,

128
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,590
and I didn't expect flour
to fly around everywhere.

129
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,893
That can happen at home.

130
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,328
I practiced for an hour,

131
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,163
but it took me four hours to clean up.

132
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,532
-It must take a while to clean up.
-Yes.

133
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,902
Why do you feel both grateful
and sorry to Eun-yeong?

134
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,137
Of course, I was awful
because I've never done it.

135
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,972
Naturally, I kept ruining the dough.

136
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,908
-Right.
-From the dough.

137
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,177
<i>I stayed focused on making the dough,</i>

138
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,846
<i>but later on, I realized someone had been</i>
<i>sweating next to me,</i>

139
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,315
trying to bring
the ruined dough back to life.

140
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,719
She was doing that
whenever I ruined the dough.

141
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,188
You were saving his dough by his side?

142
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,156
How did you honestly feel?

143
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,291
I thought,

144
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,760
"I hope he doesn't come tomorrow."

145
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,596
DANG IT… DON'T COME!

146
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,798
You hoped he wouldn't come tomorrow?

147
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,935
Chef Chinglai would say things like,
"Eun-yeong, light the stove."

148
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,371
-And I'd teach him how to light the stove.
-Light the stove?

149
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,840
He'd go, "Start chopping,"
then I'd teach him how to chop.

150
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,341
I remember doing that.

151
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,477
-Why didn't Chef Chinglai do it himself?
-Chef Chinglai?

152
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,046
Eun-yeong did the actual teaching.

153
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,648
He usually teaches just by talking.

154
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,384
Oh, my.

155
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,452
There's no discipline
in the world of Chinese cuisine.

156
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,254
He'd keep teaching me like that,

157
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,056
and always took a picture at the end.

158
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,325
THE PHOTO IS MINE

159
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,461
He'd just tell me what to do,
where to go, and this and that.

160
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,730
Then, after everything,
he'd go, "Time for a picture."

161
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,466
<i>-He loves to take pictures.</i>
<i>-He does.</i>

162
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,902
HE ALSO TOOK ONE HERE ON EPISODE 26

163
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,372
I hear you're also acquainted
with one of the other chefs.

164
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,974
It's Chef Jong-won.

165
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,809
-What?
-Chef Jong-won?

166
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:54,147
Has it been six or seven years
since I've been coming to your restaurant?

167
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,948
-Really?
-Yes.

168
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,383
It's a go-to on my wife's birthday.

169
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,786
You two must love his restaurant.

170
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,355
And over the last six to seven years,

171
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,893
I kept feeling like
his dishes continued to get better.

172
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,995
I thought,
"How come it's getting even better?"

173
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,730
He also visited my restaurant once before.

174
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,932
-Chef Nam-no?
-Yes.

175
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,067
But I only saw him once, never again.

176
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,137
You should've gotten better.

177
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,339
-He's so cool-headed.
-He's such a level-headed guy.

178
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,508
-You also came to my restaurant.
-What?

179
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,409
-Once?
-Chef Ho-young.

180
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,877
-Yes, he came by
-I've been there.

181
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,345
-to eat at my place.
-He came by.

182
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,814
-And that was the last time.
-It was?

183
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,515
WAS THAT THE CASE?

184
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,752
-He's such a scary guy.
-He's like a Michelin Guide inspector.

185
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,521
-You're way too rational.
-He's like a mystery shopper.

186
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,590
-It means there was no progress!
-Yes.

187
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,225
He tries it and goes,
"It's the last time."

188
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,328
I apologize.
I didn't mean to come off like that.

189
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,565
There's something Chef Jong-won told us.

190
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,234
-You said Woo-jin was such a romantic guy.
-He is.

191
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,702
-See?
-Is that so?

192
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,272
He came with his wife and daughter
and calls them a certain way.

193
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,242
-His daughter was Princess, of course.
-Princess.

194
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,544
And he called his wife, "My lady."

195
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,146
-My lady?
-My lady?

196
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,581
-My lady.
-My lady.

197
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,884
-I called her that since our dating days.
-Since when you two dated?

198
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,452
-I see.
-I'm jealous.

199
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,155
Does she call you her servant boy?

200
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,324
At times, she goes, "Hey, Woo-jin!"

201
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,159
WOO-JIN!

202
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,995
-Then I answer her and run over.
-I see.

203
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,931
It seems like there's another chef
you want to be acquainted with.

204
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,633
Who do you want
to be acquainted with today?

205
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,737
I was so glad to hear
that he'd be sitting next to me.

206
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,306
-It's Chef Hyun-suk.
-Chef Hyun-suk.

207
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,610
-My lady loves him so much.
-That's why.

208
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,713
When a fan visits my restaurant,
I offer a buy-one-get-one-free option.

209
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,014
If it's your first visit,

210
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,782
you get a free meal next time.

211
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,653
You can't start touting in the studio.

212
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,322
-You're a smart guy.
-Come on.

213
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,392
I've never heard of a restaurant
with a buy-one-get-one-free offer.

214
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,562
We've never heard of it before.

215
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,097
I'll continue to get better!

216
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,565
I also have sad news to share.

217
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:56,669
He's been living his life
while missing his wife and daughter.

218
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,603
He even has to howl.

219
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,971
AWOO

220
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,439
He has to do that.

221
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,875
-They're abroad right now.
-They are?

222
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,877
-My wife and daughter
-Right.

223
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,246
left abroad for my daughter's studies,

224
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,749
-while I live here alone.
-That's the sacrifice a father makes.

225
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,118
That means your fridge…

226
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,820
-I'm starting to get worried.
-You're right!

227
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,057
-Have you ever seen anyone
-Yes?

228
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,660
with such few ingredients stored outside?

229
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,296
-He doesn't have much at room temperature.
-That's way too little.

230
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,565
I'm feeling anxious.

231
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,601
As you just mentioned, these are all
for the room temperature ingredients.

232
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,136
Three mini tubs of dried laver,

233
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,506
and this one is seafood soup stock.

234
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,341
He doesn't have a lot.

235
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,244
-He must have lots of fresh ingredients.
-Of course.

236
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,648
Let's find out
what Woo-jin keeps in his fridge.

237
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,884
-We present his fridge!
-His fridge!

238
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,954
What? Wait a minute.

239
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,455
-It's an emergency.
-This is bad.

240
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,591
-We present his fridge!
-His fridge!

241
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,926
What? Wait a minute.

242
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,562
-It's an emergency.
-This is bad.

243
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,664
My gosh. Look at this.

244
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,434
THE CHEFS ARE IN A COMMOTION

245
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,403
HE CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES

246
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,738
I CAN'T WATCH THIS…

247
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,341
-It's the emptiest yet.
-It's like my house.

248
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,476
It's been a while
since we've had one like this.

249
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,245
-Goodness. It's breaking my heart.
-It is.

250
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,949
Woo-jin begins to dab tears.

251
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,285
-There's nothing.
-I expected some Chinese food ingredients.

252
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,320
Right? I was looking forward to it.

253
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,688
-He doesn't even have flour.
-I'm sad.

254
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,725
Did you learn how to cook
only for the movie?

255
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,061
Yes, well, I made something
for my daughter once, but…

256
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,396
-And?
-Well…

257
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,032
She never asked for it again…

258
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,967
-She didn't want it?
-…ever since that day.

259
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,702
GOODNESS…

260
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,038
She said, "You're the worst cook."

261
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,609
-I see. So she gave you a bad review.
-She did.

262
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,611
-Can I drink some of that now?
-Which one?

263
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,080
-What?
-He has a bottle of wine.

264
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
I'm suddenly craving a drink.

265
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,183
He still has something.

266
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,586
-Do you have a light drink after work?
-I do.

267
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,755
But you'll need a bar snack with this.

268
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,757
-That's it.
-The dried laver.

269
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,825
THESE WERE WINE SNACKS

270
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,328
-He's breaking my heart.
-Please don't do this!

271
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,330
-I can't look at him.
-It'll be harder on you.

272
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,165
You'll see some salted clams there.

273
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,700
-Salted clams?
-This one.

274
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,670
I eat that with instant rice,

275
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,740
wrapping it in sheets of the dried laver.

276
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,542
A LONG-DISTANCE DAD'S SAD FRIDGE

277
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,145
Don't do that when you get hungry.

278
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,547
-I guess you must like salted clams.
-I do.

279
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,484
It's something I get
from my favorite codfish soup restaurant.

280
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,055
It takes a while for the soup to come out
after you order, right?

281
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,657
I had two bowls of rice with that
before the soup came out.

282
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,094
-You must like it a lot.
-I rarely eat that much rice,

283
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,596
-so that's how good they are.
-I see.

284
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:41,133
That's why he eats this
when he gets snacky,

285
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,104
-salted clam with rice and dried laver.
-The more I talk, the more awkward I feel.

286
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,174
-Five bananas on the top shelf.
-Five bananas.

287
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,508
He still has kimchi.

288
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,411
-He has some.
-Yes, right? He has some kimchi.

289
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,947
-What a relief.
-Yes, he has some kimchi.

290
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,749
CABBAGE KIMCHI

291
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,451
-You haven't touched it.
-Two heads.

292
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,986
I eat kimchi about once a month at home.

293
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,455
He doesn't eat it often.

294
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,490
My mother-in-law gives me a whole batch.

295
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,093
-So this is from your mother-in-law?
-Yes.

296
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,228
What's in here?

297
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,030
-Goodness.
-Young radish kimchi.

298
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,567
-I can see that you ate a piece.
-I guess so.

299
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,570
-He had one. He cut it up and had a piece.
-I did.

300
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,438
Is this from your mother-in-law too?

301
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,575
-That's onion pickle?
-Onion pickles, I see.

302
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,543
My wife made them.

303
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,712
-They were made by your wife.
-You must like these.

304
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,147
-I love pickles.
-I guess so.

305
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,849
Not only is it good with rice,

306
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,451
but it's really good as a snack with soju.

307
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,452
GULP

308
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,254
He just swallowed hard.

309
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,956
He knows what these taste like.

310
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,958
Do your lady and you have
different taste in food?

311
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,661
-My lady is definitely into Korean food.
-For your lady.

312
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,030
She likes spicy
and stronger-tasting dishes,

313
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,167
-while I don't have a preference.
-Anything goes.

314
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,035
But there's nothing
to prefer in particular.

315
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,139
There's nothing to prefer in here.

316
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,340
You're right about that.

317
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,843
And next, some sauces.

318
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,447
Perilla oil, perilla powder,
salted anchovy sauce, and oyster sauce.

319
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,382
-All we need is oyster sauce.
-What's this?

320
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,217
-That's a Chinese cuisine ingredient.
-Yes.

321
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,387
-This is peanut butter.
-Yes, right.

322
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,658
Wait a minute. Look at these plastic bags.

323
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,060
Those black plastic bags
are really suspicious.

324
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,897
-We see those in movies.
-They appear in movies.

325
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,300
We often see these black bags
in the movies.

326
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,204
-We'll check them out in a bit.
-Yes, later.

327
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,705
I want to approach cautiously.

328
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,741
Let's look through the freezer.

329
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,111
I found some <i>tteokgalbi </i>here.

330
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,479
This is…

331
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,181
What are these snacks?

332
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,916
-They're not snacks.
-Pork cutlet?

333
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,885
-My Princess loves them.
-Chicken nuggets.

334
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,487
-Nuggets?
-That brand is delicious.

335
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,022
-I can eat like 40 of those.
-You pig.

336
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,390
What, you eat 40 of them?

337
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,292
Without any rice, I can do 40.

338
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,928
Things like this break my heart.

339
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,064
I found one lump of croissant
wandering around.

340
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,699
-My gosh.
-What's this?

341
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,367
It was on the door.

342
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,203
-It's bread.
-It is.

343
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,173
My daughter loves the bread served
at Chef Jong-won's restaurant.

344
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,441
I see.

345
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,311
-So he gives us some to go after we eat.
-Is that the bread?

346
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,446
-Is this bread from your restaurant?
-Yes.

347
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,714
It's nice to see it here.

348
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,648
-Is it good?
-Yes.

349
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,251
Does this mean Ho-young
and Nam-no's bread weren't so good?

350
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,087
You've only been
to their restaurants once.

351
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,689
-I guess it wasn't good.
-Right?

352
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,858
-He's just too far away from my place.
-Sure.

353
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,126
Yes, it's a little far.

354
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,795
-Let's stop here.
-All right.

355
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,630
LET'S QUICKLY MOVE ON

356
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,366
We should take a look at these
before we wrap up.

357
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,301
-Yes.
-What's in the black plastic bags?

358
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,404
-Man.
-Man. What's in here?

359
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,173
I feel a bit cautious.

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,574
My gosh!

361
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,009
-All right.
-What's wrong?

362
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,245
-Does he have canned food?
-There are three different bags.

363
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,679
-What?
-Don't scare us like that.

364
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,248
-Is this…
-Is there something inside?

365
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,083
Wait a second. Let's see what this is.

366
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,050
Why? What is it?

367
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,986
-What is that?
-What's that?

368
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,487
-Why is it so wet?
-It's dripping.

369
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,056
-Something must be inside.
-What is it?

370
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,460
-I see.
-What's this? My gosh.

371
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,629
-He had something.
-What are those?

372
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,897
-Abalone.
-It looks good.

373
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,064
-Seafood?
-Scallops.

374
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,301
-Shrimp and squid.
-That's a lot.

375
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,335
-And mussels.
-Mussels.

376
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,870
-That's a lot.
-Squid.

377
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,438
He has lots of seafood.

378
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,776
-Do you hide these before you eat them?
-No, not at all.

379
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,145
Why do you keep them in here?

380
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,917
I really felt bad about bringing
my empty fridge to the show,

381
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,719
-so I actually bought it all.
-You did?

382
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,854
He bought them in a hurry.

383
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,757
My wife and daughter

384
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,127
-can't and won't eat seafood.
-Is that so?

385
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:33,832
I enjoy the smell and texture
you can you get from seafood,

386
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,337
so I brought the ingredients I could buy
and keep in there while they were away.

387
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,873
I see. Now I understand.

388
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,142
-He had been craving it.
-Yes.

389
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,710
-So he loves seafood.
-He does.

390
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,279
I see. Look at this.

391
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,881
-Veggies.
-He has veggies.

392
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,683
You also have veggies.

393
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,018
-Some veggies. Did you also…
-Did he buy those too?

394
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,920
Does your lady not like veggies?

395
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,188
-Veggies…
-Is it just you?

396
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,890
She loves morning glory.

397
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,893
-Your wife? Her favorite, morning glory.
-Yes.

398
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,328
What's your favorite?

399
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,497
You'll see that I brought some cilantro.

400
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,167
-Cilantro. Do you like cilantro?
-Cilantro.

401
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,271
I even like to eat it raw
once it's washed clean.

402
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,505
It's because I was born

403
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,673
in the Year of the Horse.

404
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,710
-You were born in the Year of the Horse?
-Yes, I'm a horse.

405
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,445
Right. Horses do love veggies.

406
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,481
-I can eat a ton of it.
-Good for you.

407
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,683
Eating lots of veggies is good for you.

408
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,318
The last bag.

409
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,122
-You also have some meat.
-I used to love beef a lot.

410
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,591
That was the somewhat lonesome fridge

411
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,761
Woo-jin brought for us today.

412
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,897
THE ROMANTIC LONG-DISTANCE DAD,
WOO-JIN'S FRIDGE

413
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,735
I wonder what kind of dishes
Woo-jin is looking for.

414
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,504
These are his orders. Let's find out.

415
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,740
-A dish for my lady.
-A dish for my lady.

416
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,274
-He's such a romantic.
-I'm jealous.

417
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,777
He doesn't forget his lady even now.

418
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,813
I've never cooked
a proper meal for my lady,

419
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,485
so I wanted to use this opportunity
to learn to make a delicious dish

420
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,488
that isn't too hard to make

421
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,291
in order to surprise her.

422
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,427
A dish you can make for your wife.

423
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,828
What's the second order?

424
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,431
A seafood dish behind my lady's back.

425
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,566
Yes, you mentioned seafood before,

426
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,402
and kept them in a black plastic bag.

427
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,738
When I eat out
at a delicious spot with my colleagues,

428
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,342
I feel bad
for eating something so good all alone.

429
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,845
But I don't feel as bad if it's seafood,
because my wife can't eat that.

430
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,150
-She doesn't like it anyway, right?
-Yes.

431
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:36,155
So I wanted to ask you to make something
I could have while she isn't here.

432
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,756
A dish just for Woo-jin.

433
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,659
Let's give the first choice to Eun-yeong,

434
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,228
who is as good as Woo-jin's teacher.

435
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,898
I'll fill the order
for a seafood dish behind his lady's back.

436
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,668
-A seafood dish.
-Chinese cuisine uses lots of seafood.

437
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,438
-Chef Jong-won?
-We should give him a chance too.

438
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,673
"A seafood dish behind my lady's back."

439
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,308
-Really?
-I see!

440
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,545
We're about to see the seafood battle.

441
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,980
Eun-yeong and Jong-won
have already decided.

442
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,683
You'll now have to cook for his wife.

443
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,652
Shouldn't married men do it?

444
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,220
-Married men?
-Jump in, romantics.

445
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,223
-Ho-young is a romantic too.
-Jump in if you're a romantic.

446
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,394
I also am a long-distance husband who goes
back and forth between Seoul and Jeju.

447
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,230
-Yes, you were a long-distance couple.
-I am.

448
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,666
I think I know how he feels,
so I'll jump in.

449
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,935
-All right. Anyone else?
-Thank you.

450
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,070
Where's another romantic? Jump in.

451
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:29,241
-Anyone? Any romantics?
-I'll jump in.

452
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,644
-Poong, are you a romantic?
-Dang it. I missed my chance.

453
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,414
Poong is also a romantic,
and he beat you to it.

454
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,815
I wanted to give others a chance,

455
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,953
but I'm the cook at my home,
so I thought I should do it.

456
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,055
-My gosh.
-That's the case.

457
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,458
Then let us begin the round
between Ho-young and Poong!

458
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,832
<i>We're here to use Woo-jin's ingredients</i>
<i>to fight this first round.</i>

459
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,802
The boss of the Binge Eating Gang,
Chef Jung Ho-young,

460
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,639
is up against the boss
of the Bizarre Food Gang, Kim Poong.

461
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,074
-My gosh.
-Okay.

462
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,709
The two of them

463
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,178
are both in second place
for total wins on the show.

464
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,681
The current first place
is Chef Hyun-suk with 12 wins.

465
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:15,487
This is a chance for one of you
to rise up as the sole second place.

466
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,557
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
STRIP LOIN, PERILLA POWDER, RADISH

467
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,726
PERILLA LEAVES, SSAMJANG, PEANUT BUTTER,
BROTH TABLET, OYSTER SAUCE, ANCHOVY SAUCE

468
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,928
The name of my dish is

469
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,464
Choi-esque Pasta.

470
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,533
-Choi-esque Pasta?
-Choi-esque Pasta?

471
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,468
-Yes.
-What do you mean by Choi?

472
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,570
Are you talking about Chef Hyun-suk?

473
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,005
-That's right.
-I see.

474
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,373
He already said

475
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,877
-his wife was a fan of Chef Hyun-suk.
-Yes, she is.

476
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:43,448
One of his signature dishes
is fresh handmade pasta

477
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,385
<i>-he makes right on the spot.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

478
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,588
I wanted to try re-enacting that today.

479
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,889
You'll make fresh pasta?

480
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,358
Yes, I will make fresh pasta.

481
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,726
There was a type of pasta

482
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,931
Chef Hyun-suk made before,
the spiral-shaped one.

483
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,332
<i>That was a tough one.</i>

484
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,368
I want to make use of the concept

485
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,705
-and turn them into donut shapes.
-Donut shapes?

486
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,274
-Can I think of it as <i>sujebi </i>with holes?
-That's right.

487
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,310
I saw that he had perilla powder,

488
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,612
so the pasta would end up
tasting like perilla <i>sujebi</i>.

489
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,880
I love that.

490
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,482
If there's enough time,
I'll also grill some steak.

491
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,651
-If you have time?
-On top of that,

492
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:24,590
I'll also make peanut butter <i>ssamjang</i>
on the side if I have enough time.

493
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,858
-I see.
-You said she liked meat.

494
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:30,329
-He's right.
-One more thing. I have Choi's knife.

495
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,631
-Did you borrow it from him?
-I did.

496
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,634
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS: PORK RIB CAP,
STRIP LOIN, YOUNG RADISH KIMCHI

497
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,869
MORNING GLORY, CROISSANT,
OYSTER SAUCE, BROTH TABLET

498
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,772
Up against him is Chef Ho-young.
What are you making?

499
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,376
She'll probably crave Korean food the most
when she returns from abroad.

500
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,713
I saw that you had strip loin
and pork rib cap, so I'll use them

501
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,549
-and make crispy bulgogi.
-Crispy bulgogi?

502
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,319
You also said she liked morning glory,
so I'll parboil them

503
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,855
and season them as a side dish.

504
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,159
Lastly, you had young radish kimchi,
so I'll chop them finely

505
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,396
and make young radish kimchi fried rice.

506
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,731
My gosh.

507
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,000
Not only do they taste great,

508
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:12,037
but I also want to present them
by making many different heart shapes.

509
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,773
-That's what he's doing.
-It doesn't sound easy.

510
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,343
The winner of this battle

511
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,145
will get a star, as always,

512
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,682
but to celebrate Chuseok,
you'll get the highly anticipated prize,

513
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,119
the Spam set, gold-bar edition.

514
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,387
I love that.

515
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,088
-I want that.
-We wanted to celebrate

516
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,990
-the holidays with the chefs.
-I want it too.

517
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:37,262
Now, let us fill Woo-jin's order,
"A dish for my lady."

518
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,199
-When the clock ticks,
-I can't believe I'm seeing this.

519
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,235
-there is no going back.
-Tell me about it.

520
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,171
The long-distance husband
from Yeonhui-dong, Chef Jung Ho-young,

521
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:50,075
versus a guy who'll be Hyun-suk today,
Woo-jin's wife's favorite,

522
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,144
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

523
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,048
Which one of them will capture
the heart of Woo-jin the romantic?

524
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,418
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

525
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,387
All right!

526
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,090
-Do they really get only 15 minutes?
-That's it.

527
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,692
May I go back and forth to see them?

528
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,760
Yes, feel free to do that.

529
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,430
You have to watch and learn the recipe.

530
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,831
Begin!

531
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,366
THE ROMANTICS ARE UP

532
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,637
MORNING GLORY

533
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,206
-Is that morning glory, Ho-young?
-Yes.

534
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,674
I'm parboiling morning glory.

535
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,811
Poong, why didn't you choose
to use some morning glory?

536
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,280
He's using broth tablets.

537
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,283
IS HE USING HYUN-SUK'S KNIFE?

538
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,886
If he's going to cut onions like that,
he could've used his own knife.

539
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,923
-That's not my knife.
-It's not?

540
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,591
-No, it's not.
-That's not it.

541
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,727
-That's not Hyun-suk's knife?
-No.

542
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,995
I must be careful with his knife.

543
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,465
-He'll use it at an important moment.
-At an important moment.

544
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,799
What's he doing?

545
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,701
1. MIX BROTH WITH OYSTER SAUCE,
ANCHOVY SAUCE, PERILLA POWDER

546
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,037
-How will he use the broth?
-What is that?

547
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,739
He said he was making perilla <i>sujebi</i>.

548
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,841
-It must be the soup base.
-For the pasta?

549
00:22:55,907 --> 00:23:00,112
-He'll make it similar to perilla <i>sujebi</i>.
-With soup, right?

550
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,914
1. CHILL PARBOILED MORNING GLORY OVER ICE

551
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,016
Chef Ho-young
finishes cooking morning glory.

552
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,386
CROISSANT

553
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,254
-He's using the bread?
-If he's going to cut…

554
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,590
Ho-young is grinding something.

555
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,392
-What is it?
-What's he using?

556
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,026
-Bread and something.
-Bread and meat.

557
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,128
Bread and meat?

558
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,496
What's he going to do?

559
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,630
Crispy bulgogi.

560
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,366
Do you usually grind bread with meat?

561
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,136
-If you mix breadcrumbs with meat,
-Oh, breadcrumbs.

562
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,071
it becomes easier to mold.

563
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,206
-He ground everything at once.
-He did.

564
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,008
Gosh, that's so new.

565
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,077
He's making a special soy sauce.

566
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,946
Two soy sauce, one cooking wine,
one sugar, and one oyster sauce.

567
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,649
-I see.
-He's so kind.

568
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,951
Two soy sauce, one cooking wine,
one sugar, and one oyster sauce.

569
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,620
THE ROMANTIC'S BRIEF COOKING LESSON

570
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,121
ADDING SOME MINCED GARLIC TOO

571
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,824
He's so kind.

572
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,225
How will he use…

573
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,563
He's mixing the sauce
with the ground meat.

574
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,632
-Potato starch.
-Starch.

575
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,567
-That way, it becomes thicker.
-Yes.

576
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,403
AS ALWAYS, USING GREEN ONION…

577
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,407
Poong is grinding
the green part of green onion.

578
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,110
-He's grinding green onion?
-Just the green part.

579
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,980
I used green onion water
to mix the dough last time.

580
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,850
Yes, I remember that.

581
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,885
That's how the recipe is Choi-esque.

582
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,321
But he has to use that liquid quickly,

583
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,656
because it thickens like jelly.

584
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,024
Because of its sap?

585
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,759
-Does he know that?
-He ground it.

586
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,861
Yes, he ground the green onion.

587
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,230
-That thickens quickly.
-It thickens quickly.

588
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,199
-Hurry up.
-Were you aware, Poong?

589
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,467
What now?

590
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,303
-That thing thickens quickly.
-What thickens?

591
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,638
-The ground green onion.
-The green part.

592
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,106
HE COULDN'T CARE LESS…

593
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,042
He's mixing it with flour.

594
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,076
Will it grind that?

595
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,878
And he mixes everything again.

596
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,046
Yes.

597
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,515
3. MAKE GREEN DOUGH
WITH GREEN ONION LIQUID AND FLOUR

598
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,487
HO-YOUNG GRINDS BROTH TABLETS

599
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,121
What's he doing?

600
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,657
It seems like
this is a battle of blenders.

601
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,459
Chef Ho-young,
are you making the side dish?

602
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,194
Yes, I just seasoned some greens.

603
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,397
It's his wife's favorite, morning glory.

604
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,166
TASTING

605
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,034
IT TASTES GREAT

606
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,205
-His dough…
-That's really cool.

607
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,774
…needs to be ready soon
to let it cook longer.

608
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,310
But he doesn't have it ready yet,

609
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,979
so he may end up without any pasta.

610
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,815
He might end up with just steak.

611
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,884
They've spent four minutes already.

612
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,553
Time flies even faster
when I'm in the studio.

613
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,221
-Right?
-It's flying.

614
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,756
We don't pause the time for them.

615
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,791
The clock just ticks and ticks.

616
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,496
He's using a heart-shaped mold on the pan.

617
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,465
-It's a heart-shaped mold!
-It's a heart.

618
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,201
I'm going to cook the meat
in this heart-shaped mold.

619
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,037
He's going to press the meat
and fill the mold.

620
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,372
-In an actual heart shape?
-Yes.

621
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,742
He's shaping crispy bulgogi
into a heart shape.

622
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,578
That's Ho-young showing his romantic side.

623
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,812
HOW'S THIS MR. ROMANTIC DOING?

624
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,114
The dough looks good.

625
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,916
-Did it turn out nicely?
-It did.

626
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,651
He kneaded two different kinds.

627
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,019
He's really quick, though.

628
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,854
He has to turn them into spirals.

629
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,123
How will you turn it into a spiral shape?

630
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,091
It got stuck together.

631
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,428
His hands are trembling
as he puts two pieces of dough together!

632
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,931
-You need… powder…
-You need more flour.

633
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,934
He still doesn't have the dough
at five minutes past.

634
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,169
-It's too thin. It's stuck on his hands.
-Is it?

635
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,605
Yes, the dough is stuck on his palms.

636
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,973
Are you doing okay, Poong?

637
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,274
I'm fine!

638
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,310
-Are you?
-I'm okay!

639
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,178
-Here I go!
-He's still full of energy.

640
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,681
-It looks sleek.
-He uses a rolling pin.

641
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,082
-It turned out nicely.
-to push it out.

642
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,951
If Choi Hyun-suk can do it, so can I!

643
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,352
CHOI CAN? I CAN!

644
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,288
"If Hyun-suk can do it, why can't I?"

645
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,123
That means Woo-jin can do it too!

646
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,659
-Then Woo-jin can do it too.
-Of course.

647
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:39,297
He mixed two different kinds of dough
and pushed it flat.

648
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,699
Why did you take my knife?

649
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,634
I need water.

650
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,970
-You're putting water on it?
-What?

651
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,137
Okay.

652
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,640
-Poong rolls the dough with a green onion.
-He's rolling it with a green onion.

653
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,242
-He's using a green onion?
-Wait!

654
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,979
Is he rolling it
with a piece of green onion?

655
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,749
He's trying to make a hole in the middle
by pulling it out later.

656
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,484
I guess that's why they'll be like donuts.

657
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,653
-That's not a part of your dish?
-No.

658
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,190
-So the green onion is just a tool?
-It is.

659
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,492
-It just shapes the dough.
-That's right.

660
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,461
Will that turn into crispy bulgogi?

661
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,595
Are you having fun?

662
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,765
OF COURSE, I'M HAVING FUN

663
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,734
You have 8 minutes and 20 seconds left.

664
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,135
-Time's flying.
-It's 8 minutes and 20 seconds.

665
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,770
He's chopping young radish kimchi.

666
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:22,507
Young radish kimchi?
The one he only had a piece of.

667
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,010
-Are you making fried rice with it?
-Yes, I'm going to do that.

668
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,211
For fried rice.

669
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,779
I'll also use pork rib cap

670
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,582
-Pork rib cap too?
-with the kimchi for the fried rice.

671
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,651
-Young radish kimchi fried rice.
-Kimchi fried rice.

672
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,253
-So you'll make fried rice?
-It's for fried rice.

673
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,290
4. STIR-FRY INGREDIENTS WITH GREEN ONION,
ONION, GOCHUJANG, AND INSTANT RICE

674
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,126
-Instant rice.
-He's already on fried rice?

675
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,696
He's making young radish fried rice.

676
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,131
I don't know what it tastes like,

677
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,766
but Chef Ho-young's recipe

678
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,602
-seems easier to copy.
-Chef Ho-young's recipe seems easier.

679
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,405
We thought Poong's recipe
would be easier to copy.

680
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,207
There are some difficult techniques
to copy his recipe.

681
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,312
-He whips out the knife.
-He needed that

682
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:05,283
because he needed a sharper knife
to keep the dough from becoming mushy.

683
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,951
He's using Chef Hyun-suk's knife now.

684
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,888
CHOPPING

685
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,557
Is that the right shape?

686
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,361
-It'll be tough to eat if it's too thick.
-What is that?

687
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,562
They should be thinner.

688
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,064
How is that donut-shaped?

689
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,666
It'll look like a donut
once he removes the green onion.

690
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,536
But at this point in time,

691
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,272
-it looks like an eye.
-It's like tripe.

692
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,442
It looks like an eye,
so it may seem a bit repulsive.

693
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,310
WHY ARE THEY EYES?

694
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,346
His daughter may think,
"Why are there eyes in this dish?"

695
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,415
It's his first time using that knife.

696
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,950
STAYS CALM AND KEEPS CHOPPING

697
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,486
The donuts all seem crushed.

698
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,254
WHAT'S HIS NEXT STEP?

699
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,291
-What's he doing?
-Young radish kimchi fried rice.

700
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,292
It might be better if he didn't do that.

701
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,293
AN EYE MASSAGE?

702
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,495
His wicked dance has begun.

703
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,130
He should just use his hands.

704
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,699
THE PUPIL WHO LEARNED THE WRONG WAY
IS OUT OF CONTROL

705
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,835
But they turned out nice.

706
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,269
You have to grill the steak.

707
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,839
-The steak?
-You have to start cooking it now.

708
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,941
He chose to do something difficult.

709
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,343
Yes, he's trying to copy you.

710
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,379
He tried to make it Choi's way
and fell into trouble.

711
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,816
We thought Poong's recipe
would be easier to copy,

712
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,184
but Ho-young's recipe is easier.

713
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,054
He threw in everything delicious
into the young radish kimchi fried rice.

714
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,124
Just add one spoonful of gochujang
and one oyster sauce.

715
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,326
-It's not too difficult.
-No.

716
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,297
He's only using the ingredients
from your fridge, so it's not hard.

717
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,100
You said she liked morning glory,

718
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,704
so chop up the thicker part
and throw them in at the end.

719
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,073
It'll add a tasty and crunchy texture.

720
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,275
-Add the thick portion of morning glory.
-Morning glory.

721
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,811
You have under six minutes left.

722
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,647
-The steak. Let's go.
-Let's go?

723
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,450
-The steak.
-When will you cook the steak?

724
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,686
IGNORES THEM AND CHOPS GARLIC CLOVES

725
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,388
Butter.

726
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,890
No, not butter.

727
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,658
-Oil.
-Oil.

728
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,662
Chef Ho-young continues to throw in
great tips for his recipe as he cooks,

729
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,797
but has Poong been quiet--

730
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,765
Add some minced garlic in olive oil.

731
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,167
RAPID-FIRE

732
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,102
You didn't even mince it.

733
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,238
-Minced garlic?
-You threw in raw pieces of garlic!

734
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,507
-Minced garlic.
-You say one thing and do another.

735
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,676
Steak. Wait.

736
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,912
I need to cook steak too.

737
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,980
I'm draining the pasta now.

738
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,749
-A strainer.
-A strainer.

739
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,584
All right. Okay.

740
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,985
It's so easy. Very simple.

741
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,189
-The pasta is ready.
-The pasta is ready.

742
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,458
-That was so simple, wasn't it?
-Even without the green onion,

743
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,695
you can't call them donut-shaped
because they aren't round.

744
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,497
-They're crushed.
-They're like belly buttons.

745
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,633
-They look kind of weird.
-They seem…

746
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,203
It looks like
he trampled on Chef Hyun-suk's good pasta.

747
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,973
-Sung-ju, please report from the kitchen.
-Sure!

748
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,809
-Five minutes. Let me report out there.
-Please walk out.

749
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,212
-The steak. Start cooking it first.
-The steak.

750
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,713
Can you do this in five minutes?

751
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,081
Put it in the pan first.

752
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,850
-Put it in the pan.
-I can do it.

753
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,551
-Hurry up.
-I have to cut it first.

754
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,652
I'll cut

755
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,621
HE DIDN'T EVEN CUT MUCH

756
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,556
Season it!

757
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,757
-Season it.
-Salt.

758
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,293
Is he cooking steak? Is that possible?

759
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,429
He threw it in,
so you'd be able to eat it.

760
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,131
-Use some salt.
-Seasoning.

761
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,601
My gosh! What is he doing?

762
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,102
Can he do this in five minutes?

763
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,904
-I can.
-You have less than five minutes.

764
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,272
It's all right.

765
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,207
You just put that in.

766
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,344
-The heart!
-He's cooking steak.

767
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,779
DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME

768
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,915
-He's using his hands!
-His bare hands.

769
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,551
Ho-young doesn't seem bothered.

770
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,620
The heart shape looks great.

771
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,456
The heart!

772
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,691
HIS BULGOGI OF LOVE IS COOKED WELL

773
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,526
All right. I can do this.

774
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,795
Darn it. I'm ruined. One second.

775
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,199
-The garlic pieces are burnt!
-Wait.

776
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,667
The garlic pieces.

777
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,136
Poong is trying to juggle
three different pans.

778
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,171
INDECISIVE POONG

779
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,373
Is the garlic burnt?

780
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,508
-It is!
-Use just the oil.

781
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,709
Wait, just the oil.

782
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,045
-Use just the oil.
-Chef Ho-young is…

783
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,480
The garlic is burnt.

784
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,048
SMALL LAUGHTER

785
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,116
The garlic is burnt?

786
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,451
HUGE LAUGHTER

787
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,820
BURNING EVERYTHING

788
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,324
FIRE!

789
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,528
IN FLAMES

790
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,397
CAN'T BELIEVE THE SIGHT

791
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,265
Can Woo-jin do this?

792
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,733
Can Woo-jin do this?

793
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,101
He can! He can!

794
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,970
DAMNATION OF ETERNAL FIRE(?)

795
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,406
This is so much fun.
How does it look, honey?

796
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,641
THE HONEY IS SPEECHLESS

797
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,810
Honey, look. Isn't that cool?

798
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,345
It caught on fire!

799
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,781
-What now?
-Honey, isn't this cool?

800
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,217
-Honey, isn't this cool?
-What now?

801
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,521
DO YOU SEE MY BURNING HEART?

802
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,923
ABOUT TO DIE FROM LAUGHING

803
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,158
Is it burning?

804
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,126
I can do this at home, right?

805
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,562
He just asked,
"I can do this at home, right?"

806
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,798
THEN THE SPRINKLERS WILL GO OFF

807
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,666
It caught on fire!

808
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,969
It's a part of the performance.

809
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,171
-Can he do this at home?
-Can he do it?

810
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,040
-Lower the heat a little.
-What a commotion!

811
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,110
MIXED FEELINGS…

812
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,512
His house is about to set on fire.

813
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,214
-What about the steak?
-It's burning!

814
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,549
I'm onto it.

815
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,117
CRYING…

816
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,218
What about the steak?

817
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,186
What about the steak?

818
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,921
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

819
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,656
Poong takes all the attention.

820
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,124
I can do this!

821
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,826
I can do this, honey.

822
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:15,994
I can do this, you know.

823
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,597
-Will you lower the heat?
-It's on fire!

824
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,898
Lower the heat a little.

825
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,334
Ho-young seems to think
things are dangerous.

826
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,304
-He feels anxious about the fire.
-No, it's okay.

827
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,905
MIXING PERILLA BROTH AND GARLIC OIL

828
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,074
-Why does it keep catching fire?
-It smells burnt.

829
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,176
Honey, you can keep watching the telly.

830
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,745
I can do this, honey.

831
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:34,979
-Honey!
-Order delivery food.

832
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,148
What on earth is he doing?

833
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,319
This is hilarious.

834
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,956
-Let me try the sauce after the commotion.
-The steak.

835
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,359
Will he capture his wife's heart?

836
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,628
Will he capture his wife's heart?

837
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,763
His wife's heart?

838
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,431
It does taste good!

839
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,800
-It tastes good!
-The steak.

840
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,769
It does taste good! It tastes good!

841
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,971
I TOLD YOU YOU COULD TRUST ME, HONEY

842
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,140
I'M CRYING…

843
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,307
-It's good.
-It's a bit too salty.

844
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,711
-Yes, good one. It was a bit salty.
-It's a bit salty.

845
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,613
HO-YOUNG COOKS QUIETLY
IN THE MIDST OF CHAOS

846
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,648
5. ADD MORNING GLORY AND SESAME OIL

847
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,018
Chef Ho-young continues to cook calmly.

848
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,820
As I speak,

849
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,988
he gets the heart shape out.

850
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,957
It's a heart-shaped crispy bulgogi.

851
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,326
I see his fried rice here.
Should I try this?

852
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,095
-The fried rice.
-The fried rice.

853
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,130
Let me try it
with 2 minutes and 30 seconds left.

854
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,832
-It looks good.
-So?

855
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,201
Will that dish capture his lady's heart?

856
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,869
Will that dish capture his lady's heart?

857
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,905
-It's a bit too sweet.
-Is it?

858
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,207
It is. Is that right? It's sweet.

859
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,542
-It's sweet?
-It is sweet.

860
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,810
-It is?
-It's sweet.

861
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,111
-Really?
-Yes!

862
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,279
OKAY, GOTCHA

863
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,881
Chef Ho-young listens to my opinion.

864
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,516
It was a bit too sweet.

865
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,419
-Don't cry.
-I can do this.

866
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,155
-It looks fine without it.
-I can do it. Honey, give me a minute.

867
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,157
-Two and a half minutes.
-Just one second.

868
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,860
-Should I try the fried rice?
-Isn't that completely burnt?

869
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,829
It seems fine. It looks okay.

870
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,898
-That's really bad.
-I doubt it's cooked on the inside.

871
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,700
HYUN-SUK'S KNIFE

872
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,103
-You're cutting it already?
-After three minutes.

873
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,204
Wait.

874
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,138
No?

875
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,174
-No, let it rest.
-No? Let it rest?

876
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,443
-Get the pasta first.
-The pasta first.

877
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,678
He should cover that.

878
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,480
What's with that color?

879
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,182
You have a minute and 40 seconds.
His steak is ready.

880
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,717
It's like a sports event.

881
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,853
-A sports event.
-It is.

882
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,821
Did you pull out the green onion?

883
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,858
-You didn't, right?
-I have to get them out.

884
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,727
-But he has to.
-He is pulling them out.

885
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,762
Some of them have eyes, some don

886
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,099
-What's that?
-He's pulling out the green onion pieces.

887
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,034
He's pulling out the green onion eyes.

888
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,070
He's pulling out the eye balls
with tweezers.

889
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,005
That's so scary.

890
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,809
Pull out this eye and that eye.

891
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,446
He pulls out one piece after another
after pulling out the eyes.

892
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,748
-You have a minute left!
-One minute!

893
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,584
-Please speed it up.
-Why is he pouring the soup?

894
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,053
Why are you pouring that on to the plate?

895
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,188
POURING SOUP ON TO A FLAT PLATE

896
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,157
Ho-young begins to serve his dish.

897
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,160
BULGOGI GOES ON TOP

898
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,029
He just serves it from the frying pan.

899
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,064
Please hurry a little more.

900
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,099
Forty-five seconds.

901
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,502
-I'm done.
-He's surrounding meat with fried rice.

902
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,239
Please wrap it up.

903
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,842
You have to start serving!
Forty-five seconds.

904
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,645
Tell him to cut the steak!

905
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,246
Tell him to cut it!

906
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,414
KINDLY CUTS THE STEAK

907
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,619
EVERYONE IS DYING

908
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,188
-It's beef tartare!
-It's raw!

909
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,822
-It's beef tartare!
-It's raw!

910
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,691
-It's raw!
-It's beef tartare.

911
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,226
-It's…
-It's beef tartare!

912
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,163
-It's beef tartare!
-It's raw! It's just raw meat!

913
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,599
I'm seeing raw meat as I speak!

914
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,334
That's raw meat!

915
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,203
-Thirty seconds!
-Thirty seconds.

916
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,538
-I'm seeing raw meat as I speak!
-That's raw meat!

917
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,574
It was completely raw on the inside.

918
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,010
-It was still raw.
-It's okay. You can let it rest.

919
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,112
-Ho-young should move quickly.
-Yes.

920
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,247
Twenty seconds.

921
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,516
Hurry up.

922
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,086
ADDING BUTTER TO THE SSAMJANG SAUCE

923
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,356
Look at how raw this steak is.

924
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,691
Even lions wouldn't eat that.

925
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,426
It's too raw.

926
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,962
Yes, this is important.

927
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,630
It's okay. You can let it rest.

928
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,365
-Seven. Six.
-Seven. Six.

929
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,367
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

930
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,336
-Three. Two.
-Three. Two.

931
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,470
-Two.
-Just one more.

932
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,105
-One! You need to stop.
-One!

933
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,174
-You have to stop. Ring the bell.
-Ho-young's done.

934
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,309
You can't cook anything anymore.

935
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,113
What are you going to do with that?
Your time's up already.

936
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,881
What about this? Do I turn it off?

937
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,684
-Yes, my gosh! I did.
-Yes, you had that too.

938
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,020
-Let me grab it.
-You were working on it.

939
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,222
-Ring the bell.
-It's cooked.

940
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,758
-Put it on the dish.
-Ho-young is done now.

941
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,659
Ring the bell now.

942
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,763
-Ring the bell now.
-Just top it like that?

943
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,064
BREAKING ALL RULES

944
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,432
-Just like that.
-Ring it, Poong.

945
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,301
EVERYONE IS DEAD

946
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,637
CAN'T GET OVER THIS…

947
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,472
Man.

948
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,207
It'll be either the worst or the best.

949
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,010
We don't know
what it looks like on the inside

950
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,945
-as the dishes take off.
-It'll rest.

951
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,513
Send them away.

952
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,782
-Thank you. Great work.
-I told you so.

953
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,752
It's not easy to make
fresh noodles in 15 minutes.

954
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,453
That was so much fun.

955
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,357
And now, both dishes are finished
for Woo-jin to enjoy.

956
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,959
Do you think you can make these?

957
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,328
Yes, I want to try doing it,

958
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,297
except for lighting that on fire.

959
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,399
That would've set off the sprinkler 100%.

960
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,333
No, no.

961
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,902
-Is it okay?
-My wife cried tears of joy when I tried

962
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,737
doing flambé at home.
That's how I proposed.

963
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,340
-Her eyes must've stung.
-She might have cried out of shock.

964
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,375
That is love. The flame of love.

965
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,843
-I'm jealous.
-The flame of love.

966
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,845
Please try them before they get cold.

967
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,548
BULGOGI AND FRIED RICE
TAILORED TO HIS LADY'S APPETITE

968
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,719
WITH A SIDE OF SEASONED MORNING GLORY

969
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,490
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
BULGOGI HEART, HEART, HEART

970
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:50,928
Crispy bulgogi sits in the middle
in the shape of a heart,

971
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,197
-with morning glory on the outside.
-It looks so good.

972
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,832
I'll try the morning glory first.

973
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,168
His wife loves morning glory.

974
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,771
I wonder if it's been parboiled well.

975
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,973
FLINCHING EYEBROWS

976
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,676
-I see.
-He's such a gourmet.

977
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,611
-Next, the rice.
-The rice.

978
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,680
That's young radish kimchi fried rice.

979
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,282
It was a bit too sweet when I tried it.

980
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,584
DID THE SALT DO THE TRICK?

981
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,752
Is it seasoned well?

982
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,454
-What?
-Wait.

983
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,889
-He's happy. Is he reminded of his wife?
-What is it?

984
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,024
What is it?

985
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,125
Is it too sweet?

986
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,827
-Is it?
-He's reminded of his lady.

987
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,028
It's not as sweet as I thought.

988
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,063
-It's not?
-No, it's not. It's good.

989
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,165
Good work with the impromptu seasoning.

990
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,934
I was so curious
of what this would be like.

991
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,503
He mixed bread and meat to make this.

992
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,506
Meat gets much stickier with some bread,

993
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,208
<i>so I mixed it to make them stick together.</i>

994
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,210
<i>-You ground the croissant with it, right?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

995
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,277
All right.

996
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,147
-He only used what you had.
-It won't fall apart.

997
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,116
-You ground the croissant with it, right?
-Yes.

998
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,417
Now, crispy bulgogi.

999
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,019
-Hey.
-It must be good.

1000
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,989
How did this turn out so classy?

1001
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,923
Because of the croissant?

1002
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,925
-The croissant.
-His eyes turned big.

1003
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,861
The flavor of croissant

1004
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,630
-covers my entire mouth right now.
-I see.

1005
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,866
You can taste the butter
used to bake the croissant.

1006
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,101
-Butter from that. Yes.
-It's the butter.

1007
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,504
-It's because he likes Western cuisine.
-I see.

1008
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,672
-Let me try everything together.
-All together.

1009
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,610
With the fried rice
and some morning glory.

1010
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,145
-This is the real deal.
-It looks good.

1011
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,081
I hope it's something his wife would like.

1012
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,783
A BIG BITE

1013
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,919
Crispy bulgogi, fried rice,
and morning glory.

1014
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,257
-He tried everything all together!
-Look at him.

1015
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,958
It must be like a firecracker.

1016
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,961
When I had just the morning glory,

1017
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,664
I thought it might be a bit too salty
and strong for my taste.

1018
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,266
-And?
-When I had it all together,

1019
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,768
it doesn't taste too strong at all.

1020
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,836
And the texture too.

1021
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:43,174
The softness of the meat mixes
with crunchy veggies and rice,

1022
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,342
so it adds a nice bite.

1023
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,878
-I didn't expect to taste such a mix.
-I see.

1024
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,347
-It's wonderfully delicious.
-I see.

1025
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,617
It was an excellent move
to grind bread with the meat.

1026
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,954
I saw in your freezer that you had
some <i>tteokgalbi,</i> short rib patties,

1027
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,790
so I thought
you might like that kind of a dish.

1028
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:03,027
-My daughter would also love this.
-I see.

1029
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,662
Amazing work, Ho-young.

1030
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,130
I wanted to order a dish for my wife,

1031
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,065
but it became a dish
that both women would love.

1032
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,667
My goodness.

1033
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,304
Next up, Webtoon Artist Poong's dish.

1034
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,972
Choi-esque Pasta.

1035
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,741
A WHOLE PIECE OF STEAK

1036
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,879
SERVED WITH HANDMADE DONUT PASTA

1037
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,751
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S CHOI-ESQUE PASTA

1038
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,155
I'm wondering if you had to

1039
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,457
serve that steak at all.

1040
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,227
-It's tough to tell how well it's cooked.
-Right.

1041
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,328
It must be more than fine.

1042
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,864
I'm sure it's perfectly cooked by now.

1043
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,032
This steak
does come across like an island.

1044
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,468
-An island?
-A lonely island.

1045
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,537
Yes, you're right. You could tell.

1046
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,372
-He felt guilty.
-Tell what?

1047
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,108
I wanted to convey the loneliness

1048
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,143
of a long-distance dad

1049
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,311
with that lonely island.

1050
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,248
It's as if I'm lying on the dish.

1051
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,750
It does look like someone lying down.

1052
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,819
-He's so kind.
-Right.

1053
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,088
-Yes.
-Please try the pasta first.

1054
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,124
He said he wanted to shape it like donuts.

1055
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,159
He makes you wonder what it'll be like.

1056
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,629
Should I pull out the green onion
from the pasta?

1057
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,330
No, you can eat it as you like.

1058
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,232
You haven't removed everything.

1059
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,335
You said you liked vegetables,

1060
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,472
so I wondered if I should
pull it out or not.

1061
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,706
-Weren't you rushed?
-It's because

1062
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:26,944
your wife can eat the ones without it,
and you can eat the one with it.

1063
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:27,978
It was just an idea.

1064
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,915
He'll be the judge as the husband.

1065
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,716
He'll try the pasta now.

1066
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,955
-I wonder if it's been cooked well.
-Right?

1067
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,926
-The sauce too.
-His eyebrows twitched.

1068
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,427
I should dip it in the sauce.

1069
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,229
He made it fresh himself.

1070
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,332
-Try it with the soup.
-Yes, try it with the soup.

1071
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,467
MMM!

1072
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:53,470
I kept wondering
what the soup would taste like,

1073
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,139
and it was exactly what I imagined.

1074
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,808
I went over to the kitchen, remember?

1075
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,811
I could sense the rich and nuttiness

1076
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,514
of perilla powder over there.

1077
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,016
My lady loves this smell very much.

1078
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,419
Because she likes perilla seeds.

1079
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,689
I prefer the softer texture,

1080
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,158
but the pasta is on the chewier side.

1081
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,293
This is also how my wife likes it.

1082
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,561
ANOTHER WIFE FAVORITE

1083
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,964
-It was a dish only for his wife.
-Of course.

1084
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,633
Let me try it and see
if you intentionally left the green onion.

1085
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,001
The one with green onion.

1086
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,704
What's it like with the green onion?

1087
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,607
Yes, it was intentional.

1088
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:30,874
It's much better.

1089
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:35,279
He tends to cook
many delicious dishes unintentionally.

1090
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,048
It's better with the green onion.

1091
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,251
I wasn't sure if he'd like that or not.

1092
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,755
He's cutting into the steak as we speak!

1093
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,193
The steak! Let's look inside!

1094
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,295
-It's cooked to blue rare.
-Blue rare?

1095
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,530
-It's practically raw meat.
-It's a bit…

1096
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,899
-It's a bit like an Italian style.
-I see.

1097
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,801
-It's been seared well.
-But you never know.

1098
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,303
I was curious of the sauce too.

1099
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,406
The inside does look kind of reddish.

1100
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,274
I thought it was <i>doenjang,</i>
but I guess not.

1101
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,543
-Is the sauce good?
-The sauce.

1102
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,911
I've never had anything like it.

1103
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,179
What's in here?

1104
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,316
Peanut butter, butter, and <i>ssamjang.</i>

1105
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,985
I can taste everything in my mouth.

1106
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,588
Peanut butter, butter, and then <i>ssamjang.</i>

1107
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,323
It hasn't been mixed well.

1108
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,125
-That's an interesting flavor.
-Don't say that.

1109
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,527
-It hasn't been mixed well.
-They're all made with beans.

1110
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,529
Now, the steak even lions wouldn't eat.

1111
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,931
It does seem quite undercooked.

1112
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,702
Some people do eat it like this.

1113
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,837
Some people like their steak rare.

1114
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,273
It's beef, nevertheless.
People eat tartare anyway.

1115
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,374
All right then.

1116
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,711
-Is it better than he thought?
-What's going on?

1117
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,880
-What's going on?
-The Kim Poong magic has begun.

1118
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,082
-His magic has begun.
-This sounds dangerous.

1119
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,850
This is for his wife,

1120
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,919
-so he checks cautiously.
-Of course.

1121
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:49,953
He takes another bite.

1122
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,990
CHEWING WELL AND SAVORING THE FLAVOR

1123
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,027
-The husband's judgment.
-His brows.

1124
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,563
My wife would make this face
when she has a bite of this.

1125
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,665
-What is it?
-Something like this.

1126
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,801
You're crazy!

1127
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,336
Is that a positive remark?

1128
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,806
-It's been cooked better than it looks.
-Really?

1129
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,774
I love the texture too.

1130
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,577
And the fact that he served this
with <i>ssamjang</i> and perilla leaves

1131
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:17,815
is the biggest kick to this dish.
This mix is simply amazing.

1132
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,819
-It had many more flavors than I expected.
-It must've blown him away.

1133
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,787
I thought, "Why is this so good?"

1134
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,390
That was an unexpected response.

1135
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,859
-I knew it.
-It was unexpected.

1136
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,728
Why don't we try it together?

1137
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,329
-It's not sweet.
-Eat it all together.

1138
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,234
HEY!

1139
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,571
-I can taste the croissant.
-Don't you?

1140
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,107
-It wraps up the flavor.
-It does.

1141
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,577
That dish looks different.

1142
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,979
A BIG-SIZED DISH

1143
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,216
ENJOYING

1144
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,084
How did you like it, Ji-hwan?

1145
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,187
-It tasted like childhood.
-Childhood?

1146
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,456
It doesn't pretend to be mature,

1147
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,158
and it's not too much, either.

1148
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,428
-So I said both of my girls would love it.
-I can tell.

1149
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,331
It's a flavor you don't want to resist.

1150
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,867
I'm sure Chef Jong-won knows
what his wife likes.

1151
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,968
I think she'll like it.

1152
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:15,606
The buttery flavor from the bread

1153
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,275
-brings everything together.
-It does.

1154
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,211
The morning glory
keeps refreshing your mouth.

1155
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,181
All right, then. Next, Choi-esque Pasta.

1156
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,950
The texture is very nice,
considering he had

1157
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,819
-only a short amount of time.
-It's good.

1158
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,589
-It's so good.
-It'd be impossible to make in 15 minutes.

1159
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,991
It's good with perilla leaves.

1160
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,493
THIS TIME, A SMALLER DISH

1161
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,897
BUT IT'S THE FOURTH ONE

1162
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,998
How many has he had?

1163
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,800
-Are we at a conveyor belt sushi place?
-Like sushi?

1164
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,004
What the viewers

1165
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,340
would want to know the most
is if the steak is cooked.

1166
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,245
Does it taste like beef tartare or steak?

1167
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,580
That's the most important.

1168
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,183
It's more like <i>tataki,</i>
lightly seared beef,

1169
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,585
-rather than steak.
-It's like beef <i>tataki?</i>

1170
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,322
But it has the scent of steak
to call it just <i>tataki.</i>

1171
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,824
YOU'RE RIGHT

1172
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,158
Was this <i>tataki?</i>

1173
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,360
What was your intention?

1174
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,963
-You called it steak at first.
-He probably doesn't know.

1175
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,164
St…

1176
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,299
Staki?

1177
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,103
-Staki?
-Staki?

1178
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,339
-I knew you'd come through.
-Good one. Staki.

1179
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,308
As I looked at him,

1180
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,010
he reminded me of a peacock.

1181
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,712
A peacock?

1182
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,081
<i>Like the feathers of a peacock?</i>

1183
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,983
You like everything he does
because you like him.

1184
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,018
He said he saw a peacock in him.

1185
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,521
He's way too smitten with Poong.

1186
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,223
I want to call

1187
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,626
this kind of cooking technique
the chaotic moonwalk.

1188
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,328
-The chaotic moonwalk?
-Yes.

1189
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,431
He does the moonwalk,
and somehow hits the right spot.

1190
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,399
-I see.
-The moonwalk?

1191
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,536
The pasta is chewy, not hard,

1192
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,570
and it's savory.

1193
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,405
The balance turned out nice.

1194
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,541
EVEN CHEF CHOI ACKNOWLEDGES
CHOI-ESQUE PASTA

1195
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,878
This means there's a chance
Woo-jin may choose Poong.

1196
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,713
-Please make your decision.
-Time to decide.

1197
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,648
-What am I going to do?
-What now?

1198
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,016
<i>Press one for Ho-young</i>

1199
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,618
<i>-and two for Poong.</i>
<i>-Poong.</i>

1200
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,953
-It must be hard.
-I think there will be a twist.

1201
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,788
Gosh. I'm sorry.

1202
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,924
He lets out an apology.

1203
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:18,428
He left an apology to one of you
and made his choice.

1204
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,164
Let's check out the result. Show us!

1205
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,901
A dish for my lady.

1206
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,969
Both men have eight wins at the moment.

1207
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,571
Will Poong become the number two?

1208
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,239
Or will it be Ho-young?

1209
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,142
Who did Woo-jin choose?

1210
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,543
Who did you choose?

1211
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,012
A dish for his lady!

1212
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,947
Who is it?

1213
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,248
JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1214
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,349
Jung Ho-young wins.

1215
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,885
BULGOGI HEART, HEART, HEART WINS

1216
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,988
HO-YOUNG BECOMES THE SOLE 2ND PLACE

1217
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:50,027
Chef Ho-young rises as the winner.

1218
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,462
I enjoyed
Webtoon Artist Poong's dish so much.

1219
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,398
Actually, his dish was something

1220
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,402
I wanted to try the most
while watching <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> all along.

1221
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,771
It was such an honor to have tried it,

1222
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,708
but Chef Ho-young's dish was
definitely something my wife would enjoy,

1223
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,177
as well as my daughter.

1224
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,647
Chef Ho-young surpasses Poong
and becomes the only second place.

1225
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,749
This is your ninth win!
Please put a star on him.

1226
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,618
-The sole second place!
-Yes.

1227
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,586
-Put the star on him.
-Thank you.

1228
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,554
It's your ninth win.

1229
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:22,059
-That's a lot of stars.
-The ninth star and the golden Spam set.

1230
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,028
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1231
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,064
Ho-young takes the sole second place.

1232
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,201
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Woo-jin's fridge.</i>

1233
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,604
Woo-jin's cooking teacher, Park Eun-yeong,

1234
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:38,442
versus Woo-jin's family's favorite chef,
Son Jong-won.

1235
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:42,212
The two are up against each other
in this round.

1236
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,716
-This is a twist of fate.
-A twist of fate?

1237
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:46,817
There's a Korean saying,

1238
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,952
"The King, the Teacher,
and the Father are one."

1239
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,088
It's an old adage that reminds you

1240
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,290
never to forget your teacher.

1241
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,459
The King, the Teacher,
and the Father are one?

1242
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,396
-I'm just saying.
-You're asking him to choose you.

1243
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,431
She mentioned the old adage right now.

1244
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,834
Your teacher is just like your parents.

1245
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,305
I already know
how unfair and impartial he is.

1246
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,041
And yes, of course,
your teacher is significant,

1247
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,311
but don't we do everything
for our family's happiness?

1248
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,613
Your family's happiness
is the most important.

1249
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,349
FAMILY'S HAPPINESS
VS RESPECTING THE TEACHER

1250
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,852
What if your daughter comes home
during the break and goes,

1251
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,288
"What's going on, Dad?
You picked Chef Park Eun-yeong?"

1252
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,857
"Are you crazy?"

1253
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,625
How will you deal with that?

1254
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,060
"We can't go back to his restaurant."

1255
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,764
This is such a tough round for me.

1256
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,265
Honestly speaking,

1257
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,701
I just want to eat my food and run away.

1258
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,070
THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE

1259
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,805
That's dine and dashing.

1260
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,975
I'd like to dine and dash.
That's how hard this choice will be.

1261
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:49,780
Anyway, I'll think of this as a blind test
and decide solely on how it tastes.

1262
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,282
-You should do that.
-That's only fair.

1263
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,185
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:
ABALONES, SALTED CLAMS

1264
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,287
PEANUT BUTTER, RADISH,
CILANTRO, PERILLA LEAVES

1265
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,222
My dish is called

1266
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,557
Cold Salad from Mimiru.

1267
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,459
-Cold Salad from Mimiru?
-Mimiru?

1268
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,161
-What's Mimiru?
-What's Mimiru?

1269
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:09,666
The Chinese restaurant where Woo-jin works
in the film <i>Boss</i> is called Mimiru.

1270
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,235
I wanted to remember our memories
and make a cold salad

1271
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,505
-from Mimiru Chinese Restaurant.
-What a move.

1272
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,107
That's enough!

1273
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,276
Only she had that information.

1274
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,712
She previously said
she didn't want him to come by.

1275
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,350
Cold salad in Chinese cuisine
often uses mustard-based sauce.

1276
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,488
But I want to use what he likes,
cilantro and peanut butter…

1277
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,723
-That sounds good.
-…to make the sauce.

1278
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,059
Today, I'm up against Chef Jong-won,

1279
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,196
so I'll pay extra attention
to the presentation

1280
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,765
and make the dish flower-shaped,

1281
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,301
so you'll feel like
you're picking off one petal each.

1282
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,636
I wanted to wish for the success of <i>Boss</i>

1283
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,106
-and present that flower to you.
-My gosh.

1284
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,308
-Wishing for the success of <i>Boss?</i>
-My gosh.

1285
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,878
-How can she not choose him after this?
-She's using every card up her sleeve!

1286
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,781
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS: MUSSELS,
SCALLOPS, SHRIMP, SQUID, ABALONE

1287
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,883
SALTED CLAMS, CILANTRO, WHITE WINE,
TOMATO SAUCE, BROTH TABLETS

1288
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,753
I prepared a dish Woo-jin can have

1289
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,990
secretly without telling anyone.

1290
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,725
My dish is called

1291
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm Eating in Secret.

1292
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,529
-I'm Eating in Secret.
-I'm Eating in Secret.

1293
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,631
A dish only I can eat in secret.

1294
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,267
-It's like his restaurant, L'Amant Secret.
-It's L'Amant Secret.

1295
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,504
Are you trying
to remind him of his family?

1296
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,440
You better pick me
if you want to come to my restaurant.

1297
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,209
They named the dishes
to give him pressure.

1298
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,511
They're both something.

1299
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,379
What's your dish like?

1300
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,981
I'm going to make bouillabaisse.

1301
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,283
-Bouillabaisse.
-Bouillabaisse?

1302
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,218
-Bouillabaisse?
-Bouillabaisse.

1303
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:38,455
Easily put, it's just
French tomato seafood soup.

1304
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,190
-Right.
-I see.

1305
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,193
-It must be soup.
-Is it like stew?

1306
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,962
Yes, and I know
that he loves seafood very much,

1307
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:49,132
<i>so I plan to use</i>
<i>everything he has in the fridge,</i>

1308
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,068
as well as the salted clam,
because he said he liked it a lot.

1309
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,438
It'll be a French dish
with a hint of Korean spirit.

1310
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,375
-I'll throw in everything he likes.
-I see.

1311
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:02,646
All right, then. Let us begin the round
for a seafood dish behind his lady's back.

1312
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,448
Do not forget
the kindness of your teacher,

1313
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,518
and consider her like your parent.
Chef Park Eun-yeong is up first.

1314
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,055
Do not forget
the happiness of your family,

1315
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:16,193
as it is the most important.
Chef Son Jong-won is also up.

1316
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,962
Who will he choose
between his teacher and his family?

1317
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,765
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1318
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,936
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THIS HONOR

1319
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,370
Begin!

1320
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:28,772
FAMILY'S HAPPINESS
VS RESPECTING THE TEACHER

1321
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,007
Gosh. What's he going to do?

1322
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,842
We just can't help him with this.

1323
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,212
-It must be hard.
-She's cleaning the abalones.

1324
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,415
She's cleaning the abalones
to make the cold salad.

1325
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,750
-It's a must for a Chinese cold salad.
-It is.

1326
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,519
She's using three of them.

1327
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,287
Abalone is an important ingredient.

1328
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,191
Bouillabaisse is a dish
that you even have to cook the day before

1329
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,394
-because it takes hours to boil.
-It takes a long time.

1330
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,964
I wonder how he'll do it in 15 minutes.

1331
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,165
ANTICIPATION

1332
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,867
He's using lots of seafood.

1333
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,903
LOOK FORWARD TO IT!
HE'LL USE THIS MUCH SEAFOOD!

1334
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:01,972
CHOPPING RADISH!

1335
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,940
CUTTING THE RADISH FLAT

1336
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,041
AND SHE TURNS IT AROUND?

1337
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,745
THEN SHE SLICES IT SIDEWAYS!

1338
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,747
-Look at her slicing that.
-Yes.

1339
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,449
Look at her slicing that.

1340
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,084
-That's amazing.
-Yes.

1341
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,787
-Look at the way she slices that.
-The radish.

1342
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,055
-It's so thin.
-That's like art.

1343
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,557
Watch your hand.

1344
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,425
Why is she making such thin slices?

1345
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,294
-They'll turn into petals.
-Petals.

1346
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,197
I see. She's wishing
for the success of <i>Boss.</i>

1347
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,833
-She says she's making flower petals.
-Yes.

1348
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,167
And with that huge knife.

1349
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,569
That's so thin.

1350
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,537
Premieres on October 3rd.

1351
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,608
Many parties in relation
with the production of <i>Boss</i>

1352
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,744
must be moved right now.

1353
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,913
A film about thugs
who don't want to be the boss.

1354
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,914
That's right.

1355
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,716
ALL EYES ARE ON EUN-YEONG

1356
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,551
LOOK HERE!

1357
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,321
SEAFOOD GALORE: 1. MUSSELS

1358
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,889
-He's grilling scallops.
-Scallops.

1359
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,558
-And shrimps.
-It's been two minutes right now.

1360
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,494
It took him over two minutes
just to prepare the ingredients.

1361
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,728
AND WHITE WINE!

1362
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,263
He's using wine.

1363
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,965
-Garlic.
-That's a lot of wine.

1364
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,367
He first has to cook
garlic, onion, and green onion,

1365
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,603
and then add mussels and wine.

1366
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,405
-He's making the soup base.
-I see.

1367
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,106
SEAFOOD GALORE: 4.SQUID

1368
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,842
He's using squid too.
That's a lot of seafood.

1369
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:17,247
Jong-won is grilling
scallops and shrimps right now,

1370
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,817
-which will add a lot of savory flavor.
-That is so, correct?

1371
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,555
-Tomato sauce!
-He drops a bunch of sauce.

1372
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,691
-He just added tomato sauce.
-Yes.

1373
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,027
She has to make many thin radish slices.

1374
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,963
How many petals will she make
with that big piece of radish?

1375
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,466
How desperately
is she praying for the film's success?

1376
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,602
-She's been slicing that…
-How will she--

1377
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,471
-My gosh.
-No!

1378
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:45,141
-That didn't go well.
-It's not easy to do.

1379
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,477
It's not easy
to wish for the film's success.

1380
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,480
Is this a teacher
wishing for her pupil's success?

1381
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,548
That's true.

1382
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,083
Do you have to do it horizontally?

1383
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,885
-It's to check how thin it is.
-Watch your hand.

1384
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,021
Three minutes have passed
while slicing the radish.

1385
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,590
It isn't easy.
Three minutes went by just on that radish.

1386
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,325
-Is she carving them?
-She is.

1387
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,060
-She's carving?
-Yes.

1388
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,129
She's carving the slices.

1389
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,965
-She's turning them into petals.
-I can't believe I'm seeing it here.

1390
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,202
It's the first time
we're seeing someone carving vegetables.

1391
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:15,038
That's a very sharp knife.

1392
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,306
Is that all he'll eat?

1393
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,441
She's competing by presentation alone.

1394
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,977
He did say he liked veggies,
but is he just eating the radish?

1395
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,814
Yes, it's taking her over three minutes
to make the petals.

1396
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,117
I think I know what she's making.

1397
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,919
-She made radish petals.
-They're pretty.

1398
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,489
Chef Eun-yeong may run out of time.

1399
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,090
She has 11 minutes now.

1400
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,625
-Sugar?
-Four minutes have gone by.

1401
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,760
It must be pickles.

1402
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:37,827
-I'm making pickles.
-Pickles.

1403
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,629
-Pickled radish?
-Pickled radish.

1404
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:44,734
If she pickles the radish,
the petals will get droopy.

1405
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,203
So I won't leave it
in the solution for too long.

1406
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,606
-The petals should remain firm.
-Yes.

1407
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,975
He doesn't need wilted petals.

1408
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,009
Don't let them wilt.

1409
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,246
Will she have enough time
to season it, though?

1410
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,249
GRILLED SCALLOPS INTO BOUILLABAISSE

1411
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,383
The scallops go in.

1412
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,420
It looks like <i>jjamppong,</i>
spicy seafood soup.

1413
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,488
It's bouillabaisse.

1414
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,123
-<i>Jjamppong.</i>
-Look at that.

1415
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,426
-The soup already looks good.
-It does.

1416
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,095
Scallops, squid, mussels,
and tomato sauce.

1417
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,029
It already looks good.

1418
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,733
-It'll taste amazing with some noodles.
-You're right.

1419
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,636
-He's adding cilantro stems.
-Cilantro.

1420
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,838
Cilantro. He's using cilantro.

1421
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,974
-What's he doing?
-He made a bouquet garni to add aroma.

1422
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,243
He'll pull it out once it adds more aroma.

1423
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,845
He'll pull it out later?

1424
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,314
Look at the way
he ties the string with his teeth.

1425
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:34,417
-Many fans find that move sexy.
-They do.

1426
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,086
-He often uses string.
-Sexy food.

1427
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,588
-Sexiness.
-It looked sexy.

1428
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,590
-My heart raced a little too.
-Did it?

1429
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,225
CHUCKLING

1430
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,061
Yes, isn't that so?

1431
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,996
It's all in the process.

1432
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,465
ABALONE

1433
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,099
FEELING A BIT ANXIOUS

1434
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,036
EUN-YEONG FINISHES COOKING THE ABALONE!

1435
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,506
What's Chef Eun-yeong doing?

1436
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,975
I'm making the prop
to stick the petals on.

1437
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,243
She's still on the radish.

1438
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,246
-How long will she work on that?
-That's…

1439
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,348
She's making a sculpture.

1440
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,352
5. MAKE CUTS ON THE RADISH
TO MAKE THE SUPPORT

1441
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,521
Peanut butter.

1442
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:14,290
Are you using soy sauce,
peanut butter, and sugar?

1443
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,093
-Yes, sugar, soy sauce, and…
-Peanut butter.

1444
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,662
-That must taste great.
-It looks good.

1445
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,197
And vinegar?

1446
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,533
-Yes, it's vinegar.
-Noodles would taste great with that.

1447
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,736
-Most Chinese cold salads are made
-Minced garlic?

1448
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,271
with mustard-based sauce.

1449
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,674
She's adding more flavor
with peanut butter.

1450
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,210
-She's using fresh garlic, not minced.
-It must not be in good condition.

1451
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,446
-It tastes best with fresh garlic.
-That's true.

1452
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,814
She added fresh garlic.

1453
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,950
There was minced garlic,
but she crushed fresh ones.

1454
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,787
That sauce she's making
is the most important aspect.

1455
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,323
-How delicious will that be?
-Right?

1456
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,593
-Cold salads are all about the sauce.
-That's the most important.

1457
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:52,929
What?

1458
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,931
He just threw in salted clams.

1459
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,800
-Salted clams?
-Right, he had salted clams.

1460
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,102
Is that like a marinade?

1461
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,104
It'll add umami and act as seasoning.

1462
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,875
He just added salted clams,
the ones Woo-jin eats with laver and rice.

1463
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,378
-He's using abalone too.
-Abalones.

1464
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,413
Chef Jong-won uses abalone too.

1465
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,283
I'm trying to use all of the seafood
he had in the fridge.

1466
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,819
9. CHOP ABALONE INTO THE BOUILLABAISSE

1467
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,755
What? Red pepper powder?

1468
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:19,956
-Red pepper powder?
-Red pepper powder?

1469
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,824
It's originally made with cayenne pepper.

1470
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,293
-Red pepper powder.
-A pinch.

1471
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,328
-Just a pinch?
-Yes, a pinch.

1472
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,299
Did that pinch mean anything?

1473
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,768
-Isn't it meaningless?
-It seemed meaningless.

1474
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,270
-He must have a reason.
-What did he do?

1475
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,974
-He added that tad bit of spiciness.
-Really? With that little?

1476
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,443
-It should be spicy enough for Europeans.
-Really?

1477
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,212
-It should be spicy enough.
-Really? I didn't know.

1478
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,516
Chef Jong-won already knows
that I like to drink.

1479
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,850
-I see.
-I have a feeling

1480
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:52,855
he's trying to make a dish appropriate
for someone who likes to drink.

1481
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,223
I see.

1482
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,959
You have seven and a half minutes.

1483
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,293
-That's all?
-You got enough time.

1484
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,562
You're halfway through
the seven-minute mark.

1485
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,664
She's using
both cilantro and perilla leaves.

1486
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,734
Yes, I'm throwing them into the sauce
for him to dip in.

1487
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,403
-I see.
-Yes, she's working hard on the sauce.

1488
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,539
-He's using bread!
-Bread.

1489
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,942
-That's the bread his princess loves.
-A loaf of sourdough.

1490
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,945
-Oh, right.
-He'll serve it with the soup.

1491
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,714
Garlic cloves.

1492
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,150
RUBBING IT ON THE BREAD!

1493
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,518
European style.

1494
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,787
He's doing it
like they do for garlic bread.

1495
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:25,822
Like garlic bread.

1496
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,824
He's supposed to do it after toasting.

1497
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,459
CHUCKLING

1498
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,694
Chef Sung-jun says
you should've toasted them first.

1499
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,696
-Are you helping or disturbing me?
-People do that too.

1500
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,498
The surface must be hardened

1501
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,101
-to add more flavor with the rub.
-You're right.

1502
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,169
-It's harder when it's not toasted.
-I see.

1503
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,371
He's toasting them now.

1504
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:44,073
He's toasting them
after rubbing them with garlic.

1505
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,176
If he rubs them after toasting,
it'll smell like raw garlic,

1506
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,246
but it'll smell nuttier
toasting them afterward.

1507
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,514
There's a difference.

1508
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,149
You have six minutes now.

1509
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:54,784
Time flies.

1510
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,121
She's working on the abalone.

1511
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,790
Eun-yeong prepares the abalone.

1512
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:01,958
Watch your hand.

1513
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,793
She's not slicing them.

1514
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,262
She cuts them into straight pieces.

1515
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,565
-Are those salted clams?
-Salted clams?

1516
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,135
Chef Eun-yeong also uses salted clams.

1517
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,736
I LOVE SALTED CLAMS

1518
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,706
Same ingredients, different dishes.
One's European, the other's Chinese.

1519
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:20,343
You're right.
It's either Chinese or European.

1520
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,446
7. MIX ABALONE STRIPS WITH SALTED CLAMS,
SESAME OIL, AND MINCED GARLIC

1521
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:28,117
She adds a whole lot of cilantro
just as he likes.

1522
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,887
-I'm worried about the bread.
-Are they burning?

1523
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,955
-They're burning.
-They don't look fine.

1524
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,090
What's wrong?

1525
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,591
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, they're fine.

1526
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,628
-Five minutes left.
-Five minutes left.

1527
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,697
Please go out to the kitchen, Jung-hwan.

1528
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,566
Why don't you go out
and try the cold salad sauce?

1529
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,268
-The cold salad sauce?
-Yes.

1530
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,670
-That's the most important.
-Yes.

1531
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,505
-It's the key.
-That's the key aspect.

1532
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,606
Five minutes left.

1533
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,575
CILANTRO STEMS

1534
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,545
They're both using cilantro.

1535
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,979
He's now boiling bouillabaisse

1536
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,748
-and toasting bread.
-Yes.

1537
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,217
EUN-YEONG GOES BACK TO THE RADISH AGAIN

1538
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:02,652
FLUTTER

1539
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,721
HOW WILL THESE TURN OUT?

1540
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,789
Like that?

1541
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:09,892
Chef Eun-yeong is
turning the radish into a flower.

1542
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,328
It's turning into a flower.

1543
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,431
-Just like that?
-Just like that?

1544
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,900
She's wishing for the success of <i>Boss.</i>

1545
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,303
WILL YOU STILL NOT PICK ME?

1546
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,772
He should pick her
after that kind of effort.

1547
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,007
-You're right. It's like a cherry blossom.
-Yes.

1548
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,943
-Look at the flower.
-No way!

1549
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:29,846
-I didn't know she could do this.
-And in such a short while?

1550
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,914
That's why she's Chef Chinglai's pupil.

1551
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,117
Can you try the sauce, Jung-hwan?

1552
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,753
The sauce.
Is this the peanut butter sauce?

1553
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,755
You can try that and the abalone.

1554
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,356
And the abalone?

1555
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,559
This is the abalone
that'll go into the salad.

1556
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:44,727
The seasoned abalone.

1557
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:48,331
Does Cold Salad from Mimiru
taste marvelous?

1558
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,832
Or is it so-so?

1559
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,101
Is it so-so or marvelous?

1560
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,603
It's marvelous!

1561
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:55,238
Does it taste marvelous?

1562
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:58,474
It's unlike the usual mustard sauce.

1563
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,909
It's very smooth.

1564
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,677
-Did you add sesame oil too?
-I did.

1565
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:05,915
I love how the sesame oil
brings the flavors all together.

1566
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,785
-She's topping the abalone on the petals.
-She is.

1567
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,954
-He'll pull out each one to eat it.
-You're right.

1568
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,223
The petal and the abalone.

1569
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,226
Filling up on energy
while wishing for the success of the film.

1570
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,061
MOVED

1571
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,698
THE TOASTED BREAD GOES INTO THE OVEN!

1572
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,468
AND IN THE BLENDER

1573
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:26,803
GOES SALTED CLAMS

1574
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,271
WATER

1575
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,205
AND TWO EGG YOLKS

1576
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,141
-He's using eggs too, but just the yolks.
-Just the yolks.

1577
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,577
HE RIPS OUT
A SIDE OF THE UNTOASTED BREAD

1578
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,747
What's he grinding with the bread?

1579
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,282
-Egg yolks.
-Egg yolks?

1580
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:43,119
12. GRIND SALTED CLAMS, WATER, EGG YOLKS,
AND THE SOFT CENTER OF THE BREAD

1581
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,321
AND OLIVE OIL!

1582
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,690
He's pouring olive oil inside.

1583
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,262
-He left it on the blender!
-What's he doing right now?

1584
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,065
THAT LOOKS GREAT

1585
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,401
What's that? Vinegar?

1586
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,070
A bit of vinegar.

1587
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,905
13. POUR OLIVE OIL IN,
ADD VINEGAR, AND MIX

1588
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,074
Chef Eun-yeong

1589
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:09,078
seems to be serious
about her presentation today.

1590
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,581
-It's finger food.
-The presentation looks solid.

1591
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:15,351
-Jung-hwan, check on Chef Jong-won's soup.
-It looks good.

1592
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,987
-The bouillabaisse he's working on?
-What's it like now?

1593
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,455
He has a minute and 50 seconds.

1594
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,324
It had been looking good for a while.

1595
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,658
-The bouillabaisse.
-Yes.

1596
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:27,930
It should be a seafood dish
he wants to eat behind his lady's back.

1597
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:31,601
Will even his wife crave the dish?

1598
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,103
Yes, 100%.

1599
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,607
It's mild and delicious.

1600
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:40,476
The flavor of seafood
tastes amazing with tomato sauce.

1601
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,479
The decision will be tough today.

1602
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,947
-It seems so.
-Yes.

1603
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:46,782
SHAKING OFF

1604
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,919
Eun-yeong is almost done,
and she begins to serve it.

1605
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,256
-She set it on top of some cilantro.
-One minute left.

1606
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,424
He's adding vinegar
instead of lemon juice,

1607
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,426
-which he needed.
-Woo-jin didn't have it.

1608
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:00,129
He used vinegar without lemon juice.

1609
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,265
-It'll taste more refreshing.
-He needs the sourness.

1610
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,634
What will he do
with what's in the blender?

1611
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,403
It must be the sauce.

1612
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,305
He's adding cilantro stems.

1613
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,507
-Thirty seconds.
-You have thirty seconds left.

1614
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,743
-Jong-won.
-He's making something.

1615
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,646
-What's he doing?
-What's he doing now?

1616
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:20,316
It doesn't seem like
he's simply making food.

1617
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,018
He's making a piece of art.

1618
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,152
Thirty seconds!

1619
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,521
-You should hurry!
-Just the sauce?

1620
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,622
You won't pour it on top?

1621
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,124
You don't have much time.

1622
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,793
10. TOP PEANUT BUTTER SAUCE
WITH CHOPPED CILANTRO AND PERILLA LEAVES

1623
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,995
Gosh.

1624
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,264
-Twenty seconds!
-Twenty seconds!

1625
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,333
Twenty seconds! Eun-yeong is done!

1626
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,568
-Eun-yeong is finished.
-Fifteen seconds.

1627
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:40,636
And Jong-won.

1628
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,071
HE'S DONE TOASTING THE BREAD!

1629
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,473
-The bread!
-The bread!

1630
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,409
It looks good.

1631
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,178
-Ten seconds.
-That bread is from his restaurant.

1632
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,948
-Eight. Seven. Six.
-Eight. Seven. Six.

1633
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,417
-Five. Four. Three.
-Five. Four. Three.

1634
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,419
-Two. One.
-Wow.

1635
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,888
-That's time!
-Time's up! Jong-won is finished.

1636
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,256
The sauce.

1637
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,557
SALIVATING

1638
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,627
The two chefs' dishes
have been completed.

1639
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,563
-It smells amazing.
-That pot is pretty.

1640
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,533
-It must be tough.
-What's he going to do?

1641
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,201
This will be hard.

1642
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,169
It smells great.

1643
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,104
I'm already moved.

1644
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,138
And in just 15 minutes.

1645
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:19,742
Thank you very much
for your hard work. Thank you.

1646
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,946
And now, both dishes are finished
to fill Woo-jin's order.

1647
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,414
When I saw them serving the dish,

1648
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,783
I almost choked up
as they moved around busily

1649
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,954
-trying to present the dish beautifully.
-I see.

1650
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,289
I want to try them quickly.

1651
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:34,623
Chef Eun-yeong finished first,

1652
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,093
-and it's Cold Salad from Mimiru.
-Cold salad.

1653
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,463
RADISH PETALS SURROUNDING SALTED CLAMS
AND COLD ABALONE SALAD

1654
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:41,864
AND SPECIAL COLD SALAD SAUCE

1655
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,302
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
COLD SALAD FROM MIMIRU

1656
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:50,139
Chef Eun-yeong has put together
a piece of art today.

1657
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,807
I appreciate this, my teacher.

1658
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,612
A dish made
by his teacher of three months.

1659
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,383
-She taught him all the techniques.
-That's made with abalones.

1660
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,118
Yes, abalones help you get more energy.

1661
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,587
-It's easy to eat too.
-It looks so good.

1662
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:05,554
It must be good.

1663
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,556
-It was just the sauce.
-The sauce?

1664
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:10,459
-It must be good.
-He's already feeling it with the sauce.

1665
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,295
-I know that face means it's really good.
-Is that so?

1666
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,931
EATS IN ONE BITE

1667
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,034
He wrapped the salad in the petal.

1668
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,804
-That's made with abalones.
-Yes, abalones help you get more energy.

1669
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,508
The long-distance dad
probably hasn't eaten well lately.

1670
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:26,542
-Right away?
-Another one.

1671
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,611
THIS TIME LOTS OF SAUCE

1672
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:29,712
He dips it in the sauce.

1673
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,214
He rarely eats seafood at home.

1674
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,749
I wonder what it's like.

1675
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,851
SAVORS THE FLAVOR FOR A WHILE
WITH HIS EYES CLOSED

1676
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:37,186
He chews it for a while.

1677
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:39,555
-I can almost taste the excellent flavor.
-He chews it well.

1678
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:40,956
Man.

1679
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,092
Without her, he…

1680
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,528
I keep chewing this
because it's the kind of dish

1681
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:48,330
that changes its flavor
with every single chew.

1682
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,632
-Yes.
-You don't want to swallow it.

1683
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:53,769
It's been a while since I had something
that made me want to chew for a long time.

1684
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,105
The presentation is beautiful, isn't it?

1685
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,040
But it tastes even more gorgeous.

1686
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,242
-It tastes more gorgeous?
-The taste.

1687
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,512
My humble salted clams

1688
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:07,750
turned into something
I don't think I'm even worth eating.

1689
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,619
-I feel almost sorry and grateful.
-I see.

1690
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,255
I knew what I had
in my fridge wasn't much.

1691
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:15,257
-He tries the sauce again.
-Go ahead and eat more.

1692
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:18,060
-We'll get another serving later.
-Yes.

1693
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,261
Jeez.

1694
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:22,364
-The sauce must be good.
-This sauce is a piece of art.

1695
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,367
It has that sweet yet bitter flavor.

1696
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:29,505
Most cold salads are made
with spicy and tangy mustard sauce.

1697
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,407
-It's in another dimension.
-Another dimension.

1698
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,243
It's not just one level above
the cold salads I've had to this day,

1699
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,846
but at least three levels above.

1700
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:40,216
I just had a new experience
in the realm of Chinese cold salads.

1701
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,217
That's her.

1702
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,384
My gosh.

1703
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:46,122
-Thank you so much, Ms. Park.
-That sounds wonderful.

1704
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,625
Next up, Chef Jong-won's dish,
I'm Eating in Secret.

1705
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:53,562
BOUILLABAISSE FULL OF SEAFOOD
FOR HIS REGULAR CUSTOMER

1706
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,098
SALTED CLAM SAUCE WITH CILANTRO STEMS

1707
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,570
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S I'M EATING IN SECRET

1708
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,572
He's serving wine too?

1709
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,274
-Even some wine?
-Wine?

1710
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,609
-That's him.
-He's serving wine.

1711
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:09,812
This is a combination you can't lose with.

1712
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,982
-He used to drink that with dried laver.
-Yes.

1713
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:16,118
-My gosh.
-Look at that.

1714
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,254
I can't deal with this.

1715
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,122
-It must be hard.
-He must love that dish.

1716
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,091
I can even smell it from here.

1717
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,959
-It smells amazing.
-It feels like

1718
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:27,163
Jong-won is saying,
"I got Woo-jin in the palm of my hands."

1719
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,765
He's like, "Try this."

1720
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,900
The sauce first.

1721
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:36,906
This is the type of sauce
that gives you a dopamine hit.

1722
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,340
I want it in my living room.

1723
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,545
-As a diffuser?
-To use it as a diffuser?

1724
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,215
He left the olive oil bottle
and poured it into the blender.

1725
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,583
<i>-And egg yolks.</i>
<i>-He used egg yolks.</i>

1726
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,717
<i>Wouldn't it be greasy?</i>

1727
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,219
It doesn't feel greasy at all.

1728
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,454
I topped it with cilantro stems,

1729
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,858
so it'll have the crunchy
and juicy texture, unlike the leaves.

1730
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,092
He's right.

1731
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,094
He'll start digging in now.

1732
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:04,333
The dish was inspired
by something called bouillabaisse.

1733
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,467
EYES SHUT

1734
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,571
It's a tomato-based seafood stew.

1735
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:11,273
He didn't just see right through me.

1736
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,677
He shot a bullet and hit the bull's eye
of the target called my taste.

1737
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,812
-He must know you well.
-You're his regular.

1738
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,981
He knows what I like almost too well.

1739
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,084
He always thinks
sauces are very important.

1740
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,019
-He knows everything.
-It's also amazing

1741
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:28,057
-how he remembers his customers' taste.
-It's amazing.

1742
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,393
-He's enjoying the stew.
-With the shell? He knows how to eat that.

1743
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,529
-He eats the head too.
-He does.

1744
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,497
Was everything cooked well?

1745
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,499
-Everything was cooked well.
-Everything?

1746
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,669
It doesn't feel like
it's been made in a short while.

1747
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,105
It's impossible to make in 15 minutes.

1748
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,974
Try it with the bread.

1749
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,442
I'll pull off this much.

1750
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,510
-It'll taste good with noodles too.
-Right?

1751
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,813
He should dip it in the soup
and eat it with a spoon.

1752
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:55,351
-This was the bread with the garlic rub.
-The garlic rub.

1753
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,053
-Everything smells subtle.
-Subtle.

1754
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,022
-Try it with the soup.
-Dip it all the way in.

1755
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,592
-Top it with the soup.
-You have to shovel it in all the way.

1756
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,595
-And top it with a piece of scallop.
-My mouth is watering.

1757
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,763
-Right on top.
-Yes.

1758
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,666
-Yes, that's it.
-Make the bread soft and moist.

1759
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,735
-He's topping it with the stew.
-Yes, that's it.

1760
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,503
So that's the way.

1761
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,771
My gosh.

1762
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,506
-Does this look good?
-It's dripping.

1763
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,541
Bouilla-hooray!

1764
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,477
LOVE THE WORDPLAY

1765
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,345
It looks delicious.

1766
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,080
My mouth is watering. I'm jealous.

1767
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,548
-That must be good.
-Take a bite.

1768
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:27,549
I want some.

1769
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,218
-He makes it look so good.
-I want some.

1770
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:33,922
I don't have to try that
to know that it's good.

1771
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,991
Look at him now.

1772
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:39,128
EVERYONE IS IN AGONY, CRUNCH

1773
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,796
I'm jealous. It looks so good.

1774
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,431
-Man, dipping.
-That's how he's done.

1775
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,533
-That's it.
-That's what we do.

1776
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,470
-The sauce.
-That sauce must be good too.

1777
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,039
He tops some on the top.

1778
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:53,275
-Doing all right?
-I'm craving it badly right now.

1779
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,511
I saw you with your jaws dropped.

1780
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,779
IN A BITE

1781
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,415
-He makes it look so good.
-Today's a tough day.

1782
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,618
And he washes it down.

1783
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,353
-The finish.
-Bouilla-hooray!

1784
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:07,222
He's washing it down.

1785
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,158
He doesn't feel lonely anymore.

1786
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,260
-He's not lonely.
-You're right about that.

1787
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,129
-He has bouillabaisse by his side.
-He's not lonely.

1788
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:15,798
He's at L'Amant Secret.

1789
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:18,967
It's truly brilliant.

1790
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,838
"It's truly brilliant."

1791
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:26,342
It's such a shame
to explain this only with its flavors.

1792
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,510
The mix of the sauce and seafood

1793
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:33,015
was the best seafood dish
I have recently had.

1794
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:37,286
It's the taste of stew made by someone
who's very good at working with seafood.

1795
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,054
The pinch of red pepper powder.

1796
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,724
-I can feel it.
-You can?

1797
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,361
There's a hint of tasty spiciness.

1798
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,330
-I'm not good with spicy food…
-He's a gourmet.

1799
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,566
-…but I can eat this one.
-He's a gourmet.

1800
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:53,969
Do you want some?

1801
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,504
It's driving me crazy.

1802
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,039
It's driving me crazy.

1803
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,307
It's driving me crazy.

1804
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:03,579
-Please try some, Ji-hwan.
-He's having such a rough time.

1805
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,081
First, Cold Salad from Mimiru
by Chef Eun-yeong.

1806
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,549
Cold Salad from Mimiru.

1807
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:10,986
-Let me begin.
-That's the restaurant in the film.

1808
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,722
Cold Salad from Mimiru,
wishing for the film's success.

1809
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,625
-The meaning is significant too.
-Of course.

1810
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,128
-He must feel grateful.
-Nice.

1811
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,129
My gosh.

1812
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,897
Cold Salad from Mimiru.

1813
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,465
It tastes like Korean food.

1814
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,901
-I can eat 100 of these.
-What?

1815
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,269
The thickness is important.

1816
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,971
I could understand that.

1817
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:32,741
-I realized she had a reason as I ate.
-She had a reason.

1818
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,377
This is absolutely delicious.

1819
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,580
It felt like
I walked into a subtle forest of cilantro

1820
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:39,948
and eating this dish.

1821
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,718
-A forest of cilantro?
-In a forest of cilantro?

1822
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,787
-Are there cilantro forests?
-I've never heard that.

1823
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,156
-Like he's in a forest of cilantro.
-A forest of cilantro.

1824
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,525
Yes, the balance is perfect.

1825
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,926
ONE MORE

1826
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,929
Not only is it good while you eat it,

1827
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,665
but the aftertaste is unbelievable.

1828
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,267
The aftertaste?

1829
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,302
When you hear an excellent musician,

1830
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:05,140
you keep hearing the music in your head,
and that's what I'm feeling now.

1831
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,876
-She chopped salted clams inside, right?
-The salted clams.

1832
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:11,814
<i>-The fresh ocean scent keeps lingering.</i>
<i>-It does.</i>

1833
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,515
<i>The salted clams leave that aftertaste.</i>

1834
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,018
-Isn't it like sea cucumber viscera?
-Yes, you're right.

1835
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:19,922
Next, please try
Chef Jong-won's I'm Eating in Secret.

1836
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,557
That sauce.

1837
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,459
I'm Eating in Secret.

1838
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,099
It tastes warm and rich.

1839
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,168
It must be really tough to choose.

1840
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,905
This completely erased
the impression of the previous dish.

1841
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,807
IT DID AWAY WITH THE PREVIOUS DISH…

1842
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:43,545
He used the salted clams appropriately
to add nice flavors.

1843
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:47,316
I wouldn't feel lonely
if I get to eat this dish alone.

1844
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:51,653
It feels like I'm eating this
with my whole family on Christmas.

1845
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,323
-It feels warm.
-I can feel the warmth.

1846
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:57,359
He has a knack for not letting
the ingredients fight each other.

1847
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,795
-I see.
-He makes them hold hands,

1848
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,597
put their arms on their shoulders,

1849
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,465
and put them in the same uniform.

1850
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,934
That was really touching.

1851
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,003
-So it had a nice balance?
-Yes.

1852
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:11,340
-Cilantro adds a refreshing note.
-Yes, didn't it?

1853
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:14,376
It was a familiar and delicious flavor,

1854
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,445
but it finishes with a new flavor.

1855
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,980
What will he do? This is hard.

1856
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:20,148
What will he do now?

1857
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,951
His teacher
versus someone who's like family.

1858
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,686
I didn't know this show was so cruel.

1859
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,989
-Right? What will you do?
-It's so cruel.

1860
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,424
<i>Press one for Son Jong-won,</i>

1861
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:32,027
<i>and press two for Park Eun-yeong.</i>

1862
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,997
This is the toughest decision this year.

1863
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,598
-Yes.
-It's so hard.

1864
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:37,966
They both came ready.

1865
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,968
Don't think too much about it.

1866
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,503
Please press

1867
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,671
the button.

1868
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:44,840
Where's the exit?

1869
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,241
-Over there.
-Thataway.

1870
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:47,910
GOTCHA

1871
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,578
-Choose and dash?
-Choose and dash.

1872
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:51,480
-Choose and dash.
-He can choose and then leave.

1873
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,016
He's thinking of the time
he learned how to cook

1874
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:57,052
under Chef Eun-yeong for three months,

1875
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,821
-as well as the six years he spent…
-Don't look at him.

1876
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,058
-…as Jong-won's loyal customer.
-Every year on his wife's birthday.

1877
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:06,795
His head must be spinning
in many different ways.

1878
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,764
-Now, who will it be?
-He's trying to dash.

1879
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,399
-Is he fleeing?
-Where are you going?

1880
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,768
I'll cause the craziest scene
in the show's history.

1881
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,270
-Please have a seat.
-Please calm down.

1882
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,738
It must be really hard.

1883
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,941
-I'm so sorry!
-All right.

1884
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,043
-He pressed it.
-Which side was it?

1885
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,779
-Which one?
-He shouted in his thick voice.

1886
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,981
-All right, now.
-Goodness!

1887
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,450
Which chef did he choose?

1888
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,118
All right, now.

1889
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:32,955
Let's find out which one Woo-jin chose.

1890
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,057
-Show us the result!
-I can't watch this.

1891
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:38,093
A seafood dish behind my lady's back.

1892
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,095
Will it be his teacher, Eun-yeong?

1893
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:43,265
Or will it be Jong-won, who's like family?

1894
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,100
-He can't lift his face.
-Who is it?

1895
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,036
Who will he give the star to?

1896
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,705
Which side is it?

1897
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,740
Who did Woo-jin choose?

1898
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,742
What's the result?

1899
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:57,546
Show us!

1900
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,214
SON JONG-WON WINS

1901
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,816
Jong-won wins!

1902
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,217
I'M EATING IN SECRET WINS

1903
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,152
Son Jong-won wins!

1904
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,322
-Great work.
-He abandons his teacher!

1905
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:11,693
-I knew it. He chooses his family.
-He chooses his family.

1906
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,930
What did those three months mean?

1907
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,765
-He forgot it all.
-Yes.

1908
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:19,501
She used only the ingredients I loved,

1909
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:22,638
<i>and it immediately looked like</i>
<i>a piece of art.</i>

1910
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:24,306
I thought so,

1911
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:27,843
but Chef Jong-won's dish
was just a little closer

1912
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,411
-to my preference.
-I see.

1913
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:30,445
Above all,

1914
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:33,181
it felt like a dish
that comforted my lonely soul.

1915
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,983
-I see.
-That was why.

1916
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,386
-You need soup when you feel lonely.
-You do.

1917
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,121
Are you disappointed in any way?

1918
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,222
I'm sorry, my teacher!

1919
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,958
I was planning on going to the movies

1920
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,827
-for the first time in a while to see you.
-I see.

1921
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,696
I won't go to the movies ever again.

1922
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:51,533
-She's so cold.
-She's so feisty.

1923
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,137
You won't have 10 million audience,
but only 9.99 million.

1924
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,806
-It'll be 9.99 million.
-It will be. How unfortunate.

1925
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:01,243
-What a shame. Because of one person.
-And that one person is Chef Eun-yeong.

1926
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,846
This means Chef Jong-won gets a star!

1927
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,983
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1928
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,486
This is your seventh win, Chef Jong-won.

1929
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,989
Please take the golden Spam set
as your prize!

1930
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,892
-Congratulations!
-It's Jong-won's seventh win!

1931
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:32,107
