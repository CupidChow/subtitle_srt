1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,783
We're here with two men
loved by millennials and Gen Z,

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,618
Car, the Garden and Pani Bottle.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,721
Pani Bottle is truly

4
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,991
-the biggest travel vlogger in Korea.
-That's right.

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,993
<i>He has the most subscribers too.</i>

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,230
He currently has 2.49 million subscribers.

7
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,432
-He was the first travel vlogger…
-The top.

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>…to break one million</i>
<i>and two million subscribers.</i>

9
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,871
You're right.

10
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:41,441
-A revolutionary and a pioneer.
-What now?

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,876
-Che Guevara.
-Other vloggers

12
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,613
watched him
and became inspired to travel like him.

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,416
Kwaktube was one of those
who succeeded you, right?

14
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,785
He was unintentionally

15
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,353
influenced by me.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,522
At first, my mom was concerned.

17
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,691
<i>Back then, he had been working</i>
<i>at the Korean embassy in Azerbaijan.</i>

18
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,194
<i>And when you hear that,</i>
<i>it sounds like a decent job.</i>

19
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,297
<i>So when he quit that job</i>
<i>to become a vlogger like me,</i>

20
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,267
my mom became concerned
for making him quit his perfectly fine job

21
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,303
-into doing something so unpredictable.
-That's true.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,172
So I told her I didn't make him do it,

23
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,174
but that he decided
after seeing my bank account.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,508
He literally saw my account

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,112
because he asked how much I made,
so I showed it to him.

26
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,014
He later told me

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,216
that I didn't seem much more entertaining

28
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,819
or better looking than him,
that I didn't seem like much.

29
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,786
And you're traveling.

30
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,854
<i>But I was making much more than him,</i>

31
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,423
so he thought there was something wrong
with the world.

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,858
That's how he began his journey.

33
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,293
Thankfully, he became a success

34
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,529
and got involved
in many more TV shows than I have.

35
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,264
What does Pani Bottle mean?

36
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,834
The Hindi word for water is <i>pani</i>.

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,969
When I went to India,
the guy who sold water went…

38
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,404
Pani bottle.

39
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,172
<i>…"pani bottle" as he went around.</i>

40
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,008
I remembered that
just as I was about to open my channel,

41
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,410
so I just went with it.

42
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,412
I didn't expect to get famous
under this name.

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,048
So you're called a water bottle, right?
Mr. Water Bottle.

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,417
-Water Bottle?
-How many countries have you been to?

45
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,887
I've been to 71 countries.
It's not as many as you think.

46
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,921
-Seventy-one.
-Yes.

47
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,291
-There's an app that tracks your trips?
-There is.

48
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,494
Let's take a look at it
on the screen with our viewers.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,230
These are the countries
Pani Bottle has been to.

50
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,664
I didn't know there was an app.

51
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,468
I haven't gone to as many as I thought.
I've only been to 36%.

52
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,605
-That's 36% of the world?
-But you've been to 71 countries.

53
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,375
It doesn't show Antarctica on the map,

54
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,676
<i>but I've been there too.</i>

55
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,211
<i>-You've been there?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

56
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,513
<i>You've been to so many places.</i>

57
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,248
<i>He's been to a lot.</i>

58
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,517
You must've been to unfamiliar places.

59
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,253
Was there a place
most people haven't been to?

60
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,757
As far as I know, the country that told me
I was the first Korean to be there was

61
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,925
my most recent visit.

62
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,594
-It's called the Principality of Sealand.
-The Principality of Sealand?

63
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,429
<i>It's in the south of the United Kingdom,</i>

64
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,065
<i>a military offshore platform</i>
<i>established in World War II.</i>

65
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,768
<i>Someone declared independence</i>
<i>as a micronation,</i>

66
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,038
although it's not recognized,
but the UK leaves it alone as it's unused.

67
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,575
<i>The listed population is 30,</i>
<i>but only 1 person actually lives there.</i>

68
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,177
I went there and asked,

69
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,945
and no Korean has visited before.

70
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,813
-You've been there?
-Yes.

71
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,384
Oh, you've recently traveled
with Chef Sung-jun?

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,286
-Yes.
-Yes, we went to Italy.

73
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,887
<i>-Italy.</i>
<i>-Rome and Naples.</i>

74
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,355
They don't sell this anywhere else.

75
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,457
I showed him around as the local guide.

76
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,126
-The local guide?
-Sure.

77
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,827
<i>He showed us to a place he frequented.</i>

78
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,029
We finished everything.

79
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,263
It was perfect.

80
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,065
After I uploaded the video,

81
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,400
the newly updated reviews said

82
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,169
the lady who owned the place
decided to take Sunday off

83
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,739
because 600 Koreans showed up.

84
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,074
-It felt good.
-It was hard for her.

85
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,444
Napoli Matfia had a great influence
when it came to good restaurants.

86
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,146
People rarely believe what I say is good,

87
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,747
because my palate isn't sensitive.

88
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,217
Yes, you seemed to have a poor appetite.

89
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,151
I do,

90
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,953
-and I can eat whatever I get.
-Really?

91
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,290
He recently went public
that he is dating someone.

92
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,825
Can you tell us about that?

93
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,361
I didn't announce it because I wanted to.

94
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,631
It was when I went to see a fortune teller
on a travel program I did with Kian84.

95
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,932
I got really flustered

96
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,702
and asked the production crew,
"What do I do?"

97
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,870
-At first, they weren't going to air it.
-He can't lie.

98
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,206
But the writers convinced me and said,
"The way you looked was so funny."

99
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,541
-It was good.
-So I said,

100
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,076
"Sure, you can put it on air."

101
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,145
That's how I got to disclose it casually,
so I'm happy with it at this point.

102
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,381
-I see.
-Did your girlfriend understand?

103
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,350
She doesn't mind it.

104
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,685
She said,
"If you want to share it, go ahead."

105
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,153
That's good because it's something…

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,888
-What?
-…she may have wanted.

107
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,423
COULDN'T HOLD IT IN

108
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,826
PITTER-PATTER OPPA-NI BOTTLE

109
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,995
-I heard you two met while volunteering.
-Really?

110
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,498
The idea of a fan meet-up
sounded too embarrassing,

111
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,835
<i>so I wanted to do volunteer work with them</i>
<i>to meet them while doing good work.</i>

112
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,805
And among them,
there was someone I noticed.

113
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,842
Later on, she reached out to me,
so we began talking and all.

114
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,012
They've been dating
for a long time, actually.

115
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,548
-It's my longest relationship yet.
-That's great.

116
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,484
A man who travels

117
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,022
and who's also in love.
Let's find out what he has in his fridge.

118
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,090
-I'm looking forward to this.
-Yes.

119
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,726
He travels a lot, so…

120
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,229
-He must have sauces and ingredients…
-Yes.

121
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,830
-It sounds fun.
-…from around the world.

122
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,067
But first, even before
we open up the fridge…

123
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,468
It's like a duty-free shop.

124
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,537
-What are these?
-Isn't it a duty-free shop?

125
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,407
Look at this. This is the craziest yet.

126
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,275
He has so many.

127
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,279
<i>We've had guests who enjoyed drinking,</i>

128
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,815
-but this is something else.
-There are so many.

129
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,017
I have a hobby of collecting liquor,

130
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,820
and I like to buy bottles
that are different and unique.

131
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,090
So I have no idea
what some of those taste like.

132
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,694
We'll hear more about these
after we open up the fridge

133
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,862
and take a look at what's inside.

134
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,667
We might get to travel around the world
with the ingredients in here.

135
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,338
What does Pani Bottle keep in his fridge?

136
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,173
Let us present his fridge!

137
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,277
-What? He has drinks there too.
-He has drinks there.

138
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,411
Let us present his fridge!

139
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,848
-What? He has drinks there too.
-He has drinks there.

140
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,816
There are so many.

141
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,586
I store them there
because they have to be refrigerated.

142
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,788
-All he has is alcohol.
-Those that can be stored outside

143
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,190
-are out there.
-He only has drinks.

144
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,693
I wouldn't say
your fridge is neatly organized.

145
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,563
-You must've stashed everything in here.
-Yes.

146
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,365
The sausages haven't been organized

147
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,799
because those arrived

148
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,268
right before your production crew came,
so I tossed them in.

149
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,503
Okay.

150
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,637
What's this?

151
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,974
-That's wine from Hokkaido.
-Hokkaido.

152
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,275
Hokkaido wine.

153
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,845
Gran Reserva…

154
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,079
Uh…

155
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,647
Queulat?

156
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,416
-I don't know much about wine.
-You don't?

157
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,051
-I got some as gifts.
-In that case,

158
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,354
we'll have to talk
about these bottles anyway.

159
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,392
The one behind the crystal-something
is a bottle from Macau.

160
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,128
-I don't know what it's like.
-This one.

161
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,829
-It looks expensive.
-Look at the case.

162
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,132
So you don't drink these?

163
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,701
-You can't open it! No! You can't!
-Why not?

164
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,936
THEY'RE SURPRISED TOO

165
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,272
You know
what Chinese liquor is like, right?

166
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,975
Once you open it,
it's impossible to pack it up again.

167
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,476
There are lots of knockoffs,

168
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,011
so you must finish it when you open it.

169
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,679
I see.

170
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,716
Why do you treasure it so much?

171
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,484
-Can we open it and drink it?
-Let's do it.

172
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,953
-So we must have it once we pop it?
-We all have to have it.

173
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,321
And you don't want to do that?

174
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,556
No, we can drink it.

175
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,059
-Should I pop it?
-We haven't decided on a bottle yet.

176
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,594
He's flustered.

177
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,229
-After we make a decision.
-We can have this.

178
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,464
Let's have that one.

179
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,099
You seem stressed. Was this expensive?

180
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,435
And that one.
Make a decision before you open it.

181
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,903
RESPONDING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

182
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,505
-You can open the Chinese liquor.
-You can just open it like this.

183
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,774
-You can do that.
-We can open just the box.

184
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,944
-So you don't want us to pop it?
-Right. Just the bottle.

185
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,712
-They won't pop the bottle.
-How shocking.

186
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,215
-It looks valuable.
-Is this also Chinese liquor?

187
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,850
We can have it.

188
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,386
Just make a decision
and let me mentally prep myself for it.

189
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,888
I want to know what you're going to pop.

190
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,925
-It's not easy to pop the bottle.
-It's not.

191
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,727
-Do you see the skull-shaped bottle?
-This one.

192
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,730
I got it in America
because it wasn't available here.

193
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,333
Its eyes glow when you see it in the dark.

194
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,802
-These eyes?
-It looks scary.

195
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,405
-I got it for my dad.
-It looks mad…

196
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,906
-It's scary.
-…from that angle.

197
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,610
I got it for my dad but had to keep it
because he was too scared of it.

198
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,612
-"You keep it."
-It must be high-proof.

199
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,481
These two must be a set.

200
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,651
Those are liqueur,
drinks you can mix with milk.

201
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,987
You'll see
the same kind of bottle right below.

202
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,423
-That one's good too.
-It's from South Africa.

203
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,959
This is from South Africa?
The one with an elephant drawing?

204
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,360
FASCINATING

205
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,661
This looks special too.

206
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,364
-That's Andong soju.
-From Andong.

207
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,398
It's from Korea.

208
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,033
The clear bottle is from Bali,

209
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,536
-and the other box is from Dubai.
-From Dubai.

210
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,570
It's called arak.

211
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,740
-This is a unique bottle.
-South American liquor made with grapes.

212
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,876
-Brandy.
-South American brandy?

213
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,278
It looks so unique. How cool.

214
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,280
Open it on a great day with great people.

215
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,082
-A day like today.
-Sure.

216
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,650
These are all drinks too.

217
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,951
Did you buy this limoncello?

218
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,422
When I went to Italy,
I got it from Fabri's acquaintance,

219
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,559
and it was homemade liquor,
not store-bought.

220
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,028
It's on the stronger side
for you to have a shot after a meal

221
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,530
to help with digestion.

222
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,899
So it's like dessert liquor?

223
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,002
-People take it for digestive reasons.
-To help with digestion.

224
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,937
We might have that after the show, then.

225
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,372
It's like green plum tea.

226
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,473
UNDONE BOTTLE

227
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,841
Whoa, he almost dropped it.

228
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,576
I didn't open it.

229
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,544
It was open.

230
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,079
Why was the cap…

231
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,348
-He's suspicious.
-He's very sensitive.

232
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,816
It came undone as I put it down.

233
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,319
It seems we'll have to drink this one.

234
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,222
-It was homemade.
-We can't seal it again.

235
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,358
-It came out like this.
-It was closed before.

236
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,593
It smells so good.

237
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,895
-I've never smelled it, either.
-You haven't?

238
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,298
-It came undone.
-Yes, it came undone as I dropped it.

239
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,200
-It smells like juice.
-Because it's from Naples.

240
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,437
All right, then.
You have lots of great drinks.

241
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,373
Let's look for more ingredients.

242
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,243
This one… Nothing's on it.

243
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,278
That one is from the country
I just mentioned,

244
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,780
the Principality of Sealand.

245
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,715
They've started a cockle business.

246
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,317
-What?
-Cockle. The shellfish.

247
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,852
Those are cockles from the UK.

248
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,388
-I don't see a label.
-It doesn't have anything.

249
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,824
I got it for free as a souvenir.

250
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,895
I was already scheduled
to be on the show at the time,

251
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:00,266
so I kept it to have it together
in this great occasion with a great drink.

252
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,934
Thank you so much.

253
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,071
This is… What is this?

254
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,539
I had saved it for the show too.

255
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,740
-Gosh.
-This one too?

256
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,476
That's probably a can of sardines.

257
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,845
You can get the can marked with the year

258
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,180
-you were born.
-I see.

259
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,749
POP

260
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,453
-This one wants us to drink it right away.
-We should have it soon.

261
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,555
See? It keeps popping up by itself.

262
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,590
-All right. I'll have you later.
-It must be fate.

263
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,759
-We should have a shot after we eat.
-It's not even carbonated.

264
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,361
-Huh?
-I know.

265
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,328
What are these?

266
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,200
-What are these?
-I got them when I went to America.

267
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,669
-Space food.
-I went to see an aircraft carrier,

268
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,871
and they were selling space food.

269
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,806
You have three, so can we try one?

270
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,042
-We can have all three.
-Can we?

271
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,243
I'm kind of curious.

272
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,778
-Me too.
-It says space food.

273
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,681
-Let me open it.
-What's it like?

274
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,883
-This is it.
-It's wrapped in paper.

275
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,085
-Only this was inside.
-I've never seen it, either.

276
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,221
-It doesn't look so bad.
-Hey.

277
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,691
It looks like that ice cream sandwich.

278
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,326
-It does.
-Is it ice cream?

279
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,827
You eat that in outer space?

280
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,664
IT'S HARD, UNLIKE HOW IT LOOKS

281
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,298
-Have you had it?
-No, it's my first time.

282
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,833
-You haven't had it?
-No.

283
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,569
Cut it. You can just cut it.

284
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,338
-It breaks.
-It's like a snack.

285
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,673
It's good.

286
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,441
It tastes like dried meringue.

287
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,376
Oh, hardened meringue?

288
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,378
-It's good.
-It tastes like <i>dalgona</i>.

289
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,249
Do you know the marshmallow pieces
in that particular cereal brand?

290
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,451
-That's an accurate depiction.
-Those marshmallows.

291
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,853
Isn't this dessert? It's not a meal.

292
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,422
Hey, this was ice cream.

293
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,826
-These were ice cream.
-It says "Dried Ice Cream Sandwich."

294
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,994
It's good.

295
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,096
Did you try it for the first time
because of us?

296
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,399
Honestly, I had stocked up
on lots of things just for the show.

297
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,334
He hasn't had a lot of these.

298
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,271
-"One day, I'll be on the show."
-Even before this was sealed.

299
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,405
Really?

300
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,207
-I had a lot of unique things.
-You do.

301
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,408
So I wanted to show them.

302
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,178
It's the most unique yet.
We've never seen anything like this.

303
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,413
He still has lots of stuff in here.

304
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,849
Black Pepper Crab Paste.

305
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,453
I thought I might get invited
to <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>

306
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,789
-so I got it when I went to Singapore.
-He's been ready.

307
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,357
That sauce itself is delicious.

308
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,326
Do you also have lobster?

309
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,061
-No, I don't.
-Just the sauce?

310
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,296
-Just the sauce.
-Just that.

311
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,399
What can we do without lobster? Wait.

312
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,434
-Wouldn't they think of something?
-They would.

313
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,503
This looks like a meal kit.

314
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,272
<i>Al-tang,</i> fish roe soup
and <i>budae-jjigae,</i> sausage stew.

315
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,108
When I return to Korea,

316
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,278
the first thing I eat is
either <i>budae-jjigae</i> or raw fish.

317
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,613
He has to localize his tummy.

318
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,082
-I get meal kits instead of delivery food.
-Right.

319
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,119
-And the side dishes?
-My mom made those.

320
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,521
That <i>kkakdugi</i> is amazing with <i>makgeolli</i>.

321
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,156
I GET THAT

322
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,292
What's this between cola and this bottle?

323
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,195
I got that Chinese coconut beverage
from someone.

324
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,196
It's coconut milk.

325
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,065
-That's a famous one.
-It must've been Hainan.

326
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,002
If you put half a can of that
into a pot of curry,

327
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,606
-it'll taste like Thai curry.
-Thai curry.

328
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,508
So I use it like that and drink it as is.

329
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,109
I like the taste of that.

330
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,879
What kind of food do you always take

331
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,548
when you travel abroad?

332
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,651
It's really great if you take
<i>ramyeon</i> or <i>jjajang ramyeon</i> soup base.

333
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,353
Soup base for <i>ramyeon </i>and <i>jjajang?</i>

334
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,855
You'll often find kimchi
when you go abroad,

335
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,957
but it's hard to eat <i>jjajangmyeon</i> abroad.

336
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,759
-Right.
-So if you have the soup base,

337
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,530
you can mix it with pasta
and cook makeshift <i>jjajangmyeon</i> there.

338
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,732
That's a great tip.

339
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,502
Everything else is a mess,
but why are these cola cans lined up?

340
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,171
My girlfriend did that for me.

341
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,073
Why did she organize just those?

342
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,508
-Your girlfriend?
-Just the cola.

343
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,645
I have a can of cola as soon as I wake up

344
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,446
and another one for every meal.

345
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,949
It may look like a lot,

346
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,717
but I'll finish those
in three to four days.

347
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,486
-That quickly?
-Over here.

348
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,822
-Look at these.
-Lots of sauces.

349
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,826
Sauces. Soy dipping sauce, tuna sauce…

350
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,294
There are lots of sauces.

351
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,729
Do you use these to cook?

352
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,097
Actually, I don't.

353
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,866
My girlfriend does.

354
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,068
Does she come over to cook for you?

355
00:13:56,135 --> 00:14:00,105
She makes rolled omelet, soup,
and stuff like that.

356
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,307
LOOK AT THESE LOVEBIRDS

357
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,575
-Yo.
-Her cosmetics products

358
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,877
-are somewhere up there too.
-Where?

359
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,412
She has quite a share in this fridge.

360
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,348
-Let's see.
-Where are her cosmetics products?

361
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,951
-So these are all hers?
-Yes.

362
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,419
Why didn't she come?

363
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,422
I was thinking the same thing.

364
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,791
-She should've just come.
-We should've asked her.

365
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
-I guess so.
-All of these are hers.

366
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,395
-Should we open the fridge again?
-Why?

367
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,664
We present
Pani Bottle's girlfriend's fridge!

368
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,867
She played a huge part in it.

369
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,235
Next, the freezer.

370
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,536
Dried mixed berries.

371
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,138
The berries…
The blueberries were left behind

372
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,441
by my ex-girlfriend.

373
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,642
-Ex-girlfriend?
-Ex-girlfriend?

374
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,743
-Ex-girlfriend?
-Wait.

375
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,546
She brought that to make something for me,

376
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,780
and those were the leftovers.

377
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,116
-And you kept them.
-And I… It's not that.

378
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,151
The food isn't at fault.

379
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,887
-Traces can be left behind.
-Ex-girlfriend?

380
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,555
I really dread throwing food away.

381
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,523
I don't think he wants to eat these.

382
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,659
It expired on November 12th, 2024.

383
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,994
It's frozen, so it's fine.

384
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,530
-You're trying to keep it.
-Something's going on.

385
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,999
There must be a story.

386
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,135
-What story?
-I have a feeling.

387
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,570
-It doesn't feel…
-There's a story.

388
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,873
It's okay. You can keep that.
My perilla oil was probably left behind…

389
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,109
THAT WAS WHY HE LOOKED SO SENTIMENTAL…

390
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,510
-Was it significant?
-It feels like that.

391
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,345
-That's how it feels.
-Wait.

392
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,247
The perilla oil isn't at fault.

393
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,983
-No, the perilla oil isn't at fault.
-You shouldn't throw away food.

394
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,485
The perilla oil isn't at fault?

395
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,453
-And the blueberries.
-They're innocent.

396
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,821
Does your girlfriend know?

397
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,291
She also said,
"Blueberries are just blueberries."

398
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,192
-She's fine?
-She's chill about it.

399
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,962
-She sounds chill.
-That's great. She's a great person.

400
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,098
Then we need to know what's going on.

401
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,036
It doesn't matter if these are
from your current or ex-girlfriend.

402
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,338
-Tell us what you like.
-Yes.

403
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,173
-What do you like?
-I'm the type

404
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,609
who hates spicy food.

405
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,777
I prefer carbs,

406
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:49,315
and I also enjoy sweet things
as long as they aren't too sweet.

407
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,783
I have an appetite of a kid.

408
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,284
And the texture?

409
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,387
I like the chewy and gummy texture,
like rice cakes.

410
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,256
That's why you have these.

411
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,325
-You're right. He has rice cakes.
-The rice cakes.

412
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,794
Chef Ji-sun sent me those
on the bottom shelf.

413
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,195
She did?

414
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,097
-She sends lots of those.
-She keeps sending me those.

415
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,200
-She keeps giving me those too.
-Those and apples and whatnot.

416
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,469
-Send me some too.
-I will.

417
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,237
-And us.
-Why not us?

418
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,641
I like to send tasty things
to my acquaintances.

419
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,076
Well, I get it.

420
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,812
It means
I'm not Chef Ji-sun's acquaintance.

421
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,214
-Why didn't you become one?
-Right?

422
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,983
HMPH

423
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,885
That's not a bad idea.
What's this? Aglio e olio?

424
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,556
I got those from the clinic
while I was trying to lose weight.

425
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,091
Those are the leftovers.

426
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,559
Did you try to lose weight?

427
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,129
I've been taking some medicine,
and I'm off it now.

428
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,665
-I don't see why, though.
-I don't either.

429
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,201
-I've lost some already.
-Right now,

430
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,436
people are all over him,
saying he looks handsome.

431
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,337
They aren't all over me.

432
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,072
-That he looks like Lee Do-hyun.
-Lee Do-hyun.

433
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,241
My lowest was really rock bottom.

434
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,276
ARE THEY RELATED?
I CAN SEE IT FOR LIKE 1.5 SECONDS

435
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,346
That was all for Pani Bottle's fridge!

436
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,615
FINISHED CHECKING PANI BOTTLE'S FRIDGE

437
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,884
The top Korean travel vlogger,
Pani Bottle,

438
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:03,856
just gave us a tour of the world
in his fridge. So what are his orders?

439
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,492
Let us reveal his orders right now.

440
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,260
-Show us.
-It's probably unique.

441
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,330
-We go be binge eating.
-We go be binge eating.

442
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,699
"We go be" sounds like something.

443
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,268
I think it's a wordplay
on the name of the drug brand.

444
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,703
-Did you use that?
-Yes.

445
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,174
I couldn't even eat half of my old portion
after taking it.

446
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:27,079
I wanted to come and eat a lot,
just like I used to in the old days.

447
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,614
The portion isn't important, right?

448
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,918
I get full when I eat about 70%
of what a normal adult male would eat.

449
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:33,819
That should be enough.

450
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,890
But I hope it's mainly carbs
that have a good texture.

451
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,158
-Like rice cakes.
-Yes.

452
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,426
What's the next one?

453
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,295
Drinks from around the world.

454
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,363
Drinks around the world.

455
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,498
And by drinks, you mean alcoholic ones?

456
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,167
-Drinks from around the world.
-Around the world.

457
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,136
-I collected those for a day like this.
-Right?

458
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,139
You can pop whichever bottle you want.

459
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,408
But you have to tell me first.

460
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,643
You can use it to cook too.

461
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,512
I want them to cook something
that will go well with a drink

462
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,814
so that we can all share it.

463
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,284
I want to have a great time
with great people on a day like this.

464
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,086
Can we pop everything if we can have them?

465
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,255
Can you leave a few behind?

466
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,226
Four of you need to join the battles.

467
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,762
Sam, Nam-no, Ho-young, and Sung-jun.

468
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,763
That's right.

469
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,334
I'll fill the order titled,
"We go be binge eating."

470
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,504
He's someone who has binge eaten.

471
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,005
He's always binge eating.

472
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,807
That's his usual portion.

473
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,344
I've never known what it's like
not to have an appetite.

474
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,079
I couldn't connect,

475
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,916
-but I'll make him binge eat today.
-I see.

476
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,487
There are a few others
who have binge eaten over there.

477
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:45,824
-There are a few over there.
-Who binge eats regularly.

478
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,893
I'll show you how I became this big.

479
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,897
That was significant.

480
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,067
-He used to be lean and good-looking.
-Are you serious?

481
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,204
LEAN

482
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,311
I'll show you
how I'll bring his appetite back.

483
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,314
The two remaining chefs will cook dishes
to go with drinks

484
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,916
from around the world.

485
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,417
Sam versus Sung-jun.

486
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,552
-You two are up.
-The Italian chefs.

487
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,887
The Italian derby?

488
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:20,192
-I've never seen most of those drinks.
-Right?

489
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,960
Do you want to pop a few first?

490
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,896
If we can all have a taste of it.

491
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,831
We're going to have a party today.

492
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,933
So you're all looking
to pop a bottle, right?

493
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,668
All right. I'll keep that in mind.

494
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,104
You'll have to change your name
to Poppin' Bottle.

495
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,006
-Poppin' Bottle.
-Popping.

496
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,674
I'll accept my fate.

497
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,410
-I can always collect more bottles.
-Yes, of course.

498
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,414
Then let us begin the round
between Nam-no and Ho-young!

499
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:49,521
<i>This is the first battle with ingredients</i>
<i>from Pani Bottle's fridge.</i>

500
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,156
He's a man

501
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,526
who comes to <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
to binge eat for the day.

502
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,161
Chef Yoon Nam-no.

503
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,098
This man strains his stomach
by binge eating every single day.

504
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,968
Chef Jung Ho-young.
The two are up against each other.

505
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,103
The kitchen looks much smaller

506
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,773
-with both of you over there.
-Yes.

507
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,241
Can you two cook conveniently?

508
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,376
We'll be fine
as long as we aren't too close.

509
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,179
Let's take a look at the record.

510
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,183
Chef Ho-young is currently in the lead
with three consecutive wins.

511
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,552
-He's on fire these days.
-He is.

512
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,587
He's become stronger.

513
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,423
But when they were up against each other,

514
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,558
Chef Nam-no
had won against him once before.

515
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,126
Oh, so he's won before.

516
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,162
I've never had consecutive wins before.

517
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,830
I'm at one win right now.

518
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,900
I want to knock him over today

519
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,970
-and take my second win in a row.
-All right.

520
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,205
-You must break that pattern.
-Yes.

521
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,475
Anyway, they also look alike
as they stand next to each other.

522
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,978
We call Nam-no and Sung-jun doppelgängers,

523
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,480
but Nam-no and Ho-young are
the food fighting duo.

524
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,148
<i>The food fighting duo? Indeed.</i>

525
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,451
<i>-They eat a lot.</i>
<i>-They do.</i>

526
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:57,422
Actually, there's a YouTube clip
just of the two sampling the dishes.

527
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,690
Really?

528
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,792
The comments have blown up.

529
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,463
<i>"They seem to eat more passionately</i>
<i>than the fridge owners."</i>

530
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,866
<i>"Other chefs seem like</i>
<i>they're studying as they have a taste,</i>

531
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,435
<i>but these two are just here to dine."</i>

532
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:15,207
<i>"They look like a beaver and a badger</i>
<i>sharing food."</i>

533
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,642
Who's the beaver and who's the badger?

534
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,709
He's the beaver.

535
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,911
-He does.
-He looks like a badger.

536
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,079
Then, he's the badger.

537
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,748
The honey badger.

538
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,684
Do you come here to do cook-offs

539
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,319
or just to eat?

540
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,254
Honestly speaking,

541
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,922
my heart races so much

542
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,891
and disturbs my sleep
two days before the shoot.

543
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,194
You're like, "What delicious dishes
will I get to eat today?"

544
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,864
I'm like, "What will I get
to eat in two days?"

545
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,267
I also heard some people say
Chef Ho-young's beer belly

546
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,671
-was the source of his cooking skills.
-His cooking skills?

547
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,272
That's the theory.

548
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,907
That it's where he gets his power.

549
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,678
Well, I am a good chef,
so it must be where I get my power.

550
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,048
If that belly is
where his power comes from,

551
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,684
then Chef Nam-no also has a big one.

552
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,585
-His apron is about to rip.
-According to a source,

553
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,055
his uniform is currently

554
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,892
the biggest size among all the chefs.

555
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,193
It wasn't Chef Ho-young?

556
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,096
My size is exactly 4XL.

557
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,032
-There's a size like that?
-Just one.

558
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,601
But even this is slowly getting tighter.

559
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,072
-My apron is getting smaller too.
-He's growing his belly for power.

560
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,808
That's the last of his size.

561
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,278
If he gets bigger,
we'll have to make a new one

562
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,312
-or drop him.
-Drop him.

563
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,880
A NEW UNIFORM OR A NEW PERSON

564
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,349
The uniform is why he has to leave?

565
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,050
-We have no more fabric.
-No.

566
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,218
WHAT WILL THEY MAKE
WITH THEIR BELLY POWER?

567
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,154
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS:
BLACK PEPPER CRAB PASTE, COCONUT MILK

568
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,223
CRAB MEAT, WHITE WINE, OYSTER SAUCE,
MIXED SEAFOOD, FISH INTESTINE, AND MORE

569
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,925
Here's the dish I'll make today.

570
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,127
No Gratin Left Behind.

571
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,963
-No Gratin Left Behind.
-No Gratin Left Behind.

572
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,934
-I prepared something he'll finish.
-Gratin?

573
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,669
I actually need cheese to make gratin,

574
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,070
but he didn't have any.

575
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,239
So I'll use coconut juice
to make it richer,

576
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,209
use the chewy texture of macaroni,

577
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,777
and the umami of chili paste.

578
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,514
Your sense of hearing,
taste, visual, smell, and touch,

579
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,817
all five sensations will be satisfied
through this dish.

580
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,786
He's making mac and cheese.

581
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,722
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS:
KATSUOBUSHI SOUP BASE, OYSTER SAUCE

582
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,791
TOMATO SAUCE, BAR RICE CAKES, SAUSAGE,
SHRIMP, MILK, RAMYEON SOUP BASE, AND MORE

583
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,826
What are you making, Chef Ho-young?

584
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,061
I'm making Rosé Tteokbokki Tteokbokki.

585
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,729
-Rosé Tteokbokki.
-Rosé Tteokbokki.

586
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,030
He's so adorable.

587
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,966
Rosé Tteokbokki Tteokbokki.

588
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,769
I saw that
he had bar rice cakes in the fridge

589
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,438
and remembered
how he liked the chewy texture.

590
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,907
So I'll make rosé <i>tteokbokki</i>

591
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:33,211
by using <i>ramyeon </i>soup base,
ketchup, and oyster sauce

592
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,982
to make something that tastes very strong.

593
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,451
I'll also make <i>menbosha</i>, fried toast,
by using canned ham,

594
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,854
-and serve it with fried perilla leaves.
-Even <i>menbosha?</i>

595
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,458
He said he didn't have an appetite,

596
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,362
so I'll make something strong and rich
to bring it back.

597
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,600
Now, let us fill the order titled,
"We go be binge eating."

598
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,738
He's here to turn Pani Bottle
into Little Nam-no!

599
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,541
The Binge Eating Maniac, Yoon Nam-no!

600
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,278
He's going to prove
how he came to be this big today.

601
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,246
The binge eating Loopy,

602
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,682
Chef Jung Ho-young.

603
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,854
-He looks like it.
-He does look like Loopy.

604
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,325
Will Pani Bottle
turn into Binge Eating Bottle?

605
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,528
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

606
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,465
Begin!

607
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,568
Nam-no.

608
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,303
He's using instant rice first.

609
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,738
For now, this side looks busy.

610
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:40,145
Aren't Chef Nam-no's ingredients
more intriguing for you?

611
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,247
-Yes, I like coconut.
-Right?

612
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,215
And he's using alcohol?

613
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,983
-He's using many things I like.
-He is.

614
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,187
He didn't have many ingredients
to work with. All he had was alcohol.

615
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,223
1. PUT ONION, GREEN ONION IN BOILING WATER
TO MAKE VEGETABLE BROTH

616
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,458
-He's putting them in whole.
-Veggie broth?

617
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,994
-It's vegetable broth.
-Vegetable broth?

618
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,663
CALLS IT VEGGIE BROTH
AND ADDS KATSUOBUSHI SAUCE

619
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,633
-Into the veggie broth?
-Curry powder?

620
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,667
It's <i>ramyeon</i> soup base.

621
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,102
-<i>Ramyeon</i> soup base?
-<i>Ramyeon</i> soup base?

622
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,038
-That's just <i>ramyeon</i> with vegetables.
-Veggie <i>ramyeon.</i>

623
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,173
-Veggie <i>ramyeon.</i>
-Veggie <i>ramyeon?</i>

624
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,075
-Veggie broth is the best.
-It looks good.

625
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,712
-He's becoming more like Poong.
-He is.

626
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,415
-That much bread?
-Baguette?

627
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,551
Is he going to grind those?

628
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,521
-He's making breadcrumbs.
-It's to make breadcrumbs.

629
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:26,324
-But he's making <i>menbosha.</i> Right?
-Why is he using breadcrumbs?

630
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,592
It's used for deep-frying.

631
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,494
If it doesn't work…

632
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,264
-It won't move.
-You put in too much.

633
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,300
-Pull out some first.
-Be careful with your hand.

634
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,535
There's too much bread.

635
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,204
That's enough.
It'll move if it's not crushed.

636
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,907
-The blender always does this.
-That's a lot of bread.

637
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,010
THANKFULLY, IT GRINDS

638
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,745
The blender.

639
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,313
NAM-NO USES A BLENDER TOO!

640
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,182
Nam-no is grinding bread too.

641
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,419
These two chefs both eat a lot,

642
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,056
so they know how to increase
the rate of absorption for your body.

643
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,791
Breadcrumbs will speed up the process.

644
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,893
I think the dishes will be quite dense.

645
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,096
-Yes. Wait, he's frying those?
-He's deep-frying breadcrumbs?

646
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,098
I'm doing that

647
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,633
to add better texture.

648
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,103
In Italian cuisine,
fried breadcrumbs are sprinkled on pasta

649
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,172
-and are called <i>mollica.</i>
-He's right.

650
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,374
Is that shrimp?

651
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,642
He's grinding shrimp.

652
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,378
Well, he'll have to.

653
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,380
But what about the bread? I don't get it.

654
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,184
-Shrimp usually sits between the bread.
-Yes, the minced shrimp.

655
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,187
He must have a plan. He's a creative chef.

656
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,090
FINELY MINCED SHRIMP MEAT

657
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,326
And he's adding crab sticks?

658
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,795
-That has to be good.
-Looks good.

659
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,029
It looks good!

660
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,898
It must have great texture too.

661
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:43,735
That's Ho-young. He knows his stuff.

662
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,439
Chef Nam-no is
trying to satisfy all five senses.

663
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,541
Sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.

664
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,278
Where did I put the curry?

665
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,179
What do you need?

666
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,281
-Where's the curry? It's here.
-Curry?

667
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,349
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM

668
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,918
He's pouring curry powder in.
What are you making?

669
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,754
I'm making curry béchamel for the smell.

670
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,991
Curry béchamel? That's creative.

671
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,793
1. MIX FLOUR AND MILK INTO A POT
OF BUTTER AND CURRY POWDER

672
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,997
-He mixed flour and curry powder?
-That's a good idea.

673
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:16,635
There's a dish called <i>vadouvan,</i>
a French version of curry.

674
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,770
It'll taste great with coconut milk.

675
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,238
How is he going to use that?

676
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,606
It's probably the gratin base.

677
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,841
CHEESE SUBSTITUTE

678
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,842
It looks good.

679
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,477
TEAR

680
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,446
-We're seeing Spam again!
-Spam!

681
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,682
We're sick and tired of it from last week.

682
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,618
We had a lot last week.

683
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,487
HE'LL USE IT AGAIN

684
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,422
<i>Tteokbokki</i> is delicious with Spam.

685
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,623
-Yes.
-It is.

686
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,993
The Spam I keep is probably low-sodium.

687
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,663
Will he fry that?

688
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,931
-I see.
-He frying that?

689
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,667
He'll cover that with breadcrumbs.

690
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,803
-He'll use that to make <i>menbosha.</i>
-Spam is used as the bread.

691
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,373
Spam will act as the bread
for the original <i>menbosha</i> recipe.

692
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,577
This'll be really fattening.

693
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,714
It increases the absorption rate.
It'll seep right into your body.

694
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,384
-Spam as bread?
-He's putting breadcrumbs on the outside.

695
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,787
-He's using Spam instead of bread?
-Yes.

696
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,755
He's going to deep-fry that now.

697
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,258
-Like that?
-Like that?

698
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,826
My gosh. That's insane.

699
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,528
If you were going to do that,

700
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,163
why didn't you do it last week?

701
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,432
CAR, THE GARDEN, LOADED WITH SPAM

702
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,400
You're right.

703
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,936
-Why didn't he join the battle?
-Right?

704
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,106
Will Chef Ho-young
deep-fry breadcrumbs too?

705
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,141
I'll cover them with breadcrumbs
and then deep-fry.

706
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,077
Eggs and starch.

707
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,679
-Is that frying batter?
-Yes, in Japanese style.

708
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,782
-It'll turn into <i>menbosha</i> now.
-Like that?

709
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,318
He soaks it in eggs first,

710
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,053
and then the breadcrumbs.

711
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,289
He's coating it with breadcrumbs

712
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,725
to make it crunchy on the outside.

713
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,760
It already looks so good.

714
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,929
-Ho-young is ready to win today.
-He is.

715
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,998
Nam-no becomes anxious when he cooks.

716
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,300
ANXIETY LEVEL, HEAVY BREATHING

717
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,935
He's using perilla leaves!

718
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,136
He said he'd deep-fry those.

719
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,105
Nam-no is using perilla leaves too.

720
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,908
There must be a lack of ingredients.
They're all the same.

721
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,710
WHAT'S HE USING NEXT?

722
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,512
He's using crab sticks again.

723
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,347
-The ingredients are similar.
-Actually,

724
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,349
-he didn't have much.
-That's true.

725
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,151
-They're quite similar.
-It's inevitable.

726
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,755
He only showed of the things
he bought around the world.

727
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,090
-All he had were drinks.
-He had no actual ingredients.

728
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,992
ONION

729
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,060
GREEN ONION

730
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,728
Are you using onion and green onion?

731
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,096
CAN'T ANSWER

732
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:27,932
He's stir-frying those.

733
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,336
What did you throw in, Chef Nam-no?

734
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,005
I added fish roe and mixed seafood.

735
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,673
Fish roe from the meal kit.

736
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,143
-From <i>al-tang?</i>
-Roe from the meal kit.

737
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,546
But he hasn't started the <i>tteokbokki</i> yet.

738
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,881
HE'LL START NOW!

739
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,150
3. CHOP SAUSAGE AND ONION,
STIR-FRY IN AN OILED PAN

740
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,818
Why are you stir-frying sausage?

741
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,219
It's for <i>tteokbokki.</i>

742
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,888
There was no fish cake,

743
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,724
so he must be using those for more umami.

744
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,893
WHAT'S THE MASTER FOODIE'S NEXT STEP?

745
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,896
GRILLED BAR RICE CAKE

746
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,597
-He's grilling rice cakes.
-He's grilling them?

747
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,766
-I see.
-That looks good.

748
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,636
-It looks so good.
-Pani Bottle loves chewy texture.

749
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,371
I actually do make that at home.

750
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,506
So you'll grill those
and use them for <i>tteokbokki?</i>

751
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,308
Yes, I wanted to mix
two different textures.

752
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,911
I'll add some as is and some grilled.

753
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,312
He's using both textures.

754
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,916
That looks so good.

755
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,685
FREE HUG

756
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,287
Chef Ho-young, it's crowded here.

757
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,388
Is it?

758
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,389
EXPANDING

759
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,423
Is it?

760
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,491
INTRUDING

761
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,359
THE TWO MARSHMALLOWS ARE ON EACH OTHER

762
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,961
They're tussling!

763
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,930
The kitchen is too tiny.

764
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,534
The kitchen looks quite crowded.

765
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,205
These two big men look
even bigger from the back.

766
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,040
WHEN ONE OF THEM WORKS WITH FIRE…

767
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,976
Whoa. They're doing the same thing.

768
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,211
Decalcomania.

769
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,081
They're doing the same thing.

770
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,049
Decalcomania.

771
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:56,154
That's what he does with the wine?
When he stir-fries those?

772
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,023
He's getting rid of any odd smells
and adding some flavor.

773
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,759
What's that?

774
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,895
-The chili crab.
-The crab paste.

775
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,865
Chef Nam-no, can you leave some for me?

776
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,100
-What?
-Can you leave some?

777
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,969
Give me a minute.

778
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,639
Sam demands that he leave some behind
in this while.

779
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,874
It'll be too spicy, so…

780
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,075
ONLY HALF OF THE PASTE!

781
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,043
MIX, MIX

782
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,413
Grilled rice cakes taste so good.

783
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,650
-That burnt part is really good.
-Right?

784
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,085
That's where the flavor is.

785
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,053
My mouth is watering.

786
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,289
Is that milk?

787
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,024
He's making rosé <i>tteokbokki.</i>

788
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,827
A MAGICAL LADLE OF MSG VEGGIE BROTH

789
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,996
OYSTER SAUCE

790
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,831
TOMATO SAUCE

791
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,432
Shouldn't he use the broth?

792
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,301
-He did.
-I already did.

793
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,535
For a healthy flavor.

794
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,305
Didn't you say
you'll also use perilla leaves?

795
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,074
I'll deep-fry those with <i>menbosha.</i>

796
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,243
It looked pretty thick, though.
Haven't you started?

797
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,445
-You have six minutes. You should start.
-Hurry.

798
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,749
You'll have to start now
to fully cook the shrimp.

799
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,550
INTO THE OIL

800
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,585
<i>Menbosha</i> goes in.

801
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,020
The oil isn't hot enough.

802
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,955
-<i>Menbosha </i>goes in.
-<i>Menbosha </i>is

803
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,691
-cooked at low temperature.
-That's true, but…

804
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,227
Whoa, isn't that overburnt?

805
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,930
Whoa, isn't that overburnt?

806
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,665
-It's better when it's burnt.
-It's better.

807
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,800
I like the burnt parts.

808
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,136
Nam-no is fully focused.

809
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,873
-Look at his eyes.
-He's determined to get his second win.

810
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,274
CRAB STICKS

811
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,077
He's done with winning and losing.
He'll win and win again.

812
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,912
FRIED BREADCRUMBS, OUT

813
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,783
-I'm so sorry, but can you scooch over?
-Dang it.

814
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,918
CRAMMED

815
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,720
He's scooping the macaroni out.

816
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,889
He added pasta to béchamel.

817
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,693
FEELING CONSCIOUS AS HE HAS A TASTE

818
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:43,928
ADDING SALT

819
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,964
-Sung-ju, please report from the field.
-Yes?

820
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,365
-Yes, of course.
-Okay.

821
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,803
Let me try his rosé <i>tteokbokki</i>
with 4 minutes and 15 seconds left.

822
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,238
-The sauce.
-Let me try the sauce.

823
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,040
It's his rosé <i>tteokbokki.</i>

824
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,110
Will Pani Bottle binge eat that?

825
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,179
GOOD ENOUGH TO HIT THE BINGE BUTTON?

826
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,014
It's almost done.

827
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,349
-Yes, it is.
-It's almost done.

828
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,718
-It's very rich.
-Yes, it is.

829
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,554
It looks thin, but it's quite rich.

830
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,888
It's rich and delicious.

831
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,157
5. CUT THE GRILLED RICE CAKE INTO PIECES

832
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,393
He grilled rice cakes to make <i>tteokbokki.</i>

833
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,429
NAM-NO IS RUNNING AROUND OUT OF BREATH

834
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,133
ABOUT TO LOSE HIS BREATH

835
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,669
Topped with seafood.

836
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,137
4. PLATE THE CURRY MACARONI AND SEAFOOD

837
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,906
That's the fish roe from the <i>al-tang</i>.

838
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,074
Are you finished already?

839
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,609
-Yes.
-What?

840
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,145
Nam-no is moving quickly.

841
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,847
-Are you done?
-Gratin has to go in the oven.

842
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,883
-The oven.
-Oh, I see.

843
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,020
-You have 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
-But there's no cheese.

844
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,855
What's the point of putting it
in the oven without cheese?

845
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,990
-It'll get crunchy on the outside.
-Like the top?

846
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,525
This is macaroni, right?

847
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,027
RETURNS HUFFING

848
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,662
Did it turn out well?
I saw you cooking this for a long time.

849
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,563
ZOOM

850
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,601
Will no gratin be left behind?

851
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,603
He won't leave leftovers.

852
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,738
-No?
-Wow, Pani Bottle.

853
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,774
-This is good.
-Is it good?

854
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,745
WHY IS NAM-NO RUNNING?

855
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,347
TO GET HIS INSTANT RICE!

856
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,282
He's bringing over instant rice.

857
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:16,521
5. SERVE INSTANT RICE IN A BOWL

858
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,356
SPAM MENBOSHA IS ON ITS WAY

859
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,291
He's frying <i>menbosha </i>there.

860
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,261
The <i>menbosha </i>pieces are getting fried.

861
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,063
Can you try a sip of the oil?

862
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,864
SAMPLE THE BURNING OIL

863
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,866
DO YOU WANT SOME?

864
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,836
You both are out of your mind.

865
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,471
He puts a lot of work into this.

866
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,173
It has a strong curry flavor.

867
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,574
Curry?

868
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,809
-It's not him.
-I didn't use any.

869
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,577
NAM-NO IS USING CURRY

870
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,379
Wait, this tastes like curry.

871
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,481
-Why?
-Why does it taste like curry?

872
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,650
-From rosé <i>tteokbokki?</i>
-From that.

873
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:46,751
TRIES IT AGAIN

874
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,521
-You didn't use any curry?
-I didn't.

875
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,157
-That's odd.
-Did you try the gratin?

876
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,092
-Is the smell coming from here?
-Yes.

877
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,228
-But you tried that.
-That's impossible.

878
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,329
That's the curry.

879
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,865
You're fired as a host
if you lose your sense of taste!

880
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,767
This doesn't taste like curry.

881
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,069
-It's from this one.
-What are you talking about?

882
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,671
-He didn't use curry.
-That's impossible.

883
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,673
-Why would it taste like curry?
-This is odd.

884
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,007
Did someone put it in?

885
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,110
-Is the sausage curry-flavored?
-Yes!

886
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,344
-Oh!
-The sausage.

887
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,912
The sausage is curry-flavored.

888
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,248
The sausage is curry-flavored.

889
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,050
HE WASN'T WRONG!

890
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,419
Right? See that?

891
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,222
I said it tasted like curry
because it tasted like curry!

892
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,389
You were on point!

893
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,825
For you to ask why it tasted of curry…

894
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,328
-My gosh.
-That's Sung-ju for you.

895
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,629
I'm Kim Jang-geum.

896
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,133
-He was on point.
-I had curry-flavored sausage.

897
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,036
MINI-SPOILER
THE REAL JANG-GEUM WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK

898
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,709
6. MIX FRYING POWDER AND WATER
TO MAKE FRYING BATTER

899
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,412
HE BEGINS TO FRY THE PERILLA LEAF!

900
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,314
Why are you frying
only one side of the perilla leaf?

901
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,517
That's how it's done in Japanese cuisine.

902
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,219
And sprinkle it on the top? I see.

903
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,954
Two and a half minutes.

904
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:57,922
Two and a half minutes.

905
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,690
And breadcrumbs.

906
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,260
HE TALKS TO HIMSELF TO CALM HIMSELF DOWN

907
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,928
ANXIETY LEVEL

908
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,231
PULLING OUT THE GRATIN
WHILE LOOKING AROUND

909
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,170
IT'S COOKED WELL

910
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,472
ANOTHER LAYER OF MACARONI

911
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,007
It's almost time. A minute and a half.

912
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,309
-It's like that?
-Nam-no finishes up.

913
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,311
Delicious gratin. Hey!

914
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,312
A fire show?

915
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,248
Adding smoky flavor!

916
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,450
He uses a torch.

917
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,586
He's doing that without cheese?

918
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,489
ANXIETY EXPLODES

919
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,391
HO-YOUNG FINISHES UP TOO!

920
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,259
That one looks good.

921
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,562
He begins to serve his dish too.
A minute and ten seconds.

922
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,798
He's done frying the perilla leaf.

923
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,234
These both look really good.

924
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,969
TOPPING WITH FRIED BREADCRUMB

925
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,104
I don't know who'll win this round.

926
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,440
-Forty seconds!
-You have forty-five seconds!

927
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,676
He's topping it with rice cake pieces.

928
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,044
What's that?

929
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,145
<i>-Menbosha.</i>
<i>-Menbosha.</i>

930
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,215
-Was the shrimp cooked?
-It's cooked well.

931
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,583
-It's cooked well.
-It is.

932
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,518
The menbosha looks so good.

933
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,586
-It does.
-Yes.

934
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,655
Ho-young tops the <i>menbosha</i>

935
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,592
with just a dab
of low-calorie sweet chili sauce.

936
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,794
Twenty seconds left!

937
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,663
You have to put it in.

938
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,466
Ten seconds. Nine.

939
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,235
-There's no time.
-It's almost done.

940
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,736
You have to move quickly.

941
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,071
You have to finish up.

942
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,074
Nam-no's done. Five. Four. Three.

943
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,842
-Four. Three.
-Three.

944
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,511
Two. One. Ho-young!

945
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,715
-Ring the bell.
-Ho-young is finished too.

946
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,583
APPLAUSE

947
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,685
Great work. They're done cooking.

948
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,920
DISHES ARE LAUNCHED

949
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,455
Gosh, look at this.

950
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,156
They look so good.

951
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,625
Whoa, man.

952
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,260
That's how you cook Spam.

953
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,996
It looks so luxurious.

954
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:49,634
Both dishes were finished
just for Pani Bottle.

955
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,203
We go be binge eating.

956
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,405
They both look high in calories

957
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,507
and look rather filling too.

958
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,409
Actually, both dishes were

959
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,046
made only with the ingredients
that I love.

960
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,282
I already knew it'd be tough to choose.

961
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,416
I love all these.

962
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,352
I can't finish everything anyway,

963
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:12,523
so this much food is enough
to last two meals in a day.

964
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,759
Chef Nam-no finished cooking first,

965
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,128
<i>so please try No Gratin Left Behind first.</i>

966
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,897
STIR-FRIED SEAFOOD
COVERED WITH MACARONI GRATIN

967
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:25,903
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S NO GRATIN LEFT BEHIND

968
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,672
I have a favor to ask of you.

969
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,307
May I sprinkle black pepper on it?

970
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,508
Well, this is…

971
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,143
-May I sprinkle black pepper on it?
-Okay.

972
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,244
HO-YOUNG IS COOL WITH IT

973
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:37,315
-You should take it easy to your own kind.
-Ho-young lets him do it.

974
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,683
That belly

975
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,385
must also hold some generosity.

976
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,620
All right, Ho-young.

977
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,588
-That's too much.
-Isn't that a lot?

978
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,258
-It wasn't once.
-It'll taste like ground pepper.

979
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,393
It'll taste too strong,
so please mix it up.

980
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,561
Yes, sure.

981
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,129
I like ground pepper, though.

982
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,199
It's nice to see you give way to each
other, even though you're competitors.

983
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,668
It does look like gratin

984
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,303
even without cheese.

985
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,238
-Without cheese.
-Yes, even without cheese.

986
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,973
-Now, will you try it?
-Yes.

987
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,943
I'll try the macaroni first.
I like this pasta.

988
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,080
I hope he'll want to binge eat.

989
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,817
My gosh. It's so good.

990
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,987
I got your taste.
The sight was not bad, right?

991
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,023
I like the smell of coconuts,

992
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,392
so I loved that smell
mixed with some curry.

993
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,595
The mix of seafood with coconut milk

994
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,833
reminded me of Southeast Asia
and a bit of India.

995
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,334
Southeast Asia and India.

996
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,969
I haven't tried the perilla leaves yet.

997
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,038
YUM

998
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,774
CURIOUS

999
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,510
This is so new. <i>Al-tang</i> is a dish

1000
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,080
that usually tastes spicy
with fish roe and seafood.

1001
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:46,851
I can taste a bit of nice spiciness.
Is it the ground pepper?

1002
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,019
Yes, that too,

1003
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,323
and curry and fish roe
unexpected go well together.

1004
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,424
Curry's good with <i>al-tang.</i>

1005
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,025
You used fish roe from <i>al-tang?</i>

1006
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,927
Yes, those and innards.

1007
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,696
It can taste too rich,

1008
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,133
but the perilla leaves
seem to balance it out nicely.

1009
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,267
How do I eat the rice?

1010
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,870
I prepared that
because you said you liked carbs.

1011
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,840
-So he can eat it as he wants to.
-You can have it or not.

1012
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,177
-Will those go well together?
-Macaroni over rice.

1013
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,145
Macaroni over rice?

1014
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,881
-How crazy. You need that to get bigger.
-Bulking up.

1015
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,218
It'll taste like a Southeast Asian dish
if he tries it with rice.

1016
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,789
-It tastes like coconut curry.
-Oh, does it?

1017
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,359
But it's much better
with macaroni than rice.

1018
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,927
-I see. Without the rice.
-Yes.

1019
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,061
SUDDENLY GETTING NERVOUS

1020
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,464
The dish goes so well with his outfit.

1021
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,332
It's as if he's at a vacation spot.

1022
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,002
ENJOYING SEAFOOD GRATIN
AT A VACATION SPOT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

1023
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,737
-And some cola too.
-Or in India.

1024
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,439
You're right. I can see it.

1025
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,443
-It tastes a bit like Indonesian food.
-Indonesian food?

1026
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,244
It's seafood and curry.

1027
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,613
He travels a lot,

1028
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,017
so he knows right away
which country the dish is similar to.

1029
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,020
I didn't think this flavor would
go well with fish roe,

1030
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,354
but they go well wonderfully.

1031
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,489
NOM

1032
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:02,026
I thought fish roe was only good
in spicy fish soup.

1033
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,762
But they're served in a gratin now.

1034
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,831
-It's so good.
-I see.

1035
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,433
In Japan, fish roe is used
to make mapo tofu too.

1036
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,101
-I see.
-They go well together.

1037
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,872
I was inspired by that
and decided to use curry instead.

1038
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,142
-I should stop here.
-Yes, you'll get full.

1039
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,743
He won't be able to eat our food.

1040
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,545
-He just kept eating.
-He was binge eating.

1041
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,414
He was so immersed in eating.

1042
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,583
Why don't you try
Chef Ho-young's dish next?

1043
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,818
He made rosé <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1044
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,054
GRILLED BAR RICE CAKES
TURNED INTO ROSÉ TTEOKBOKKI

1045
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:34,358
SERVED WITH SPAM MENBOSHA
AND FRIED PERILLA LEAF

1046
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,696
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
ROSÉ TTEOKBOKKI TTEOKBOKKI

1047
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,598
There's one <i>menbosha</i> on top.

1048
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,802
-I think mine also lacks a bit of sauce.
-What?

1049
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,371
-May I serve some chili sauce?
-I see.

1050
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,440
It'll be funny if Nam-no says no.

1051
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,808
THAT SOUNDS FUNNY

1052
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,009
You should've said no.

1053
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,177
"No, you can't."

1054
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,815
You can try it as is,
and then dip it in the sauce as you like.

1055
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,183
What's the sauce for?

1056
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,252
<i>-Menbosha.</i>
<i>-Menbosha.</i>

1057
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,653
<i>Menbosha </i>looks good.

1058
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,655
It's your girlfriend's sauce.

1059
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,691
-It has zero calories.
-Zero calories.

1060
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,827
She's currently trying to lose weight.

1061
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,596
I have a habit of starting with rice cake,
so may I do that?

1062
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,198
Sure, go ahead.

1063
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,766
Yes, it's that rice cake.

1064
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,501
The texture must be nice.

1065
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,938
He grilled it and mixed it with the sauce.

1066
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,107
-The grilled rice cake.
-He'll love it.

1067
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,744
How did he grill
the rice cakes so deliciously?

1068
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,178
-It's perfect.
-Is it?

1069
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,413
It doesn't get stuck in my mouth.

1070
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,148
RELIEVED

1071
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,517
It's not too burnt either.

1072
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,119
And it's not too sticky?

1073
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,621
It cuts through easily as you chew it.

1074
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,757
Let me try this now.

1075
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,259
It's the <i>menbosha.</i>

1076
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,728
-It looks good.
-<i>Menbosha </i>made with Spam.

1077
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,864
-There's shrimp in the middle.
-Yes.

1078
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,299
-I have a tiny mouth.
-You do?

1079
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,301
He tries to eat it in one bite.

1080
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,536
-Really?
-Oh, no. You can't.

1081
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,104
-Yes, take a bite.
-Eat it in a few bites.

1082
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,106
You have to try the chili sauce too.

1083
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,310
-How will shrimp and Spam work?
-I wonder.

1084
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,145
It'll probably go well.
It's pork and shrimp.

1085
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,881
-Pork and shrimp go well.
-They're always a win.

1086
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,683
Man, the shrimp is really good.

1087
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,388
-Try the sauce.
-The chili sauce is sweet,

1088
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,358
so try that for a different flavor.

1089
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,727
-He has a reason for serving that.
-Of course.

1090
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,562
His girlfriend's sauce.

1091
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,031
What's it like?

1092
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,201
-It's so good.
-I see.

1093
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,036
FEELING PROUD

1094
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,005
It tastes salty when I just eat this,

1095
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,174
but it becomes sweet and salty
with the sauce.

1096
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,843
So I like the balance
of switching between the two.

1097
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,345
VARIOUS WAYS TO ENJOY IT

1098
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,414
Next, the rice cake of rosé <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1099
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,316
-It has to be good.
-It looks good.

1100
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,322
It really tastes like curry.

1101
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,657
-Doesn't it?
-Yes.

1102
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,593
-It does taste like curry.
-Is it from the sausage?

1103
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,662
If Chef Nam-no's curry
was Southeast Asian curry,

1104
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,797
this is more Japanese curry.

1105
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,065
-What?
-Does it or doesn't it?

1106
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,101
-It tastes like curry.
-I told you.

1107
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,836
Ho-young says he didn't put it in.

1108
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,738
-It's like mild Japanese curry.
-It is.

1109
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,439
-Is it the sausage?
-It must be the sausage.

1110
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,807
The curry-flavored sausage…

1111
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:04,975
IT'S NOT JUST THE SAUSAGE

1112
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,712
THE KETCHUP WAS CURRY-FLAVORED TOO

1113
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,347
Was this intentional?

1114
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,982
The sausage

1115
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,884
carried a bit of curry flavor.

1116
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,786
So I wanted to add a subtle flavor.

1117
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:18,922
I guess the flavor got stronger.

1118
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,357
TIME FOR THE CRUNCHY PERILLA LEAF

1119
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,861
-Fried perilla leaf.
-They give off similar vibes.

1120
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,830
-He's binge eating.
-I think he's eating a lot.

1121
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,200
-This is really good.
-He's enjoying the dish.

1122
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,135
He's binge eating.

1123
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:32,536
YUM

1124
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,605
Gosh, it's so good.

1125
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,240
NERVOUS, RELIEVED

1126
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,808
Why don't we try these too?

1127
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,677
No Gratin Left Behind.

1128
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,545
This is Chef Nam-no's dish.

1129
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,813
It's so good.

1130
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,451
-It tastes like curry.
-It's good.

1131
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,919
It's delicious.

1132
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,189
It's the texture of the perilla leaf.

1133
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:56,060
Perilla leaves usually don't leave
a big impression with their texture,

1134
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,529
<i>but when I had it with breadcrumbs,</i>

1135
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,599
<i>it also made perilla leaves</i>
<i>a bit of a crunchy texture.</i>

1136
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,702
-You're right.
-Yes.

1137
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,570
He didn't even add much.

1138
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,673
I thought the lack of cheese
would be evident,

1139
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,911
<i>but I loved how it tasted rich</i>
<i>like there was cheese even without it.</i>

1140
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,946
It's really good.

1141
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,283
It's the breadcrumbs
adding the crunchy texture

1142
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,618
<i>-to the soft and chewy gratin.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

1143
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,220
I liked that contrast.

1144
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:27,257
And the perilla leaves refreshed my mouth,
which allowed me to continue eating.

1145
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:31,428
-It would taste amazing with white wine.
-That sounds good.

1146
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:35,099
Next, Chef Ho-young's rosé <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1147
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,872
It tastes like something I can get

1148
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,507
at a tiny pub in an alley
somewhere in Osaka.

1149
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,675
Ham-katsu.

1150
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,844
It's ham-katsu with shrimp on the inside.

1151
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,281
Car, the Garden goes for the <i>menbosha</i>
and dips it in the sauce.

1152
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,083
You already had lots of Spam. Is it okay?

1153
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,619
He also used Spam to make this.

1154
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,057
-It's a different genre.
-I see.

1155
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,458
-Gosh.
-It's good.

1156
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,762
-It's great, and it'd be good with rice.
-The rice cake is so good.

1157
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,030
-Like curry.
-Isn't the rice cake good?

1158
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,266
-The rice cake is really good.
-It is.

1159
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,667
-Spam is…
-Yes?

1160
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,904
…really good when it's made into <i>menbosha.</i>

1161
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,641
-I was surprised.
-Right?

1162
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,076
From now on,

1163
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,844
I'll never grind anything again.

1164
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,046
Don't.

1165
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,215
-Deep-fried dishes are the best.
-Yes.

1166
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:30,387
And now, we await Pani Bottle's choice
after he had a chance to binge eat.

1167
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,022
<i>Press one for Yoon Nam-no.</i>

1168
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,758
<i>Press two for Jung Ho-young.</i>

1169
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,795
Make your decision and press the button!

1170
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,265
CONTEMPLATING

1171
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,534
Surprisingly enough,
it seems like Korean cuisine.

1172
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,802
-Did you press it?
-I did.

1173
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,270
He made his decision.

1174
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,740
Pani Bottle finally let himself go
and binge ate today.

1175
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,544
Which one of the two dishes
could he eat more?

1176
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,946
Let's find out the result. Show us!

1177
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,349
We go be binge eating.

1178
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,752
Ho-young will win
four times in a row if he wins today.

1179
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,688
Nam-no will begin his winning streak
if he wins.

1180
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,889
I know, yet I'm nervous.

1181
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,692
Who did Pani Bottle choose?

1182
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,228
-Show us!
-What's his choice?

1183
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,030
Who made him binge eat?

1184
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,433
JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1185
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,836
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
ROSÉ TTEOKBOKKI TTEOKBOKKI WINS

1186
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,339
-My gosh.
-Ho-young's fourth consecutive win!

1187
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,775
He now ties for second place on the show.

1188
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,343
His yummy belly.

1189
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,811
I was agonized over this

1190
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,481
and decided it was meaningless
to make my decision on the taste

1191
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:35,586
because both dishes were made
exactly to my liking.

1192
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,988
While I wondered how I should decide,

1193
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,456
I suddenly realized

1194
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,126
I didn't need rice to eat this dish.

1195
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:47,064
It was perfect as is,
so it went overboard with the rice.

1196
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,432
It was the third wheel.

1197
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,201
If he didn't do that,
I couldn't have chosen one

1198
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,870
-because I loved both of them.
-Right.

1199
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,706
-Anyone can serve anything if that's okay.
-Exactly.

1200
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:59,209
-I can just bring kimchi. Yes.
-Whatever works is the winner.

1201
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:03,247
It actually would've been better
if I had it with <i>tteokbokki</i>.

1202
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,581
BOO-HOO

1203
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,216
He served it because he liked carbs.

1204
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,219
-You said you liked rice.
-He did. What did Nam-no do wrong?

1205
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,623
-The macaroni was so good.
-He already served pasta.

1206
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,924
As soon as he saw the rice cake,

1207
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,893
-he went, "It looks so good."
-It looks so good.

1208
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,061
-He said that while it was on the grill.
-Did he?

1209
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,229
The round ended there.

1210
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,499
-I should've served rice cake.
-It was rice cake, not rice.

1211
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,468
Ho-young wins four rounds in a row.

1212
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,272
He's now tying for second place.

1213
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,173
-Already?
-Yes.

1214
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,478
-That was so delicious.
-He's doing as well as Ji-sun!

1215
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,014
-Thank you.
-Congrats! You're on a winning streak!

1216
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,715
-Thank you for the dish.
-Four wins in a row!

1217
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,817
-It was really good.
-Really?

1218
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:45,188
<i>Let us begin the second round with</i>
<i>ingredients from Pani Bottle's fridge.</i>

1219
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:50,360
The two who officially can't take alcohol
are cooking with international drinks.

1220
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,564
Chef Sung-jun, who needs one glass of beer
for the entire team dinner,

1221
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,000
is up against Chef Sam,

1222
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,469
the man who never shows up.

1223
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,438
HAPPY TO SEE THE AWFUL DRINKERS

1224
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,474
But according to my sources, both men

1225
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,978
actually know their stuff
when it comes to alcohol.

1226
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,814
Well, in my case,
it's kind of awkward for me to say it,

1227
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,350
but I'm a licensed bartender

1228
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,885
and a sommelier.

1229
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,987
Also, my restaurant probably

1230
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,990
has the largest selection
of Italian wine in Korea.

1231
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,259
-I'm serious about alcohol.
-I see.

1232
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,193
Chef Sung-jun.

1233
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,396
If it's awkward to say those things,
just don't.

1234
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,000
Wait, it's Hyun-suk pointing this out?

1235
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,601
Isn't this ironic?

1236
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,871
Is this what it's like
to hold up a mirror in front of you?

1237
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,373
He came to a realization.

1238
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,541
SELF-REFLECTION?

1239
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,577
On the other hand, Chef Sam
learned about alcohol by doing labor.

1240
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,046
Ever since I got into Italian cuisine,

1241
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,949
I've spent some time over 20 years
going back and forth from Italy

1242
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:50,120
to learn to pair dishes with wine
by working there in real life.

1243
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,955
It's different from textbooks.

1244
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,123
FLASHES HIS CANINE TOOTH
AND SHOWS CONFIDENCE

1245
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,958
-It's different.
-It's not in the books.

1246
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,626
POKER FACE

1247
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,895
But there was a piece of his past
he had been hiding.

1248
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,163
-What?
-What is it?

1249
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,165
It turned out

1250
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,433
-that in the past…
-Yes?

1251
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,801
-…when he was younger…
-Yes?

1252
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,603
…he was a heavy drinker.

1253
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,038
-Really?
-Really?

1254
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,807
-Five bottles of soju was his limit.
-Five?

1255
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:11,942
-Really?
-Five?

1256
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,176
-Really?
-Yes.

1257
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,544
-Five bottles?
-Really?

1258
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,679
-Is this true?
-No way!

1259
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,514
It was a bit exaggerated.

1260
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,949
-Four?
-Four bottles.

1261
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,018
-Man.
-Four is still a lot.

1262
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,854
-Did you quit drinking after marriage?
-Yes.

1263
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,288
He was a heavy drinker.

1264
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,190
In this line of work,

1265
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,359
-we'd feel empty when we got home.
-Right.

1266
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,196
-So I always drank with my colleagues.
-You did?

1267
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,731
-No way.
-I see.

1268
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,933
-It's hard to imagine now.
-Tell me about it.

1269
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,503
-He was choosing not to drink.
-How's that possible?

1270
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,705
Chef Sung-jun is now facing

1271
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,241
his biggest crisis since joining the show.

1272
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,078
-He has lost three times in a row.
-Oh, no.

1273
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,047
But this says you said

1274
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,883
that you're glad
you've lost three times in a row.

1275
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,118
-Yes, it's even better.
-Why?

1276
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,222
I took first place when I participated
in <i>Culinary Class Wars.</i>

1277
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,525
That was ages ago.

1278
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:06,363
I didn't think it benefitted me
to keep carrying that kind of stern image.

1279
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,397
THAT'S ENOUGH

1280
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,666
I wanted to come off as easygoing

1281
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,134
and humorous here,

1282
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,471
while thinking positively
that I still had a long way to go.

1283
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,906
I CAN'T STAND IT

1284
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,008
He's the type who makes you feel fed up.

1285
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,676
All right, now.

1286
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,912
-We're getting tired.
-All right.

1287
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:25,215
But Chef Sam said
he'd take Sung-jun down for good today.

1288
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,684
He said he had been on a losing streak,

1289
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,821
and I've recently fallen
into four consecutive losses.

1290
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,690
He'll know how it really feels
after losing four times.

1291
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,326
That's true.

1292
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,996
-Four is the magic number.
-Three is still not enough?

1293
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,933
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
BLACK PEPPER CRAB PASTE, CRAB MEAT

1294
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,001
CANNED COCKLES, TUNA SAUCE, LEMON JUICE,
CLUB SODA, ARAK, AND MORE

1295
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,970
My dish is called

1296
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,107
What Do You Know About Arak?

1297
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,076
-What Do You Know About Arak?
-What Do You Know About Arak?

1298
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,945
Arak was that drink, right?

1299
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,580
That one over there.

1300
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,616
-It's an alcoholic drink from Bali.
-From Bali.

1301
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,953
I'll pair this in two ways,
at room temperature

1302
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,188
and when it's chilled,

1303
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,892
so I plan to make two different dishes.

1304
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,362
-You said you liked Vietnamese cuisine.
-Yes.

1305
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,798
You don't have any Vietnamese ingredients,
but I'll make it get close

1306
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,434
-in scent and acidity.
-Is that possible?

1307
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:21,605
I'll use fish sauce and make something
that tastes like <i>bun cha</i>.

1308
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,906
-<i>Bun cha.</i>
-Yes.

1309
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,977
He had tuna sauce,
so I'll make use of that

1310
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,579
and make a similar cold noodle dish.

1311
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,815
Also, I wouldn't call it a stew,

1312
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,216
but I'll use crab paste

1313
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:37,954
and just the soup of this
Daegu-style <i>yukgaejang,</i> spicy meat soup,

1314
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:42,592
to make a soup dish
that tastes like Vietnamese cuisine.

1315
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,361
Same drink
paired in different temperatures.

1316
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,829
-That's awesome.
-That's amazing.

1317
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,731
I heard you also took the cockles.

1318
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:48,865
Yes.

1319
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,234
I've actually never seen this before,

1320
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,804
-but they look neatly organized.
-How nice.

1321
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,773
-Whoa, it's just the meat.
-That looks good.

1322
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,009
This is something he saved for the show.

1323
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,043
Where did you get those again?

1324
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,412
-The Principality of Sealand.
-Sealand.

1325
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,514
-The resident there.
-It was a gift, right?

1326
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,650
And he opened it here.

1327
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,586
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS:
MIXED SEAFOOD, LEMON JUICE

1328
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,655
LIMONCELLO, PISCO,
SHRIMP, MILK, BAR RICE CAKE

1329
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,190
I prepared a dish called

1330
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,258
I Go Chile,

1331
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,994
You Go Down.

1332
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,400
I Go Chile, You Go Down.

1333
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,969
He'll punch, and Sam will go down.

1334
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,238
That was provocative.

1335
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,840
The drink I'm using today

1336
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:34,010
-is called pisco, from Chile.
-I see.

1337
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:37,314
-The moai-shaped bottle.
-Yes, the moai-shaped bottle. I'll use it

1338
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,084
to make pisco sour,
a cocktail usually served in Chile.

1339
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:45,555
I want to reinterpret that and mix it
with limoncello, a drink from Naples,

1340
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,457
and make something new.

1341
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,960
When we went to Naples,
one of the dishes he enjoyed the most

1342
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,728
was lemon pasta.

1343
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,531
So I'll make the same kind of lemon cream

1344
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,100
and serve it with deep-fried meringue

1345
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,803
filled with shrimp,
rice cake, and cuttlefish.

1346
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,038
I'll serve that with the cream.

1347
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,673
-I see.
-Deep-fried meringue?

1348
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,577
Let us begin the next round,
drinks from around the world.

1349
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,780
Chef Sam Kim will return
to his heavy drinker days

1350
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,250
and cook a dish perfect for a drunkard.

1351
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:16,753
But Chef Kwon Sung-jun is here

1352
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,657
to give a spicy chili blow
to take Sam down today.

1353
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,493
This is a do-or-die round
between Italian chefs.

1354
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,996
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1355
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,331
THE ITALIAN DERBY STARTS

1356
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,601
It's the Italian derby.

1357
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:32,769
PULLING OUT

1358
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,573
What are you taking? A hangover cure?

1359
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,908
-Already?
-It's a hangover cure. I'm taking it now.

1360
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,343
I have to get ready.

1361
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,879
How much is he going to drink later?

1362
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,414
HE BEGINS TO WATCH

1363
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,284
The two Italian chefs.

1364
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,053
Napoli Matfia versus Sam Kim.

1365
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,255
1. STIR-FRY ONION STRIPS IN A BUTTERED PAN

1366
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,758
He's making roux.

1367
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,727
I think he'll make something thick.

1368
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:01,197
-He's making onion béchamel.
-It's béchamel again?

1369
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,366
Who did that earlier?

1370
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,301
Me.

1371
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,436
-I did, and I lost.
-So you did!

1372
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,706
I see. Are their fates sealed together?

1373
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,208
Is this the curse of béchamel?

1374
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,711
Four losses in a row is kind of rough.

1375
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,682
<i>Ramyeon</i>?

1376
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,784
No, just the noodles of <i>bibim-myeon.</i>

1377
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,385
He didn't start from scratch?

1378
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,621
He rarely uses pre-made noodles.

1379
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,122
-Right?
-Gosh, but he is.

1380
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,824
In the previous season,

1381
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,927
he was known as a naturalist
who made healthy dishes.

1382
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,497
-But he does everything now.
-He picks up <i>ramyeon</i> noodles just to win.

1383
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,832
It came with his canine tooth.

1384
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,667
CHEONGYANG PEPPER, GARLIC

1385
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:41,104
He doesn't care what it is
as long as he can win.

1386
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,741
If he loses, he'll go back to his old way
and chug three bottles of soju.

1387
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,043
TUNA SAUCE, +MSG

1388
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:47,977
GLANCES

1389
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,245
+SUGAR

1390
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:54,317
2. MIX VEGGIES WITH TUNA SAUCE, SUGAR,
LEMON JUICE, AND SOY SAUCE

1391
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,386
SECOND PAN, ONION BÉCHAMEL

1392
00:55:56,453 --> 00:56:00,023
Chef Sung-jun is boiling
limoncello and lemon juice.

1393
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:04,394
-You mean the open bottle of limoncello?
-Yes.

1394
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,196
-Rice cake!
-Is that rice cake?

1395
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:09,399
Ho-young used that
and won the previous round.

1396
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,267
The rice cake itself was good.

1397
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,635
That's a great rice cake.

1398
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,405
Is that cuttlefish?

1399
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,275
He cut the cuttlefish really nicely
into pine cone shapes.

1400
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:20,744
Isn't it ready-made?

1401
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,846
-Is it? He didn't cut that?
-It is.

1402
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,848
-It was in the mixed seafood.
-It was?

1403
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,517
Yes, I had mixed seafood in the freezer.

1404
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,121
-Is that frying batter?
-He must be deep-frying that.

1405
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,691
He's mixing rice cake and seafood
into frying batter.

1406
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:37,994
He had stir-fried onion and flour,

1407
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,931
and he just mixed that
with boiled limoncello and lemon juice.

1408
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,700
I hear they originally use lemon peel.

1409
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,469
You're right. That's often the case,
but you didn't have any.

1410
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,839
Sung-jun has an upper hand

1411
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,575
because he recently traveled
with Pani Bottle.

1412
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,079
THIS TIME, DARK SAM USES CRAB STICKS

1413
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,981
It is the Italian derby.

1414
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,683
INTO THE PAN!

1415
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,319
GREEN ONION

1416
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,621
INTO THE PAN!

1417
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,891
-Those are the cockles.
-Cockles.

1418
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,660
-The cockles look pretty.
-They look so pretty.

1419
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,328
Are the cockles seasoned?

1420
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,998
I think so. You can eat it as is.

1421
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:18,168
Is he going to rinse
the noodles right away?

1422
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,439
-To stop from overcooking.
-I think he's cooling the noodles

1423
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,275
-to make it look like <i>bun cha.</i>
-Like <i>bun cha.</i>

1424
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,311
AND HE MAKES BUN CHA SAUCE

1425
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,046
SUGAR, SESAME OIL

1426
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,450
FISHING OUT THE CHILLED NOODLES

1427
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,352
You're putting the <i>ramyeon</i> into the sauce.

1428
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,353
Yes.

1429
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,656
4. MIXING NOODLES
WITH SOY SAUCE, SUGAR, AND SESAME OIL

1430
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:40,924
GREEN ONION

1431
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,125
COCKLES

1432
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,026
CHEONGYANG PEPPER

1433
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,663
5. MIX NOODLES WITH GREEN ONION,
COCKLES, AND CHEONGYANG PEPPER

1434
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,431
BUN CHA-STYLE NOODLES ARE READY!

1435
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,200
TAP TAP

1436
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,937
SEPARATING THE WHITE AND YOLK

1437
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,174
-He's making meringue!
-Meringue!

1438
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,742
SHOWS HIS SPIRIT BY MAKING MERINGUE!

1439
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,644
Sung-jun makes meringue!

1440
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,448
HE'S EXTREMELY DETERMINED!

1441
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,983
-He's so good at it.
-Yes.

1442
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,819
I Go Chile, You Go Down.

1443
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,121
Sung-jun continues to make meringue.

1444
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,991
-He must be dying to win today.
-He must be.

1445
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:18,828
-He's even making meringue.
-He can't lose four times in a row.

1446
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,664
-I didn't know he had lost three times.
-Right?

1447
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,800
That's why youth is great.

1448
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,602
If we did that,

1449
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,338
-we would've had to stop twice.
-We needed breaks.

1450
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,206
A few breaks.

1451
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,675
-What's he adding?
-Frying powder.

1452
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,010
-Frying powder?
-Frying powder.

1453
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,712
-And eggs?
-And eggs.

1454
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:40,483
MIXING TO MAKE EGG YOLK FRYING BATTER!

1455
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,886
ADDS THE MERINGUE INTO THE MIX!

1456
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,655
Meringue becomes soft like sponge
when it's deep-fried,

1457
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:49,526
so I was worried when he said
he wanted to fry meringue.

1458
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:53,830
But he just mixed egg yolk
with frying powder and the meringue.

1459
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,900
-I wonder how that'll turn out.
-I see.

1460
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,802
-It's coming together.
-His arms are in pain. He's exhausted.

1461
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,172
It must feel similar to bread.

1462
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,342
-It'll rise.
-That's how we make soufflé omelet.

1463
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,211
LEMON CREAM SAUCE

1464
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,282
SAM HAS TO MAKE TWO DISHES
FOR TWO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES

1465
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,383
What did he put in?

1466
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,784
What was that paste?

1467
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:18,154
-This one? The crab.
-Like a chili paste.

1468
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,189
There's the <i>yukgaejang</i>.

1469
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,425
-Daegu-style.
-He's using just the soup.

1470
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,061
He only gets the soup out like that.

1471
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:26,396
He's good at squeezing it out.

1472
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,464
-Without the solid ingredients.
-Just the soup.

1473
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,033
-No solid ingredients?
-No.

1474
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,367
What a waste.

1475
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,637
<i>Yukgaejang</i> is straight up Korean food,

1476
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:38,007
but he's trying to make it taste
more like Vietnamese cuisine, right?

1477
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,777
AND HE BEGINS TO MAKE THE FRYING BATTER

1478
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,580
They're both using starch.
Are they both frying something?

1479
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:47,050
7. MIX FRYING POWDER, WATER, EGG, AND SALT
AND MAKE FRYING BATTER

1480
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,484
You have eight minutes.

1481
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,320
-You have eight minutes.
-Eight minutes.

1482
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,388
I see. He's doing it like that.

1483
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,559
-That's very delicate.
-Isn't the temperature too low?

1484
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,394
-Is it hot enough?
-He'll fry it like that.

1485
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,563
-It's too low.
-He can't use high heat.

1486
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,464
But still.

1487
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,333
-Is that right?
-Is it the right temperature?

1488
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,634
No, it has to be 170 degrees.

1489
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,270
Is there something inside?

1490
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:10,239
He's frying cuttlefish, shrimp, and more.

1491
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:14,677
-Cuttlefish, shrimp, and rice cake.
-He's putting it in like that.

1492
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:15,878
The batter looks amazing.

1493
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,081
-He's using shrimp too?
-Yes. Shrimp, cuttlefish, rice cake.

1494
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,916
SAM BEGINS TO DEEP-FRY TOO!

1495
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,720
He's making fried seafood too.

1496
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,388
What? You're right.

1497
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,790
HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE
FRIED VS FRIED

1498
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,360
They're different
because he made this with meringue

1499
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,695
while Chef Sam's dish is regular fritters.

1500
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,697
-Just eggs and powder.
-I see.

1501
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,933
The textures will be different, then.

1502
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,401
8. FRY CRAB STICK AND ONION

1503
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,538
Drinks usually go better
with red soups, right?

1504
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,706
-Right.
-Yes.

1505
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:46,743
I'm a bit more drawn
to the red-colored soup.

1506
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,346
He said Pani Bottle enjoyed
lemon pasta a lot in Italy.

1507
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,383
That's why he's using the lemon sauce.

1508
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,619
It's much harder
to pair cocktail with food

1509
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,287
compared to straight drinks.

1510
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,490
-Because of the flavor.
-Yes, because they're flavored.

1511
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,925
-We drink cocktails on their own.
-Yes.

1512
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,395
METICULOUS

1513
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:09,265
COATING SHRIMP WITH BATTER

1514
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,601
Sung-jun fries the shrimps.

1515
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,237
He has to be delicate with the fries.

1516
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,805
It's probably not crunchy.

1517
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,941
-It'll turn into softer fritters.
-Right?

1518
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,377
Naples is famous for fritters,
so he'll do well.

1519
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,913
I think it'll become flat

1520
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,749
if he doesn't eat it quick.

1521
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,653
Chef Sung-jun is making something
to pair with pisco,

1522
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,057
while Chef Sam is making something
to eat with arak.

1523
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,024
GOLDEN BROWN

1524
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:38,428
THE CRAB MEAT AND ONION FRITTER IS DONE!

1525
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,996
They have five minutes.

1526
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,631
-Five minutes.
-Five minutes left.

1527
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,000
-Please go, Jung-hwan.
-I'll be back.

1528
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,469
Those look good. The fritters are ready.

1529
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,004
They remind me of donuts.

1530
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,639
It's the Italian derby.

1531
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,240
It looks great.

1532
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,342
-Not bad.
-Have those been fried?

1533
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,444
I should make use of it.

1534
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,344
Me too.

1535
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,014
CALL 113 TO REPORT TECHNOLOGY LEAKS

1536
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,483
Yours look neat and delicious.

1537
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,418
-The shrimp and all.
-Thank you.

1538
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,519
This looks cool.

1539
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,088
RUN!

1540
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,990
THE ICE HE KEPT IN THE FREEZER

1541
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,927
SAM WANTS TO PAIR THE DRINKS
ACCORDING TO TEMPERATURE

1542
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,162
They both went for the ice.

1543
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,630
-Both ice?
-Why ice?

1544
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,467
The ice cubes are stuck together!

1545
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,536
Are they both making cocktails?

1546
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,572
So, one has arak in it.

1547
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,173
DISH - ICE - DISH

1548
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:26,476
SAM BEGINS BY SERVING THE FOOD

1549
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,411
-Pisco.
-Pisco?

1550
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,813
He's now making a drink.

1551
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,714
POPPED

1552
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,417
Chef Sung-jun is a certified bartender.

1553
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,054
He's using a jigger.

1554
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,623
-Is that the opened limoncello?
-It's lemon juice.

1555
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,559
Lemon juice. There's the limoncello.

1556
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,462
-Limoncello.
-Limoncello goes in.

1557
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,233
SAM FIGHTS BACK WITH ARAK

1558
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,201
They have to serve it with the drinks.

1559
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,370
9. MIX ARAK, ICE, CLUB SODA,
AND LEMON JUICE IN A SHAKER

1560
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,105
That side too? Wait.

1561
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,107
He has a shaker.

1562
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,146
-It's a cocktail.
-Shake it.

1563
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,181
He's not certified. His shake needs work.

1564
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,583
-Are you going back to your old way?
-Are you done?

1565
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,619
Why didn't you shake harder?

1566
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,121
-I'm busy.
-Think of your old days.

1567
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:15,191
-It's turning murky. The arak.
-It really is.

1568
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,093
-It turns murky when mixed.
-I'm busy.

1569
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,096
I'm not seeing anything finished here.

1570
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,198
I don't see any dishes.

1571
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,567
I'm running out of time.

1572
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:29,605
-He's trying to make the drink smoother.
-Pisco sour, made with only egg whites.

1573
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,340
He's putting eggs in there?

1574
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,177
-Pisco sour is made with egg whites.
-I see.

1575
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:36,345
That'll make the cocktail smoother.

1576
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:42,485
YOU CAN MAKE A COCKTAIL
IN 20 SECONDS? REALLY?

1577
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,056
The way he shakes is extraordinary.

1578
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:50,126
HE'S NO. 1 IN SHAKING!

1579
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,194
IMPRESSED

1580
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,030
He's adding a slight texture to it
with the egg whites.

1581
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,032
You'd think it'll smell eggy,

1582
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,466
but it turns smoother.

1583
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,735
SAM BEGINS TO SERVE THE FOOD

1584
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,373
THE BUN CHA NOODLES LAND INTO AN ICE GLASS

1585
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,642
So, he used <i>ramyeon</i>.

1586
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:10,279
-Did you put the cockles in there?
-I did.

1587
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,781
Looks good.

1588
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,184
The fritters are indeed different
from ordinary fritters.

1589
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,087
And the meringue fritters…
Are you frying these again?

1590
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,989
Can you try that sauce?

1591
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,791
-The sauce?
-The lemon sauce.

1592
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,626
This lemon sauce.

1593
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,495
-It doesn't smell like lemon.
-No?

1594
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,597
Why not?

1595
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,632
-But it's lemon sauce.
-Where did the lemon go?

1596
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,901
It doesn't smell much like lemon.

1597
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,669
-Let me try it.
-Okay.

1598
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,639
So? Will it make Sam go down?

1599
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,775
Will it make Sam go down?

1600
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,644
The lemon will make him go down.

1601
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,114
I can't smell it,
but it tastes like it in my mouth.

1602
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,116
You have two minutes left.

1603
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:52,088
Kids would love a dish
that looks like that.

1604
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,190
-Are those the fried meringue pieces?
-Yes.

1605
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:58,060
Meringue mixed with egg yolk
and frying powder.

1606
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,596
-They look like chicken nuggets.
-Don't they?

1607
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,965
-You have two minutes.
-Two minutes?

1608
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,234
You have two minutes.

1609
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,335
BUN CHA-STYLE NOODLES ARE READY!

1610
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,739
THE BUN CHA SAUCE INTO THE SAUCE BOWL!

1611
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,475
BUN CHA SAUCE IS READY TO GO

1612
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:13,910
AND LASTLY?

1613
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,345
What's this?

1614
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,614
-It's the soup.
-The soup.

1615
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:19,515
Topping it with fritters?

1616
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,218
-I'll serve it separately.
-He's using a lot of lemons

1617
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,353
after hearing that Pani Bottle likes them.

1618
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,424
-Look at that.
-Straining it. Precision till the end.

1619
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,692
One minute.

1620
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,561
13. STRAIN PISCO SOUR AND SERVE

1621
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:33,496
Be careful now.

1622
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,864
You have one minute left.

1623
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,132
Chef Sung-jun is finished.

1624
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,300
I GO CHILE, YOU GO DOWN COMPLETE

1625
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,135
Chef Sung-jun is done.

1626
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,203
SAM IS FINISHING UP TOO!

1627
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,040
THE CRAB MEAT AND ONION FRITTER IS DONE

1628
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,208
One minute. Fifty seconds left.

1629
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,510
CHECKING THE SOUP'S SEASONING

1630
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,412
What's it like?

1631
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,147
-It's good.
-Did it turn out okay?

1632
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,715
And the cocktail.

1633
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,984
Sam is finished too.

1634
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,552
Great work.

1635
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,822
This one was really… honestly…

1636
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,124
How am I supposed to pick one?

1637
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:03,960
Carefully.

1638
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,628
You made lots of dishes.

1639
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,595
-He made a lot.
-That's a lot.

1640
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:10,066
Sam made lots of food in that short while.

1641
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,568
And now,

1642
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,505
both dishes were made
and paired with drinks around the world.

1643
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,374
-Sam made lots of food.
-He did.

1644
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,675
-That's a lot.
-Right?

1645
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:23,379
Is he thinking that one of them
is bound to go with the drink?

1646
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:24,914
Maybe that's why.

1647
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,285
But first, try Chef Sung-jun's dish,
I Go Chile, You Go Down.

1648
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,487
A COCKTAIL MADE WITH PISCO FROM CHILE

1649
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,524
SERVED WITH FRIED MERINGUE IN LEMON CREAM

1650
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,996
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
I GO CHILE, YOU GO DOWN

1651
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,430
The fried meringue.

1652
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,533
-He made it in a unique way.
-He did.

1653
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,069
These are different from the fritters
we ate together in Italy.

1654
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,170
But…

1655
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,639
-they look very classy.
-I see.

1656
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,708
-Do I start with the drink?
-With the drink, please.

1657
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,411
-The pisco sour.
-I made a refreshing drink.

1658
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,315
WHAT'S THE COCKTAIL
OF A CERTIFIED BARTENDER LIKE?

1659
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:02,585
Sung-jun is a certified bartender.

1660
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,221
-It's good. I can taste the lemon.
-Is it?

1661
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,422
It's not too strong.

1662
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,357
Pisco sour with fried meringue?

1663
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,027
Drop the knife.

1664
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,928
-He wants to cut meat.
-Stop that.

1665
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:13,996
I want a bite so much.

1666
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:18,534
It tastes like a lemon cocktail
with an adequate amount of alcohol.

1667
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:19,869
Does it smell like eggs?

1668
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,404
No, not at all.

1669
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,072
You added egg whites, right?

1670
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:27,043
<i>The egg whites will protect your stomach</i>
<i>from high-proof alcohol.</i>

1671
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:29,145
The eggs will eliminate
the smell of alcohol

1672
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,913
while the egg smell disappears
behind the drink.

1673
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,815
It's a great combination.

1674
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:33,949
It's super smooth.

1675
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:36,652
JEALOUS GARDEN

1676
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,322
-This should go well with it.
-That's shrimp, cuttlefish, and rice cake.

1677
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,824
-Is this shrimp?
-It is.

1678
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,958
-It is.
-Yes, it's shrimp.

1679
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:44,193
BITE

1680
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,494
SO CURIOUS

1681
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,662
What's the texture like?

1682
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,565
WHOA

1683
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:53,502
-The fritter wasn't crunchy.
-But soft?

1684
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,371
-Yes, it was soft and tender.
-Soft.

1685
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,373
-Like donuts.
-At times,

1686
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,575
fritters will scrape
the top of your mouth, right?

1687
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:00,943
That can't happen with this,

1688
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,144
even if you tried.

1689
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:05,014
-Even if you try to scrape it?
-I see. Soft fritters.

1690
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,849
Is it like donuts?

1691
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,218
-Yes, it's like donuts.
-Like a donut.

1692
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:11,987
I can taste the lemon in the sauce.

1693
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,989
-Does it work well?
-Yes.

1694
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,460
It tastes like lemon,
but it's not sour at all.

1695
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,029
It tasted like lemon but gently.

1696
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,397
BITE OF RICE CAKE

1697
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,065
Gosh.

1698
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,867
-The rice cake is so good.
-The rice cake?

1699
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,403
-The rice cake?
-He just like rice cakes.

1700
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,605
-He just likes it.
-He's just into the rice cake.

1701
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,807
He likes it a little too much.

1702
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,642
He just likes rice cake.

1703
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,077
Change your pseudonym

1704
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,412
to Pani Rice Cake.

1705
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,181
He likes the rice cake so much.

1706
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,918
It tastes like something we ate together
at a classy restaurant in Europe.

1707
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,019
I love it.

1708
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,722
But does it go well with the drink?

1709
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,325
It wasn't too sour or anything.

1710
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,426
-Not too strong?
-No.

1711
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,195
<i>It might have been boring if these were</i>
<i>the same kind of lemon flavor,</i>

1712
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:56,465
but he interpreted lemon
in different ways.

1713
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,202
This feels refreshing
while this tastes smooth.

1714
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,138
-I see.
-I love it. It's so good.

1715
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:06,142
Next up, Chef Sam's dish,
What Do You Know About Arak?

1716
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,743
BALI'S LIQUOR, ARAK AND A COLD COCKTAIL

1717
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:13,749
3 VIETNAMESE-STYLE DISHES,
NOODLES, SOUP, AND FRITTERS

1718
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:18,354
CHEF SAM KIM'S
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ARAK?

1719
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,456
There are three different dishes.

1720
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,557
LAVISH

1721
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,158
You'll see a bowl of sauce.

1722
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:26,762
You can sprinkle that over the noodles
and have them.

1723
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,430
-This on the noodles?
-Yes.

1724
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,466
You can try the cold cocktail first.

1725
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,435
-So that and the noodles next?
-Yes.

1726
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,537
SNIFFING

1727
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,938
I can't smell anything.

1728
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,339
I've never had arak before.

1729
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:38,741
FEELING CURIOUS

1730
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,180
It's a bit sour and a bit sweet.

1731
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,681
It's sour?

1732
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:46,982
DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COCKTAIL…

1733
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,585
It's smooth,
but it doesn't taste like alcohol.

1734
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,120
It must be because it's cold.

1735
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,057
-Pour a bit of the sauce over the noodles.
-The sauce.

1736
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,194
I like <i>bun cha,</i>
but I've never had it like this.

1737
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,597
I wonder what it'll taste like.

1738
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,465
CURIOUS

1739
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,467
Because of the cockles,

1740
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,937
it tastes like whelk and noodles.

1741
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,406
-You're right.
-It feels like that.

1742
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,107
It doesn't feel like <i>bun cha.</i>

1743
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,776
That tastes a little sweet,

1744
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,444
but this is a bit saltier.

1745
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:19,548
It's because I made it with tuna sauce
instead of using the usual fish sauce.

1746
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,917
-But it's good.
-I see.

1747
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,919
ANOTHER BITE RIGHT AWAY

1748
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,622
Cockles from the Principality of Sealand.

1749
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,594
Next, the lukewarm drink.

1750
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,628
Man!

1751
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,064
-Is it different?
-It hits strong.

1752
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,166
The temperature change
must've been significant.

1753
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,567
He must like hard liquor.

1754
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,803
-He must love to drink.
-Man.

1755
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:41,704
WOW!

1756
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,572
He must like this better.

1757
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,773
BINGE-BOTTLE MODE, ON

1758
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,008
This must be better.

1759
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,276
He eats so deliciously.

1760
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,645
-Do you like the sauce?
-It's good.

1761
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,982
It's somewhere between
the whelk dish and soba.

1762
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,016
-But it's good.
-I see.

1763
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,050
SOUP'S TURN

1764
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,952
And next, cuttlefish and crab sticks.

1765
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:59,521
-Try the soup too.
-With the soup, yes.

1766
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,523
Please try the soup.

1767
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,426
You added just the <i>yukgaejang </i>soup, right?

1768
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,128
And he added lemon juice.

1769
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:11,267
I can sense <i>tom yum </i>brushing by
in the midst of this Korean soup.

1770
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,036
It almost becomes <i>tom yum,</i>
and then it turns away.

1771
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,071
But not all the way?

1772
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:19,074
-It's like a transit flight.
-Yes, yes.

1773
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:21,010
Yes, at Don Mueang International Airport.

1774
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,978
A connecting flight there.

1775
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,848
The fritters look so good.

1776
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,851
A bite of the fries.

1777
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:33,088
This sauce goes so well

1778
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:36,158
-with the stronger shot.
-Do they work better?

1779
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,394
It must bring out the smell.

1780
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,563
It's greasy and salty, right?

1781
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,465
So it goes better with the stronger drink.

1782
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,269
This is bad. What do I do?

1783
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,905
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S DYING TO TRY IT

1784
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,174
-Is this for me?
-Tell me if you don't finish.

1785
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:54,810
Would you like a sip?

1786
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,946
DRINKER JUNG TAKES A SIP

1787
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,083
Hey, it's good.

1788
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:07,089
NAM-NO TAKES A… GULP?

1789
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,191
HE CHUGGED IT

1790
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:10,693
You downed it.

1791
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,194
When did he finish that?

1792
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,799
I love the lemon scent toward the end.

1793
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,368
The egg whites push it down.

1794
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,837
Would you like a drink, Car, the Garden?

1795
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:23,605
-It looked too strong.
-The drinks?

1796
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:24,940
This one is really smooth.

1797
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,942
-Then may I try just this one?
-Sure.

1798
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,778
We don't have a lot of drinks,
so just one for Car, the Garden.

1799
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,046
You should relieve your hangover.

1800
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,182
All right.

1801
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,783
I see. It's good.

1802
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,819
-The foam.
-You got foam on you.

1803
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,887
It's as if he's drinking cappuccino.

1804
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,524
-The foam.
-You got foam on you.

1805
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,793
It's because of my mustache.

1806
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,694
The foam kiss.

1807
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,764
Didn't you just say you didn't want a lot?

1808
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,532
-This is good.
-Is it?

1809
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,235
It looks even better
getting it on his mustache like that.

1810
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,805
-Give him that too. Try the food too.
-Try this one.

1811
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:57,706
This too.

1812
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,275
I almost finished this.

1813
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,145
It has to go well with the drink.

1814
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,815
-It goes so well together.
-The two go well?

1815
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,617
Gosh, this is good.

1816
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,586
Didn't he say he won't eat?

1817
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,221
-His appetite came back.
-Yes.

1818
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,590
CHEF SAM KIM'S
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ARAK?

1819
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,525
TAKES A SIP OF ARAK FIRST

1820
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:17,793
Arak's great.

1821
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,028
Was the drink okay?

1822
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,331
-It's nice.
-He says it's nice.

1823
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,466
SLURP

1824
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,369
NODDING ENDLESSLY

1825
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:28,937
That's a different reaction.

1826
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,372
This is great.

1827
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,742
Arak must go well with noodles.

1828
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:34,743
Yes.

1829
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,212
Didn't you say you didn't want the drink?

1830
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,115
His appetite suddenly came back.

1831
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,584
-Wait a minute.
-He's the type who can't lie.

1832
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,353
These two are great too.

1833
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,825
That dish is by Chef Sung-jun,
and the drink is from Chef Sam.

1834
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:53,595
-They're both good at what they do.
-They are.

1835
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,464
It was so delicious.

1836
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,933
-This must be tough to choose.
-It really is.

1837
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,635
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

1838
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,537
<i>Press one for Kwon Sung-jun.</i>

1839
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,071
<i>Press two for Sam Kim.</i>

1840
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,108
Think of this as a rule.

1841
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,510
This is too hard to choose.

1842
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,712
-I pressed it.
-Did you?

1843
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:11,947
All right.

1844
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:15,083
Which dish did Pani Bottle choose?

1845
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,819
Let's find out. Show us!

1846
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,088
Drinks from around the world.

1847
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,257
It was a round between Sam and Sung-jun.

1848
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:25,727
Sam has lost four times in a row before,

1849
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:28,664
and it'll happen to Sung-jun
if he loses today.

1850
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,699
They must both win.

1851
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:34,169
Who did Pani Bottle choose?

1852
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,705

1853
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,507
Who is it?

1854
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,710
KWON SUNG-JUN WINS

1855
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,846
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
I GO CHILE, YOU GO DOWN WINS

1856
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,849
Kwon Sung-jun takes the victory.

1857
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,584
He ended his losing streak.

1858
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,022
At first, I thought of picking
Chef Sam's dish.

1859
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:57,192
-Yes?
-Because the strong arak

1860
01:14:57,259 --> 01:15:00,529
went so well with the salty noodles.

1861
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,031
If I go out with friends to drink,

1862
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,700
I'd pick Chef Sam's dish.

1863
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,602
But if I wanted to try something new

1864
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,303
or have a drink with a significant other,

1865
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,006
Napoli Matfia's dish would seem novel.

1866
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:14,776
It wouldn't have been easy
to use lemon to create two flavors,

1867
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:15,878
but he did that.

1868
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,046
-I chose him after a lot of thinking.
-I see.

1869
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,182
That was the Italian derby.

1870
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,951
Sung-jun, how does it feel
to end your losing streak?

1871
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,822
I must've had the advantage
because I was familiar with his palate.

1872
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,557
That's why I won.

1873
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,527
He suddenly took some rice cake
at the very last minute.

1874
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,362
It must've been
because he knew how much he liked it.

1875
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,364
Why did he use some rice cake?

1876
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:40,502
Chef Sung-jun ends his losing streak
and wins a star.

1877
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,471
-His losses have ended…
-It was delicious.

1878
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,805
…thanks to Pani Bottle.

1879
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,109
-Congratulations, Sung-jun!
-Thank you for the food.

1880
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,811
Thank you. It was delicious.

1881
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,315
The guest we have been waiting for
is finally with us today.

1882
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,818
Please welcome today's guests!

1883
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,322
Thank you for inviting me today.
I'm Lee Young-ae.

1884
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,924
"Because it tasted like soft persimmon."

1885
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,493
I've been binge-watching the show.

1886
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,994
I wanted to meet Chef Nam-no.

1887
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,996
Did you really?

1888
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,731
I've been keeping a garden.

1889
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,300
-Did you pick these there?
-That's right.

1890
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:12,467
AMAZING

1891
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:16,705
SERIOUSLY PROUD ABOUT HER GARDEN

1892
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,274
You're Jang-geum in real life.

1893
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,610
Do you want a naturalist dish?

1894
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,979
Who'll capture
the Great Jang-geum's appetite?

1895
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,248
-She grew them organically on the rooftop.
-Yes, they're organic.

1896
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,884
A FIERY BATTLE

1897
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,253
<i>-He's on a roll today.</i>
<i>-He must feel confident.</i>

1898
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,521
LOTS OF HONEY

1899
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,755
It's naturalism.

1900
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,892
It's her first evaluation
after her days as Jang-geum.

1901
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,027
I feel like
I'm watching <i>Jewel in the Palace.</i>

1902
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,596
She's the modern Jang-geum!

1903
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,365
-Come on!
-That was so real. I can tell by her face.

1904
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,704
-May I take this and finish it?
-Of course.

1905
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,005
I'll finish all these.

1906
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,007
WHICH DISH DID SHE LIKE SO MUCH
THAT SHE TOOK IT WITH HER?

1907
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:06,688
