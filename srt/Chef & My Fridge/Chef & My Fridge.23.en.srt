1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,284
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,721
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,224
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,693
-<i>Chef & My Fridge!</i>
-<i>My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,598
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GREAT SHOOT

6
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,034
I'm seeing some familiar faces.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,468
Hello, Chef Sohyi.

8
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,737
She came to join us here once again.

9
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,938
THE VIENNESE QUEEN
OF KOREAN CUISINE

10
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:43,043
Thank you so much
for taking such a long flight once again.

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,912
After her episode went on air,
the viewers…

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,747
He needs him.

13
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,517
SHE WAS THE FIRST TO HAND OVER
THE UNICHEF TO THE OPPONENT

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,253
Even women were saying
they were crushing on you.

15
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,021
-People loved you so much.
-Exactly.

16
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,389
-Thank you.
-You were huge.

17
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,826
-They probably think I'm a grandma.
-No, they really were crushing on you.

18
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,063
And as soon as Chef Sohyi came to Korea,

19
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,964
she asked for Kang-rok.

20
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,467
She wondered if he had been doing well.

21
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,335
He's been writing a book lately.

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,638
I called him as soon as I landed.
"What are you up to?"

23
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,707
And he told me that
he was meditating in the mountains.

24
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,976
-To write a book?
-So I told him to return right away.

25
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,380
He said, "Oh, yes, right. Yes. Of course."

26
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,848
-"Yes, okay."
-"Yes. Right. Yes."

27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,784
That was his response.
So it was a sad moment for me.

28
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,189
-I hope he returns from nature very soon.
-Me too.

29
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,026
But today, we have yet another chef
joining us for the first time.

30
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,895
-Right here.
-This new chef is

31
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,630
someone who defeated

32
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:42,702
the grand master of Chinese cuisine,
Lu Chinglai, in <i>Culinary Class Wars.</i>

33
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,872
Please welcome Chef Lim Tae-hun,
also known as Self-Made Chef!

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,340
Welcome to the show.

35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,009
HELLO, I'M THE ROOKIE

36
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,646
He won against Chef Lu Chinglai
on <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>, right?

37
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,782
Who are you here to take down?

38
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,884
-Me? May I be honest?
-Please.

39
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,219
I came to get Chef Ji-sun.

40
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,122
-I came to take down Chef Jung Ji-sun.
-Chef Jung Ji-sun.

41
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,491
Why are there so many people after Ji-sun?

42
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,892
I don't think I can lose today.

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,394
I guess Chinese chefs must begin
by taking Chef Ji-sun down.

44
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,796
-I guess so.
-Yes.

45
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,664
The world of culinary arts is
strictly hierarchical.

46
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,601
-He's not allowed to defy me like this.
-He can't?

47
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,169
-But he just… Yes.
-Especially Chinese cuisine.

48
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,838
Actually, I have much more experience
when it comes to running a business.

49
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,510
-He's run his business longer.
-Running his own business?

50
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,879
This relationship must be like
a martial arts movie

51
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,081
because this is Chinese cuisine.

52
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,617
-He says he had a rough upbringing.
-Exactly.

53
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,819
Look how tanned Chef Tae-hun is.

54
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,088
-He's been through a lot.
-He's so tanned.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,422
How did you get so tanned?

56
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,291
It's because he had to deliver too.

57
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,595
-I had to go around doing deliveries.
-That's why he still looks…

58
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,665
The Queen of Dim Sums
versus Dongpo Pork Prince.

59
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,769
-They're amazing.
-Okay. Let's turn that into something.

60
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,473
I wonder who will be here
as the fridge owners today.

61
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,078
-The hottest idol stars are here with us.
-Idol stars?

62
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,747
Let's meet them. Come on out!

63
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,484
Today's fridge owners.

64
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,322
Please welcome the fridge owners!

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,593
The idols celebrating their tenth year,
HOSHI and WOOZI of SEVENTEEN

66
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,095
and Mimi of OH MY GIRL are here!

67
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,997
THE STUDIO BRIGHTENS UP

68
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,866
-Come on in.
-Hello.

69
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,768
-Please have a seat.
-Please sit down.

70
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,971
The group with the highest sales
for a single album.

71
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,173
<i>SPILL THE FEELS</i> by SEVENTEEN.

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,910
The group that won the Grand Prize
for a K-pop awards two years in a row.

73
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,814
The K-pop maestros who captured the world,

74
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,684
please welcome HOSHI and WOOZI
of SEVENTEEN!

75
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,186
-Welcome.
-Hello.

76
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,423
And now, please.

77
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,192
-Please make it good.
-Of course.

78
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,495
The rapper and the dancer of a girl group
who made dazzling performances.

79
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,798
THREE WORDS THAT END IN "PARTY"

80
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,299
The Democratic Party.
The New Frontier Party.

81
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,634
The Communist Party.

82
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,637
And now, she's the hottest
variety show personality!

83
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,539
Please welcome Mimi of OH MY GIRL!

84
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,508
-Welcome to the show.
-Yes, hello.

85
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,346
I'm very excited
that I'll get to fill up today.

86
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,447
You will.

87
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,681
You've become quite tanned.

88
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,751
Yes, I'm on the darker side,
and I like to get tanned.

89
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,687
-Chef Sohyi and I make a great duo.
-Sure.

90
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256
Are you two acquainted?

91
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,691
-Of course, I know her.
-We met in the restroom just now.

92
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,860
Wait, and Chef Tae-hun too.

93
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,396
-The three of you are all tanned.
-Yes.

94
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,698
He's like that because of soy sauce.

95
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,801
-He's made too much Dongpo pork.
-Right.

96
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,769
Soy sauce-colored?

97
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,505
We're here with HOSHI, WOOZI, and Mimi.

98
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,541
All three of you use stage names
instead of your real name.

99
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,510
My real name is Kwon Soon-young.

100
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,212
But my name sounded too gentle,

101
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,749
so I was named with the acronyms for
tiger's eyes, <i>horangi-eui siseon</i>, HOSHI.

102
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,784
-Tiger's eyes.
-It was an acronym?

103
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,686
It's like the idiom "<i>hoshitamtam</i>,"
high on alert like a tiger's eyes.

104
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,455
-Is that so? That's right.
-Yes.

105
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,124
-Is Soon the generation's common syllable?
-Yes, that's right.

106
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,092
-The 37th generation of Chumilgong Clan?
-Yes, that's right.

107
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,795
We're family. Yes.

108
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,463
Why do you try to get involved like this?

109
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,599
He has a head shape
that runs in my family.

110
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,268
-The shape?
-The head? It's not the same at all.

111
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,671
-What do you mean?
-What are you saying?

112
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,339
The sizes are completely different.

113
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,641
-You have the same hair parting.
-He's my family.

114
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,976
And we're the same generation.

115
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,046
-I was supposed to use Soon, but I didn't.
-I see.

116
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,113
You came prepared.

117
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,682
I had to get at least a second on air.

118
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,718
WOOZI, why did you name yourself that?

119
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,787
-My real name is Ji-hoon.
-Ji-hoon.

120
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,390
I joined my agency at 15,
while I was still young.

121
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,728
So the adults there adored me and said,
<i>uri</i> Ji-hoon, "my dear Ji-hoon."

122
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,464
I shortened that and was named WOOZI.

123
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,933
-<i>Uri </i>Ji-hoon became WOOZI.
-My dear Ji-hoon.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,702
-Then it became WOOZI?
-Yes.

125
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,771
There's a special reason
why we invited the three of you together.

126
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,507
This year, SEVENTEEN and OH MY GIRL

127
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,443
both celebrate their 10th anniversary.

128
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,244
-I see.
-The tenth year!

129
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,980
-It's their tenth anniversary.
-Yes, that's right.

130
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,049
Did both groups debut
around the same time?

131
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,852
We debuted on May 26th, 2015.

132
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,321
We debuted on April 21st, 2015.

133
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,857
-April 21st. Yes.
-I debuted a month earlier.

134
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,893
-So tomorrow is your actual tenth year.
-Yes.

135
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,363
-And you'll release a commemorative album?
-Yes.

136
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,964
He writes all our music.

137
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,533
-WOOZI wrote the entire album?
-Yes.

138
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,036
-Including "VERY NICE"?
-Yes.

139
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,738
-Really?
-Yes.

140
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,674
And "Fighting," "Super,"
and "God of Music" too.

141
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,942
He's written songs since our debut.

142
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,511
-I hear WOOZI writes most songs.
-Yes.

143
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,080
He probably released 200 songs
if we include this album.

144
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,882
-That's crazy.
-Two hundred?

145
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,252
-You must make a lot of royalties.
-You're right.

146
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,820
-Is there an estimate?
-An estimate?

147
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,792
-Among people who take--
-Let me make it simple.

148
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,595
-You should let him do the talking.
-Yes, it's awkward.

149
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,530
I visit his studio often.

150
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,899
And as people who make royalties know,
you get an e-mail.

151
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:44,170
His e-mail is always logged in,
so I got curious and clicked on it.

152
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,972
Goodness gracious.

153
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,840
That's why he's never on variety shows.

154
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,544
How many commas did you see?

155
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,480
-You can't even count the zeroes.
-You can't?

156
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,849
We found out a huge secret.

157
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,952
SEVENTEEN is famous
for the number of members.

158
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,821
-There are 13 of them.
-Yes.

159
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,156
You must spend a lot of food.

160
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,258
It'll add up to a lot.

161
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,759
HE SPOTS SOMETHING

162
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,562
-Ten million won on a team dinner?
-What?

163
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,063
-It's not a few million won?
-Ten million won?

164
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,801
It was when we had a barbecue
when we went to Japan for the first time.

165
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,769
We thought it'd be as cheap as pork belly.

166
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,772
We roasted everything at once
and began to eat really quickly,

167
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,340
but barbecue is expensive in Japan.

168
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,510
-And we were eating Kobe beef.
-That's expensive.

169
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,414
-Kobe beef? Gosh.
-You pretty much chewed on a car.

170
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,517
-Good for that restaurant.
-Your agency must be generous.

171
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,153
But of course, my agency is great.
Yours is great too.

172
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,388
They're generous.

173
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,892
SEVENTEEN is also famous
for your great friendship.

174
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,629
I hear your parents
often get together as well.

175
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,266
I heard you still schedule meet-ups
with one another. Is that true?

176
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,235
We told each other

177
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,473
that the 13 of us should meet up
regularly, at least once a month.

178
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,509
-There's a fine if you don't show up.
-There's a fine?

179
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,077
-It's pretty high.
-It is?

180
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,546
-If you don't come, ten million won.
-My gosh.

181
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,281
-That's way too high.
-If you're a minute…

182
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,317
-Every minute you run late, 100,000 won.
-That's 100,000 won.

183
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,751
You pay 100,000 won per minute?

184
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,386
Has anyone paid the fine?

185
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,955
-Not ten million won yet.
-Not ten million won.

186
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,424
-But a few did pay late fees.
-For coming late.

187
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,826
-So 100,000 won per minute?
-Yes, 100,000 won per minute.

188
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,628
-A million won for ten minutes?
-Yes.

189
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,363
And we use the fine

190
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,432
to pay for our staff members' dinner.

191
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,668
-That's so cool.
-We make good use of it.

192
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,569
That's so cool.

193
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,438
We have a different host each month.

194
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,640
This month, it's me.
Then next month, it's him.

195
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,275
-We always have a host.
-There's a host.

196
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,810
-There's a host?
-So you take turns?

197
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,147
The host gets to decide
the theme, the location,

198
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,650
and everything else,
but the host also pays.

199
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,985
That sounds fun.

200
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,488
-We played futsal when I was a host.
-Futsal.

201
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,756
<i>We can decide to play futsal.</i>

202
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,858
-Was DK the host in the UK?
-Yes.

203
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,560
It was DK's turn to be the host,

204
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,263
and he had always loved <i>Harry Potter</i>.

205
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,666
And at that time,
we were in the UK for work.

206
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,335
We all got dressed up
like characters of <i>Harry Potter</i>

207
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,838
and dined at a restaurant in the UK.

208
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,040
That was probably the biggest scale yet.

209
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,375
You're all like party planners.

210
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,576
That's a lot of effort.

211
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,577
Can we see the pictures?

212
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,415
-That was <i>Harry Potter</i>.
-That's cool.

213
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,384
-There's <i>Harry Potter</i>.
-There it is.

214
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,685
Was this the UK?

215
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,855
-I counted the members, and there were 13.
-Everyone.

216
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,658
They have to be there
if they don't want to pay ten million won.

217
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:23,062
We have a Chinese member,
and he hosted the hot pot meet-up.

218
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,597
-Hot pot?
-I see.

219
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,698
Yes, that's hot pot.

220
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,133
HOSHI had it the easiest.

221
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,268
-What?
-Just playing futsal?

222
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,171
-Right?
-He just had to pay for the venue.

223
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,472
Two hours would've been enough.

224
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,841
-Next time, go hiking.
-Hiking?

225
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,610
-That's not a bad idea.
-That's even easier!

226
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,378
-Go hiking.
-It won't cost anything.

227
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,647
You'll just have to give out 13 cucumbers.

228
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,716
-Or carrots.
-Cucumbers are the best.

229
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,185
-But that's a great idea.
-It's not so bad.

230
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,853
-I'll make use of it quickly.
-We should.

231
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,156
-I'm kind of jealous.
-They're a group.

232
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,859
And now, it's time to take a look
at what HOSHI and WOOZI of SEVENTEEN,

233
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,497
the world-renowned stars,
keep in their fridge.

234
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,167
There are two of you, but only one fridge.

235
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,535
-Yes.
-Do you live together?

236
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,071
We live separately,
but we put the food together.

237
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,474
We didn't have a lot of stuff
to bring them separately.

238
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,545
-It'd look too empty, so you combined it.
-Yes, then it looked pretty full.

239
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,479
Nice.

240
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,615
-Very nice.
-Yes, very nice.

241
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,917
This is a combination of their fridge.

242
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,019
-We present their fridge!
-Their fridge!

243
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,622
EVERYONE'S EYES ARE ON
THE FRIDGE FOR THE GODS OF MUSIC

244
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,856
-Their fridge!
-Their fridge!

245
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,060
-This is for the two of you?
-Combined?

246
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,428
-That's not a lot.
-That's all?

247
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,632
-It still looks empty after combining.
-Kimchi.

248
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,635
-But I can't tell whose these are.
-Right?

249
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,838
-The top three on the right are mine.
-The three.

250
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,973
And the lower three are WOOZI's.

251
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,376
-And the freezer? WOOZI's?
-The top three are WOOZI's.

252
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,710
The lower ones are mine.

253
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,114
First of all,
these three shelves belong to HOSHI.

254
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,549
-There is a lot of kimchi.
-These are all kimchi.

255
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:54,053
-Cabbage kimchi, mukeunji, chopped kimchi…
-It's like a kimchi fridge.

256
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,789
-…young summer radish, radish kimchi…
-He must love kimchi.

257
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,857
…and green onion kimchi.

258
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,227
-And there's young radish kimchi.
-And I see young radish kimchi.

259
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,496
-My mouth is watering.
-Do you like kimchi?

260
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,165
I'm an ambassador for a kimchi brand.

261
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,501
It's because I loved kimchi so much,

262
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,536
and there were all kinds of videos.

263
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,406
And my love for it became known,

264
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,343
so a kimchi brand asked me
to become their ambassador.

265
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,611
So they send me lots of products.

266
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,046
That's wonderful.

267
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,348
-Kimchi idol.
-I see.

268
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,750
What do you have to do
as a kimchi ambassador?

269
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,254
It's like any other brand endorsement.
I'd go for a photo shoot and all.

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,122
-While holding kimchi?
-Yes.

271
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,559
-We got one from his photo shoot.
-Really?

272
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,960
Let's take a look.

273
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,629
-Whoa.
-Look at that!

274
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,930
It doesn't look like it's for kimchi.

275
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,965
-It looks cool.
-It does.

276
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,601
The red stuff must be red pepper powder.

277
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,670
-Yes, it doesn't look so bad.
-Right?

278
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,673
He's like a sand lance
used to make sauce for kimchi.

279
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,909
I think
that's what the picture is getting at.

280
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,210
-It looks cool.
-It looks cool.

281
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,179
In Japan, there's a tub of kimchi…

282
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,481
-Is it available for sale?
-…with my face on it. Yes.

283
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,116
The sales must be through the roof.

284
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,719
Is there any unlikely food
that goes well with kimchi?

285
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,321
-My members found this very shocking.
-Yes?

286
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,658
-People often eat sweet potato and kimchi.
-Yes.

287
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,394
So I tried sweet potato cake with…

288
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,264
I thought it'd be good with kimchi,
so I told them I had those together.

289
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,933
-It's good.
-It is, right?

290
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,267
I eat cream cake with kimchi.

291
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,936
-Right? I'm telling you.
-Yes.

292
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,571
-It's good with onion kimchi.
-It is?

293
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,005
-With kimchi?
-Yes, with kimchi.

294
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,508
-You eat fresh cream cake with kimchi?
-Yes, it's good.

295
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,243
Just… Why?

296
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,978
At times, I get suspicious of him.

297
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,279
Is he doing this as a show?

298
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,081
-That's what they think.
-That can happen.

299
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,551
-I get what you mean.
-The two seem so unlikely.

300
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,888
Anyway, you'll have to use kimchi
if you want him to choose you.

301
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,857
-Make sure you do that.
-You'll have to.

302
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,559
Also, I see some naengmyeon.

303
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,727
-Do you like naengmyeon?
-Pyongyang-style.

304
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,729
-I love Pyongyang-style naengmyeon.
-Pyongyang-style naengmyeon.

305
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,664
-I love that too.
-I see.

306
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,333
-You have some naengmyeon broth.
-It's good.

307
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,467
Olive oil?

308
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,468
Olive oil?

309
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,571
Truffle balsamic vinegar and truffle oil.

310
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,940
-I love the smell of truffles.
-I see.

311
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,243
I even found
a bag of truffle potato chips.

312
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,811
-Yes.
-See?

313
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,346
-You must love the smell.
-You love it.

314
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,716
-I eat it when I watch a film at night.
-It's delicious.

315
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,086
-Are these fish? Dried yellow corvina?
-Yes.

316
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,421
Look at all these.

317
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,458
-There are so many of these.
-And they're in ropes.

318
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,427
-Whoa, look at these.
-My dad is the chief of a fishing village.

319
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,897
-I knew it.
-Really?

320
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,031
-The chief of a fishing village?
-Yes.

321
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,134
He left those in there
after I told him I'd be on the show.

322
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,437
I see. He brought some
when he heard you'd be here.

323
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,508
He was probably like,
"Hey, I'm the chief of a fishing village."

324
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,876
He wanted you to eat something good.

325
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,344
And marsh snails.

326
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,380
-Marsh snails.
-Are these from your father too?

327
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,015
-He probably gathered them himself.
-Marsh snails.

328
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,219
These are WOOZI's stuff.

329
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,556
He has a whole watermelon in here.

330
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,158
-Yes.
-Carrots, tomatoes. Are these tomatoes?

331
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,459
I love tomatoes.

332
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,928
-You do?
-Yes, I love them.

333
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,629
-Korean melon.
-I love those too.

334
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,832
-Cucumbers.
-I love cucumbers too.

335
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,433
-So you like everything in here.
-Yes.

336
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,703
-He wouldn't have bought it otherwise.
-He's not so picky.

337
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,975
Even as a child, I was never the type
who'd complain about the food.

338
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,478
I often just eat seasoned dried laver
and rice to make do with a meal.

339
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,349
And over here. The pile of instant rice.

340
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,952
-This means you'll never make rice.
-Exactly.

341
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,120
You have lots of ramyeon too.

342
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,389
-Are these instant rice yours?
-Yes.

343
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,092
-I always keep that much in stock.
-I see.

344
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,027
How many bags of ramyeon
do you eat for a meal?

345
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,264
It all depends on how full I want to feel.

346
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,934
I need at least four to five bags
if I want to feel full.

347
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,402
-Can you really eat that much?
-Yes.

348
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,838
How many instant rice bowls
do you eat for a meal?

349
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,406
I need at least three to four.

350
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,542
I see. He has a big appetite.

351
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,110
Do you enjoy hamburgers too?

352
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,280
If I had to eat just the burgers,
I could easily finish six or more.

353
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,716
-What?
-Just the burgers?

354
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,717
He does have a big appetite.

355
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,585
-The freezer.
-Meat.

356
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,487
Do you eat lots of meat
when you set your mind on it?

357
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,490
I can basically eat
at least 600 grams to 1 kilogram.

358
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,626
-You can even eat a kilogram?
-Yes.

359
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,095
-He must love to eat meat.
-Yes.

360
00:14:56,161 --> 00:15:00,032
Some pork. And this is beef.

361
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,367
It's a strip loin.

362
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,436
This one is pork shoulder,
and it's a cut to make jjigae, stew.

363
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,040
-I'm the type who likes to cook.
-I see.

364
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,876
I use pork shoulder to make stew,

365
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,144
but also because it's easy to use.

366
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,113
-It doesn't have a lot of fat.
-No, exactly.

367
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,014
You can make curry too.

368
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,582
Grilled mackerel.

369
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,284
-Do you like fish too?
-Yes, I love it.

370
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,388
-I see some cod fillets.
-Protein.

371
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:27,226
We're now done
taking their fridge inside out.

372
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,228
One of them is a kimchi ambassador,

373
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,530
and the other one has a big appetite.

374
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,768
And now, let us show you their orders.

375
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:36,969
Please show us.

376
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,605
What kind of dishes do they want?

377
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,140
Now, the first order.

378
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,376
<i>What is this mix? Oh, my</i>

379
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,878
KIMCHI NICE

380
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,646
AUTOMATIC REACTION

381
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,181
That was cool.

382
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,217
Wait, can you elaborate? Kimchi, nice?

383
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,653
People mostly eat
jjajang ramyeon with green onion kimchi

384
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,021
or white kimchi with raw fish.

385
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,990
-There are these usual mixes.
-Yes.

386
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,359
I wanted to eat a kind of dish
that's new yet good with kimchi.

387
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,594
He wants you
to pair something with kimchi.

388
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,263
So he wants them to make something

389
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,532
-that'll go well with the kimchi he has.
-Yes.

390
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,567
A dish that goes well with kimchi.

391
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,269
The next dish, please.
What's the next topic?

392
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,406
-Happy SEVENTEEN day.
-Happy SEVENTEEN day.

393
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,742
-I know. Your tenth anniversary.
-Can you tell us about it?

394
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,079
SEVENTEEN will celebrate
our tenth anniversary soon,

395
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,614
so I wanted to order a dish

396
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,250
that'll help us remember
this important day.

397
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,386
I don't know which chef will cook,

398
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:32,291
but why don't you hold the monthly meet-up
at the winning chefs' restaurant?

399
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,828
-Yes, if we can make a reservation.
-It'd be an honor for us.

400
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,663
Their bill starts at ten million won.

401
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,499
They'll give you
enough sales for that day.

402
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,034
-That's pretty nice.
-This will be

403
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,737
-a bloody battle today.
-Yes.

404
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,472
You came all the way from Vienna,

405
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,607
so let us give you a chance to choose.

406
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,576
Or you can choose to cook next week.

407
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,144
I wanted to pick one right now.

408
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:56,215
I'm also a type who needs kimchi
even when I eat kimchi jjigae.

409
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,450
I need to do the kimchi round.

410
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,586
CHEF SOHYI PICKS WHAT IS
THIS MIX? OH, MY, KIMCHI, NICE

411
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,854
She picks the kimchi round.

412
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,189
-Hosts, excuse me.
-Yes?

413
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,658
As a Kor-Talian…

414
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,861
-A Kor-Talian?
-A Kor-Talian?

415
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:13,766
…I was thinking
I could make a new kind of mix

416
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,336
which Koreans couldn't come up with.

417
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,504
-Right.
-That's amazing.

418
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,772
-Okay.
-Okay.

419
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,839
Chef Sohyi

420
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,910
and Chef Fabri will fill the order
for the Kimchi, Nice round.

421
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,512
Happy SEVENTEEN Day.

422
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,981
He wants a dish
to remember their tenth anniversary.

423
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,150
Hey, Sung-jun lifts his hand right away.

424
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,184
Gosh, it's Matpizza.

425
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,953
I can also eat a kilogram of meat alone,

426
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,588
and I can down
two fried chickens in 20 minutes.

427
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,359
-I knew it.
-And I can easily eat six bags of ramyeon.

428
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,028
I want to invite you to my restaurant
if I win this round.

429
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,264
All right.

430
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,400
Who'll fight against Sung-jun?
We need one person.

431
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,102
I'll fight him.

432
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,405
-Nam-no?
-Anti-Good Vibes?

433
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,642
-Aren't you on the same side?
-You're in the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance.

434
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,844
He's the chairman,
and I'm the action-taker.

435
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,613
But I'll destroy his title
as the chairman today.

436
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,984
-He's become too snooty lately.
-That's true.

437
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,953
-You'll teach him a lesson.
-Just one lesson.

438
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,755
-He'll teach him a lesson.
-I see.

439
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:14,726
Sung-jun and Nam-no will fill the order
for Happy SEVENTEEN Day.

440
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,964
I'm so looking forward to this.

441
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,401
This is the first round
with the ingredients from SEVENTEEN's

442
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,603
HOSHI and WOOZI.

443
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,039
Fabri from Italy is up against

444
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:32,211
-Chef Sohyi from Vienna, Austria.
-Yes, I'm from Vienna.

445
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,645
Very nice!

446
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,080
All right!

447
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,582
A VERY NICE MATCH HAS BEEN MADE

448
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:41,753
Today, you two will have to make
a new kind of dish

449
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,991
that'll go wonderfully with kimchi
for the kimchi ambassador.

450
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,995
Chef Sohyi, did you say
Fabri has the upper hand in this?

451
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,231
Yes, because Chef Fabri is

452
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,899
more Korean than I am.

453
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,670
-That's true.
-I usually drink espresso ristretto.

454
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,407
But as soon as he got here,
he went around looking for iced Americano.

455
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,410
He'd get slapped if he asked
for iced Americano in Italy.

456
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,745
It's that serious.

457
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,780
Other than iced Americano,

458
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,949
do you usually eat lots of Korean food?

459
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,451
Yes, of course.

460
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,953
I especially love kimchi.

461
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,755
What's your favorite kimchi dish?

462
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,524
It's braised kimchi.

463
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,159
-Braised kimchi?
-Braised kimchi?

464
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,494
I love some braised kimchi with soju.

465
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,795
It's perfect.

466
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,897
Or, you know…

467
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,932
-He's Korean.
-Is he Korean?

468
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,600
Did he just say soju?

469
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,770
Braised kimchi, rice, rolled omelet,

470
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,605
seasoned dried laver, and soju.

471
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,641
-It's game over.
-My gosh.

472
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,142
-It's game over?
-He's Korean now.

473
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,311
-We have to check his passport.
-My gosh.

474
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,046
-Chef Fabri has an advantage.
-Really?

475
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,482
HOSHI is currently
an ambassador for a kimchi brand, right?

476
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,450
But Fabri has also been appointed

477
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,887
as a global kimchi ambassador in the past.

478
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,523
-Really?
-Yes, it's true.

479
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,158
I'm a modest man,

480
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,928
so I didn't want to share it before.

481
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,362
-Because you're modest?
-Modest?

482
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,232
Are you saying HOSHI is not?

483
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,067
I was also a judge

484
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,771
for a kimchi cooking contest
for four consecutive years.

485
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,339
-Whoa.
-Really?

486
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,241
You were a judge
for a kimchi cooking contest?

487
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,842
Then he'll do well in this round.

488
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,711
-He'll have to be good.
-He's probably tried a lot.

489
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,480
But I'm Korean,
and I have Korean blood in me.

490
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,982
The kimchi blood.

491
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,483
I have an announcement to make.

492
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,252
We have two guests with one fridge today,

493
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,322
so the selection of the winning chef
will have to change from before.

494
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,490
They'll try both dishes

495
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,627
-and cast their votes separately.
-I see.

496
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,129
If they had different opinions…

497
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,898
-One to one?
-Yes.

498
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,166
We'll give you time to discuss.

499
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,170
It's like <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

500
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,072
HOW WILL IT IMPACT THIS ROUND?

501
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,907
CHEF FABRI'S INGREDIENTS:

502
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,975
RADISH KIMCHI,
TRUFFLE POTATO CHIPS, MILK

503
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,009
MUKEUNJI, DONGCHIMI BROTH,

504
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,077
CHAMPAGNE, TRUFFLE OIL,
KIMCHI POWDER, AND MORE

505
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,046
This is the title
of the dish I prepared today.

506
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,849
Kimchi Gnocchi Vibes.

507
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,785
-Kimchi Gnocchi Vibes?
-Kimchi Gnocchi Vibes?

508
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,220
-He's making gnocchi?
-Gnocchi?

509
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,923
-He's making gnocchi.
-Yes, I'm making gnocchi.

510
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,028
I want to make some gnocchi
that goes well with radish kimchi.

511
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,864
-Gnocchi that goes with radish kimchi?
-Gnocchi that goes with radish kimchi?

512
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,367
That idea suddenly came to me.

513
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,336
-Potato chips?
-Potato chips.

514
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,771
-I see.
-No!

515
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,341
Chef Sung-jun just closed his eyes.

516
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,709
What's wrong?

517
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,745
Making gnocchi with potato chips is

518
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,146
kind of odd in Italian cuisine…

519
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,115
-No.
-Why not?

520
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,450
-No.
-Should we say he has abandoned Italy?

521
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,185
IT'S A RADICAL COMMENT

522
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,289
Why is this place so extreme?
You're harsh.

523
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,024
Let me show you, Sung-jun.

524
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,825
Do you have no plan to return to Italy?

525
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,494
He asked if he won't return to Italy.

526
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,429
I'll also do something else.

527
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,365
I'm going to smoke the radish kimchi.

528
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,667
-You'll smoke it?
-Radish kimchi?

529
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,068
-Radish kimchi?
-Radish kimchi?

530
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,203
You'll go, "It's good."

531
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,272
Give me your trust. It'll be good.

532
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,408
CHEF SOHYI'S INGREDIENTS:
WATERMELON,

533
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,742
YOUNG SUMMER
RADISH KIMCHI, APPLE

534
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,277
LETTUCE, PORK BELLY,
PERILLA LEAF, TOMATO

535
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,514
Up against him is Chef Sohyi.
What's your dish?

536
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,649
It's called Kimchi Maestro.

537
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,551
-Kimchi Maestro?
-Kimchi Maestro.

538
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,187
"MAESTRO" BY SEVENTEEN

539
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,557
-Maestro also means a conductor.
-Yes.

540
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,693
Yes, she's from Vienna.

541
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,895
-It's a country of music.
-It is.

542
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,096
She got the idea from there.

543
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,032
HUMMING

544
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,901
How do they get along so well?

545
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,670
What kind of kimchi
will your dish go well with?

546
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,138
Young summer radish kimchi.

547
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,541
-Young summer radish kimchi.
-I thought I should win,

548
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,910
so I'll make watermelon steak.

549
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,178
-What?
-Watermelon?

550
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,313
-With watermelon?
-It's sweet, isn't it?

551
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,283
So you're making watermelon steak,
not actual steak?

552
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,884
He obviously had regular steak before,

553
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,753
-so I'm making watermelon steak.
-Watermelon steak.

554
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,622
-I can't imagine a warm watermelon.
-That's amazing.

555
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,593
The round for HOSHI and WOOZI
is about to begin.

556
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,063
<i>What is this mix? Oh, my</i>

557
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,833
<i>Kimchi, nice</i>

558
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,469
They're here to fill the order.

559
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,804
The round will begin right away

560
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,207
Whoa, this is so cool.

561
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,875
It's so cool.

562
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,777
So this is how it feels.

563
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:03,148
This is a man who drinks kimchi water
instead of espresso.

564
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,218
A Kor-Talian kimchi lover, Chef Fabri.

565
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,688
And here's a maestro
who'll play the Kor-Talian

566
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,157
according to her rhythm.

567
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,794
Chef Kim Sohyi, the kimchi maestro.

568
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,263
Which one of the two will

569
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,333
capture the heart
of the kimchi ambassador?

570
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,870
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

571
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,141
It has begun? It begins like this?

572
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,443
They'll only get to cook for 15 minutes.

573
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,178
Begin!

574
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,180
WHAT IS THIS MIX? OH,
MY, KIMCHI, NICE ROUND BEGINS

575
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,448
Has it begun?

576
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,983
What's Fabri doing?

577
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,251
Rosemary.

578
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,953
That's dried rosemary.
He'll probably smoke the kimchi with that.

579
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,855
-I see.
-I see.

580
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,624
Why is he sprinkling sugar on it?

581
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,125
Oh, no. Come on. Get inside.

582
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,494
Oh, no. Come on. Get inside.

583
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,197
He didn't use the right-sized pan!

584
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,033
-The pan wasn't the right size.
-Come on, already?

585
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,271
Oh, no!

586
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,006
Gosh, darn it.

587
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,910
He puts rosemary into a bowl to smoke it.

588
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,511
CHEF SOHYI GRABS THE WATERMELON

589
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,180
-Gosh, the watermelon.
-Okay.

590
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,714
She got the watermelon.

591
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,082
It's the watermelon.

592
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,051
Snap.

593
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,719
It's well ripened.

594
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,888
-I love the color.
-Yes.

595
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,191
Gosh.

596
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,493
All right.

597
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,528
SHE CUTS IT UP IN UPBEAT

598
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,331
-The watermelon is well ripened.
-Yes, it is.

599
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,033
-All right.
-It looks good.

600
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,035
-We should cut the rest and eat it.
-Yes.

601
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,538
Fabri grabs the radish kimchi.

602
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,374
-Radish kimchi.
-He said he'd smoke that.

603
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,809
No, right here.

604
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,046
-What's he doing?
-Is he steaming it?

605
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,981
No, he'll smoke that.

606
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,183
People often smoke pickles too.

607
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,586
-Yes, you're right.
-Cucumbers.

608
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,187
Are you using a steamer, though?

609
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,522
-But he'll smoke it.
-Just the smoke.

610
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,123
He'll light it on fire.

611
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,328
How will the radish kimchi turn out
when it's smoked with rosemary?

612
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,297
-Is that rosemary? Sugar?
-Rosemary and sugar.

613
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,867
-Sugar will add the caramel scent.
-Caramel scent.

614
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,438
HE PLACES THE RADISH KIMCHI
OVER THE SMOKE

615
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,440
I've never seen smoked radish kimchi.

616
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,042
I'm already out of my mind.

617
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,577
How are you going to survive?

618
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,746
How are you going to carry on
if you're already out of it?

619
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,414
SLAM

620
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,018
GARLIC GOES IN

621
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,855
-What did Chef Sohyi put in the pot?
-Garlic and ginger.

622
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,058
And a tomato, I think.
Why is she using that?

623
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,728
What did Chef Sohyi put in the pot?

624
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,897
She just put tomatoes in.
Is she boiling those?

625
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,732
It's to eliminate the meat smell.

626
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,600
Oh, it's to remove the meat smell?

627
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,869
The meat smell?
She does have some meat with her.

628
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,639
-It's to remove the pork smell.
-She's using an apple too.

629
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,973
Is she making boiled pork?

630
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,075
She seems so relaxed.

631
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,344
Chef Sohyi looks so chill.

632
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,547
-I think it's like boiled pork.
-But she didn't season it.

633
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,948
Will she boil the pork?

634
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,850
Not at all.

635
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,652
SHE THROWS HER ANSWER CASUALLY

636
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,123
Whoa, she's making cuts so quickly.

637
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,025
Will you boil the pork?

638
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,527
I'll parboil it.

639
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,863
-You're cutting off the cartilage.
-Yes.

640
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,299
It'll make it tender and tasty.

641
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,533
It's for texture.

642
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,937
In Western cuisine,
apples and pork are a classic mix.

643
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,172
Is that so? I see.

644
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,340
Darn it.

645
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,877
Chef Fabri's using cabbage kimchi too.

646
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,315
Chef Fabri's using cabbage kimchi as well.

647
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:27,285
-It's mukeunji. It's my favorite type.
-Mukeunji?

648
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,054
And the potato chips.

649
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,522
He'll use those?

650
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,125
-A blender?
-Those are potato chips to make gnocchi.

651
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,861
-He'll grind it up to make the batter?
-He'll make the batter?

652
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,630
He's going to grind that?

653
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,232
I think that's a cooking method
often used in America.

654
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,301
Italians need to shut their eyes now.

655
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,907
GRIND TRUFFLE POTATO CHIPS
IN A BLENDER

656
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,209
Oh, come on. No.

657
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,577
It's not grinding.

658
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,379
He has to shake it around.

659
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,549
-It stopped.
-He has to shake it around.

660
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,619
It's not turning

661
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,588
because it got sticky
with the oil and starch from the chips.

662
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,991
WHAT ABOUT CHEF SOHYI?

663
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,060
Chef Sohyi said
she'd make steak with watermelon.

664
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,062
She cut it up into flat square pieces.

665
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,699
-Will you remove the seeds?
-The seeds?

666
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,602
-Will you remove the seeds?
-The seeds?

667
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,004
Am I allowed to do this?

668
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,773
-All of a sudden?
-Remove the seeds.

669
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,675
She's suddenly using UNICHEF.

670
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,278
I have bad eyesight,
so I can't see anything.

671
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,814
-Goodness, if you say so.
-I'm getting older.

672
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,282
I can't see very well.

673
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,384
-Is it that bad?
-Yes.

674
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,285
Yet you can use the knife like that?

675
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,022
She's so good with her knife.

676
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,358
-We'll just let it go.
-Right.

677
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,428
Chef Sung-jun is removing the seeds.

678
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,765
THANKFULLY, THE BLENDER
IS STILL WORKING

679
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,334
THE CHIPS WERE
GROUND UP PERFECTLY

680
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,336
-Do you need help, Chef Fabri?
-No.

681
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,371
-No, I think I'm fine.
-Are you okay?

682
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,440
I might have to ask you later.

683
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,242
Yes, okay.

684
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,078
SHE TAKES OUT
THE PARBOILED PORK BELLY

685
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,748
2. CHOP PARBOILED PORK BELLY
INTO TINY PIECES

686
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,818
She's dicing the pork.

687
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,587
Thank you. Okay.

688
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,124
What's at the bottom?

689
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,694
-Kimchi and potato chips.
-The potato chips?

690
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,464
Were they ground up well?

691
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,900
-I think so.
-I see.

692
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,368
You have nine minutes.

693
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,036
-Nine minutes?
-Yes.

694
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,238
Really? Only nine minutes?

695
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,008
This is the gnocchi batter.

696
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,977
-You won't use any flour?
-No, that's right.

697
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,114
No! Italians, close your eyes.

698
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,383
-Mamma mia!
-This is unimaginable.

699
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,386
That batter looks tasty.

700
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,254
But it looks good.

701
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,989
Is it thick enough?

702
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,460
-With the chips?
-I think he'll bake that.

703
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,360
That's so cool.

704
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,763
The chips are already seasoned too.

705
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,065
I think he'll toast that.

706
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,768
So the radish kimchi is
still getting smoked, right?

707
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,836
Yes, that's right.

708
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,106
-It'll stay there until the end.
-It'll stay until the end.

709
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,477
THE PROFESSOR
GOES BACK TO CHOPPING CALMLY

710
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,377
She's so cool with the knife.

711
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,714
GARLIC,
CHEONGYANG PEPPER, TOMATO

712
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,084
3. DICE AND STIR-FRY GARLIC,
CHEONGYANG PEPPER, AND TOMATO

713
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,320
This one is…

714
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,088
Chef Sohyi, are you using tomatoes?

715
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,456
Yes, I am.

716
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,992
-You're frying tomatoes.
-I am.

717
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,794
Are you roasting the watermelon?

718
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,828
She hasn't put it in yet.

719
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,532
She'll have to start soon to remove
the water for a steak-like texture.

720
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,168
If I roast the watermelon now,

721
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,771
-it'll turn into liquid.
-It'll become liquid?

722
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,606
Poong didn't have enough knowledge.

723
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:38,109
She wants to trap the water inside,
but Poong thought she'd remove it.

724
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,413
She seasoned the diced pork
and begins to stir fry them altogether.

725
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,782
4. COAT PORK BELLY WITH STARCH
AND STIR FRY WITH THE VEGGIES

726
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,150
WHAT ABOUT FABRI?

727
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,085
Butter?

728
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,853
What's that, Fabri?

729
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,922
-Roux?
-Roux.

730
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,590
-Roux.
-Fabri's making roux.

731
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,560
He's making roux, although he has
6 minutes and 45 seconds left?

732
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,430
What's that? What did he put inside?

733
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,967
What's that? What did he put inside?

734
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,702
Naengmyeon broth?

735
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,037
-Naengmyeon broth?
-Dongchimi broth?

736
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,105
Dongchimi broth?

737
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,307
-Dongchimi broth?
-Naengmyeon broth?

738
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:14,045
You added dongchimi broth into the roux?

739
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,280
Yes!

740
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,482
Yes, I'm using dongchimi broth!

741
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,384
-Whoa, that's amazing.
-What?

742
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,920
THE JAPANESE CUISINE
CHEFS ARE IN SHOCK

743
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,956
-You're adding that to the roux?
-No!

744
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,691
This is really strange.

745
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,895
-Yes, it's dongchimi broth.
-I've never seen anything like this!

746
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,064
I HAVE ONE MORE INGREDIENT LEFT…

747
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,266
And milk!

748
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,869
-And milk!
-No!

749
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,371
Mamma mia!

750
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,841
GIGGLING

751
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,309
WHOA

752
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:48,346
PLEASE END THIS NIGHTMARE

753
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:52,050
-Will dongchimi broth go well with milk?
-This is so strange.

754
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,551
EVEN THE PROFESSOR
CAME TO SEE IT

755
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,220
SHE FINDS IT ODD TOO

756
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,223
-Wait, he's like Poong from Italy.
-This is…

757
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,092
Even I can't condone something like this!

758
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,427
He's like Poong from Italy.

759
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,097
-No, I'm not that bad. I'm not like him.
-Okay.

760
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,834
What's that?

761
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,703
-It's the gnocchi.
-What?

762
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,806
-He said that was gnocchi, right?
-It is.

763
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,874
It looks good.

764
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,244
6. BUTTER PAN
AND GRILL DICED GNOCCHI,

765
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,248
GRILLING CHEESE, AND BOK CHOY

766
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,017
THEY'RE ALL SHAPED
LIKE DICED RADISH KIMCHI

767
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,152
WHAT ABOUT CHEF SOHYI?

768
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,655
SHE DROPS IT CASUALLY

769
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,190
She dropped the watermelon.

770
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,992
The watermelon goes over the heat.

771
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,330
SHE ROASTS
THE WATERMELON IN A FLASH

772
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,299
She puts on a flashy performance.

773
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,568
-That was cool.
-She puts on a flashy performance.

774
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,405
You can't cook watermelon over low heat.

775
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,740
-Is that so?
-Yes.

776
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,843
If you cook it slowly, it'll draw out
the water and destroy the texture.

777
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,311
So it'll melt.

778
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,614
SHE FLIPS THE PAN WITH EASE

779
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,017
You're about to try watermelon steak.

780
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,586
-You have five minutes left.
-Five minutes and ten seconds or so.

781
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,987
-Sung-ju…
-Yes?

782
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,455
…please report to us out in the field.

783
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,424
Let me go out to the field.

784
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,526
I didn't even realize the time passing.

785
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,028
Time flies so quickly.

786
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,966
FABRI PULLS OUT
THE SMOKED RADISH KIMCHI

787
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,501
It smells great.

788
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:18,970
Truffle oil?

789
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,038
-No!
-No!

790
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,206
-No!
-No!

791
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,309
What have you done? No!

792
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,344
What is that?

793
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,881
-Truffle oil.
-Truffle oil?

794
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,416
-In radish kimchi?
-Yes, truffle oil.

795
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,018
-Hey! Come on!
-Wait, what is that?

796
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,687
WILL THAT TASTE OKAY?

797
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:36,621
I don't get it.

798
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,791
HE FINISHES MAKING THE
MYSTERIOUS TRUFFLE RADISH KIMCHI

799
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,492
This is what I'm curious about.

800
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,828
The mix of dongchimi and milk.

801
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,364
-Even I don't cross that line.
-Okay, now.

802
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,133
-Let me try this.
-Even he won't cross that line.

803
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,135
Even Poong said he crossed the line.

804
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,138
Does it taste nice?

805
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,740
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

806
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,376
-It tastes nice!
-Why?

807
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,079
-It tastes nice!
-Why?

808
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,580
It tastes nice!

809
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,781
Why?

810
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,484
-It tastes nice!
-That makes no sense!

811
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,686
FABRI HAD A PLAN ALL ALONG

812
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,588
-This is good.
-How so?

813
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,123
Does the naengmyeon broth work with that?

814
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,624
-It has that savory flavor.
-Really?

815
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,360
It's milky and savory.

816
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,928
This is really nice.

817
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,131
-I can't even imagine what it's like.
-That's amazing.

818
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,400
CHEF SOHYI QUIETLY
BEGINS TO MOVE FASTER

819
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,336
SHE SLICES PERILLA LEAVES
INTO THIN PIECES

820
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,839
GROUND PEPPER,
OLIVE OIL, VINEGAR

821
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,542
5. MIX GROUND PEPPER,
OLIVE OIL, VINEGAR,

822
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,779
PERILLA LEAVES,
GARLIC TO MAKE DRESSING

823
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,249
SHE ADDS SUGAR FOR SWEETNESS
AS A FINISHING TOUCH

824
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,685
Chef Sohyi is serving her food now.

825
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,023
The watermelon pieces
really look like steak.

826
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,291
That's really amazing.

827
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,327
-I can't even imagine.
-Yes, it's hard to imagine.

828
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,195
The watermelon steak.

829
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,164
Why don't you taste
something Chef Sohyi made?

830
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,233
The tomato and pork mix.

831
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,334
HE TASTES THE STIR-FRY

832
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,570
Will it make them say
the kimchi tastes nice infinitely?

833
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,640
Will it make them say
the kimchi tastes nice infinitely?

834
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,743
-Do you crave some kimchi?
-Look at his face.

835
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,578
No, I don't think so.

836
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,280
I think it'll be too salty

837
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,448
if I eat it with kimchi.

838
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,684
-Oh, no.
-This is bad.

839
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,854
-I doubt it.
-You doubt it?

840
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,992
Please remember that
you'll have to serve it with kimchi.

841
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,761
-All right. Are you done?
-Yes.

842
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,996
Chef Sohyi is done!

843
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,532
-She's already done!
-She had a minute and 57 seconds.

844
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,534
THAT'S AWESOME

845
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,203
-Do you need help?
-Yes.

846
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,605
-She's already done.
-Do I flip these?

847
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,741
She's now helping with his dish.

848
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,709
-She's helping Fabri.
-She's so cool.

849
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,978
-She's helping him.
-Do I have to flip these?

850
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,681
-He's your opponent. Is this okay?
-It's fine.

851
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,050
-She's so cool.
-Thank you. You're awesome.

852
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,985
-The champagne is giving him trouble!
-The champagne!

853
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,488
-Hey, the cap.
-What will you use it for?

854
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,623
Why did you grab the champagne?

855
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,726
He just put the sauce on the dish.

856
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,929
-The dongchimi sauce.
-I'm getting curious.

857
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,132
How did Fabri come up with this idea?

858
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,335
Is that cheese?

859
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,370
-Is that cheese?
-Yes.

860
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,839
-It looks so good.
-Gosh, I know.

861
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,174
He grilled the cheese lightly.

862
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,310
You have a minute left!

863
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,712
You have under a minute left.
It's now 55 seconds.

864
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,814
Chef Sohyi serves the champagne.

865
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,917
She doesn't consider him an opponent.
She's gladly helping out.

866
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,386
Fabri must finish up soon. Forty seconds.

867
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,922
-Only Fabri remains.
-Thirty seconds!

868
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,525
You have 25 seconds left.

869
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,161
You must finish up, Fabri.

870
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,395
Are you done?

871
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,231
-Fabri?
-Yes?

872
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,899
-One second.
-You aren't done yet?

873
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,033
I want to do this myself.

874
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,436
Pour the champagne. Fifteen seconds.

875
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,871
You need to finish up.

876
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,306
Ten. Nine. Eight.

877
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,608
Seven. Six.

878
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,743
-That's so cool.
-Five. Four.

879
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,913
-He's done.
-He's finished.

880
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,982
-They're both done cooking.
-This is so cool.

881
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,850
-They're done.
-In just 15 minutes.

882
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,619
AMAZED

883
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,254
-This is crazy.
-It's amazing.

884
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,156
This is so cool.

885
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,124
I really wonder what the sauce is like.

886
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,592
I can't imagine what that's like.

887
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,827
-It's so cool.
-Is it?

888
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,530
-Yes, in just 15 minutes.
-In just 15 minutes.

889
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:09,567
-First, Chef Sohyi's Kimchi Maestro.
-Kimchi Maestro.

890
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,572
A HARMONY OF PORK AND WATERMELON

891
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:20,545
CHEF KIM SOHYI'S KIMCHI MAESTRO

892
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,582
She stir-fried pork and tomatoes together.

893
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,417
-It looks so good.
-Yes.

894
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,552
It smells so wonderful.

895
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,054
HOSHI, the kimchi ambassador,

896
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:34,525
must've requested this order.

897
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,660
But WOOZI will try it too.

898
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,461
It's really watermelon.

899
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,530
This is fascinating.
I've never had watermelon steak.

900
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,400
They split it in half and share it nicely.

901
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,735
-They're good friends.
-They are.

902
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,237
They got along for a decade.

903
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,639
They got along for a decade.

904
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,975
They got along for a decade.

905
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,245
THIS IS A SERIOUS ACCIDENT

906
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,350
Oh, my gosh. WOOZI!

907
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,986
He just dropped the watermelon steak!

908
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,155
Oh, my gosh. WOOZI!

909
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,657
-I'm so sorry.
-He just dropped the watermelon steak!

910
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,427
-What now, WOOZI?
-It's all right.

911
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,995
-What now?
-I'll eat this.

912
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,030
WHOA, NO WAY

913
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,133
-I have some here. He can take the half.
-Don't do that.

914
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,835
-I'll give you half.
-HOSHI shares his half.

915
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,605
-I have more watermelon here.
-Don't eat that.

916
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,774
-No, he can't try that.
-He can't?

917
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,142
He can't try the new piece.

918
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,144
It's okay. They'll share the half.

919
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,214
-This will strengthen their friendship.
-It's slippery.

920
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,784
-Yes, it was slippery. I'm sorry.
-It's really slippery.

921
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,219
It's not like meat.

922
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,589
-Yes, right.
-SEVENTEEN shares even a tiny piece.

923
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,359
It turned into a quarter from half.

924
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,995
-It's just one bite.
-Yes, one bite.

925
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,830
You'll have to judge her with that.

926
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,566
-It's all right. Look at that.
-With one bite?

927
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,234
Don't forget
the young summer radish kimchi.

928
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,971
-Forget what happened and taste it.
-Yes.

929
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,840
They're trying it.
Do they go well together?

930
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,844
I wonder how watermelon will taste
with pork and tomatoes.

931
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,712
Look at HOSHI.

932
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,150
WOOZI ate everything in one bite.

933
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,419
He's a guy who knows how to enjoy it.

934
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,955
-And try the young summer radish kimchi.
-The kimchi.

935
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,357
Will watermelon taste good

936
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,892
-with pork and tomatoes?
-I wonder.

937
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,427
I'm really curious.

938
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,063
There's only a tiny piece left.

939
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,399
He didn't want this to happen.

940
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,334
He's savoring the flavor.

941
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,871
-This is so good.
-I'm curious.

942
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,307
This is so good.

943
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,876
He's amazed at the flavor.

944
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,879
-He keeps making astonished noises.
-It looks like

945
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,380
the watermelon is rather juicy.

946
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,848
I can hear the watery sound.

947
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,085
When I bite on the watermelon,

948
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,887
it gives out the juice,

949
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,222
but at the same time, it's crunchy
and sweet like dalgona.

950
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,425
-It's because she roasted it.
-Yes.

951
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,959
Did it retain the sweetness?

952
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,394
Yes, it's sweet.

953
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,931
It's very sweet,
but the pork harmonizes the flavor.

954
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,500
It's a mix of sweetness and saltiness.

955
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,137
But as soon as I had the kimchi,
everything just melted away.

956
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,305
It's fantastic. I've never had

957
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,540
-anything like this.
-No?

958
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,741
But she also used perilla leaves.

959
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,044
-That also adds a good smell.
-I see.

960
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,281
I thought the pork
and tomato stir-fry was a bit too salty.

961
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,249
-Not at all.
-It's not too salty?

962
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,187
-The watermelon wasn't seasoned.
-Right. It wasn't seasoned.

963
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,322
-It's so good.
-Let's hear from WOOZI.

964
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,690
You may think

965
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,759
my response is too abstract,

966
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,028
but it feels like I'm biting the cloud

967
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,431
off the autumn sky at sunset.

968
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,067
-That's why he's a songwriter.
-He's amazing.

969
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,002
He's an artist.

970
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,138
-Watermelon is a summer fruit.
-Yes.

971
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,940
But when it got warmer,

972
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,442
-its texture became much softer.
-It's so good.

973
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:42,246
But the pork and kimchi add
the crunchy texture to the dish.

974
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,281
It was a new experience.

975
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,350
I think tomatoes play a huge role.

976
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,152
I see. How so?

977
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,588
The watermelon pops and gives out juice,

978
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,824
and the tomato
also pops and gives out juice.

979
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,259
-I get what you mean.
-They all pop.

980
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,294
Popping and juicy.

981
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,829
He chewed on autumn sky's cloud,

982
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,831
but he just said it was popping and juicy.

983
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,034
-They play different roles.
-They do.

984
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:07,071
-I thought she chose the perfect kimchi.
-Yes, the kimchi.

985
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,807
There were many others,
but her choice was a perfect one.

986
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,411
If this was just oily meat
and sweetness of the watermelon,

987
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,146
I could've gotten sick of it.

988
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,616
-Young summer radish kimchi is refreshing.
-It refreshed my mouth.

989
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,052
The young summer radish kimchi
went perfectly with the dish.

990
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,955
-Next up, Chef Fabri.
-I really want to try this one.

991
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,924
Kimchi Gnocchi Vibes.

992
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,728
POTATO CHIP GNOCCHI
SITTING ON THE EXOTIC SAUCE

993
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:35,266
CHEF FABRI'S
KIMCHI GNOCCHI VIBES

994
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,135
Try the gnocchi first,
and then the radish kimchi.

995
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,471
Lastly, have a sip of champagne.

996
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,808
-It'll be a stroke of genius.
-All right.

997
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,209
Will it taste okay?

998
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,845
Try the gnocchi first,
then the radish kimchi.

999
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,580
I'm dying to know.

1000
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,483
It's that layer of sauce
on the bottom of the plate.

1001
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,953
I've never been so curious
about a dish as I am now.

1002
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,688
-He ground up the truffle potato chips.
-Yes.

1003
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,892
He roasted ground chips
mixed with ground kimchi.

1004
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,762
CHUCKLING

1005
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,397
Gosh, this is really good.

1006
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,132
-He says it's good.
-It…

1007
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,868
It feels like truffle potato fries.

1008
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,570
-Really?
-Yes.

1009
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,371
It's like French fries and…

1010
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,106
-Hash brown?
-Whoa.

1011
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,608
-It's like that.
-Right? It looked like it.

1012
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,711
She hasn't tried it, but she knows better.

1013
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,779
What is this?

1014
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,013
He tried the radish kimchi.

1015
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,783
My gosh. This radish kimchi is insane.

1016
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,084
It must be that good.

1017
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,786
It has this unique smell.

1018
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,354
-It must smell smoky.
-Yes.

1019
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,858
Can you taste the smoky flavor,
the truffle oil, and the kimchi taste?

1020
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,226
Yes, everything.

1021
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,295
-But they all go well together.
-It must be a great mix.

1022
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,598
-How's the soup? The sauce.
-The sauce.

1023
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,501
It almost feels like cheese.

1024
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,702
Cheese?

1025
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,570
-From the broth, I mean.
-From the broth?

1026
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,405
It's naengmyeon broth, milk, and butter,

1027
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,009
but I can taste
a bit of cheese from the sauce.

1028
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:56,480
It's because naengmyeon broth is sour.
That plus cream makes it cheesy.

1029
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,882
I see.

1030
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:02,219
This sauce was a perfect kick.

1031
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,023
The radish kimchi just has

1032
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,692
a bit of fragrance
on top of its original flavor,

1033
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,630
-and gnocchi tastes like potato chips.
-It's familiar.

1034
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,065
But this sauce jumps in and goes,

1035
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,401
"No, it's not the flavor you think it is."

1036
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,069
It changes the dish completely.

1037
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,705
THE GAME CHANGER SAUCE

1038
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,375
-The sauce is really good.
-That's amazing.

1039
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,745
-I see. WOOZI takes another bite.
-It must taste cheesy.

1040
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,082
WOOZI still savors the flavor.

1041
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,717
He's different from HOSHI.

1042
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,554
-This is good.
-HOSHI's like, "Whoa, this is good!"

1043
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,123
-But WOOZI remains calm.
-They play different roles.

1044
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,792
-This was why they made it to a decade.
-Exactly.

1045
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,995
-Congratulations on your anniversary.
-Congratulations.

1046
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,898
Does it go well with champagne?

1047
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,867
-Totally.
-I see.

1048
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:54,705
-I was dying to try this.
-Let's try Chef Sohyi's Kimchi Maestro.

1049
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,408
Try some young summer radish kimchi
served with the dish.

1050
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,376
The pairing is important.

1051
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,046
The meat.
The meat itself would've been too salty.

1052
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,614
It's refreshing and delicious.

1053
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,582
Thank you.

1054
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,051
I can smell the perilla leaves too.

1055
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,219
I'll try this, then…

1056
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,220
EYES WIDENED

1057
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,756
I can smell the perilla leaves too.

1058
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,224
ISN'T IT REALLY GOOD?

1059
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,726
I'll try this, then…

1060
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,296
What?

1061
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,466
It's watermelon,
but it doesn't feel like watermelon.

1062
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,903
I really feel like I'm eating steak.

1063
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,140
If you close your eyes,
it'll feel like a fatty piece of meat.

1064
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,842
-Isn't it like that?
-Yes!

1065
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,210
It's like sweet and sour pork,

1066
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,079
-but made very tender.
-Yes, right.

1067
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,615
-And very juicy.
-It's so good.

1068
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,049
This is delicious.

1069
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,553
It would've been too salty
if it was served without watermelon.

1070
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,021
I gave Mimi two pieces.

1071
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,490
-I had two pieces.
-I see.

1072
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,592
Then you must've had much more than WOOZI.

1073
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,296
-I'm sorry.
-He dropped half of this delicious dish.

1074
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,732
-I'm so sorry.
-Gosh.

1075
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,634
I think I understand

1076
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,569
why WOOZI mentioned autumn.

1077
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:03,207
It feels like the disappointment
at the end of your summer vacation.

1078
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:08,078
-It had that late summer taste.
-The artists can connect.

1079
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,147
It feels like you're sad to see summer go.

1080
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,549
I can feel that warmth of autumn.

1081
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,952
-And that autumn…
-Why can't I connect

1082
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,187
to the things you say, Poong?

1083
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,257
We each play different roles.

1084
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,526
-He's more like a webtoon.
-Nice.

1085
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:26,030
Next, let's try
Fabri's Kimchi Gnocchi Vibes.

1086
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,531
-I was so curious.
-This one.

1087
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,966
-This is crazy.
-Kimchi Gnocchi Vibes.

1088
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,202
-What is this soup?
-How did he do this?

1089
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,537
-What?
-What?

1090
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,673
What is this?

1091
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,842
-I feel it, but can't put a finger on it.
-It doesn't seem odd.

1092
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,411
I knew these guys very well,

1093
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,380
-but they have changed.
-Yes, exactly.

1094
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:47,584
It tastes familiar yet new.
I kept wondering what it was,

1095
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,720
-and it tasted like yogurt.
-It was like yogurt!

1096
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,556
-It's like yogurt.
-It tastes like yogurt.

1097
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,092
-This is such a wonder.
-It is.

1098
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,960
-You're a genius.
-This was a surprise.

1099
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,328
This is such a wonder.

1100
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,364
I think only Fabri can have this idea.

1101
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,932
Koreans couldn't do this.

1102
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,169
Gosh.

1103
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,704
A BIG SMILE

1104
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,971
The gnocchi is extraordinary.

1105
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,908
The kimchi pieces keep popping out.

1106
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,443
They keep popping out.

1107
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,380
If I had to put this
in Chef Sohyi's words,

1108
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,448
"It tastes like kiddy food."

1109
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,783
-Like kids' food?
-Kids would love this.

1110
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,720
It's like having cheesy potato chips
and yogurt at the same time.

1111
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,488
It feels like that.

1112
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,124
-Yes, it feels that familiar.
-Yes.

1113
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,660
But it's way up on the top from there.

1114
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,496
On top of that, he added truffle oil
to the radish kimchi.

1115
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,232
I think younger people will
enjoy this a lot.

1116
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,333
I see.

1117
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,168
There was a guy
who worried about this the most.

1118
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,403
Chef Sung-jun?

1119
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,206
After all, he's an Italian chef.

1120
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,842
He thought Italian cuisine
shouldn't be like this.

1121
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,677
-What do you think?
-Forget that.

1122
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,947
First of all, I was the most worried
about the theme.

1123
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,283
-The sourness and balance were excellent.
-Right?

1124
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,086
So when it paired up with kimchi,

1125
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,656
I began to question
if kimchi was necessary for this.

1126
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,625
-Rather?
-The dish itself was great.

1127
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:06,396
The sourness, saltiness,
and the crunchy texture were perfect.

1128
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,632
So I didn't crave kimchi that much.

1129
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,534
He's trying to find fault with it.

1130
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,036
What would Italians say
if they tried this?

1131
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,372
He can't go to Italy anymore.

1132
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,440
He can't go?

1133
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,541
He's banned from entering.

1134
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,310
-It's time to decide.
-It's our time to decide.

1135
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,012
You'll have to put a star on someone.

1136
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,480
It must be so hard.

1137
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,949
Both of these were delicious.
What do I do?

1138
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,484
These were both good.

1139
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,419
They were both too perfect,

1140
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,790
so it makes no sense to say
one was better than the other.

1141
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,392
-But we only have one star.
-Right.

1142
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,327
Please make a wise choice.

1143
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,029
Press one for Fabri

1144
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,331
and two for Sohyi.

1145
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,902
Please make your decision
and press the button.

1146
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,437
They may have different tastes.

1147
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,407
-They play different roles in the team.
-Right.

1148
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,810
HOSHI pushed the button, and so did WOOZI.

1149
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,847
Now, we have the result.

1150
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,716
And here's the result.

1151
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,984
WHO DID HOSHI AND WOOZI CHOOSE?

1152
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,286
What will happen?

1153
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,687
One to one.

1154
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,056
One to one.

1155
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,328
My gosh. It was a close game.

1156
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,398
And now, you two must
come to an agreement.

1157
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:16,533
I thought…

1158
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,636
…so it'll taste imperfect without that.

1159
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,005
I think that was why I chose otherwise.

1160
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,174
But I thought this was so good.

1161
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,411
WHAT'S THE RESULT
OF THEIR AGREEMENT?

1162
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,147
-They came to an agreement as we speak.
-Yes.

1163
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,416
-Have you two decided?
-Yes.

1164
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,886
I wonder which one of them was chosen.

1165
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,621
Let's find out. Show us!

1166
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:42,059
<i>What is this mix? Oh, my</i>

1167
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,393
<i>Kimchi, nice</i>

1168
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,863
Will it be Sohyi or Fabri?

1169
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,866
The initial score was one to one,
so HOSHI and WOOZI

1170
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,602
had a discussion and made a decision.

1171
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,503
Sohyi has one win so far.

1172
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,372
Fabri had won twice.

1173
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,308
Who'll keep their winning streak going?

1174
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,677
Who's the winner?

1175
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,913
Who won?

1176
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,082
Show us the result!

1177
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,218
Show us the result!

1178
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,354
KIM SOHYI WINS

1179
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,356
CHEF KIM SOHYI'S
KIMCHI MAESTRO WINS

1180
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,126
Sohyi wins! Chef Sohyi wins!

1181
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,462
Thank you.

1182
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,398
Well, that's that.

1183
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,567
I wouldn't have been surprised
with either one.

1184
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,469
Yes, these were both delicious.

1185
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:26,904
Whose initial choice was this?

1186
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,373
-WOOZI.
-I had picked Chef Sohyi.

1187
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,375
-I see.
-I picked her.

1188
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,077
I agreed completely to what Sung-jun said.

1189
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:37,080
Everything was delicious,
but I didn't crave the radish kimchi.

1190
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,483
It was fine without the kimchi.

1191
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,319
But Chef Sohyi's dish was
centered around sweetness,

1192
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,688
so it'll taste imperfect
without the young summer radish kimchi.

1193
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,424
-After all, the pairing was the theme.
-I thought so.

1194
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,026
But the radish kimchi was so good.

1195
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,495
Of course, Chef Fabri's dish was good,

1196
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,830
but Chef Sohyi's dish
would've been imperfect

1197
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,566
without the young summer radish kimchi.

1198
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:00,304
I thought the harmony was perfect.

1199
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,439
THEY DECIDED ON
ITS HARMONY WITH KIMCHI

1200
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,875
-HOSHI, you were convinced, right?
-Yes.

1201
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,610
I mostly just tag along

1202
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,045
with what the producer says.

1203
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,147
IS THAT HOW THEY LASTED SO LONG?

1204
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,549
-That's how we choose our songs.
-He just tags along.

1205
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,518
-I just do my best at my part.
-That's excellent.

1206
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,087
Chef Sohyi wins twice in a row.

1207
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,423
Please put the star on her, HOSHI.

1208
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,224
CONGRATULATIONS

1209
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,826
CLAPPING

1210
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,296
Chef Sohyi takes her second win!

1211
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,098
She captured SEVENTEEN's heart.

1212
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,100
Nice! Keep it up.

1213
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,435
Congratulations!

1214
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,236
Thank you.

1215
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,606
This is the second round with ingredients

1216
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,775
from HOSHI and WOOZI's fridge.

1217
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,144
Chef Sung-jun, the chair
of the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance,

1218
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:45,782
versus Chef Nam-no,
the muscle of the alliance.

1219
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,718
All right.

1220
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,520
Yesterday's friend became today's foe.

1221
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,189
-Really?
-These two got along well

1222
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,459
-as the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance.
-Yes.

1223
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,494
The fight has broken out
under the same roof.

1224
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,896
It was really uncomfortable
in the green room.

1225
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,833
We received an amazing report.

1226
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,235
It was recorded,
so I took a listen to it too.

1227
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,737
-It was recorded?
-Recorded?

1228
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,474
-Chef Sung-jun made a shocking statement.
-What is it?

1229
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,076
"After this round,

1230
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:17,047
I plan to leave
the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance."

1231
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,183
Your closest friend can be
the biggest foe.

1232
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,619
Is he leaving the show? What is this?

1233
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,389
-He'll leave the alliance…
-And go where?

1234
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,558
…and side with Son Jong-won,
Mr. Good Vibes.

1235
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,093
-I can't do this anymore.
-Yes?

1236
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,528
I decided to lose weight.

1237
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,030
-What?
-Is it happening now?

1238
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,766
-I'll do my best to lose weight, and…
-Wait.

1239
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,000
What?

1240
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,069
I also want to be Mr. Good Vibes.

1241
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:40,937
-I don't follow.
-What now?

1242
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:45,642
He's saying he's trying to lose weight,
thinking he'll become 100% handsome.

1243
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:50,147
He thinks he can be like Chef Jong-won
only if he loses his weight.

1244
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:51,982
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1245
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,483
AND THIS MAN IS LAUGHING AT HIM

1246
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,552
-He's mocking him so much.
-This is…

1247
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,088
-I've seen his old pictures.
-Sure.

1248
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,891
He wasn't so good-looking.

1249
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,626
-Even when he was thinner?
-Why not?

1250
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:05,095
Wasn't this a cook-off?
Was this a beauty pageant?

1251
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,132
Is Chef Jong-won aware of this?

1252
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,468
Well, I don't need his permission
to be his fan.

1253
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,705
-That's true.
-But you already look cool enough.

1254
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,774
Stop that. He'll think it's true.

1255
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,243
ZIPPING HER MOUTH

1256
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,612
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS:
TRUFFLE OIL, LEMON JUICE

1257
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,147
COD FILLET, CABBAGE,
CHAMPAGNE, PERILLA LEAVES

1258
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,182
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS:
PLUM EXTRACT,

1259
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,249
GRILLING CHEESE,
SPARKLING WATER, CABBAGE

1260
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,284
TRUFFLE BALSAMIC VINEGAR,
BLUE CRAB SAUCE,

1261
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,318
STRIP LOIN, LEMON JUICE, AND MORE

1262
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,822
Chef Nam-no, what's your dish?

1263
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:32,856
I wonder.

1264
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,759
-Why are you crying?
-What's wrong?

1265
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,328
-It'll be harder if you drag this on.
-That's true.

1266
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,130
It's their tenth anniversary!

1267
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,232
-Here's the dish I prepared today.
-Yes?

1268
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:45,769
<i>Fighting Steamed Cod</i>

1269
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,070
Fighting Steamed Cod.

1270
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,006
KEEP IT UP, NAM-NO…

1271
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,042
-<i>Fighting</i>
-Steamed cod?

1272
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,178
Can you show us the dance
for Fighting Steamed Cod?

1273
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,648
<i>Fighting Steamed Cod</i>

1274
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:02,352
<i>Fighting Steamed Cod</i>

1275
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,653
He surely is different.

1276
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,123
-They're completely different.
-Completely.

1277
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,657
-Totally different vibes.
-Did you write this, WOOZI?

1278
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:08,758
-You're right.
-I see.

1279
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,861
WOOZI has the copyright to the song.

1280
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,796
That's why he didn't move.

1281
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,499
-He gets the money anyway.
-Right.

1282
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,768
I'm going to make steamed cod.

1283
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,737
I plan to make their symbol,

1284
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,574
the diamond carat, with an onion.

1285
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,276
-A diamond carat with an onion?
-Yes.

1286
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,812
And to commemorate
their tenth anniversary,

1287
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:33,250
I want to use the champagne you had
to make sauce with French technique.

1288
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,585
-That's my plan.
-I see.

1289
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,521
Up against him is Chef Sung-jun.

1290
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,189
What's your dish?

1291
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,690
The dish I prepared is…

1292
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,760
<i>I Feel Like I Became SEVENTEEN</i>

1293
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,097
<i>I Feel Like I Became SEVENTEEN</i>

1294
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,334
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
I FEEL LIKE I BECAME SEVENTEEN

1295
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,303
IN SHOCK…

1296
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,272
He's good.

1297
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,107
I thought I just saw an executioner.

1298
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,310
-It was like an executioner's dance.
-It was awful.

1299
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,678
What's it called again?

1300
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,813
<i>I Feel Like I Became SEVENTEEN</i>

1301
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,485
-He just danced.
-How does the dance go?

1302
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,655
<i>I feel like I became SONOGONG</i>

1303
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,457
-This is the dance.
-It's the same.

1304
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,826
It's completely different.
I thought it was Psy's dance.

1305
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,332
-And the copyright goes to WOOZI?
-WOOZI.

1306
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,234
He sits there and makes money.

1307
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,037
-That's the best, though.
-Yes.

1308
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,240
I want to present SEVENTEEN in my dish.

1309
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,643
-I see.
-SEVENTEEN consists of 13 members,

1310
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,844
three units,

1311
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,646
and one team.

1312
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,115
I'll use 13 ingredients

1313
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,184
and three units

1314
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,786
to make one dish.

1315
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,623
And the three units will represent
the nationalities of the members.

1316
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,893
-America, China, and Korea.
-How did he know?

1317
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,431
I'll roll the meat up in some cheese
and deep-fry it for the American dish.

1318
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,865
For Chinese, I'll make salad
with the Chinese sour soy sauce.

1319
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,668
Lastly, bibimbap, the Korean dish.

1320
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,271
I'm going to make one dish with
Korean, Chinese, and American touches.

1321
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,207
-That's awesome.
-It's a representation of SEVENTEEN.

1322
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,643
-That's what I plan to make.
-I'm curious.

1323
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,579
-That's so amazing.
-It is.

1324
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:15,452
And now, let us begin the round
titled Happy SEVENTEEN Day.

1325
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:18,088
Chef Yoon Nam-no is here today

1326
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:22,259
as SEVENTEEN's fan club,
the muscle for CARATs.

1327
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:25,962
Up against him is a guy
who wants to become their 14th member,

1328
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,399
the SEVENTEEN wannabe,

1329
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,768
Chef Kwon Sung-jun.

1330
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,739
Which one of them will get to host
their tenth anniversary team meet-up?

1331
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,675
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1332
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,177
Begin!

1333
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,413
THEIR CEREMONY

1334
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,748
THE FIGHT HAS BEGUN!

1335
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,550
SUNG-JUN HEATS UP
THE INSTANT RICE RIGHT AWAY!

1336
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,885
That was cool!

1337
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,688
That was cool.
When did they come up with that?

1338
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,590
-Yes, it was.
-Look at them.

1339
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,559
How did he come up with the idea
to leave the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance?

1340
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,662
-Right?
-Whoa!

1341
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:00,630
WHOA

1342
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,798
-My gosh!
-Gosh.

1343
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,266
THE SPEEDY GUY

1344
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,701
-Look at him go.
-Whoa.

1345
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,137
He's probably
the fastest at chopping in Korea.

1346
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,807
-He chops without looking at it.
-He's so fast.

1347
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,575
Sung-jun looked at it, though.

1348
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,980
He's taking a peek.

1349
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,982
Yes, Nam-no is on fire too.

1350
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,817
IT ENDED IN A FLASH

1351
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:22,852
LOOKING FAR OUT
INTO THE DISTANCE!

1352
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:26,756
Look at Sung-jun.
He's looking out into the distance too.

1353
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,258
Deep-fried chicken in sour sauce?

1354
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,995
AND HE ADDS YUJA PONZU!

1355
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,963
BIBIMBAP

1356
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,933
HE PUTS THE ONION
HE CHOPPED WITHOUT LOOKING!

1357
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,301
Are you stir-frying the onion?

1358
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,136
Can you open this? No.

1359
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,805
What will he do with that?

1360
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,873
I'll boil down the onion with champagne.

1361
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,208
I see, the onion?

1362
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,278
-He'll boil it down in champagne?
-Yes.

1363
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:49,979
Whoa, man.

1364
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,383
SOMEONE SUDDENLY
POPPED THE BOTTLE!

1365
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,090
All right!

1366
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,258
THIS IS SEVENTEEN'S
10TH ANNIVERSARY

1367
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:03,493
Congratulations!

1368
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,596
We did it!

1369
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,734
-Italians are so loud.
-This happened before too.

1370
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,902
-It'll go in here.
-Okay.

1371
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,137
1. BOIL ONION DOWN IN CHAMPAGNE

1372
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,072
He's using champagne.

1373
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,807
That's a lot of champagne.

1374
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,542
How much should he charge for that?

1375
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:22,011
-He dropped a bottle in it.
-That's a lot.

1376
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,947
-A whole bottle.
-The fish.

1377
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,515
Did you season cod fillets in salt?

1378
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:30,220
Yes, you must season it handsomely
when you braise the dish.

1379
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,355
And olive oil.

1380
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,524
-It's truffle oil.
-Truffle oil.

1381
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:38,027
2. SEASON COD FILLETS
WITH SALT AND TRUFFLE OIL

1382
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,130
SUNG-JUN IS USING
LOTS OF VEGGIES

1383
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,465
Look at what he's doing.

1384
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,869
-He's scraping off cucumber seeds.
-Cucumbers?

1385
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,737
That'll bring out the texture.

1386
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,172
I see.

1387
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,807
He knows what he's talking about.

1388
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:51,808
He's right.

1389
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,110
-He's good.
-He scrapes the seeds from Korean melons.

1390
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,513
-He scrapes the seeds from Korean melons.
-He needs to.

1391
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,415
-That's the good part.
-Right?

1392
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,183
-That's my favorite part.
-Me too.

1393
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,753
HE SURELY IS IN CHARGE OF SPEED!

1394
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,756
YOUNG SUMMER RADISH KIMCHI

1395
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:09,659
AND SESAME OIL

1396
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,496
-He's using lots of onions.
-He's putting a lot of work into it.

1397
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,331
He's making the carat shape with an onion.

1398
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,902
-I see. He's making shapes.
-Yes.

1399
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,739
-Can he do it in 15 minutes?
-He needs to stay focused.

1400
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,575
-This is a delicate process.
-It is.

1401
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,377
He won't cut it all the way.

1402
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,646
Is he making carrots with onion?

1403
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:30,747
No, like carats, diamonds.

1404
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,782
-Carrots? Diamonds?
-Yes.

1405
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,751
-Diamonds.
-Our fandom is called CARAT.

1406
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:35,985
I get it.

1407
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,454
Did you think they were carrots?

1408
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,157
They aren't horses.

1409
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,959
SEVENTEEN is a horse?

1410
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,794
Carat, for diamonds.

1411
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,664
HE'S MAKING A DIAMOND SHAPE
WITH ONION!

1412
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,332
It's flower-shaped.

1413
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:52,035
-It looks like a flower.
-Whoa.

1414
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,904
I hope the shape turns out nicely.

1415
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,940
The onion and what?

1416
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,741
He's frying the whole onion.

1417
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,744
-Deep-fried onion?
-Is he making just one?

1418
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,548
I know. I've won once by doing that.

1419
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,550
-When?
-During the first season.

1420
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,486
Don't bring up such ancient history.

1421
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,356
He's frying the whole thing.

1422
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:14,257
He dropped it.

1423
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,594
I guess he isn't frying it over high heat.

1424
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,596
No, I have to pull out the water
as slowly as possible.

1425
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,997
AH-HA

1426
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,165
Slow, over low heat.

1427
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,033
It's been five minutes already.

1428
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,469
-Chef Sung-jun got some meat.
-Meat.

1429
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,770
Will he flatten that?

1430
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,306
-Aren't you going to make three dishes?
-Yes.

1431
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,207
FLATTEN!

1432
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,244
Yes, he said
he'd roll up cheese with meat.

1433
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,912
SUNG-JUN SLOWLY
BUILDS UP HIS DISH

1434
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,815
He said he'd make three dishes,
but look at the time already.

1435
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,216
1. FLATTEN THE STRIP LOIN
WITH A HAMMER

1436
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,853
He said he'd roll up the meat
and deep-fry it.

1437
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,490
NAM-NO GETS PLASTIC WRAP TOO!

1438
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,560
I think he's making a sandwich
by using cod fillet and perilla leaves.

1439
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,829
Perilla leaf sandwich?

1440
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,764
-He wrapped cod fillet with perilla leaf.
-Yes.

1441
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,533
-Why are my hands trembling?
-It's unique that he uses

1442
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,002
-both truffle oil and perilla leaves.
-I see.

1443
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,103
-It is extraordinary.
-It is.

1444
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,205
-He mixed perilla leaf with truffle oil?
-Yes.

1445
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,106
I wonder if the smell will work.

1446
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,575
-Where is it?
-But those both smell strong.

1447
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,244
He's going to steam those.

1448
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,847
-He's steaming the cod. It was named so.
-He's steaming it.

1449
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,550
He should pop holes in those.

1450
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,151
-Should he flatten it more?
-No, pop holes.

1451
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,653
-He needs to pop holes.
-He has to make holes?

1452
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,820
Is that so?

1453
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,722
He should poke two holes

1454
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,491
to let the steam escape.

1455
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,092
What now? Tell me.

1456
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,062
You have to make one or two holes
when you steam your fish.

1457
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,830
-It'll be fine.
-Really?

1458
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,699
He won't have to listen to Chef Sohyi.

1459
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:30,833
I guess so.

1460
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,802
-He'll be fine.
-Yes.

1461
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,205
Chefs all have a good reason
when they make a move.

1462
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,074
FAITH

1463
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,275
-I have nine minutes.
-He must keep the shape.

1464
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,744
-Nine minutes left.
-There isn't a lot of time.

1465
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,712
Time really flies.

1466
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,714
Are you using tenderloin?

1467
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,750
-No, strip loin.
-Right. They had strip loin.

1468
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:48,918
Whoa, the sauce.

1469
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,220
-It's yuja soy sauce.
-I see.

1470
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,689
Yuja soy sauce?

1471
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,690
It'll smell wonderful.

1472
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,024
GROUND PEPPER

1473
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,928
-He's wrapping cheese with meat.
-Cheese and meat.

1474
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,129
That looks so good.

1475
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,068
He's securing the piece like a skewer.

1476
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,235
He's fixing those.

1477
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,938
The cheese will slip out
when you bite the meat.

1478
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,107
Is that all right?

1479
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,343
It's over low heat, so it should be fine.

1480
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,378
-He knows a lot.
-He fries it over low heat.

1481
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,148
If the heat was too high,
the water in it would've made it overflow.

1482
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,183
HOSHI, you didn't know, right?

1483
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,951
-Not at all.
-Not at all. Right.

1484
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,355
-I was wondering why.
-You must've been wondering.

1485
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,394
Wait, the plastic wrap is rising.

1486
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,528
FEELING SELF-CONSCIOUS

1487
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:33,896
POKING

1488
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,166
-He had to do it.
-He didn't do as Chef Sohyi said!

1489
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,935
-He's doing it now.
-Yes, right now.

1490
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:41,437
-He's doing it now.
-He's doing it now.

1491
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:45,575
-Come on! You should've done so first.
-Exactly.

1492
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,944
FEELING AWKWARD

1493
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,312
She said it'd expand.

1494
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,147
-You have 6 minutes and 20 seconds.
-You got 6 minutes and 30 seconds.

1495
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,916
STARCH AND FRYING POWDER

1496
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,352
What's Chef Sung-jun doing?

1497
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,154
I'm making deep-fry batter.

1498
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,989
Why are you doing it over ice?

1499
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:03,259
Because it creates less gluten
and makes it crunchier.

1500
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,294
It also applies to sparkling water
instead of water.

1501
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:08,031
-Sparkling water. Yes.
-Sparkling water over regular water.

1502
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,500
-That's cool. Whoa.
-It's crunchier.

1503
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,902
The rolled meat fritter.

1504
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,904
And that deep-fry batter.

1505
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:19,709
Sung-jun puts a lot of effort
into frying the meat roll-up.

1506
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:24,013
And Nam-no is putting
a lot of effort into the fried onion.

1507
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,948
-They're both making deep-fried food.
-Yes.

1508
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,284
It looks pretty.

1509
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:33,322
-It's the Japanese style.
-The Japanese style.

1510
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,059
I guess his hands don't hurt.

1511
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,494
Look at how they look like flowers.

1512
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,330
You haven't even begun on bibimbap.

1513
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,568
I think Chef Sung-jun will need more time.

1514
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,472
These dishes will be made
to celebrate their tenth anniversary.

1515
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,640
You have five minutes left!

1516
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,208
-Please go up, Jung-hwan.
-Sure.

1517
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,511
Sung-jun is making bibimbap now.

1518
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:59,415
Wait, I was wondering
if he'd make some stone pot bibimbap.

1519
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:02,585
But he just mixed rice and veggies.

1520
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,788
It's like something my mom eats
when she eats alone.

1521
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:08,057
That's what we eat
when we don't have an appetite.

1522
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,059
My mom used to do that!

1523
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:12,061
That's exactly the style.

1524
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,732
Wait, this should be a happy day
for SEVENTEEN.

1525
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,134
We can eat that whenever we want to,

1526
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,402
but this is their tenth anniversary.

1527
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,038
We do that to clear out leftovers.

1528
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:25,408
He took a huge bite
to call it just tasting.

1529
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:26,609
He had a lot.

1530
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,745
It's like cake. It's shaped like cake.

1531
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:30,713
He's making a shape with the bibimbap.

1532
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,915
-It looks like cake.
-Cake?

1533
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:34,650
He's making up for it with the shape.

1534
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:40,156
-The presentation is important too.
-It must be.

1535
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,625
The fritters look… What's this?

1536
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,427
Salad made with cucumber and Korean melon.

1537
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,796
Made with sour soy sauce?

1538
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,666
-He's mixing Korean melon and lettuce.
-Lemon juice.

1539
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,469
It's so weird to see him cook
with the things in our fridge.

1540
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,937
These ingredients are from your fridges.

1541
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,239
My mom made that plum extract.

1542
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:59,709
HOSHI's mother made that plum extract!

1543
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,010
The green plum extract!

1544
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,914
-You have four minutes.
-The onion.

1545
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,048
LEMON JUICE

1546
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,384
-Is this the sauce for steamed cod?
-Yes.

1547
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,588
It'll taste amazing with butter and onion.

1548
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,691
He used half a bottle of champagne
to make this sauce.

1549
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,760
It's called the beurre blanc sauce.

1550
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,629
-Blanc?
-What?

1551
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,130
Beurre means butter,

1552
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,765
and blanc means white.

1553
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:27,303
It's called beurre blanc sauce,
one of the basic French sauces.

1554
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,972
It's usually made with white wine,
but I used champagne.

1555
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,874
-They didn't have white wine.
-It's a French dish.

1556
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,043
He's using a lot of butter.

1557
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,145
-That's a lot of butter.
-A huge amount.

1558
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,681
-It looks more like soup than sauce.
-Really?

1559
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,216
Yes, it's thin. Try some.

1560
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,617
-The butter hasn't melted.
-No.

1561
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:44,187
That's why he keeps stirring it.

1562
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,721
He has to stir it to make it thicker.

1563
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,123
A THUMBS-UP

1564
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,191
The fish is important,

1565
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,259
-but so is the sauce.
-The sauce for the cod.

1566
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,197
What's the sauce like?
Does it taste energetic?

1567
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,966
What's the sauce like?
Does it taste energetic?

1568
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,467
-Look at his face.
-Does it taste energetic?

1569
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,403
-He doesn't look so well.
-Does it?

1570
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,638
It does taste energetic,
but it's a bit sour.

1571
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,141
I told you.
There's not enough time to boil it down.

1572
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,776
Sugar. Add some sugar.

1573
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,344
-Shouldn't you boil it some more?
-Yes?

1574
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,112
-No, it's fine.
-I think it's the champagne.

1575
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,981
The fried onion is greasy,
so the sauce will make up for it.

1576
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,016
-Okay, I got it.
-That's amazing.

1577
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,685
-Is it okay?
-He had a reason.

1578
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,222
I really wonder how this
diamond-shaped onion will turn out.

1579
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,124
-He's working hard on it.
-It's looking good.

1580
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,593
It almost looks like a lotus flower.

1581
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,628
That onion has to be delicious.

1582
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,397
THE SOUR SOY SAUCE SALAD

1583
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:29,899
A BIG BITE

1584
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:35,037
Sung-jun is putting salad
on top of bibimbap.

1585
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,039
-The sour soy sauce.
-He used the sour soy sauce.

1586
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,140
The sour soy sauce.

1587
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,110
It's a mix of Korean, Chinese,
and Western cuisine.

1588
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,145
This is amazing.
I really wonder what it's like.

1589
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,915
This is the sour soy sauce salad.

1590
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,316
Try just the salad.

1591
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,718
-How's the salad?
-The salad.

1592
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:52,088
Does it taste good enough
to celebrate their tenth anniversary?

1593
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,056
Yes, this is worthy of their anniversary.

1594
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,126
It's refreshing.

1595
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:00,229
It's quite savory and addictive.

1596
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,132
That sounds great.

1597
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,868
The Korean melon plays a huge role.

1598
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,069
The fritters are out.

1599
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,672
-He has the fritters.
-You have a minute left.

1600
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,341
NAM-NO DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING YET

1601
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,143
CABBAGE

1602
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:19,115
7. STRAIN THE BEURRE BLANC SAUCE

1603
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,286
AND THE CHOPPED CABBAGE GOES IN!

1604
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,356
-The fried onion is ready.
-One minute.

1605
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,825
The onion looks pretty.
I see why he worked so hard on it.

1606
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:33,396
THE THIRD UNIT,
CHEESE WRAPPED IN MEAT

1607
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,264
7. TOP MEAT FRITTERS
ON TOP OF THE SALAD

1608
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:36,299
On top of the salad?

1609
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,768
My gosh, look at that.

1610
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:39,769
HE REMOVES THE COOKIE CUTTER

1611
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,605
-Whoa!
-He made it into one dish.

1612
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,273
-I see.
-It's just like SEVENTEEN.

1613
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,876
-Sung-jun is done.
-Chef Sung-jun is done.

1614
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,045
-Nam-no is still on it.
-The steamed cod.

1615
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,548
Chef Sohyi told him to make holes
before he steamed the cod,

1616
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,050
but he had refused to do that.

1617
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,619
-It's okay. You can do it.
-It looks inflated.

1618
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,255
The plastic wrap got inflated.

1619
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,990
-He has to cut it.
-Thirty seconds.

1620
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,660
-His hands are…
-His hands are on fire too!

1621
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,562
-It's hot!
-Nam-no's hands are on fire too!

1622
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,732
-It's hot!
-Nam-no's hands are on fire too!

1623
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,834
You can do this!

1624
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,302
You got this!

1625
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,503
THE FRIED ONION FLOWER
IS IN FULL BLOOM

1626
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,272
-The onion!
-It's ready!

1627
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,442
OFFERS HIM A TASTE

1628
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,043
You can do it, Nam-no!

1629
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,945
You can do it, Nam-no!

1630
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,680
ARE YOU WATCHING ME,
SHOW-OFF CHEF?

1631
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,683
-You can do it, Nam-no!
-Darn it!

1632
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,487
You don't have much time left.
Ten seconds.

1633
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,322
-Eight. Seven.
-Eight. Seven.

1634
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,424
-Six. Five.
-Six. Five.

1635
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,293
-Four. Three.
-Four. Three.

1636
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,395
-Two. One.
-Two. One.

1637
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,863
Ring the bell!

1638
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,765
YOON NAM-NO'S
FIGHTING STEAMED COD IS DONE

1639
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,066
He worked so hard on it.

1640
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,202
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

1641
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,438
That was a close call.

1642
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,806
That was amazing.

1643
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,377
The order titled Happy SEVENTEEN Day

1644
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,580
for HOSHI and WOOZI has been filled.

1645
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,053
-It was a very close battle.
-Yes.

1646
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,656
First, I Feel Like I Became SEVENTEEN.

1647
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,992
Please try that dish first.

1648
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,093
MADE WITH 13 INGREDIENTS
LIKE SEVENTEEN

1649
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,863
A DISH MADE WITH A MIX OF

1650
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,365
KOREAN, CHINESE,
AND AMERICAN CUISINE

1651
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:21,303
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
I FEEL LIKE I BECAME SEVENTEEN

1652
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,106
-Gosh, it looks good.
-Look at that.

1653
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,675
-The portion is rather big.
-Yes.

1654
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:29,278
Will this dish
get to represent their ten years?

1655
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,814
-Right.
-The fry.

1656
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,182
They're taking each layer.

1657
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,951
-The Korean dish is the foundation.
-Yes, bibimbap.

1658
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,421
-Right above that is Chinese.
-The Chinese sour soy sauce.

1659
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,556
-And on top is the American dish.
-American.

1660
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,426
-It's huge. It's a feast.
-It is big.

1661
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,227
It's made with cheese,
so I'm sure it'll be good.

1662
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,463
That's right. He rolled up cheese

1663
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,999
-with strip loin pieces.
-It looks good.

1664
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,234
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

1665
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:55,571
SAVORING

1666
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,175
HE GOES INTO HIS SUPER MODE

1667
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,676
He takes a bite of the Korean dish.

1668
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,480
Look at HOSHI eat.

1669
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,750
He's totally serious.
Look how well he eats.

1670
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:11,253
-He makes it look so appetizing.
-That's right.

1671
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,790
-They make it look so delicious.
-And it must be.

1672
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,360
HE EATS ALL THREE CUISINES
IN A BITE

1673
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,897
He's serious about this.

1674
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,299
It's to commemorate their tenth year.

1675
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:27,736
This is a dish Chef Sung-jun made
just for SEVENTEEN.

1676
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,205
HOSHI CLEANS IT OUT TOO

1677
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,372
What's it like?

1678
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,208
First of all, it's just like our team.

1679
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:36,712
It felt like many different things
came together to make one dish.

1680
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,515
This plum extract was made by my mom.

1681
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,518
Yes, he used it to make the sauce.

1682
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,620
My mom made the extract herself,

1683
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,156
so it reminded me of her.

1684
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,794
It's your tenth year anniversary,

1685
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,896
and it reminds you of your parents,
not just the team?

1686
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,998
-Yes.
-Do you feel that grateful?

1687
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,734
-It's the plum extract your mother made.
-Gosh.

1688
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,904
It felt like she held me tightly.

1689
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,973
-Everything became one.
-Thank you, Mother.

1690
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,774
Precisely.

1691
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,911
-Why is he adding to this?
-I knew it.

1692
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,080
Let's hear it from WOOZI.

1693
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,383
It almost felt like raw fish bibimbap.

1694
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,519
-Raw fish bibimbap?
-Raw fish bibimbap?

1695
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:19,355
Nothing here came from the sea,

1696
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,659
but all three countries are
connected by the ocean.

1697
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,995
-Yes.
-It's like that. That's earth.

1698
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,396
I don't know why,

1699
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,766
but I think I saw the earth.

1700
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,768
-He saw the earth.
-The earth.

1701
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,404
America, Korea, China,
and the entire earth.

1702
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,907
Yes, the Earth.

1703
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,976
He added fish sauce into the dressing.

1704
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,444
Blue crab sauce.

1705
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,481
-Blue crab sauce.
-It was blue crab sauce.

1706
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:49,218
The sweet and sour sauce seeped in,
so it must've felt like raw fish bibimbap.

1707
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,854
I began to wonder
how it all came together so nicely.

1708
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:55,357
Everything was new,
but it all worked so smoothly.

1709
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:56,825
It's good.

1710
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,727
A FRIED ONION AS THE CARATS,

1711
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,396
WHO HAVE ALSO SPENT
10 YEARS WITH SEVENTEEN

1712
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,801
SERVED WITH HIDDEN
STEAMED COD UNDERNEATH

1713
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,806
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
FIGHTING STEAMED COD

1714
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,609
He put a lot of work into the onion.

1715
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:16,078
-CARATs.
-He did it to represent CARATs.

1716
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,815
It took him so long to do that.

1717
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,018
Right, he had the sauce.
There's the sauce.

1718
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,520
The sauce.

1719
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:26,822
I SEE…

1720
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,924
Fabri's sauce was excellent before.

1721
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:29,892
Is this good too?

1722
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,428
-It's sour when I had it separately.
-Was it sour?

1723
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,264
-Try it with the dish.
-You should have it with the food.

1724
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,133
-Try everything together.
-I thought it was sour too.

1725
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,603
It'll taste good if you eat it together.

1726
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,141
Nice.

1727
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:47,643
I had to eat it together.

1728
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,179
-You did, right?
-Was there a reason?

1729
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,280
You don't eat just the sauce

1730
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,616
-when you eat sweet and sour pork.
-He's right.

1731
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,918
The onion is so good.

1732
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,186
I think it'll taste good.

1733
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,121
He put a lot of work into those.

1734
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,790
AND NEXT, STEAMED COD

1735
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:04,226
HOSHI eats so well.

1736
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,862
And Ji-hoon.

1737
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,198
Is it good? I see.

1738
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,267
Was the fish cooked perfectly?

1739
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,534
The fish itself is delicious,

1740
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,969
and the perilla leaves enhanced it.

1741
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,939
Our leader is from Daegu,
which sounds like cod, <i>daegu</i>.

1742
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,607
-Daegu?
-What are you thinking?

1743
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:22,411
-You have a point.
-Was that why he made steamed cod?

1744
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:23,712
He meant something by that.

1745
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,283
He must've had a tough time
over the last ten years.

1746
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:30,619
He had to prop up and protect CARATs,
as the foundation.

1747
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:31,887
So it must've been so hard.

1748
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:35,891
That's so meaningful.
The guy from Daegu is propping up CARATs.

1749
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,861
I was reminded of him
and our fans, CARATs.

1750
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,496
And his leader.

1751
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,864
That's it.

1752
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,534
It reminded me
of his stress over the last ten years.

1753
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,570
It almost looked bland. Isn't that so?

1754
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,273
Not at all. I think it's the sour sauce.

1755
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,042
And the onion is sweet.

1756
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:56,011
-He takes another bite.
-Yes, he tries the sauce again.

1757
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:59,381
What will WOOZI say this time?

1758
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,917
I thought it was too sour
when I had just the sauce,

1759
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,085
so it almost felt like

1760
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,822
an overly strong French dish.

1761
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,557
But when it came together with onion,

1762
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,826
it felt like my mom was protecting me.

1763
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:11,960
Another mention of his mother.

1764
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,562
He thought of his mother too.

1765
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:16,465
-His mother.
-I don't know why I felt that way.

1766
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,268
WOOZI says this time,
he was reminded of his mother.

1767
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,469
-Yes.
-Yes.

1768
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:24,740
HOSHI was reminded of his mother
after eating Chef Sung-jun's dish.

1769
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,642
Were you reminded of your leader?

1770
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,876
-No.
-I see.

1771
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,313
WHAT A CHEEKY YOUNGER MEMBER

1772
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,717
WHILE WOOZI TALKED…

1773
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,820
HOSHI KEPT GOING AFTER THE ONION

1774
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,155
Oh, my.

1775
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,557
HOSHI keeps eating so well.

1776
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,660
-The onion tastes amazing.
-I see.

1777
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:45,961
It gets better and better.

1778
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,429
It gets better and better?

1779
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,565
SEVENTEEN also gets better and better.

1780
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,934
-That's why we stayed for a decade.
-That's why.

1781
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,370
-He has a point.
-Yes.

1782
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,404
He thought of that.

1783
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,672
Many layers, just like an onion.

1784
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,207
HOW ABOUT THIS?

1785
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,776
People keep peeling us,
but we have so many layers.

1786
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,078
-Like onion.
-Yes.

1787
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,747
We tried both dishes now, right?

1788
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:08,650
And you two decided to split up today.

1789
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,620
The fritter Chef Sung-jun made

1790
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:13,989
and the sauce Chef Nam-no made…

1791
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,491
-Yes?
-…taste amazing together.

1792
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,459
These two have such great chemistry.

1793
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,261
Were they perfect together?

1794
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,430
These two go so well together.

1795
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,232
You two have to stick together.

1796
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:24,800
Let's get along once again.

1797
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,436
I just got the dishes confused

1798
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:31,707
and put the fritter
on the dish with Chef Nam-no's sauce,

1799
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,776
so I tried those together.

1800
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,310
SMILING

1801
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,646
"Wait, this was the best."

1802
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,348
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1803
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,184
-I see.
-You need to reconsider.

1804
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,419
You must stick together to survive.

1805
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:48,123
-Which one did you like better?
-What do I do?

1806
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,392
Press one for Yoon Nam-no.

1807
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,494
Press two for Kwon Sung-jun.

1808
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,063
Make your decision and press the button.

1809
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,566
HOSHI is done.

1810
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:59,134
-And so is WOOZI.
-He's done.

1811
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,837
-My gosh!
-Come on.

1812
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,972
-Look at the result.
-I can't believe the result.

1813
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,741
-Why?
-I knew this would happen.

1814
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,609
-The result is…
-Yes?

1815
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,312
…one to one.

1816
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,847
One to one.

1817
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,416
A NECK-AND-NECK FIGHT

1818
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,085
Did you two set this up?

1819
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,955
-Are you serious?
-Tell me about it.

1820
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:24,026
HOSHI felt his mother's touch
in the plum extract.

1821
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:28,464
-But WOOZI felt his mom in the other dish.
-Yes, you're right.

1822
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,299
-Here's what's important.
-Yes, WOOZI.

1823
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,468
I think we each picked our moms.

1824
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:33,669
Is that so?

1825
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,004
-We picked different moms.
-Different moms.

1826
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,739
-They picked different moms.
-They were different.

1827
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,410
Please come to a decision.

1828
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,946
I liked your mom too.

1829
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,782
They're so serious like that show
where people appraise antiques.

1830
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,251
-This happened once again.
-Again.

1831
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,720
WOOZI always does the talking,

1832
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,022
and HOSHI just listens.

1833
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,491
HOSHI, share your thoughts too.

1834
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,060
Don't just listen to the producer.

1835
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,629
Nam-no and Sung-jun finished
in a tie just now.

1836
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,231
-Have you decided?
-We have.

1837
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:05,434
SEVENTEEN celebrates
their tenth anniversary this year.

1838
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,902
Which of them

1839
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,872
was chosen today?
Sung-jun and Nam-no?

1840
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,974
HOSHI and WOOZI!

1841
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,043
Please show us their decision.

1842
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,580
Who did they choose in the end
after the tie?

1843
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,883
Who is it?

1844
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:23,285
-Who's the winner?
-Show us!

1845
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,521
YOON NAM-NO WINS

1846
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,623
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
FIGHTING STEAMED COD WINS

1847
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,392
-Chef Nam-no wins!
-My gosh.

1848
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:32,895
THE MUSCLE OF THE ALLIANCE WINS

1849
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,429
The muscle wins.

1850
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,199
I knew it.
The alliance now has a new chair.

1851
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,768
HE FAILS TO LEAVE THE ALLIANCE

1852
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,336
Not only did the chairman change,

1853
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,704
but he can't even be Mr. Good Vibes.

1854
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,007
You're right. I'm so sorry.

1855
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,408
This means

1856
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,343
there's a higher chance

1857
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,813
their regular meet-up will happen
at Chef Nam-no's place.

1858
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,315
-That's right!
-Yes.

1859
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,920
So which one of you got persuaded?

1860
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,087
I got persuaded by him.

1861
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,322
This time?

1862
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:03,191
I personally like this one.

1863
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,526
-This one?
-Yes.

1864
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,061
Just go with me this time.

1865
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:09,197
Should we go with this?
Are you set on this?

1866
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,399
-Yes.
-Okay.

1867
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:16,238
I said I wanted to go
with Chef Nam-no this time.

1868
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:19,041
This dish had me hooked.

1869
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,677
-The onion was that addictive.
-I see.

1870
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,979
-He put a lot of work into it.
-I get it.

1871
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,715
Yes, so I kept going back.

1872
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:32,087
But your choice was different
from the dish where you felt your mom.

1873
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,022
I love WOOZI's mom too.

1874
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,826
-The mothers are all very close too.
-I see.

1875
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,561
-They're all close.
-Yes.

1876
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,030
-I have 13 mothers now.
-I see.

1877
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,398
-Thirteen?
-Right.

1878
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:47,002
Then please put the star
on top of his name tag.

1879
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,470
May I share a word?

1880
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:49,972
You don't get that chance.

1881
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,543
Congratulations, Nam-no!

1882
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,577
NAM-NO TAKES EVERYTHING

1883
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,713
FEELING BITTER

1884
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:00,749
What were you going to say?

1885
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,284
I'd like to invite

1886
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,419
OH MY GIRL instead of SEVENTEEN.

1887
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:08,156
-All right. Let's go.
-We're done.

1888
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,859
-Us instead?
-Oh, my gosh.

1889
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,062
Mimi has
an extraordinary love for dessert.

1890
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,097
It's only desserts.

1891
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,665
I really love desserts.

1892
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,433
This place is more like
a convenience store.

1893
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,135
I can eat all those at once.

1894
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,603
All of those at once?

1895
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,238
-Cream-filled bread with onion kimchi?
-It's good.

1896
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,206
Try it, then.

1897
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,475
-I've never seen anyone like her.
-Is she serious?

1898
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,542
-But why?
-It's good.

1899
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,644
Why do you eat it like this?

1900
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,712
She's giving me a headache.

1901
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,848
Who ordered jjamppong?

1902
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,350
Who'll be the next big thing
in the world of Chinese cuisine?

1903
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,419
-He's not a threat.
-I know I can win.

1904
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,188
-The world of Chinese cuisine is shaken.
-This isn't good.

1905
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,224
TAE-HUN'S HEAD-ON FIGHT

1906
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,325
WOW

1907
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:44,760
A DISH FOR MIMI THE DESSERT FAN

1908
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,728
I can smell the sweetness from here.

1909
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,498
-It's too sweet.
-Mimi will have to love that.

1910
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,299
What is that, Poong?

1911
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,135
He has abandoned his work ethic!

1912
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:54,803
What is that?

1913
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:55,804
CRUNCH

1914
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:56,938
CRUNCHY

1915
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,206
MAXIMUM ASMR TINGLES

1916
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,542
I'll begin the ASMR.

1917
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,878
<i>This is crazy.</i>

1918
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:16,625
