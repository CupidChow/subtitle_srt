1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,283
We're here with professional hobbyists,
Doh Kyung-soo, the cook,

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,553
and Park Byung-eun, the angler.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,256
If you take a look
at Byung-eun's social media account,

4
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,792
he has more photos of fish than himself.

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,427
MY PHOTOS <i>FISHING PHOTOS</i>

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,062
When his fans run into him,

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,297
they don't ask for his current project.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,200
They ask for the fish
they can catch in this season.

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,069
-What fish is in season?
-Yes, which ones?

10
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,271
-That's what they ask.
-He's that serious?

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,708
I love to go fishing so much

12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,212
that skippers on Jeju Island would call
and tell me that sea bream is in season,

13
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,380
so I fish there often.

14
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,483
Let's find out
how serious he is about fishing.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,419
TA-DA

16
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,487
-That's a cuttlefish.
-Was that in winter?

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,722
Whoa, look at it.

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,223
-Look how big that is.
-It was cold.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,458
-It must've been cold.
-Very cold.

20
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,795
The hashtags go, "cuttlefish, as big
as a rugby ball, cold, snot, ink, sleepy."

21
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,263
What's that?

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,199
<i>-Ice fishing?</i>
<i>-I like to do that in winter.</i>

23
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,736
I'd go to reservoir or a lake
when it gets completely frozen

24
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,106
to make a hole in the ice and catch carp.

25
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,109
<i>It's has its romantic aspects</i>

26
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,745
although it's really cold
and you get frozen hands,

27
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,880
because you get to grill
pork belly and kimchi

28
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,384
on a hot stone plate
on top of a frozen reservoir.

29
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,386
And we'd make <i>ramyeon</i> too. That's the fun.

30
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,389
In that season,
people in that neighborhood would come

31
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,658
and sell fish cake soup

32
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,528
-and soju by the glass in a handcart.
-By the glass?

33
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,832
It'd be like 1,000 won per shot.

34
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,934
It brings me great joy

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,369
when I have a bite of fish cake
and a shot of soju together.

36
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,704
It's romantic.

37
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,473
What's that last picture?

38
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,674
-It's a photoshoot.
-It's a photoshoot.

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,545
I did a photoshoot
at a hotel pool in Seoul.

40
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,681
It looks like an indoor fishing hole.

41
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,550
-It's not. It's a hotel.
-It looks like it, though.

42
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,953
Byung-eun sent us a few pictures,

43
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,689
and one of them is
a photo of his car trunk.

44
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,557
This wasn't taken when he left to fish.

45
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,060
This is how it looks all the time.

46
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,462
This is his usual trunk.

47
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:10,997
How organized…

48
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,634
-What is all that?
-Isn't this enough

49
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,537
-for him to run away overnight?
-Most actors would have clothes hung up.

50
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,672
Can you tell us what you're keeping there?

51
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,709
The black bag on the left side is

52
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,544
the fishing poles I use the most often.

53
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,480
-There are about 40 of them in there.
-In the bag?

54
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,349
-Forty?
-That's amazing.

55
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,552
The black bag
above the blue jacket in the right has

56
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,920
-fishing poles for eels.
-Eels.

57
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,489
-Fishing poles for eels?
-Only for eels.

58
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,590
It must be different.

59
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,592
The white bag in the middle has poles

60
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,895
for places without any obstacles
like a vast dam

61
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,331
or a place with deep waters,
because the poles are very delicate.

62
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,735
-He's so serious.
-The pole is very thin,

63
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,336
so you can feel every single move.

64
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,504
He's like the fishing channel.

65
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,006
-He's such a pro.
-Also,

66
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,474
there's something called sea ice.

67
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,377
If you put sea ice into seawater,
it stays firm and fresh.

68
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,579
That ice made with seawater is sea ice.

69
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,447
It keeps its solid strength as is.

70
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,783
He's been talking about fishing
for about three minutes.

71
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,018
CHECKING FOR TIME

72
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,519
I could keep going.

73
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,254
He really loves to fish.

74
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,693
Byung-eun also said Kyung-soo was someone
highly wanted by the world of anglers.

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,963
We hear he's been looking for a chance
to get him hooked.

76
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,698
I just know it.

77
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,433
Not only is he poised,

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,336
but he rarely complains or grumbles.

79
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,605
The least likely people to go fishing are

80
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,174
those who complain and grumble a lot.

81
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,009
-"It's full of mosquitoes. It's hot."
-Right.

82
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,479
"Hook the bait for me.
Touch this. Get this off for me."

83
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,349
-I thought he was talking about me.
-"The air is awful. Is my pole any good?"

84
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,952
-"Give me something cool like this."
-"I'm hungry."

85
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,053
"When are we eating <i>ramyeon</i>?"

86
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,321
The most stressful thing is,

87
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,156
"Why can't I catch any fish?"

88
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,925
-"I don't see any. It's a waste of time."
-"You said it'd be easy."

89
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,661
-He's heard it all.
-Seriously.

90
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:53,633
But I think Kyung-soo will stay calm
and be more persistent than I am.

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,068
-It sounds fun.
-Does it?

92
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,903
Are you willing to go with him?

93
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,171
-I…
-You can be honest.

94
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,840
What I look forward to is
eating the fish I might catch.

95
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,409
-The fish that you'd catch.
-It'll be fresh.

96
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,412
-It sounds so good.
-He's good at handling the fish too.

97
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,047
-That's right.
-He's a licensed cook.

98
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,782
I think he'd enjoy it.

99
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,785
One time, I went fishing

100
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,788
with actors Gong Yoo and Park Hee-soon.

101
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,091
-I see.
-As soon as Hee-soon started, he said,

102
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,793
"Hey, I think I caught something."

103
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,229
-That was a sea bream.
-Sea bream?

104
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,465
"That's a sea bream? Is that any big?"

105
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,200
I said, "It's huge!"

106
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,335
NOT SURPRISED
EVEN AFTER CATCHING SEA BREAM…

107
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,972
He caught three more fish after that,
but Gong Yoo caught only one.

108
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,476
Still, Hee-soon never said
he wanted to do it again.

109
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,379
On the other hand,
Gong Yoo barely caught anything,

110
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,383
<i>-yet it became a good hobby for him.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

111
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,418
We just confirmed that

112
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,555
the person who complained a lot
must've been Park Hee-soon.

113
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,558
-He was kind of immature.
-Immature?

114
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,960
Fishing requires maturity.

115
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,862
He should've been calm, but he wasn't.

116
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,764
It's based on primal instinct.

117
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,668
I think you're born with the ability
to take up fishing as a hobby.

118
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,671
Byung-eun has another nickname,

119
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,572
the generous donor among anglers.

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,509
We hear you like to give out
the things you catch.

121
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,879
I first began to give out my catch

122
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,615
-because of webfoot octopuses.
-Webfoot octopus?

123
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,552
Even beginners can catch
about 100 webfoot octopuses.

124
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,987
-That much?
-Minimum 50, I'd say.

125
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,755
I hear it's like that during its season.

126
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,025
And my highest record was over 500.

127
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,493
<i>You caught over 500 octopuses?</i>

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,129
I live alone,
so I couldn't eat all 500 myself.

129
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,065
-It filled up my fridge.
-Of course.

130
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,668
So I put those in packs
and gave them out to acquaintances,

131
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,805
-and they loved it.
-I'm sure they would have.

132
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,207
And then, I'd send sea bream

133
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,909
-and even cuttlefish.
-They're expensive.

134
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,811
The most expensive one was
bigfin reef squid.

135
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,879
-Bigfin reef squid?
-That's expensive.

136
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,749
Why don't you sign a contract
with people like us

137
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,884
-and start delivering to us?
-Of course.

138
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,320
-You should be selling that much fish.
-That's not a bad idea.

139
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,956
-"Caught by Park Byung-eun."
-"Fresh seasonal fish."

140
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,525
Kyung-soo should've gotten something.

141
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,593
-He must have.
-I didn't get anything.

142
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,527
-No?
-What?

143
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,262
Why not?

144
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,265
-There are priorities.
-Priorities?

145
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,369
It's like the real estate lottery.
First, people with many children.

146
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,271
-Many children.
-Families with many children.

147
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,207
Next, newlyweds.

148
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,042
-I see.
-It's like the apartment lottery.

149
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,879
After that, those who got divorced
and carry pain in their hearts.

150
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,848
So there are such priorities.

151
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:26,018
I once sent some
to a close younger friend who lives alone.

152
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,453
I asked if he enjoyed it,

153
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,256
but he said,
"Oh, it went bad, so I threw them away."

154
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,659
-He had been too busy with work…
-Right.

155
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,461
-…just like Kyung-soo, who lives alone.
-Right.

156
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,196
-Even I can't cook for myself.
-It's understandable.

157
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,266
I began to prioritize and wonder
who could make use of these.

158
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,901
-It sounds logical.
-I'm the type

159
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,104
who'll send back the photos of me
enjoying the food I got.

160
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,305
-Really?
-Yes.

161
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,342
-I'll send you some.
-Do I make the cut?

162
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,177
-And he has many children.
-I do.

163
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,780
-I have three kids.
-You win.

164
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,415
-He can make the cut.
-When we eat it,

165
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,317
-He has three kids.
-I take pictures and send them.

166
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,852
It'll make me even happier.

167
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,755
The more we hear him speak,
the more we're looking forward to this.

168
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,325
It feels like
his fridge would be full of fresh seafood.

169
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,728
Previously, Kyung-soo tried

170
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,632
to hold Byung-eun's fridge in check
in a way.

171
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,866
Yes, that's right…

172
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,203
I didn't get anything
that might be in Byung-eun's fridge.

173
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,871
One, two, three.

174
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,773
HOLDING HIM IN CHECK

175
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,642
So we're really looking forward to this.

176
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,010
WHAT KIND OF SEAFOOD
DOES HE HAVE?

177
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,645
It must be like an aquarium.

178
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,382
I'm worried we'll see something alive.

179
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,487
Let's take a look at Byung-eun's fridge.

180
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,656
WHOA

181
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,491
First off, he has lots of stuff.

182
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,460
PRESENTING BYUNG-EUN'S FRIDGE

183
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,395
First off, he has lots of stuff.

184
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,896
-Do you live alone?
-That's a lot.

185
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,899
-Everything is neatly organized.
-It looks very neat.

186
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,435
-First, the fridge.
-He has a lot of stuff.

187
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,872
He has some kimchi, two kinds.

188
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,041
-Tofu.
-Yes, tofu.

189
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:59,812
There's a tofu place that makes
fresh, steaming tofu near my place.

190
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,448
I always have to think
whenever I buy tofu there.

191
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,184
There's a pile of tofu with a sign
that says, "domestic soybeans."

192
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,953
And another pile hat says,
"imported soybeans."

193
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,955
There are two signs there.

194
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,590
After all, I'm an actor,

195
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,392
so it'd be kind of awkward
if I got tofu made with imported beans.

196
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,862
-So domestic beans?
-It's only 1,500-won difference, though.

197
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,064
So I always buy domestic.

198
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,233
I don't see too many side dishes.

199
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,202
Food can sometimes taste bad
even when it's freshly made…

200
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,637
-Yes.
-…so after three days in the fridge,

201
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,340
it doesn't taste good,
and I don't like that.

202
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,407
It costs a lot too.

203
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,143
There's an all-you-can-eat
Korean restaurant near my place.

204
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,278
-I see.
-Yes.

205
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,282
It only costs 8,000 won,
and there are 5 ladies who worked there.

206
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,519
So I think of them as my mothers
and always eat there.

207
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,419
Sounds good.

208
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,089
The soup is hot,
and the side dishes change every day.

209
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,124
And you don't have to keep
leftovers at home.

210
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,426
When I go there later in the night,

211
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,162
they'd give me some leftovers
because I'm a regular.

212
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,699
I don't see any traces
of takeout or delivery food.

213
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,868
-I don't like delivery food.
-You may live alone,

214
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,838
but you want to eat a decent meal
even if you eat just one meal.

215
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,106
That's very important.

216
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,776
My first meal of the day is
the most important to me.

217
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,145
-Why?
-I'll explain it to you later

218
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,014
when you come across that ingredient.

219
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,882
-I see.
-He must have something.

220
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,651
-He has a plan.
-Something must be there.

221
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,619
Let us know when we get to it.

222
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,288
His breakfast ingredient is important.

223
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,822
-That's it!
-I already got it?

224
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,758
-Already? The second shelf?
-You already found out.

225
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,826
I've been eating that for two years.

226
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,261
It's cabbage.

227
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:27,133
Here's the thing.
I wash, prepare, and steam tomatoes,

228
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,202
-cabbage, and carrots myself.
-I see carrots too.

229
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,106
Then I throw in half an organic apple,
blend everything, and drink that.

230
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,375
-And tomatoes?
-He puts tomatoes in.

231
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,978
I also put in some extra virgin olive oil

232
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,314
to increase the rate of absorption
by three times.

233
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,516
I drink a glass of that as breakfast.

234
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,984
It's like a health show.

235
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,485
He's like an anti-aging expert.

236
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,622
-Two good-quality eggs.
-Two good-quality eggs.

237
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,158
-Good-quality salt…
-Salt.

238
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,826
…three pinches.

239
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,928
That's about it for breakfast.

240
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,130
Those are like the source of my life.

241
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,499
These are the source of his life.

242
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,902
-It's anticarcinogenic.
-Cancer prevention.

243
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,606
I mixed organic rice and other grains
to make that rice too.

244
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,276
-He kept them frozen.
-That's how I eat my food.

245
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,680
Also, I always store rice
in glassware instead of plastic tubs.

246
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,749
That way, I can stay free
from microplastics.

247
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,051
-Glassware instead of plastic tubs.
-Glassware.

248
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,320
I hope the viewers will try this at home.

249
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,956
He has eggs here. He eats two eggs a day.

250
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,825
So these are in good quality?

251
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,259
Egg code one.

252
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,928
-Egg code?
-What's an egg code?

253
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,664
Many people don't know
what the egg code is.

254
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,568
Eggs laid by chickens
that are stressed out in a tiny cage

255
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,404
are usually labeled with code four.

256
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,607
Egg code one is given
to organic, free-range chickens

257
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,210
-that actually feed on insects.
-These are labeled with one.

258
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,745
These all end in number one.

259
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,947
I look it up on the Internet too.

260
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,582
That's a new side.

261
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,284
I also check the farmer's picture
to see if it's a good farm.

262
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,953
I wanted to know what they looked like.

263
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,988
-You can tell.
-Face reading is important.

264
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,892
That's important. I also read
the maker's face before I order something.

265
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,027
I do that too.

266
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,361
Let's say

267
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,864
the farmer is an older man
who looks like a good person

268
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,666
and he took a photo
with his son and daughter-in-law…

269
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,501
I'd trust him.

270
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,936
…and his grandchildren
that show a huge smile…

271
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,639
<i>-That's a plus?</i>
<i>-That's a must. A family photo is a plus.</i>

272
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,208
You'll live long.

273
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,010
-He'll live forever.
-But…

274
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,246
I'll live like a mature adult.

275
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,615
You have quite a few alcoholic drinks.

276
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,151
You drink a lot for a health fanatic.

277
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,919
I have just one drink before I sleep.

278
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,655
If I get sweaty from running 10 km,
I take a shower afterward,

279
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,057
then I come and have a drink.

280
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,726
-Is this <i>makgeolli</i>?
-It is.

281
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,362
Don't you drink Jangsu <i>Makgeolli</i>?

282
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,998
The aspartame content is
a little high in that brand.

283
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,035
Here's a story about <i>makgeolli</i>.

284
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,606
I once mixed unrefined <i>makgeolli</i>
and B brand's yogurt drink

285
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,709
to make this drink

286
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,878
-and named it Bulmak.
-Bulmak?

287
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,815
People who love to drink always come up
with these names for their drinks.

288
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,851
It was during the shoot for <i>Kingdom</i>,
so I spent much time in the countryside.

289
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,421
So Ju Ji-hoon and I
always drank that after the shoot.

290
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,223
Then one day, Ji-hoon said,

291
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,660
"Byung-eun, we drink three
to four bottles of this every time."

292
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,228
UNSURE

293
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,465
-"So what if we become diabetic?"
-That can happen.

294
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,967
-It must be high in sugar.
-It's made with rice.

295
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,537
We drank up to five bottles of that
every time, so I quit drinking that

296
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,606
-for a while.
-I see.

297
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,342
You only have one bottle of soju,
and it's the red cap, higher proof.

298
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,911
-That RC is…
-RC?

299
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,515
-It's for a rainy or sentimental day.
-That's romantic.

300
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,686
There are days when wine or other drinks
cannot satisfy the kind of sentiment.

301
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,389
I pop it when something bad happens
to a friend or when I get sentimental.

302
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,825
But I only keep one bottle at home.

303
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:44,296
Because if I stay in that mood
and empty two to three bottles,

304
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,298
I'll end up feeling down.

305
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,334
So I drink just one bottle.

306
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,237
Once I'm done with that bottle,
it gets too cumbersome to get more.

307
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,272
What about those infused liquors?

308
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,841
-Oh, those? Those are bellflower roots.
-Look at these.

309
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,712
-He made this in 2015.
-He has three bottles.

310
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,282
I made this with bellflower roots
back in August 2015.

311
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,751
I dug it up from my front yard.

312
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,153
This is huge.

313
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,156
This is called Chinese fleece flower.
It's considered medicinal.

314
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,425
This is rather recent.

315
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,994
-I made it with tiny cherries.
-Cherries.

316
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,696
-I love the color.
-It's giving off the color.

317
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,333
-They're all medicinal.
-It's not hard to make infused liquor.

318
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,271
But you must keep the alcohol proof
above 30 or even 50.

319
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,140
-That's true. Because…
-When you make fruit liquor…

320
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,542
TAKING A BREATHER

321
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,611
…it can get spoiled
if you put fruit into lower-proof alcohol.

322
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,680
It'll give out its juice
and dilute the alcohol.

323
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,751
So if you put it in high-proof alcohol,
it'll give out sweetness as it ripens.

324
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,287
He sounds like a salesman.

325
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:46,625
Wait, he's dressed like someone
who's here to make sales.

326
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,427
-Doesn't he?
-All right.

327
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,829
SHALL I GET THE PARTY STARTED?

328
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,765
So you can take
this bellflower root liquor

329
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,467
made back in August of 2015.

330
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,102
How much is it?

331
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,672
Chief Park, how much do you want
for these three?

332
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,441
-Gosh.
-Did it turn out well?

333
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,643
It's amazing.

334
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,779
I can't put a number on it.

335
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,814
I'll share the details later.

336
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,818
My mom would love that.

337
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,721
He's so good at sales. How much is this?

338
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,756
My liver has been in bad condition lately.

339
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,125
In that case, you shouldn't drink at all.

340
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,330
-But I wanted to get one.
-Make sure you take liver medicine.

341
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,932
I couldn't bring everything,
so I just brought these.

342
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,402
There's a storage I use
in my friend's place.

343
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,771
-We have a picture of his liquor storage.
-Really?

344
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,807
A picture of his liquor storage…

345
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,908
THERE'S A LOT

346
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,343
That much liquor is enough to…

347
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,410
ACTUALLY SURPRISED

348
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,478
Are you a moonshiner?

349
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,180
Is Korea going under prohibition?

350
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,982
Can you tell us what you have?

351
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,319
The plastic bottles down there are
mostly fruit liquor.

352
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,022
I made some with wild pear,

353
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,926
and when you ferment it with alcohol,
it brings out the sweetness even more.

354
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,295
-That's what I call the daily drink.
-Daily drink.

355
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:00,199
-I pour it into a cup and drink it.
-Daily wine?

356
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,801
I also have some farmed wild ginseng
and regular ginseng liquor.

357
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,837
Let's take a look at the freezer.

358
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,574
-This is what we've been waiting for.
-Yes.

359
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,709
-The seafood he fished for.
-The main part.

360
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,044
What's this?

361
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,914
-That's bait.
-Bait?

362
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,814
You can't eat that.

363
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,218
-You left the bait here?
-It's for fish.

364
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,920
It's like Pacific saury fillets

365
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,189
covered with chemicals that squid love.

366
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,858
I SEE

367
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,026
You can't eat that.

368
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,694
-You'll start walking sideways.
-We can't.

369
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,698
We're starting to see these now.

370
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,634
-What's this? Cuttlefish?
-Cuttlefish.

371
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,470
-I caught those.
-The cuttlefish he caught.

372
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,674
-You got lots of these.
-These are a lot.

373
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,076
-Cuttlefish are expensive.
-In the market, yes.

374
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,345
He must've caught a cutlassfish.

375
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,648
-Cutlassfish. They're huge.
-He chopped it up.

376
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,983
-Here's the thing.
-Yes?

377
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,885
-You have to see this.
-Sure.

378
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,988
He's not trying to sell anything.
Don't take it the wrong way.

379
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,323
Why? I want to buy some.

380
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,291
Here's what anglers and fishermen do

381
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,960
when people ask for the size.

382
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,362
Cutlassfish are measured
by the number of fingers.

383
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,064
I'm sure the chefs know this.

384
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,234
-This would be over four fingers wide.
-Four fingers.

385
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,036
When you catch one five fingers wide,

386
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,039
it costs about 250,000 won
if it's fresh from Jeju.

387
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,309
It's provided for free
for our chefs today.

388
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,111
-It's for free.
-Just make a delicious dish.

389
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,947
-Did you catch this too?
-Yes, a mackerel.

390
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,383
-Look how big it is.
-Long time ago,

391
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,852
I used to clean everything myself,

392
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,420
but it took forever.

393
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,623
It'd also leave ink and fish scales
all over the kitchen,

394
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,492
and it'd smell fishy even the next day.

395
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,462
So I now work with this lady
who always cleans those at a fish market.

396
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,032
It's great because she'd clean it
on the day I leave those with her

397
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
and have it sent to my place
by the next day from Jeju Island.

398
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,472
-That's how great our distribution is.
-The system is so smooth.

399
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,640
-Vacuum-packed and all?
-She did that for him.

400
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,109
-That's amazing.
-That's great.

401
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,378
Where's the sea bream?

402
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,214
-I don't have it with me.
-Sea bream.

403
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,382
-You don't?
-No.

404
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,716
Why don't you have it?

405
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,686
I wanted to go fishing
at least once before this,

406
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,355
but the monsoon began on Jeju Island,

407
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,124
so the weather was awful.

408
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,394
When I called the skippers,
they all said we couldn't fish.

409
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,661
That was why I couldn't go.

410
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,097
He's a real angler. He got us all.

411
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,266
He eats a hearty breakfast
and drinks his life away.

412
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,869
He does that just to drink.

413
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,972
He eats the good stuff in the morning
to drink later in the day.

414
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,208
That's all for his fridge.

415
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,811
That was Byung-eun's fridge.

416
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,680
Let's find out what his orders are.

417
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,350
Show us his orders!

418
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,019
-I am an angler.
-I am an angler.

419
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,789
Isn't your YouTube thing called
I Am an Ordinary Man?

420
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,991
<i>I did that on Channel Fullmoon.</i>

421
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,893
I am an angler.
What kind of a dish do you want?

422
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,429
You probably looked forward

423
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,265
to using sea breams and brown croakers,

424
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,967
but I want you
to work with everyday seafood

425
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,803
such as cuttlefish,
cutlassfish, and mackerel.

426
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,705
Not only do I want you
to work with its flavor,

427
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,342
but I want to see something new,

428
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,546
a new twist that can change the flavor.
It must be hard.

429
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,681
-With cutlassfish and cuttlefish?
-It's hard.

430
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,349
What's the second order?

431
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,552
-I am a drinker.
-I am a drinker.

432
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:11,723
-He's a drinker?
-He did this after showing us his liquors.

433
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,559
If you like to drink, you would know

434
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,427
the happiness you can feel

435
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,230
when you eat the perfect dish

436
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,699
with the kind of drink you wanted
on a certain day.

437
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,802
I have <i>makgeolli</i>, wine,
and even infused liquor,

438
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,639
so please make a dish
that'll go well with any of those.

439
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,741
-It'd make me very happy.
-I see.

440
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,078
Hyun-suk, Ho-young, Sam, and Ji-sun.

441
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,314
The four of you can each take a spot.

442
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,850
I'll fill the angler order.

443
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,552
Cutlassfish and cuttlefish are
usually caught in Jeju,

444
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,955
and I also love those ingredients.

445
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,557
-Yes.
-He's good at working with cutlassfish.

446
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,827
-He takes the seafood order.
-He's good at working with seafood.

447
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,562
I'll fill the angler order too.

448
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,932
JAPANESE VS ITALIAN CUISINE
HAS BEEN SCHEDULED

449
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,033
Sam takes the seafood round.

450
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,870
Italian cuisine also uses lots of seafood.

451
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,740
Then Hyun-suk and Ji-sun will
automatically take the bar snack round.

452
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,109
I think we're polar opposites.

453
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,078
I can't drink a drop of alcohol,

454
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,381
-but I know she loves to drink.
-You're a drinker too.

455
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,317
She can hold a lot of alcohol,
and she likes to drink too.

456
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,187
Let's look forward to that round too.

457
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,689
Let the 15-minute cook-offs begin!

458
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:24,329
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Byung-eun's fridge.</i>

459
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:28,800
In this round, they'll be using seafood

460
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,004
caught by Byung-eun,
an actor and an angler, himself.

461
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,339
A cute blowfish among chefs,

462
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,341
Chef Jung Ho-young is up.

463
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,544
A blowfish?

464
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,712
And a smiling stingray among chefs.

465
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,381
A smiling stingray?

466
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,950
Chef Sam Kim is also up for the challenge.

467
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,685
-The stingray.
-He looks like it.

468
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:47,920
Do you think you'll win?

469
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,356
Seafood is something
I feel very confident working with,

470
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,493
and today's ingredients were
caught on Jeju Island, right?

471
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,161
This round must be the reason

472
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,863
why I married someone from Jeju.

473
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,866
-For today?
-Yes, your wife is from Jeju.

474
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,668
My in-laws live on Jeju Island,

475
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,803
so I know what to do
as soon as I see the ingredient.

476
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,205
-That must be the case.
-Right?

477
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,274
-It won't be an easy fight.
-He became eloquent while I was gone.

478
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,109
THE BLOWFISH BRO IS ON A ROLL

479
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,211
-He's on a roll.
-He is.

480
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,145
He's in season.

481
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,915
It's been a while
since Chef Sam came for a battle.

482
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,251
-Yes.
-I hear he took some time off

483
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,221
-because he lost three times in a row.
-Oh, no.

484
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,457
I reflected on myself for a while

485
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,026
and studied cooking a little more.

486
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,463
Now I'm here, ready to fight Ho-young
for the first time in a while,

487
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,232
so it's great.

488
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,233
HEHE

489
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,133
To fight him?

490
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,402
-He must feel like an easy opponent.
-Yes.

491
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,306
-He must feel like a perfect sacrifice.
-That wasn't what I meant.

492
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,474
However,

493
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,546
we always leave a device
in the chefs' green rooms.

494
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,716
-Do you have another recording?
-Yes, we got a record

495
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,252
-of someone's frightening words.
-What is it?

496
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,287
Chef Sam said,

497
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,490
"Ho-young spread his wings
here on <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

498
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,426
I can always break those wings."

499
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,362
-Really?
-He'll break his wings?

500
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,263
SNAP

501
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,897
Did you say that or not?

502
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,232
Well…

503
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,935
-I think I said something similar.
-Really?

504
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,571
-His character is intense these days.
-That was rough.

505
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,440
He's no longer a saint.

506
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,409
-He also said this.
-What is it?

507
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,712
"Ho-young's dishes are full of clichés.

508
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,281
It's either sweet and salty

509
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,483
or something deep-fried.

510
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,051
And his dance moves are awful too."

511
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,185
TRIGGERED

512
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,387
-His dance moves?
-His dance moves are awful too.

513
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,422
That must rub you the wrong way.

514
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,492
Above all else, I was most offended
by the comment on my dance.

515
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,395
He doesn't care when people say
he's an awful cook, but not his dance.

516
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,830
-I didn't want to bring it up.
-Let's verify it.

517
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,565
How much of this is true?

518
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,035
The first part was true.

519
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,937
-The first part?
-The intro.

520
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,240
-So you said his dishes were a cliché.
-His food is a cliché.

521
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,776
I said something in that line.

522
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:55,781
Are you making something sweet, salty,
and deep-fried today?

523
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,417
So you are?

524
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,586
HIS STRATEGY IS OUT IN THE OPEN

525
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,955
His strategy is already made known,
yet he'll do this?

526
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,792
-That's crazy.
-I see eggs.

527
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,427
FULL OF THOUGHTS

528
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,328
It must be true.

529
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,264
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS:
CUTTLEFISH, PEAS

530
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,333
LEMON JUICE, EGGS,
BROTH TABLET, CUTLASSFISH

531
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,968
What are you making, Chef Ho-young?

532
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,637
My dish is called…

533
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,973
<i>Next Cutlassfish</i>

534
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,642
-Is that aespa?
-Is that even a dance?

535
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,278
CHEF & MY FRIDGE
HAS A DANCING FAIRY

536
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,913
FASCINATED

537
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,282
HO-YOUNG'S DISH
NEXT CUTLASSFISH

538
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,483
-Is it a cutlassfish dish?
-Yes.

539
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,118
I'm going to use cutlassfish.

540
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,221
I'll turn it into fillets
to use just the meat.

541
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,057
I'll cut it into thin slices,
turn it into a net shape,

542
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,459
and make a steamed dish.

543
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,627
I won't make a dish
that tastes sweet and salty

544
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,695
or deep-fried.

545
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,764
-I'll make something new…
-Really?

546
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,700
-…to defeat Sam today.
-I see.

547
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,369
He changed his strategy.

548
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,704
In a phrase, I can call this,

549
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,841
"Sam Kim, you're going under."

550
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,409
A PHRASE TO KNOCK HIM DOWN

551
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,879
-"Sam Kim, you're going under."
-You're going under.

552
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,748
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
BALSAMIC VINEGAR,

553
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,815
OYSTER SAUCE, GOUDA, PEAS

554
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,884
MAYONNAISE, CABBAGE, CUTTLEFISH,
SOY MILK, TOMATOES, LEMONS

555
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,153
What are you making, Sam?

556
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,254
GLANCES

557
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,355
Well, I'm…

558
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,991
I'm making a dish

559
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,127
-with cuttlefish.
-Cuttlefish.

560
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,029
Cuttlefish?

561
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,164
Cuttlefish?

562
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,567
<i>Round-and-Round</i>

563
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:28,240
WHEN DID THEY CHOREOGRAPH THAT?

564
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,076
THE TWO ARE LIKE CHILDREN AGAIN

565
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,713
CHANGING ARMS, DOING HIS BEST

566
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,715
You're doing this before your guests?

567
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,650
WE'RE THE ONES LEFT
FEELING EMBARRASSED

568
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,352
ROUND AND ROUND

569
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,488
It took a lot of courage
for him to do that.

570
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,458
-That's how much he wants the star.
-Yes, you're right.

571
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,994
So it's called Round-and-Round Cuttlefish?

572
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,129
-That's right.
-Round cuttlefish?

573
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,932
I'll slice the cuttlefish, make cuts,

574
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,233
and stir-fry everything.

575
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,703
-He also seemed to like healthy food…
-Yes.

576
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,372
…so I'll stir-fry and broil cabbage

577
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,442
and some parboiled peas.

578
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,110
I'll use lemon

579
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,946
and some Gouda I found to season the dish.

580
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,284
Lastly, I'll use soy milk and Gouda
to make a rich and savory dip

581
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,487
to finish a toasty and fragrant dish.

582
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,123
It'll be a healthy dish.

583
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,092
Let us begin their cook-off.

584
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,765
Chef Sam is here today to catch
this big fish named Jung Ho-young.

585
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,868
However, Ho-young claims
he's too heavy to be caught,

586
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,871
and he'll snap Sam's fishing pole in half.

587
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,740
Chef Jung Ho-young is up against him.

588
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,045
Which one of them will be the one
who'll capture Byung-eun's palate?

589
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:43,682
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

590
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:46,852
Begin!

591
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,423
Cuttlefish versus cutlassfish.

592
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,726
But Chef Ho-young is
also using cuttlefish.

593
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,827
You're right.

594
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,129
Yes, I'm using cuttlefish.

595
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,798
Cuttlefish.

596
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,133
It's much more tender than regular squid,

597
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,736
and it also has less of the fishy smell.

598
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,905
IT GOES INTO A BLENDER?

599
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,039
He's grinding the cuttlefish.

600
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,242
-He's grinding it?
-I've never seen anyone do that.

601
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,644
Is he going to make a fish ball?

602
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,213
-Fish ball or fish cake.
-Is that how it's made?

603
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,018
He's now breaking eggs
labeled with egg code one.

604
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,787
EGG WHITES, YOLKS

605
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,189
It went into the wrong bowl!

606
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,891
EGG WHITE DROPS IN

607
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,626
-Damn it.
-It went into the wrong bowl!

608
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,095
It went into the wrong bowl!

609
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,565
-What have you done?
-It went into the wrong bowl!

610
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,668
It went into the wrong bowl!
It got mixed up!

611
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,237
He needed just the yolks,
but an egg white went in.

612
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,306
-Dang it.
-He's confused.

613
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,442
It was the other way around?

614
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,079
What have you done this early, Ho-young?
You should've been careful.

615
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,147
He got confused.

616
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,882
Something else must've been on his mind.

617
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,784
-You should've been careful.
-That's an expensive egg.

618
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,587
The executive director said,
"That's an expensive egg."

619
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,457
-Egg code one.
-And he eats two a day in the morning.

620
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,526
-That's an expensive egg.
-That's expensive.

621
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,262
The eggs were from free-range chickens.

622
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,530
He's grinding everything?

623
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,034
I've had cuttlefish many times,
but I've never seen that before.

624
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,238
Sam also uses a cuttlefish.

625
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,706
SKIN, OUT

626
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,741
Sam also got the cuttlefish.

627
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,744
-They're so quick with preparations.
-They're both very fast.

628
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,247
-They are.
-That's Sam.

629
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,348
HE ONLY USES THE MANTLE

630
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,318
-Sam's making cuts in the cuttlefish.
-Cuts.

631
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,587
MAKING FINE CUTS

632
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,989
-He's so delicate.
-He's making cuts.

633
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,558
-His cooking method is different.
-How delicate.

634
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,361
Ho-young sliced everything,
but Sam only makes cuts.

635
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,764
He's slicing it the other way
after making cuts.

636
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,233
-It'll roll up when cooked.
-It'll turn into a ring.

637
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,436
-Like a ring.
-It'll roll up like a ring.

638
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,704
That's right.

639
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,407
-It's like parboiled squid.
-Yes.

640
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,710
1. MARINADE CUTTLEFISH
IN BLACK PEPPER,

641
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,911
MINCED GARLIC, AND OLIVE OIL

642
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,613
Time really flies.

643
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,048
-There's the cutlassfish.
-The cutlassfish.

644
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,717
That's about four and a half fingers.

645
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,686
-It's really big. That's hearty.
-About four and a half fingers.

646
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,222
That size is very expensive
if you go to a market.

647
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,892
-He said it'd be about 250,000 won.
-If it's fresh.

648
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,095
-If it's fresh.
-If it's fresh.

649
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,364
HE GETS THE BONES OUT
AND MAKES FILLETS

650
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,300
-Both ingredients are so delicious.
-Yes.

651
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,803
The cutlassfish and cuttlefish
both look so fresh and delicious.

652
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,904
SALT

653
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,241
Is Ho-young soaking peas?

654
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,442
He's parboiling them.

655
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,278
-He's parboiling the peas.
-I see.

656
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,181
-What are those? Peas?
-I see.

657
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,750
Peas?

658
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,887
-I think he made roux.
-I did.

659
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,522
-With soy milk?
-Soy milk.

660
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,624
Just an FYI, that soy milk has

661
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,094
zero additives, so it's not sweet at all.

662
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,264
-I tried it, and it was just soy milk.
-Just soy, right?

663
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,832
It tasted like ground soybeans.

664
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,602
What's he grating? He's grating something.

665
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,437
-Gouda.
-I see.

666
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,905
Are you making soup?

667
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,240
This? No. It's Béchamel sauce.

668
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,543
I'm trying to make a Gouda dip.

669
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,478
You made the Béchamel sauce already?

670
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,914
He's probably trying to use it like cream.

671
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,250
THE SAUCE LOOKS CREAMY

672
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,818
WORKING ON THE CUTLASSFISH

673
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,522
Ho-young carefully begins
to get the cutlassfish ready.

674
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,824
His in-laws live on Jeju Island,

675
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,260
and he runs a business too.

676
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,961
Jeju Island is his turf.

677
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,697
SLICE

678
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,933
He's slicing the fish like noodles.

679
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,601
-Why are you… Oh, my.
-Why?

680
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,172
-Why do you do that?
-He said he'd make a net.

681
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,941
I thought he'd make cuts and pull it out,

682
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,943
but I think he'll weave the pieces.

683
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,411
-Really?
-Weave those?

684
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,848
Just like how people used to play
with matches at a tea house?

685
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,616
-Like this?
-A tea house?

686
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,951
-Like this?
-A tea house?

687
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,953
-It'll take forever.
-Like the hashtag sign.

688
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,422
-He's doing it now.
-Like that?

689
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,125
-That's…
-He's turning it into a grid.

690
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,663
He won't be able to finish that
if he misses a slot or two.

691
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,231
-Will it hold up?
-I wonder.

692
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,800
He couldn't even differentiate
between egg whites and yolks.

693
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,235
Yes, he couldn't even do that.

694
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,604
-Wait a second.
-He doesn't know the proper order.

695
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,306
-Be quiet!
-He's confused.

696
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,109
-Wait a second.
-He's confused.

697
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,044
-He's confused.
-"Be quiet"?

698
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,278
HE BERATES EVERYONE

699
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,347
-What do you mean?
-The second one is wrong.

700
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,715
You can do it, Ho-young!

701
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,217
It looks weird.

702
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,052
-He missed one there.
-No, it's right.

703
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,188
The first one is on top
and the second one is down below,

704
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,089
but the third is down too.

705
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,060
-Look at that.
-The first and the second are the same.

706
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,928
-The second one…
-Everything looks weird.

707
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,697
-Yes, pull the first one out.
-Damn it.

708
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,831
What's going on?

709
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,100
Ho-young is a good chef,

710
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:33,004
but he must be a bit slower
when it comes to solving puzzles.

711
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,807
He's only good at cooking.

712
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,243
-Is that done?
-He just put everything on top.

713
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,045
-What is that?
-It doesn't look uniform.

714
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,447
What will he do with it?

715
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,150
He'll probably put fillings inside
and steam that.

716
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,486
But it needs to stay together.
Otherwise, it may come undone.

717
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,955
The second and third ones are the same.

718
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,391
Right?
The second and third ones are the same!

719
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,994
Right?
The second and third ones are the same!

720
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,028
Be quiet.

721
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,231
-What do you mean? You're wrong.
-Why are you telling us to be quiet?

722
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,867
-He's going under.
-He's going under.

723
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,303
HE'S GOING UNDER

724
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,173
It should be criss-cross,
but it's just criss-criss.

725
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,009
It's the same as lumping it together.

726
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,244
Ho-young isn't so good
at making these shapes.

727
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,047
SAM SPEEDS UP WHILE EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION IS ON HO-YOUNG

728
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,182
3. CHOP A GARLIC CLOVE
AND MIX WITH

729
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,283
BALSAMIC VINEGAR AND OLIVE OIL

730
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,919
Sam is finally back to compete today.

731
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,688
Will he find his old self again?

732
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,823
Where's the black pepper?

733
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,091
BLACK PEPPER

734
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:33,965
4. ADD CHOPPED TOMATOES
AND SUGAR TO MAKE THE DRESSING

735
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,267
THE SECOND SAUCE IS FINISHED

736
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,869
HIS THIRD SAUCE
BEGINS WITH MAYONNAISE

737
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:38,770
Mayonnaise?

738
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,638
Mayonnaise.

739
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,442
Chef Sam just mixed
mayonnaise with oyster sauce.

740
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,579
-That's an unlikely mix.
-Mayonnaise and oyster sauce.

741
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,247
But he never uses MSG.

742
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,516
Sam has crossed over to the dark side,

743
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,852
-so he doesn't even mind MSG.
-Of course not.

744
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,321
You have to use it if you want to win.

745
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,991
KIM POONG'S LESSON:
ADD LOTS OF GOOD(?) STUFF

746
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,326
Do you remember the last episode?

747
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,827
He used three kinds.

748
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,332
Ho-young is making a new kind of dish.

749
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,234
How is he going to use that?

750
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,735
It had a lot of water before,

751
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:14,405
but it became drier like meringue
after it sat in the blender for a while.

752
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,475
You're right.
The egg whites turned into meringue.

753
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,911
That's pretty watery for meringue,

754
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,347
-but it became drier.
-He used only egg whites.

755
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,048
ANOTHER PINCH

756
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:24,983
What?

757
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,219
Starch? He mixed it with starch, right?

758
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,755
Chef Ho-young is using peas too.

759
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,290
I'm not completely sure,

760
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,226
but I think he got sugar
mixed up with salt and put that in.

761
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,262
-What? Sugar?
-No way. It's to add flavor.

762
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,696
Did you add sugar or salt?

763
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,999
Both.

764
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,234
-He made a mistake!
-It's to add flavor.

765
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,970
-He's going under.
-You're about to go under.

766
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,338
THIS MAN IS LOOKING
MUCH OLDER TOO…

767
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,040
Why is the time flying by?

768
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,944
We have to use a bit of sugar
when we make fish cake.

769
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,712
It'll only make it more delicious.

770
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,581
-All right, now.
-Look at that.

771
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,383
MOVING HIS CRISS-CRISS
CUTLASSFISH NET

772
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,385
One of the slices already fell out.

773
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,253
A slice already fell out.

774
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,856
-What's that? I've never seen it before.
-It's going in there?

775
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,858
It's like a ravioli.

776
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,627
-That's it.
-He's wrapping it with plastic.

777
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,796
WRAPPING QUICKLY

778
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,065
He's really fast.

779
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,402
SAFELY LANDING INSIDE A STEAMER

780
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,470
The shape is so strange.

781
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,739
Sam goes back to healthy cooking
and uses cabbage.

782
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,375
5. STIR-FRY CHOPPED CABBAGE,
OLIVE OIL, AND SALT

783
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,777
Are you stir-frying it in oil?

784
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,912
Yes, I'm using extra virgin olive oil.

785
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,847
You're just stir-frying the cabbage?

786
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:30,949
Yes, I am.

787
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,251
You have 6 minutes and 40 seconds left.

788
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,852
Time is flying by.

789
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,920
Time flies by quickly.

790
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,090
-They had lots of ingredients to prepare.
-That's right.

791
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,759
-They had to peel the skin off and all.
-They had to use seafood.

792
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,728
-The egg yolks.
-Are you using the yolks?

793
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,029
Sugar and rice wine.

794
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,866
-And what's that?
-I know!

795
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,735
He's making <i>kimizu</i> sauce.

796
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,571
It's like Japanese hollandaise sauce.

797
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,106
Hollandaise sauce?

798
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,942
The sauce I failed to make
in a previous episode.

799
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,712
-Damn it.
-It's boiling.

800
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,647
-Lemon.
-Lemon juice.

801
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,449
You had packets of lemon juice?

802
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,084
I drink that on an empty stomach.

803
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,151
Wait a second.

804
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,353
MIXING ENTHUSIASTICALLY

805
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,822
He has to go back and forth
as he mixes the mixture.

806
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,324
I think the water is boiling too hard.

807
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,027
-The heat is too high.
-Turn the heat off.

808
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,362
Who turned it on this high?

809
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,131
It was you. Who else?

810
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,199
VENTING BY MIXING

811
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,568
Can he do that?

812
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,702
I don't think it'll happen.

813
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,204
It's not turning firmer.

814
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,807
-It's hard to make <i>kimizu</i> sauce.
-It takes a while.

815
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,510
Ho-young looks flushed.

816
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,912
HE'S LOOKING QUITE SPITEFUL

817
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,381
Five minutes.

818
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,049
-Five minutes and fifty seconds.
-Five minutes.

819
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,450
-Already?
-Around five minutes.

820
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,486
What are you doing, Chef Sam?

821
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,556
I just cooked some peas
before broiling them.

822
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,991
THE STIR-FRIED CABBAGE
IS OUT TOO

823
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,161
He makes a healthy mix
with cabbage and peas.

824
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,696
6. PUT PEAS, CABBAGE, SALT INTO
A STRAINER AND BROIL OVER FIRE

825
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,699
-It goes over fire.
-Directly over fire?

826
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,301
-He's adding the smoky flavor.
-The smoky flavor.

827
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,369
That's amazing.

828
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,105
He's broiling cabbage and peas over fire.

829
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,641
He's adding the smoky flavor,
and the strainer turned red.

830
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,243
It has to.

831
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,911
The strainer is glowing red.

832
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,312
Four minutes.

833
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,415
Sung-ju, please report out there.

834
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,016
-I'll walk out.
-Yes.

835
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,318
Let me see.

836
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,388
I should try this sauce.

837
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,223
-Do you have to salt it?
-Yes.

838
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,259
I wonder what it's like
when made with soy milk.

839
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:26,063
Will he eat that
and dance round and round?

840
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:32,537
He can dance round and round!

841
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,706
<i>Round and round</i>

842
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,576
YOOHOO

843
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,811
LOOKING AWAY

844
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,045
Humor me.

845
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,880
I knew it, Sam.

846
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,550
Sam is the best chef
at making this kind of food.

847
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,717
It's so good.

848
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,119
Sam's good at that.

849
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,889
-The oyster sauce mix.
-The oyster sauce.

850
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,759
THE BLOWFISH BECAME ANXIOUS
AFTER HEARING THE TASTE TEST

851
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,595
THE BLOWFISH IS ABOUT TO BLOW UP

852
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,964
-Is this working?
-What are you doing?

853
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,433
You've been doing this for three minutes.

854
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,068
-I'm done.
-The sauce looks good.

855
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,603
-It does look good.
-Is this the sauce?

856
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,638
Let me try Ho-young's sauce!

857
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,208
-What's it like?
-I think it'll be good.

858
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,112
Is it on the next level?

859
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,814
-It's too sour!
-It is?

860
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,249
Did you use too much lemon juice?

861
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,550
Add sugar.

862
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,085
Do you like sour food?

863
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,121
-I drink lemon juice every morning.
-Really?

864
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,790
Then you'll be fine.
It's a bit too sour for me.

865
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,359
-It'll be fine with cutlassfish.
-He'll serve it with the fish.

866
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,128
Yes, he'll serve it with the fish.

867
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:33,264
He's making cuts.

868
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,400
He's now stir-frying cuttlefish in soju.

869
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,036
You're topping that with lemon?

870
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,772
This looks like a great idea.
He's topping it with lemon.

871
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,309
Sam looks busy in this return match
between him and Ho-young.

872
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,912
Will Sam get his revenge?

873
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,314
You have two minutes left!

874
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,949
Two minutes left.

875
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,050
Two minutes.

876
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,719
Hey, the cutlassfish!

877
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,555
-The cutlassfish is done.
-Is it cooked?

878
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,991
The shape looks perfect.

879
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,692
-The shape looks good.
-It's too hot!

880
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,094
TOO HOT

881
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,830
HE UNWRAPS THE BALL

882
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,466
AND FRIES IT AGAIN IN A PAN

883
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,967
You're going to fry it again?

884
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,003
-It's in a pan.
-It looks good.

885
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,539
It'll probably smell fishy
if he just steams it.

886
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,641
He's putting lots of work into the sauce.

887
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,243
Ho-young works so hard on the sauce
that his face becomes red.

888
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,345
Ho-young is doing his best!

889
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,415
This sauce must be very important!

890
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,817
He's having such a tough time.

891
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,054
His face is turning red.
Ho-young will blow up any minute now.

892
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,090
How important is this anyway?
It must be very important.

893
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,159
-One minute left.
-One minute.

894
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,962
You have one minute left.
You need to finish up soon.

895
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,432
You need to serve
your cuttlefish dish too!

896
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,467
8. STIR-FRY MARINATED
CUTTLEFISH RINGS IN OLIVE OIL,

897
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,535
AND THEN STRAIN

898
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,904
He's topping the dish with cuttlefish.

899
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,173
Sam tops the dish with cuttlefish.

900
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,410
-His hands are trembling.
-Serve it.

901
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,212
-Fifty seconds.
-Fifty seconds.

902
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,547
HO-YOUNG FLIPS IT ONE LAST TIME

903
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,217
-That looks cool.
-It looks so good.

904
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:02,186
-That looks cool.
-It looks so good.

905
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,189
The cutlassfish
turned out like a fish ball.

906
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,625
Ho-young isn't someone
who only makes sweet and salty dishes.

907
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,961
Ho-young begins to serve his novel dish.

908
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,230
Sam begins too. 18 seconds!

909
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,899
Eighteen seconds. Fifteen now.

910
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,034
Sam begins too. 18 seconds!

911
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,670
Eighteen seconds. Fifteen now.

912
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,672
-Fifteen now.
-Fifteen seconds left.

913
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,608
Whoa, that looks good.

914
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,477
Fifteen now. Sam is done!

915
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,745
Sam finishes first.

916
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,847
Sam is done! Only Ho-young remains.

917
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,751
-The sauce has such a pretty color.
-<i>Kimizu</i> sauce.

918
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,921
He's almost done now. Five. Four. Three.

919
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,689
Two. One.

920
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,659
Please ring the bell, Ho-young.

921
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,196
-Bravo.
-These both look good.

922
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,430
It looks good.

923
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,099
Look at the cuttlefish.

924
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,166
SEAFOOD DISHES FOR THE ANGLER

925
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,770
And now, the order titled,
"I am an angler"

926
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,874
had been filled by both chefs.

927
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,279
I don't think
anyone has ever cooked just for me

928
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,582
-except for my mother.
-That's true.

929
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,486
First of all, I want to thank both of you.

930
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,555
And now, please try Sam's dish first.

931
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,858
<i>It's called Round-and-Round Cuttlefish.</i>

932
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,059
CUTTLEFISH LINKING ARMS

933
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,330
SERVED WITH 3 DIFFERENT SAUCES

934
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:24,168
CHEF SAM KIM'S
ROUND-AND-ROUND CUTTLEFISH

935
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,903
How should he eat it?

936
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,405
It's served in layers,

937
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,541
so try the cabbage, sauce,
and cuttlefish altogether.

938
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,976
-At once?
-Yes.

939
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,179
Roundy. Rundy. Rondy.

940
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,447
Round and round.

941
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,483
I hope he sings the Round-and-Round song.

942
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,551
Will he?

943
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,852
PILING EVERYTHING

944
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,954
Will he sing the song?

945
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,990
-He's quite a gourmet.
-He is.

946
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,358
And he gives excellent reviews.

947
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,028
It must be good.

948
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,630
-What is it?
-It's so savory.

949
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,467
I asked them to make a dish
with one twist, right?

950
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,735
I think that was the smokiness.

951
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,772
-I didn't expect him to broil those.
-Cabbage and peas?

952
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,910
I was worried that
broiling those would kill the texture.

953
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:09,647
<i>But it was as crunchy as raw cabbage.</i>

954
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,949
I also love peas a lot,

955
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,019
so when one of them
popped deep inside my mouth,

956
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,088
it finally showed its presence.

957
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,257
The three ingredients are
in such great balance.

958
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,293
Also, the oil dressing goes very well.

959
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,162
I was very pleased with that bite.

960
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,831
I see.

961
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,767
Try it with cuttlefish pieces.

962
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,235
He's trying everything.

963
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,105
He's not an angler today.
He's the fish that's been caught.

964
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,840
He got duped by the shape.

965
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,276
-He likes it.
-He's enjoying it.

966
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:43,080
<i>Round and round</i>

967
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,783
<i>Round and round</i>

968
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,319
A SUCCESS

969
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,888
What's this white sauce?

970
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,824
The white one was made
with soy milk you had.

971
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,260
<i>I mixed soy milk with some Gouda.</i>

972
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,763
These peas are organic

973
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,298
and the soy milk has no additives,
and I like my food like that.

974
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,768
He also didn't season it too strongly,

975
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,238
so it's very close to something I like.

976
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,140
-I'm glad Sam did this.
-Me too.

977
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,443
-He listened to everything Byung-eun said.
-He did.

978
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,878
-Mmm.
-Yes?

979
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,881
It's so nice when the peas pop.

980
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,751
<i>Round and round</i>

-That was wonderful.
-Okay.

Next, a cutlassfish dish,

986
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:42,006
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
NEXT CUTLASSFISH

987
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,608
Something is inside that net.

988
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:48,212
-It looks good.
-It looks like it's floating on clouds.

989
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,347
It kind of looks like Jeju Island.

990
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,484
-The island?
-Yes, it's the island.

991
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,286
That's like Mount Halla in the middle.

992
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,420
Yes, that's true.

993
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,322
A CHANGE IN HIS STRATEGY

994
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,124
-I knew it.
-The island?

995
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,260
He made it look like Jeju Island.

996
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,362
-That was the shape.
-I'm curious.

997
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,965
I was really curious about the sauce.

998
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,402
-He put lots of work into it.
-Yes.

999
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,303
Mmm.

1000
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,707
I used egg yolks
from your favorite code one eggs,

1001
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,076
<i>lemon juice, sugar, and salt.</i>

1002
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,444
It's good.

1003
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,347
I'll try the cutlassfish now.

1004
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,717
You'll see the cuttlefish mix
when you cut that in half.

1005
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,554
-I remember that.
-I also chopped the legs in there.

1006
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,423
The sauce is a bit sour,

1007
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,826
so everything will depend on
the balance between this and the sauce.

1008
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,195
I hope the fish doesn't smell.

1009
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,098

00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,506
I only expected to taste cutlassfish,

1013
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,074
but I can taste cuttlefish too.

1014
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,112
<i>It's a mix of softness and chewiness.</i>

1015
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,481
But it doesn't smell fishy at all.

1016
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,517
-I see.
-That's the most important.

1017
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:05,623
It's only been fried on the outside,
so it's still only steamed on the inside.

1018
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,158
I think this means

1019
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,227
I did a great job
in keeping the fish fresh.

1020
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,297
-That's true.
-That's what he used.

1021
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,798
-He just complimented himself.
-It's fresh.

1022
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,568
He got it vacuum-sealed
as soon as he caught it.

1023
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,971
-The cutlassfish was in great condition.
-It was?

1024
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,173
It's a splendid achievement
for the Korean distribution system.

1025
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,044
I can't believe
the fish reached my home in a day.

1026
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,712
Also, it feels like

1027
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,381
I've become a rich man.

1028
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:34,718
Cutlassfish is expensive,
so we pick at it little by little, right?

1029
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,388
<i>But I get to eat</i>
<i>this huge piece as a whole.</i>

1030
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,123
<i>You caught it yourself.</i>

1031
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:43,193
Also, there are cuttlefish pieces
inside the sauce.

1032
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,329
He's diving into the sea.

1033
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,997
GOING IN

1034
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,034
He's diving into Jeju's sea.

1035
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,972
When I just tried the sauce,
I thought it might be a bit too sour.

1036
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,043
But it all made sense
when I had it with the fish.

1037
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,478
If the sauce was too sweet,

1038
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,748
it wouldn't have gone too well
with the cutlassfish.

1039
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,518
-It's so good.
-That's why it was sour.

1040
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,088
They made these
with the same cuttlefish I caught,

1041
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,156
but the textures.

1042
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,559
This was softer, while this was chewier.

1043
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,394
They made different textures
with the same cuttlefish.

1044
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:21,065
-This may be a decisive point.
-That's true.

1045
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,068
Kyung-soo is about to try some.

1046
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,705
That's Round-and-Round Cuttlefish
made by Chef Sam.

1047
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,107
Mmm.

1048
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,376
Do cuttlefish usually taste this savory?

1049
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,345
-The cuttlefish itself?
-Yes.

1050
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,513
-Is it really…
-I want to try that.

1051
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,682
-…thanks to the distribution system?
-It is.

1052
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,686
-How is this so good?
-It arrives at my place overnight.

1053
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,788
I can taste

1054
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,458
the subtle smokiness.

1055
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,693
-Did it change everything?
-It did.

1056
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,029
-It's so good.
-That was his twist.

1057
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,131
Smokiness is key in Chinese cuisine.

1058
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,434
The smokiness is
what brings the flavors together.

1059
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,004
It's like the glue
that holds everything together.

1060
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,340
It's definitely
the kind of dish Byung-eun would love,

1061
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,576
something that tastes healthy.

1062
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,444
It's clean and light.

1063
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,649
Next, Jung Ho-young's Next Cutlassfish.

1064
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,484
Thank you.

1065
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,020
-Just like that.
-It split in half.

1066
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,724
It almost felt like eels
when the cuttlefish was clumped up.

1067
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,626
It had that eel-like texture.

1068
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,262
It must be like steamed eels.

1069
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,330
DELIVERED INTO HIS MOUTH

1070
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,701
Kyung-soo's eyes become sharp again.

1071
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,971
It must be satisfying
to eat that much cutlassfish.

1072
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,205
Can I finish this?

1073
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,210
ONE BITE, THE END

1074
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,547
Everything was prepared,
made soft and tender.

1075
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,249
-Yes.
-So it feels like

1076
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,184
I'm getting rewarded.

1077
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,987
I don't have to remove the bones myself.

1078
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,156
-He did it for you.
-He did it.

1079
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,292
-It's easy to eat.
-It's very easy to eat and very soft.

1080
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,027
Yet he added some fun aspects

1081
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:01,999
with the filling in the middle
and other pieces of ingredients.

1082
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,234
Because cutlassfish is very soft.

1083
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,736
He has to make a decision now.

1084
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,705
It's now time to decide.

1085
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,741
It's your turn,
Executive Director Park Byung-eun.

1086
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,010
<i>Press one for Sam Kim,</i>

1087
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,312
<i>and press two for Jung Ho-young.</i>

1088
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,582
Make your decision and press the button.

1089
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,184
Did you?

1090
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,351
I did.

1091
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,189
Many things are going to change
after this decision.

1092
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:29,259
Who did Byung-eun choose?
Let's find out the result.

1093
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,461
The executive director's choice.

1094
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,062
I am an angler.

1095
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,264
Sam has now lost three times in a row.

1096
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,434
Will he finally break his losing streak?

1097
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:43,407
Or will Ho-young win against Sam
twice in a row and keep the streak?

1098
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,810
Who did you choose, Byung-eun?

1099
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,045
Was it the cuttlefish

1100
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,580
or the cutlassfish?

1101
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,882
Who won?

1102
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,851
JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1103
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,619
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
NEXT CUTLASSFISH WINS

1104
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,556
-Jung Ho-young wins!
-Ho-young wins.

1105
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,925
He's so good.

1106
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,161
HE EVEN TAKES THE DANCE

1107
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,796
He's so good.

1108
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,531
My gosh, Ho-young.

1109
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,599
He's in season.

1110
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,100
He's unstoppable.

1111
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,169
Did you enjoy the cutlassfish some more?

1112
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:15,205
I mentioned the twist I wanted,

1113
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,742
and Chef Sam's smoky flavor did just that.

1114
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:24,348
He also made it with healthy ingredients,
so I could eat that every single day,

1115
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,649
and it tasted wonderful too.

1116
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,887
But I leaned toward
Chef Ho-young's dish in the beginning

1117
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,157
because he turned
the cutlassfish I caught into a net.

1118
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:37,694
It was far from perfect,
and it was missing a few places too.

1119
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:41,899
But it felt like he made a dish
that appreciated my hobby,

1120
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,368
so I loved his imagination for that.

1121
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:47,471
What will Sam do now?

1122
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,274
-This is his fourth loss in a row.
-Oh, no.

1123
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,110
-I'm feeling uneasy now.
-Right?

1124
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,245
Why can't Chef Ho-young take a hint?

1125
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,581
-Seriously.
-Come on.

1126
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,850
Sam's going to become edgy.

1127
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,251
Well, I don't know.

1128
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,220
I'd be a bit edgy.

1129
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,022
QUICKLY LOOKS AWAY

1130
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,257
Ho-young takes his fifth win,
so put a star on him!

1131
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,228
THE SEAFOOD ROUND
GIVES HIM THE 5TH STAR

1132
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,730
-Congratulations on your fifth win!
-Congratulations!

1133
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:18,669
This is the second round
with Byung-eun's ingredients.

1134
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,405
It's titled, "I am a drinker."

1135
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,242
The official disciplinarian of the show,
Chef Ji-sun,

1136
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,078
fights against Chef Hyun-suk,
a chef who gets beaten

1137
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:31,181
by his junior chefs, for the first time.

1138
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,584
-It's like the final round of the show.
-It is.

1139
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,588
Hyun-suk has won nine times so far.

1140
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,324
THE ONLY 1ST PLACE WITH 9 WINS

1141
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,292
Ji-sun has won four times,

1142
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,162
but she won all four rounds she fought.

1143
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,231
SHE WINS EVERY SINGLE ROUND!

1144
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,632
Jung Ji-sun!

1145
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,735
-She doesn't come for no reason.
-No, she comes and wins.

1146
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,070
THE STAR BADGE HUNTER

1147
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,671
She's a strong contender.

1148
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:58,308
If Hyun-suk wins,
he'll be the first to win ten stars.

1149
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,011
-Ten?
-He'll be the first to get double digits.

1150
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,813
If Chef Ji-sun wins,

1151
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,948
she keeps the 100% win rate.

1152
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,451
However,

1153
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,187
our disciplinarian said this.

1154
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,891
-"Hyun-suk has become too weak."
-He's like a paper tiger.

1155
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,828
"It's now my turn to own
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i>."

1156
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,430
He's nothing but a paper tiger,

1157
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:24,735
-so she'll take him down and rise above.
-That's right.

1158
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,070
The culinary world is

1159
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:30,374
only defined by one's tale… talent…

1160
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,442
One's talent and taste…

1161
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:33,510
Something was odd.

1162
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,381
-He just…
-The paper tiger can't even speak.

1163
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,717
This is so sad. How unfortunate!

1164
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,953
Gosh, Hyun-suk.

1165
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,021
-My gosh.
-How sad.

1166
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,124
Hyun-suk is infamous
as someone who can't take his alcohol.

1167
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,092
I believe you can't drink at all.

1168
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,495
I cannot hold my alcohol,

1169
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:56,566
but I do have the ability to match
a perfect dish with a drink.

1170
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,303
According to our intel,

1171
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,839
the liquors Ji-sun collected for fun

1172
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,675
amounts to over ten million won.

1173
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,544
A revision is due. It's not ten million.
It's in the hundreds.

1174
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,479
-I'm so sorry.
-You should be.

1175
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,916
You killed her pride.
I mean, just ten million won?

1176
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,151
I didn't read it right.

1177
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,653
One of them is
ten million won for a bottle.

1178
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,258
<i>She even enjoys 58-proof kaoliang liquor</i>
<i>all by herself</i>

1179
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:24,061
and became famous as a drinker.

1180
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,330
Before we begin, as a fellow drinker,

1181
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:31,368
I believe he must know what it's like
to enjoy a good drink with good food.

1182
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,769
You won't have to worry.

1183
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,705
It won't be easy, Hyun-suk.

1184
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,540
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS:

1185
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,874
SEOLLEONGTANG BROTH,
OYSTER SAUCE, GOUDA

1186
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,243
CUTTLEFISH, CHILI OIL, SOY MILK,
DOUBANJIANG, TOFU

1187
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,579
The dish I'm making is called

1188
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,582
Cuttlefish <i>Mapo </i>Tofu for Soju.

1189
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,784
-Cuttlefish <i>Mapo </i>Tofu for Soju?
-Cuttlefish <i>Mapo </i>Tofu for Soju?

1190
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,387
-<i>Mapo </i>tofu.
-It already sounds delicious.

1191
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,922
For the soju he has?

1192
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,459
Pork is used the most often
to make <i>mapo</i> tofu,

1193
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,129
but I'll make it with cuttlefish,
so cuttlefish <i>mapo</i> tofu.

1194
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,197
Cuttlefish <i>mapo</i> tofu?

1195
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,631
That's not all.

1196
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,567
I thought he should protect his stomach,

1197
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,369
so I'll serve it with cream risotto

1198
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,171
you can top with <i>mapo</i> tofu.

1199
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,273
Cream risotto?

1200
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,642
Isn't the Chinese chef
better at making <i>mapo </i>tofu?

1201
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,178
-Right?
-It's a Chinese dish.

1202
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,847
-But he's…
-It's because

1203
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:19,516
I always challenge the chef

1204
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,418
with his or her strongest cuisine.

1205
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,886
That's so cool.

1206
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,455
Chef Hyun-suk challenges her head-on.

1207
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,425
And if he loses, he has an excuse.

1208
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,460
That's exactly it.

1209
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,863
He did that for many reasons.

1210
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,898
CHEF JI-SUN'S INGREDIENTS:
PEANUT BUTTER,

1211
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:35,966
BUCKWHEAT NOODLES, TOFU

1212
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,034
CHILI OIL, GREEN ONION KIMCHI,

1213
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,201
CUTLASSFISH, GINGER CHEONG,
SESAME

1214
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,870
I'm going to make

1215
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,605
Tofu and Sesame for <i>Makgeolli.</i>

1216
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,807
-Tofu and Sesame for <i>Makgeolli?</i>
-Yes.

1217
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,576
-Tofu and Sesame for <i>Makgeolli.</i>
-She's using tofu and sesame.

1218
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,311
-Tofu and sesame.
-Yes, I'll coat tofu

1219
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,515
with sesame seeds
and turn it into burger shapes.

1220
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,283
I'll use it as the bun

1221
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,920
to stuff with cutlassfish meat
and buckwheat noodles.

1222
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,355
Will she have enough time?

1223
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,523
So tofu will turn into buns?

1224
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,924
-I guess.
-She'll use tofu as buns

1225
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,926
and the filling as noodles?

1226
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:06,663
And you believe
it'll go well with <i>makgeolli</i>, right?

1227
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,331
Yes, I'm sure of it.

1228
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,699
You're sure of it?

1229
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:13,837
One of them is matching with soju,
and the other one is using <i>makgeolli.</i>

1230
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,174
Let us begin this big match.

1231
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,577
He may not know how good alcohol is,
but he knows it's good to win stars.

1232
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,081
Chef Choi Hyun-suk,
a chef who can't contain his alcohol.

1233
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,317
She's here to both chug drinks
and sweep stars.

1234
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,621
-The drunkard chef, Chef Jung Ji-sun.
-Drunkard?

1235
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:36,426
Which one of them will capture
Byung-eun's booze-loving heart?

1236
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,329
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1237
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,998
Begin!

1238
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,534
A ROUND BETWEEN THE TWO
STRONGEST CHEFS AT THE MOMENT

1239
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,671
<i>Mapo </i>tofu versus tofu and sesame.

1240
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,407
What's that? For risotto?

1241
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:53,410
-What's the rice for? Risotto?
-Risotto.

1242
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,779
-That was raw rice.
-It was.

1243
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,882
-What's he putting into the pot?
-Is that rice water?

1244
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,784
-<i>Seolleongtang</i>, ox bone soup.
-<i>Seolleongtang?</i>

1245
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,652
Stocks are used for risotto,

1246
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,754
-so he's using soup instead.
-<i>Seolleongtang</i> broth?

1247
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,657
There was a pack of soup in the fridge.

1248
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,693
Can he really make the risotto?

1249
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,062
I'm so anxious about the risotto.
Is it okay?

1250
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,499
I'm sorry for keep saying this,
but we're done if this doesn't work.

1251
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,701
Will the raw rice get cooked?

1252
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,936
All right. Let's see.

1253
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:21,571
STARTING WITH GREEN ONION OIL

1254
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,639
-Green onion oil?
-Green onion oil.

1255
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:24,708
Chef Ji-sun makes green onion oil.

1256
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,977
I've never used this before.

1257
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,447
DROPPING BUCKWHEAT NOODLES
FOR THE FIRST TIME

1258
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,216
SHE GRABS TOFU

1259
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,818
She grabs tofu.

1260
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,786
She's cutting it into three pieces.

1261
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,421
She's going to turn those into buns?

1262
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,191
-I'm not sure.
-It's so odd.

1263
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,759
1. BOIL DOWN TOFU
IN WATER AND GINGER CHEONG

1264
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,495
-Ji-sun works hard on the tofu.
-Ginger <i>cheong</i>.

1265
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,164
-Ginger <i>cheong!</i>
-Ginger <i>cheong.</i>

1266
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,466
She's making holes in tofu.

1267
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,068
She's trying to let the sauce seep inside.

1268
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,437
I'm not sure what these are yet.

1269
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,607
Tofu is an ingredient that goes well
with both soju and <i>makgeolli</i>.

1270
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,508
That's true.

1271
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:02,379
-I've seen tofu get griddled often.
-Or deep-fried.

1272
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,081
But she's boiling it down.
Is that like a braise?

1273
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,684
CHOPPING

1274
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,121
-He does that first?
-Look at his hands move.

1275
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,690
He's still in his prime.

1276
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,293
Who called him old?

1277
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,195
You have to take a good look.

1278
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,729
It's hard to see it down here,

1279
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,331
so he had to bring it up to his eyes.

1280
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,967
-That's so unfortunate.
-He can't see it down here.

1281
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,702
-So he did this?
-He brought it closer.

1282
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,438
-He only wants to see it closer.
-You're right.

1283
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,440
He has old eyes.

1284
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:34,044
He's chopping the cuttlefish
into large pieces without hesitating.

1285
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,713
He's going to use those to make <i>mapo</i> tofu.

1286
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,415
<i>Mapo </i>tofu with cuttlefish?

1287
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,984
Those are cuttlefish pieces, right?

1288
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,653
SOY SAUCE, CHOPPED GREEN ONION,
CHOPPED GINGER

1289
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,956
WRAPS CHOPPED GINGER
WITH A CLOTH

1290
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,959
TO MAKE GINGER JUICE

1291
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,862
The two look very serious

1292
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,764
and highly focused!

1293
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,400
Chef Hyun-suk may have to leave
if he loses this round.

1294
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,301
Leave where?

1295
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,538
-To become a real tiger.
-Instead of paper?

1296
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,708
-He needs to be a real tiger.
-A real tiger.

1297
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,376
SHE GRABS CUTLASSFISH

1298
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,813
-Cutlassfish. Is she making batter?
-Cutlassfish.

1299
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,549
-It looks so good.
-It's huge.

1300
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,750
It is.

1301
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,087
GOES INTO THE GREEN ONION OIL

1302
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,022
I get it. Into the green onion oil.

1303
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,358
The cutlassfish is as big as a wallet.

1304
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,659
It's huge.

1305
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:23,793
You can put it in your back pocket.

1306
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,463
-How are we going to find that?
-It looks good.

1307
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,465
It's as big as a Spanish mackerel.

1308
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,367
-I'd believe that.
-It's that big.

1309
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,669
-That'd get rid of all the fishy smell.
-Yes.

1310
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:36,506
Even fish that are less than fresh
would smell good if I do that.

1311
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,241
I mean fish
that has been around for a while.

1312
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,076
It'll get rid of all odd smells.

1313
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,712
Byung-eun makes a connection
with Chef Ji-sun's dish.

1314
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:47,350
Hyun-suk may be older,
but he's not a paper tiger yet.

1315
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,985
He can still bite you.

1316
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,787
-Let me borrow the oyster sauce.
-Sure.

1317
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,957
-Oyster sauce.
-Yes, you need a touch of MSG.

1318
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,726
He goes to the Chinese chef
and borrows oyster sauce.

1319
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,596
Let me use the chili oil.

1320
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,866
He keeps taking something
from Chef Ji-sun.

1321
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,934
We have to use it together,

1322
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,004
so I left it on her side

1323
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,939
-to make it easier for her.
-How considerate.

1324
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,842
Is that so? I didn't know. I knew it.

1325
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,411
That's Hyun-suk.

1326
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,980
Cooking begins with consideration
because it's done for others.

1327
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,649
Hyun-suk, the symbol of consideration.

1328
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,451
He's using tofu.

1329
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,422
-They're both using tofu.
-They are.

1330
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,490
Tofu is a crucial ingredient.

1331
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,628
3. MAKE A CUT HALFWAY
IN TOFU BRAISED IN GINGER CHEONG

1332
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,229
She's making the bun now.

1333
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,864
-She made a cut.
-You're right.

1334
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,766
She made a cut in the tofu.

1335
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,002
-Like a mouth?
-Yes, so she can put stuff inside.

1336
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,738
So she'll use cutlassfish…
Look at the sesame seeds!

1337
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,907
-Tofu and sesame.
-That's a lot of sesame seeds.

1338
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,442
That's too much.

1339
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,610
You both have 11 minutes.

1340
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,013
-That's a lot of sesame seeds.
-Isn't that too much?

1341
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,648
-It goes inside too.
-That's a lot.

1342
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,150
-Isn't that too much?
-Right?

1343
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,386
But it must taste really nutty.

1344
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,121
Those sesame seeds are organic too.

1345
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,389
Really?

1346
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,057
Everything is organic except for alcohol.

1347
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,728
-Is that salt? Or flour?
-Flour?

1348
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:05,995
-It's starch.
-Starch.

1349
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,497
-It's starch?
-Will she deep-fry them?

1350
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,632
But she applied it over the seeds.

1351
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,867
I can't imagine what this is.

1352
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,769
-That's new.
-I think she'll deep-fry them.

1353
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,739
-It's usually coated with starch first.
-Yes, it's the other way around.

1354
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,240
-But it's on top.
-Reversed?

1355
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,742
-What's the difference?
-It's reversed.

1356
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,644
-She'll fry those.
-She coated tofu with sesame seeds.

1357
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,079
She's griddling the tofu.

1358
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,149
I won't lose too many sesame seeds
if I put starch on the outside.

1359
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,518
-I see.
-She tried to keep the seeds.

1360
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:32,422
The seeds will remain on the tofu
if she applies starch on the outside.

1361
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,025
-She's such a genius.
-It's such a smart trick.

1362
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,894
And it wouldn't get burnt.

1363
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,796
You're right. The seeds won't burn either.

1364
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,831
THE PAPER TIGER LOOKS BUSY

1365
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,200
-He's using soy milk.
-Soy milk?

1366
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:45,635
So, you want soy milk?

1367
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,337
I'm sorry.

1368
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,739
-He apologized right away.
-So, you want soy milk?

1369
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,141
AND BUTTER

1370
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:53,810
THINKING

1371
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:56,479
Wait, don't you feel anxious
about his risotto?

1372
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,348
-He made it with soaked rice.
-You're anxious.

1373
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,851
But Chef Hyun-suk
makes the impossible possible.

1374
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,120
-Chili pepper.
-He uses chili pepper.

1375
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,258
HE CHOPS GREEN ONION…

1376
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:12,462
Wait, Hyun-suk.
Is that blood on your glove?

1377
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,964
-What? Your thumb.
-Are you hurt?

1378
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,435
-I think he cut himself.
-He did?

1379
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,371
JUST NOW

1380
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:25,608
HE CUT HIS HAND ON THE BLENDER
AND PUT ANOTHER GLOVE ON

1381
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,478
-Oh, no!
-I cut my hand putting cuttlefish in.

1382
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,547
-But I must continue to cook.
-Gosh.

1383
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,783
I put on another glove
and made sure it's still sanitary.

1384
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,187
-He hurt himself!
-What happened?

1385
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,589
The problem wasn't that
he was a paper tiger.

1386
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,158
He's now a paper tiger
with a wounded hand.

1387
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,460
And a poor eyesight.

1388
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,962
Hey, watch what you say to your elder.

1389
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,864
You aren't badly hurt, are you?

1390
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,566
No.

1391
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,435
Is he going to give up?
No, he won't give up!

1392
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:55,271
-His hands are trembling too.
-He continues to cook.

1393
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,240
AND HE DROPS SALT
DESPITE HIS WOUND

1394
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,342
He puts up with the pain.

1395
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,345
Hyun-suk does his best
to cook for Mr. Park.

1396
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,280
It doesn't matter if I cut my hand

1397
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,483
or even lose my entire arm.

1398
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:09,752
Mr. Park here deserves a delicious dish.

1399
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,922
-Yes. Oh, no.
-It looks good.

1400
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,257
He continues despite his wound.

1401
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,125
Hyun-suk puts up with the pain.

1402
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,427
The oldie goes strong.

1403
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,562
The game just went to Hyun-suk.

1404
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,064
JI-SUN GETS THE CUTLASSFISH OUT

1405
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,599
Isn't the fish burnt?

1406
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,100
It's okay. It can be burnt.

1407
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,402
I think she'll only use the meat.

1408
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,438
Yes, I will. That's it.

1409
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,406
SHE HOLDS THE FRIED CUTLASSFISH

1410
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:33,343
She's trying to get
just the meat from the fish.

1411
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,645
-Only the meat.
-She just fried it in green onion oil.

1412
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,314
-Look how much meat it has.
-Just the meat.

1413
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,916
She said she'd use noodles too.

1414
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,384
Is that the tofu filling?

1415
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:46,089
She's fighting against time
and potential bones left behind.

1416
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:50,593
The meat is definitely even better
when you fry it with the bones.

1417
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,494
You're right.

1418
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,763
I wonder if she removed all the bones.

1419
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,964
A roller mat.

1420
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,734
-There are the noodles.
-The noodles.

1421
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,836
Buckwheat noodles are really slippery.

1422
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,805
-What? What's wrong?
-I've never used these before.

1423
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,774
BUCKWHEAT NOODLES
ON THE ROLLER MAT

1424
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,675
These are very slippery.

1425
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,111
Are those glass noodles?

1426
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,679
-Buckwheat noodles.
-Buckwheat noodles.

1427
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,648
Do glass noodles come in that color?

1428
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,750
What's on top of the buckwheat noodles?

1429
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,351
-Cutlassfish.
-Only the meat?

1430
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:16,953
Isn't it obvious?

1431
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,757
Hyun-suk and I are the same age.

1432
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,091
I can't really see, either.

1433
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,428
Jeez, this is horrible.

1434
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:28,131
What will I do with these paper tigers?

1435
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,667
-She'll griddle that too.
-She'll cook that?

1436
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,138
-What? She's griddling that?
-I get it.

1437
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,706
That looks good.

1438
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,742
Is that cheese? He's using lots of cheese.

1439
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,978
ADJUSTING THE THICKNESS
WITH SEOLLEONGTANG BROTH

1440
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:42,979
Is it already cooked?

1441
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,414
Yes, it's going well.

1442
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,383
Will risotto make
a good bar snack with soju?

1443
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,186
Right? Soju and risotto?

1444
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,755
But the sauce is <i>mapo </i>tofu,
so it might go well together.

1445
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,559
Will he mix those together?

1446
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,795
-And now, five minutes. Jung-hwan?
-Yes.

1447
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,563
-Already?
-Please go out to the kitchen.

1448
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,165
You have five minutes left.

1449
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,867
This risotto was made with raw rice.

1450
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,303
-Can you try that?
-Yes. I should try it.

1451
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,573
Check the current situation
without <i>mapo </i>tofu in it.

1452
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,445
First, blow on it, and then try it.

1453
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:20,083
Does it go well with soju?

1454
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,818
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

1455
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,021
-It's too bland.
-It must be.

1456
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,690
We need something strong to eat with soju.

1457
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:28,758
Isn't that so?

1458
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,560
It's because of this sauce.

1459
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,329
It's bland, but it tastes like risotto.

1460
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,032
You must've seen Chinese chefs
use starch water.

1461
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,501
It's hard to make that in a bowl,

1462
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,069
so let me give you a tip.

1463
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,573
Put water and starch into a bottle, and…

1464
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,941
Shake it?

1465
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,876
Shake it first?

1466
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,278
IT'S MUCH EASIER WITH A BOTTLE

1467
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,413
That's a good tip.

1468
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,915
-He even shares a tip in this situation.
-A great tip.

1469
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,918
SHE CHOPS AND PREPARES
GREEN ONION KIMCHI

1470
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:57,920
SHE CHECKS ROLLED CUTLASSFISH
IN BUCKWHEAT NOODLES

1471
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,356
A FLIP ATTEMPT

1472
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,325
BREAKS IN HALF

1473
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,727
-No! It's ruined!
-No!

1474
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,630
-Did it break?
-It's ruined!

1475
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,166
No, I can do this.

1476
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,301
-I can do this.
-That side looks flustered

1477
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,903
while this side shares a good tip.

1478
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,073
-This is…
-It's okay. I can do this.

1479
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,777
She washed green onion kimchi
and began to stir-fry those too.

1480
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,112
She's cooking kimchi here,
and he's cooking risotto here.

1481
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,180
He adds tofu.

1482
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,082
STARTING TO LOOK LIKE
MAPO TOFU NOW

1483
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:31,688
4. MIX SOY SAUCE AND CHILI OIL
AS THE SAUCE

1484
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,457
FINISHED IN NO TIME

1485
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,159
It's slowly thickening.

1486
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,961
-But the problem is this.
-Look at that piece.

1487
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,065
It looks a bit ruined. Wait, what is this?

1488
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,900
-This is tofu.
-Tofu with sesame seeds.

1489
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,469
The tofu is opening up its mouth!

1490
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,970
The tofu covered in sesame opens up.

1491
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,773
-You're stuffing fish and noodles here?
-Yes.

1492
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,209
It goes in here? Isn't it a bit too small?

1493
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,978
I can do it. I can do this.

1494
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,481
She's scraping out the seeds
that went on the inside.

1495
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,849
-I see.
-The seeds?

1496
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:03,319
Ji-sun gets ready to serve the food
with two minutes left in the round.

1497
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,754
The <i>mapo</i> tofu sauce.

1498
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,822
He begins to serve too.

1499
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,558
-The <i>mapo </i>tofu sauce.
-He's serving those separately.

1500
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,527
-He's serving them separately.
-You can mix those later.

1501
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,298
TOPPED WITH GREEN ONION
AND CHILI PEPPER

1502
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,301
FINISHING WITH A BIT OF SUGAR

1503
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,203
The burger.

1504
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:24,540
-In here…
-You have 1 minute and 40 seconds.

1505
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,042
AMAZED

1506
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,412
-Ji-sun looks to be in trouble.
-No!

1507
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,547
-The problem is this.
-Will it really fit?

1508
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,951
-Yes.
-She's stuffing the tofu!

1509
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,119
It's okay.

1510
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,121
Something isn't going well.

1511
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,323
THE TOFU SNAPS OPEN

1512
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,624
ON ITS BACK

1513
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:42,692
Oh, no.

1514
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,027
THE UNDEFEATED JI-SUN'S
BIGGEST CRISIS

1515
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,429
It opened up all the way!

1516
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,264
-Hurry up!
-No!

1517
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,266
The tofu opened up!

1518
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,470
-The tofu… Hyun-suk is done.
-Hyun-suk is done.

1519
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,072
I told you that it was too small.

1520
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,007
I said it was too small.

1521
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,343
Was your plan too far-fetched?

1522
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:01,844
-I need to try it again.
-Again.

1523
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,380
-You still have a minute.
-She has another tofu.

1524
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,883
-You've only put the noodles inside.
-Oh, no.

1525
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,519
-You've only put the noodles inside.
-Oh, no.

1526
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:13,956
The cutlassfish goes in too,
but what about the green onion kimchi?

1527
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,859
What about the green onion kimchi?

1528
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,162
You have 45 seconds left!

1529
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,930
It went on this plate.

1530
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:24,367
-That sauce was for this?
-She pours it on top.

1531
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,569
-That looks good.
-It looks savory.

1532
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,338
-No!
-I can do this.

1533
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,174
-Thirty seconds!
-Thirty seconds!

1534
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,109
You can do this, Chef Ji-sun!

1535
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,278
A FATAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTACK

1536
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,646
You can do this!

1537
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,648
-The disciplinarian is having trouble.
-Come on.

1538
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,484
-He's such a tease.
-No one has fought physically, right?

1539
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,985
-No.
-No.

1540
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:46,656
Chef Ji-sun is finished too.

1541
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,291
-She's done.
-She finishes with 12 seconds left.

1542
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,726
-The noodles won't stick together.
-Look how sweaty she is.

1543
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,329
-The noodles won't stick together.
-It smells so good.

1544
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:58,000
Both dishes were finished
to fill his order, "I am a drinker."

1545
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:02,905
That was such a big match.

1546
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:06,509
Please try Chef Hyun-suk's dish,
Cuttlefish Mapo Tofu for Soju.

1547
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:11,214
SPICY MAPO TOFU
MEETS MILD RISOTTO

1548
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,052
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S
CUTTLEFISH MAPO TOFU FOR SOJU

1549
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,288
-He needs soju.
-Yes, he needs a drink.

1550
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,390
I'm the official bartender.
Please sit down.

1551
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:24,794
-Have a seat, please.
-Come on. Please.

1552
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,564
Please just stay seated,
Executive Director.

1553
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,900
Come on, Executive Director.

1554
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,668
He's your waiter today.

1555
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:33,870
Gosh, Executive Director.

1556
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,271
I'm your waiter, Terius.

1557
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,906
MANAGER TERIUS WAS ONCE
A BIG SHOT BACK IN THE DAY

1558
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,708
-Back in the day.
-Mr. Park here is…

1559
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,877
-Terius?
-I have a reason.

1560
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,679
When you try it,
scoop a spoonful and try it with risotto.

1561
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:47,717
Please have a bite of mapo tofu
with the risotto.

1562
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:52,288
I have to see what goes best
with the drink,

1563
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,690
-so I'll have a glass first.
-Of course.

1564
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,760
Before you drink that,
why don't you make a toast for us?

1565
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,762
-A toast.
-Yes.

1566
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,697
-Cut it out.
-Do it for the show, please.

1567
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:03,699
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PARK IS
GOING INTO HIS CHARACTER

1568
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:04,667
He's getting ready to act.

1569
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,103
-Everyone, listen up.
-He's getting into character.

1570
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:10,273
SCENE 1: A GROUP DINNER
FOR CHEF & MY FRIDGE COMPANY

1571
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,008
I hope to see

1572
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,277
endless growth

1573
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,679
here in <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

1574
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,149
I may be the executive director now,
but I want to be the CEO soon.

1575
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,918
For CEO Park!

1576
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,819
-For CEO Park!
-For CEO Park!

1577
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,390
THOSE WHO SIDE WITH HIM
ALL CHEER

1578
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,960
We asked him to do it for the show,
but he did it for himself.

1579
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,063
What's important is that we side with him.

1580
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,431
We're his trustworthy forces.

1581
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:39,368
I have to eat this now
as soon as the alcohol hits my nose.

1582
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,971
-Right now.
-Yes, he has to try it now.

1583
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,907
-A spoonful of <i>mapo </i>tofu.
-And mix.

1584
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,142
Just like that.

1585
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,243
What kind of mix is this?

1586
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,080
-Yes, and it can even be a meal with soju.
-It must make him crave soju.

1587
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,915
Risottos are usually considered a meal.

1588
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,618
Most think rice
wouldn't go well with drinks, right?

1589
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,820
-It seems heavy like it'll make you full.
-Yes.

1590
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:58,888
I wonder what it's like.

1591
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,389
-Mmm.
-It must feel like a casual meal.

1592
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,625
When you see it like this,

1593
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:07,530
it feels like the risotto should
reek of the ingredients such as butter.

1594
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,466
But I can only detect
a subtle smell in the sauce.

1595
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,234
But this <i>mapo </i>tofu is spicy

1596
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,171
and something that makes you crave soju.

1597
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:17,974
The balance is wonderful.

1598
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,877
It feels like a very simple dish,

1599
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,213
yet it tastes like the ultimate flavor.

1600
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,516
He didn't use too many techniques,

1601
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,653
yet it made me fall for the dish
as soon as I had it.

1602
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,789
It goes so well,
so may I have another drink?

1603
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,224
Does it go well?

1604
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,893
You must be feeling great,
Executive Director.

1605
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,296
Until the day
when Mr. Park becomes the CEO!

1606
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,665
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1607
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,868
EXCESSIVE DRINKING IS
HARMFUL FOR YOUR HEALTH

1608
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,372
-It must be amazing.
-My gosh.

1609
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:53,476
He looks so happy.

1610
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,644
-He rarely eats like this.
-Yes.

1611
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:01,350
I can feel the scent of meat in this,

1612
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,620
and it all goes well together.

1613
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,489
Where's the cuttlefish?

1614
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,892
<i>Mapo </i>tofu is usually made
with ground meat, mostly ground pork.

1615
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,528
But I chopped cuttlefish
and replaced the meat.

1616
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:16,966
-I must've thought that was red meat.
-Because of the texture?

1617
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,802
Hyun-suk turned cuttlefish into red meat.

1618
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,339
So I wanted to make <i>mapo </i>tofu
with a hint of sea.

1619
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,975
-<i>Mapo </i>tofu with a hint of sea.
-<i>Mapo </i>tofu with a hint of sea.

1620
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,545
I'll spot everything you miss, sir.
You have my loyalty.

1621
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,147
Your loyalty?

1622
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,282
-We're with Mr. Park.
-We are.

1623
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,151
These two dishes are completely different,

1624
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,253
but when they come together,

1625
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,688
it turns into a very mature flavor.

1626
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,991
It tastes like it knows what balance is.

1627
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,059
Just like you, sir.

1628
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,126
Precisely.

1629
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,695
I was going to say that!

1630
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,464
-I'm kind of liking you.
-That was mine!

1631
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,599
It's an honor, sir.

1632
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,270
It must feel hearty and mature.

1633
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,705
-They seem like an unlikely pair.
-It tastes mature.

1634
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,808
It's very good. Very mature.

1635
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:02,144
Not only will it make a nice bar snack,

1636
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,447
but it's perfect as a meal.

1637
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:08,417
It'd feel hearty to eat carbs
when you grab a drink,

1638
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,653
and it could protect your stomach too.

1639
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,223
A bar snack that can double as a meal is
a disaster in the making.

1640
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,891
Thank you.

1641
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,660
Sir, let's go to the next bar.

1642
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,129
-The second round?
-Let's go to another place.

1643
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,798
How about <i>makgeolli</i>, sir?

1644
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,334
<i>Makgeolli</i> sounds great.

1645
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,937
Back in college,

1646
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,672
I practically lived with <i>makgeolli.</i>

1647
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,441
The second round is <i>makgeolli.</i>

1648
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,010
<i>Please try Chef Ji-sun's</i>
<i>Tofu and Sesame for Makgeolli.</i>

1649
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:36,579
TOFU COATED WITH SESAME SEEDS

1650
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,447
FILLED WITH CUTLASSFISH
AND NOODLES

1651
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:43,185
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S
TOFU AND SESAME FOR MAKGEOLLI

1652
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,554
-What are you waiting for?
-I'm sorry.

1653
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,856
Should I shake it?

1654
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,125
-You have to.
-Do you take it like that?

1655
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,394
-People don't do that these days.
-It's like the old times.

1656
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,430
-I'll open it slowly.
-Push it.

1657
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,098
He's pushing it from the bottom.

1658
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,100
Mr. Park knows how it's done.

1659
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,002
I love that guy.

1660
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,304
It's not going to overflow.

1661
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,673
BUT IT DID

1662
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,143
Come on, Mr. Ahn!

1663
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,645
What have you done, Mr. Ahn?

1664
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,947
You just wasted perfectly good <i>makgeolli!</i>

1665
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:14,583
-Mr. Park is mad!
-Why did you do that?

1666
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,285
Mr. Park is angry.

1667
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,255
It's because he pushed it.
I had my own method.

1668
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,191
-I was trying to test you.
-Sure.

1669
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,828
-I knew it. I'll just laugh it off.
-He was testing you?

1670
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,696
For the day you become the CEO!

1671
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,667
-Let me try some.
-He's going to try some.

1672
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:36,172
Mr. Park has such elegance
even when he drinks <i>makgeolli.</i>

1673
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,740
-He's cut out to be the CEO.
-Yes.

1674
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:41,710
He started as the manager of sales
and got to this place today.

1675
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,013
You're acting up too much.

1676
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,248
I'm sorry, sir.

1677
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:48,984
Chief Poong!
Be quiet while Mr. Park dines.

1678
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,786
I'm a chief? I'm sorry.

1679
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,988
Chief Poong, go home if you're drunk.

1680
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,257
-I'm sorry.
-What's with you?

1681
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,459
He doesn't like to see people drunk.

1682
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,496
-Wait, this is tofu.
-But?

1683
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:03,232
But the texture reminds me of red meat.

1684
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,967
How well will it go with sesame seeds?

1685
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:09,271
Can you try everything together,
although it's a bit too big?

1686
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:13,108
-He already had the food halfway in.
-He already took a bite.

1687
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:16,745
-Ms. Jung, you should've told him before.
-I'm sorry.

1688
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,281
-What's with you?
-General Manager Choi.

1689
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,983
He tried just the tofu.

1690
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,952
-It's good.
-It is?

1691
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,553
-You just had the tofu.
-I'm getting excited.

1692
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,822
-You're getting excited?
-He's excited.

1693
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,225
That tofu was covered
with lots of sesame seeds.

1694
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,561
-I wondered if it'd be okay.
-I wanted to ask just that.

1695
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,164
Tofu is such a mild ingredient,

1696
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,766
so it goes so well with sesame seeds
and the sauce.

1697
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,836
On top of that, the smell
from buckwheat noodles adds a nice touch.

1698
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,239
-Let me try the fish too.
-Cutlassfish.

1699
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:45,407
You fried that in green onion oil, right?

1700
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,109
Yes, I did.

1701
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,812
And I put peanut butter
between the tofu buns,

1702
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,748
which were boiled down in ginger <i>cheong</i>.

1703
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:56,185
He's eating everything in one bite.

1704
01:10:56,252 --> 01:11:00,623
-That was a huge bite.
-He ate that so deliciously.

1705
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,826
VACUUMING EVERYTHING

1706
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,261
CURIOUS

1707
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:06,228
It looks good.

1708
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,634
It was an unexpected flavor.

1709
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,402
Does it go well with <i>makgeolli?</i>

1710
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,304
So much.

1711
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:17,973
My mouth is actually watering.

1712
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,509
The green onion kimchi adds a nice twist.

1713
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:25,514
When we eat green onion <i>jeon,</i>
the fried green onion or spring onion

1714
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,784
-would leave that scent behind, right?
-The nutty flavor.

1715
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:32,554
<i>This sauce is a bit greasy</i>
<i>and can be too much,</i>

1716
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:36,292
<i>but the saltiness</i>
<i>of the green onion kimchi</i>

1717
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:39,128
<i>balances everything out.</i>

1718
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:43,532
I can taste five to six
different flavors at the same time.

1719
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,668
It's such a delicious dish.

1720
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:49,138
It looks like
Chef Ji-sun has the upper hand.

1721
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,572
He's going for <i>makgeolli.</i>

1722
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:55,711
-This is nice.
-It's nice.

1723
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,714
It must be nice.

1724
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,716
He said it was nice. Give him a hand.

1725
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,351
Give him a hand!

1726
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,485
FOLLOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR!

1727
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,753
SHH, WAVING HIS HAND

1728
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,990
I'm not that big of a deal.

1729
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,461
You're already the CEO in our hearts.

1730
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,164
Our executive director.

1731
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,733
-Both chefs must've been successful.
-Yes.

1732
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,002
Would you like a drink, intern?

1733
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,471
-Intern.
-Yes, please, sir.

1734
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:26,308
I could see in his eyes
that he wanted some.

1735
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,243
RUNNING OVER

1736
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,412
You're the future of our business.

1737
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,181
The executive director will
pour one himself.

1738
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,683
-Gosh, Mr. Park.
-He's pouring a drink himself.

1739
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,286
PAT PAT

1740
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,921
IT'S FUN TO PLAY OFFICE

1741
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,122
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S
CUTTLEFISH MAPO TOFU FOR SOJU

1742
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,459
-It doesn't look too spicy.
-No.

1743
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,361
Risotto and <i>mapo </i>tofu.

1744
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,130
Mmm!

1745
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,167
He was already impressed.

1746
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:55,003
He knows how to drink.

1747
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:59,508
The cuttlefish in here is as good

1748
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,343
as red meat.

1749
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,214
-It may even be better.
-I'm used to eating ground red meat,

1750
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,684
but this is really new.
It's as good as red meat.

1751
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:09,785
The cuttlefish.

1752
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:13,489
He's saying the cuttlefish can be used
as a good replacement for red meat.

1753
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:17,893
The intern is drinking way too much today.

1754
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,330
Mr. Park is very pleased with him.

1755
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,198
And this dish is

1756
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:24,466
definitely dangerous.

1757
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,769
-I see.
-I see. It must make you crave drinks.

1758
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:31,073
-You can keep drinking forever.
-It makes you crave soju.

1759
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,309
Tofu and Sesame for <i>Makgeolli.</i>

1760
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,013
CHEF JI-SUN'S
TOFU AND SESAME FOR MAKGEOLLI

1761
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,184
What's wrong?

1762
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,719
-The sesame seeds.
-The sesame seeds.

1763
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,788
-They're on fire.
-They are.

1764
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,524
-The sesame seeds are on fire.
-It goes very well with tofu.

1765
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,759
-It's not too much.
-I thought it'd be too much.

1766
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,729
-She had to use that much for balance.
-The tofu can hold it.

1767
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,632
He just cut it into a piece.

1768
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,435
-It smells…
-That's a huge piece.

1769
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:00,602
It smells so good.

1770
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,772
He eats so well.

1771
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,043
Mmm!

1772
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,679
He's craving <i>makgeolli.</i>

1773
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,348
AMAZED AND DRINKING MAKGEOLLI

1774
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,584
He automatically makes that sound.

1775
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,488
-It's a perfect bar snack with <i>makgeolli.</i>
-I see.

1776
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,890
Write down which one you liked better.

1777
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,826
This is a part of his performance.

1778
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,795
Mr. Park is about to vote…
Why are you giving him signs?

1779
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:29,364
Mr. Park, you'll vote too.

1780
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:30,799
Mr. Park?

1781
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,268
Please stop giving him signs.

1782
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:35,037
<i>Press one for Choi Hyun-suk,</i>

1783
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,239
<i>and press two for Jung Ji-sun.</i>

1784
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,109
Please make your decision
and press the button!

1785
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,046
I'm very torn on this one.

1786
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:45,113
Did you press it?

1787
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,182
PRESSING

1788
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,785
He made his choice.

1789
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,254
Are you on the same page as Mr. Park?

1790
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,857
The intern chose

1791
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:56,892
Chef Ji-sun.

1792
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,862
He liked the <i>makgeolli</i> dish better.

1793
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,197
Let's find out the result.

1794
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,933
"I am a drinker." This was a huge match.

1795
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,035
Who did Byung-eun choose?

1796
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:11,139
Will Chef Ji-sun maintain
her win rate of 100%?

1797
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:16,111
Or will Chef Hyun-suk take his tenth star?

1798
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,980
Who's the winner

1799
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:20,415
of the round, "I am a drinker"?

1800
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,985
Who won?

1801
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,287
Who's the winner?

1802
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,222
JUNG JI-SUN WINS

1803
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,058
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S TOFU
AND SESAME FOR MAKGEOLLI WINS

1804
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,361
Chef Ji-sun wins!

1805
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,662
Five wins in a row.

1806
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,063
Five wins in a row?

1807
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,400
She's still undefeated,
a win rate of 100%.

1808
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,502
That's fire.

1809
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:45,741
If that dish stood alone
without an alcoholic drink,

1810
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:49,111
the result may have been different.

1811
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:52,281
There was a huge impact when I mixed

1812
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,383
<i>these two dishes together.</i>

1813
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:58,687
It was simple yet high in quality.
I could taste his experience in this.

1814
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,756
But one thing was this.

1815
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:03,191
I was supposed to have it with soju,

1816
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,461
so having rice with a drink was
a bit too heavy for me.

1817
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,330
-Yes, rice is too much.
-He probably thought

1818
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,300
I should protect my stomach and whatnot,

1819
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,435
but as Chef Ji-sun probably knows,
those who love to drink

1820
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:16,738
enjoy that burning sensation
on an empty stomach.

1821
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:20,142
The green onion kimchi
she added at the end

1822
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,743
added the sour flavor.

1823
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,415
It was like eating <i>makgeolli</i> with <i>jeon</i>
at a <i>jeon</i> restaurant.

1824
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,885
-May I say something, Executive Director?
-Yes?

1825
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,821
I believed you would become the next CEO

1826
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:36,024
and wanted to join your vision.

1827
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,595
But I do not appreciate
the team dinner culture in this company.

1828
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,430
Hence, I'd like to resign.

1829
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,799
He's sulking.

1830
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,101
-He's sulking.
-He became sulky.

1831
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,536
JOKING

1832
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,706
Please put a star on Chef Ji-sun.

1833
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,709
Byung-eun, please do that.

1834
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,477
Ji-sun wins all five rounds!

1835
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,913
Congratulations! You have five stars.

1836
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:58,981
I enjoyed your dish.

1837
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,515
STAY TUNED FOR NEXT WEEK'S FRIDGE
OWNERS, JIN OF BTS AND CHO SAE-HO

1838
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,918
Please welcome Jin of BTS!

1839
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:06,822
I'm Cho Sae-ho, and I'm just wide.

1840
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,423
I can't leave the bathroom
for three hours.

1841
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,526
I get to stare
at such a surreally handsome face.

1842
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,028
I cook rather often.

1843
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,162
I make kimchi.

1844
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,263
I've made <i>mulhoe</i>, cold raw fish soup.

1845
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,299
-Dongpo pork.
-At home?

1846
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,402
-Wait a second.
-Is that moldy?

1847
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,370
What is that?

1848
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,571
It must be at least six months old.

1849
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,206
-Come on.
-We can't use that.

1850
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,841
Is something going to pop out?

1851
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,309
It makes him more human.

1852
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:30,178
It's the sushi round
between two Western cuisine chefs.

1853
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,246
<i>-It'll be the best.</i>
<i>-That's cool.</i>

1854
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,314
That's Hyun-suk's artistry!

1855
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,483
-Hey!
-There it is!

1856
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:35,617
How many grains of rice does it have?

1857
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:36,918
What's going on?

1858
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,387
-It's pretty.
-It's just like his looks.

1859
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,522
-It's good-looking.
-It's so cool.

1860
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,290
<i>I'm a</i> mulhoe <i>human.</i>

1861
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:43,825
<i>I think I have the upper hand.</i>

1862
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,994
<i>This is a K-food round.</i>

1863
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,362
-What?
-Will it go well together?

1864
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:48,764
-What?
-What's he going to do?

1865
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,232
<i>I personally think it's too much.</i>

1866
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:52,267
What's it like?

1867
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,602
It's so good.

1868
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,740
I do this when I cook at home.

1869
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,276
-I do it like this.
-Right.

1870
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:16,425
