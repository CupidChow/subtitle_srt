1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,882
The classy cooking show has returned.

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,284
-<i>Chef & My Fridge</i>!
-<i>My Fridge</i>!

3
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,088
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHEFS

4
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,491
-The studio is crowded. Very crowded.
-It is.

5
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,327
-Things are bustling in here.
-That's right.

6
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,629
-There's a special reason for this.
-Ten people.

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,066
For the first time in this new season,
we'll make an attempt

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,001
to implement a team round.

9
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,170
-A team round?
-Yes, a team round.

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,507
We've formed two teams
to put together a fun match.

11
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,842
The first team of the team round is

12
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,011
Huntrix of Chinese cuisine,

13
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,713
Jung Ji-sun and Park Eun-yeong.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,150
A STRONG COMBINATION

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,052
They're a team?

16
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,188
The two will fight as a team today.

17
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,791
Up against them are

18
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,760
the heretics, the Sapa Boys,

19
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:05,031
Lim Tae-hun and Kim Poong.

20
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,800
Chinese versus Chinese.

21
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,135
They aren't the Saja Boys,
but the heretics, Sapa Boys.

22
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,137
It's a battle
between Chinese cuisine sects.

23
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,573
I get that Poong is a heretic,
but why Chef Tae-hun?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,009
I'm a heretic too.

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,078
-He's not associated with a sect.
-He isn't?

26
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,681
He isn't. He taught himself
and became a Chinese chef.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,850
He started off as a delivery boy
and worked his way up.

28
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,586
Please look forward to the team round.

29
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,289
It's time for us to present

30
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,991
our guests of the day, the fridge owners.

31
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:37,564
Two legendary K-pop boy groups are
ready to come out right now.

32
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,766
Here are the fridge owners!

33
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,769
WOW!

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,572
They're the K-Pop Mainstream Hunters.

35
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,740
Please welcome MARK and CHENLE of NCT

36
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,243
and Felix and Lee Know of Stray Kids!

37
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,212
REPRESENTING SM ENTERTAINMENT
AND JYP ENTERTAINMENT

38
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,847
WELCOME TO THE SHOW

39
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,281
-Hey.
-Two of them are here.

40
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,684
-To the world, this is NCT.
-To the world, this is NCT.

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,319
-Hello, we're NCT DREAM.
-Hello, we're NCT DREAM.

42
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,923
COOL GREETING
OKAY, WE'RE USING IT

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,091
That was so casual.

44
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,526
-One, two. Step out!
-Step out!

45
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,027
-Hello, we're Stray Kids.
-Hello, we're Stray Kids.

46
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,330
-All right!
-Welcome!

47
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,631
Thank you for inviting us.

48
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,799
Stray Kids!

49
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,601
We invited

50
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,103
the K-Pop Mainstream Hunters today.

51
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,973
-K-Pop Mainstream Hunters.
-Mainstream Hunters.

52
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,044
-MARK, you grew up in Canada, right?
-Yes.

53
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,947
-Felix, in Australia, correct?
-Yes.

54
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,418
-We also have many international viewers.
-We do.

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,954
-So please greet them in English.
-Here?

56
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,322
He's from Australia.

57
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,802
Listen to his deep voice.

58
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,804
I don't know what he said, but I like it.

59
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,941
Our guests today are from Canada,
Australia, and Shanghai, China.

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,677
Lee Know, which country are you from?

61
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,412
-America? United States?
-He looks too…

62
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,380
His name is Lee Know.

63
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,116
I'm from Daegot-myeon, Gimpo.

64
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,587
Can you say hi to our viewers
in the language you use in Gimpo?

65
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,856
-It's nearby.
-Say something in Gimpo's language.

66
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,958
-It's close by.
-Gimpo's famous for its rice.

67
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,595
Hello, I'm Lee Know of Stray Kids,
from Daegot-myeon, Gimpo.

68
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,764
It took me a long time
to be on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,633
so I look forward to eating
lots of delicious food by our chefs.

70
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,271
-It was so easy to understand.
-It was easy to listen to.

71
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,873
That's how they talk in Gimpo.

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,975
It's because I grew up eating Gimpo rice.

73
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,777
Are you four acquainted?

74
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,845
-Totally.
-You're totally acquainted?

75
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,416
The four of us
once went to play pool together.

76
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,817
-Really?
-The four of you?

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,252
-The four?
-Yes.

78
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,620
Who won?

79
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,256
-We did, right?
-MARK played very well back then.

80
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,757
-We probably won.
-I think so.

81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,327
MARK and CHENLE won.

82
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,995
-It's because they debuted first.
-That's nice.

83
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,230
Have you four dined together?

84
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,968
I once ate with CHENLE and MARK.

85
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,003
People get closer when they eat together.

86
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,706
-Don't you know that very well, Gimpo?
-Of course, I do.

87
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,975
-It's all about dining together.
-Gimpo would know.

88
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,545
We've invited the best chefs in Korea
just for you today,

89
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,014
and it's our first time
having ten chefs here at once.

90
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,049
We haven't eaten anything.

91
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,684
-No?
-We had zero breakfast.

92
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,152
We haven't had anything.

93
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,787
I'm so glad you came like that.

94
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,556
Are you all allowed to eat a lot today?

95
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,025
-Of course.
-I look forward to it.

96
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,294
We'll enjoy everything deliciously.

97
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,163
-We're ready to eat.
-You are? All right, then.

98
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,598
Your world tour is still ongoing.

99
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,667
We came back late last night.

100
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,470
I heard you two were
such huge fans of the show,

101
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,772
so you even changed your flight
and returned yesterday.

102
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,708
Yes, we took the flight
right after our schedule yesterday.

103
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,210
Because of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?

104
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,411
Of course.

105
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,714
-I mean, it's…
-I'm so grateful.

106
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,585
-CHENLE starred on my YouTube channel.
-We filmed something together.

107
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,121
-And he really loves the show a lot…
-He's right.

108
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,625
…so he'd take pictures of him
watching the show and text them to me.

109
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,893
-CHENLE.
-He does that.

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,461
Are you an avid fan of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?

111
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,796
I really love the show.

112
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,666
-You must be interested in cooking.
-I love to cook.

113
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,001
I always loved to cook,

114
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:06,205
so I watched the show every week
when it aired, whenever I had enough time.

115
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,640
-I see.
-He looks serious.

116
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,975
-Seriously.
-What about you, MARK?

117
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,311
I hang out at his place often,

118
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:15,481
and I also became a fan
because he always had it playing on TV.

119
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,851
-I see. So CHENLE got you hooked?
-That's right.

120
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,720
-That's the case.
-I see.

121
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,656
I also saw that
you sent a DM to one of the chefs.

122
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,591
Yes, it was Chef Hyun-suk.

123
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,327
-You sent him a message?
-Yes.

124
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,429
He sent me a DM and said

125
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,898
he really enjoyed the show
and wanted to be a friend.

126
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,168
So I gave him my number,
and we began to text each other.

127
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,070
That was when everything began.

128
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,072
-I bothered him often.
-You send each other messages?

129
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,109
-He'd even text me at 5 a.m.
-At 5 a.m.?

130
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,244
He texts me at around 3 to 4 a.m.

131
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,813
So he can't hold his curiosity.

132
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,814
I thought about it

133
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,450
and realized it was the time difference
when he was in the UK.

134
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,218
He kept texting me during his daytime.

135
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,186
TUNED TO HIMSELF

136
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,455
-One day…
-He can get the time confused.

137
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,190
At first, it began with <i>vongole</i>.

138
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,559
He asked me for the recipe,
so I gave him a few tips.

139
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:04,497
When he's done, he sends me a photo
to ask me for feedback,

140
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,932
-and it wasn't so bad.
-He's serious.

141
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,266
What's more is that

142
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,969
he asks me more questions
than my staff at the restaurant.

143
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,140
So I decided to make him my apprentice.

144
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,843
-Is that so?
-Thank you.

145
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,444
Yes, but the thing is,

146
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,047
I want to start speaking casually with him
and relax a little.

147
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,749
I'd love to do that.

148
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,017
Please stop sending me texts
after midnight.

149
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,054
But, Chef… Here's the thing.

150
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,256
I had told him today

151
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,892
that I was sorry
for bothering him way too often.

152
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,563
But he said he kept the sound off,
so I could feel free to keep texting him.

153
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,866
I didn't think you'd feel that free.

154
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,536
He felt a little too much freedom.
A bit too much.

155
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,972
Actually, before we came to the show,
he told me that

156
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,909
-he wanted every chef's number today.
-No wonder.

157
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,744
He had it all planned out.

158
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,648
CHENLE isn't just a fan,
but is more of a zealot.

159
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,151
-He's serious about cooking.
-He really does go that far.

160
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:02,789
And now, let's go through
MARK and CHENLE's fridge.

161
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,957
Do you live in a dorm right now?

162
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,526
-We live separately.
-You do?

163
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,060
I live with my family.

164
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,197
I had lived in Korea with my mom,

165
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,932
but I live alone now.

166
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,701
But I see only one fridge here today.

167
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,504
-I don't keep too much food at home.
-Do you have something, though?

168
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,339
-I kind of do.
-You kind of do?

169
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,074
So it's a combination of two fridges,

170
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,343
-but it mostly belongs to CHENLE?
-To CHENLE?

171
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,712
-Very much so.
-Very much so, I see.

172
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,314
EMBARRASSED

173
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,682
This is the moment of truth.

174
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,917
HOW MUCH SPACE DID CHENLE TAKE UP?

175
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,819
MARK and CHENLE of NCT.

176
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,887
What do they eat at home?

177
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,924
-Let us present their fridge.
-Their fridge.

178
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,460
It's like I'm watching TV.

179
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,330
ARE THE CHEFS IMPRESSED?

180
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,166
Whoa. Look at this.

181
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,869
-That's a lot.
-Gosh, you have a lot of stuff.

182
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,270
A FULL FRIDGE

183
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:55,308
-We don't know which ones belong to whom.
-Not yet.

184
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,976
The top shelf belongs to MARK.

185
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,511
The top shelf?

186
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,048
The top shelf?
Are you talking about these three?

187
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,282
That's right.

188
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,752
I did my best to prepare
those three containers on the top.

189
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,988
-All he has are these three.
-That's it?

190
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,159
The production crew went to CHENLE's home…
Was it the day before?

191
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,827
-Yesterday.
-They went there yesterday,

192
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,496
but what they told me was,

193
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,898
"You can probably bring your food
directly to the studio."

194
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,633
CHEF & BRINGING MY OWN FRIDGE

195
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,768
So I got them from my fridge today.

196
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,003
You did?

197
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,873
So this morning, MARK opened his fridge,

198
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,343
pulled out one, two, three containers,
and brought them here today.

199
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,079
These are the ingredients
from MARK's fridge.

200
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,314
But you must have
something else in the freezer.

201
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,618
-The chicken on the upper left shelf.
-The upper left shelf.

202
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,686
-Just this one?
-This one?

203
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,123
He brought these four items himself.

204
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,493
These belong to MARK,
and everything else belongs to CHENLE.

205
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,596
CHENLE had too many ingredients
in his fridge,

206
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,999
so MARK yielded the space to him.

207
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,502
Anyway, let's take a look at these first
before we continue.

208
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,371
These are from MARK's home.

209
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,807
Let me clarify that
he selected these very carefully.

210
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,975
My favorite side dish is

211
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,911
-seasoned cucumber pickles.
-Oh, this one?

212
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,780
-I actually finished a batch recently,
-Oh, cucumber pickles.

213
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,816
so my mom made this yesterday night.

214
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,151
You must like this a lot.

215
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,353
My mom said it tastes better

216
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,122
after you let it sit for a while.

217
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,090
-She's right.
-Yes, it needs some time.

218
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,660
She asked me to share that on the show.

219
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,094
WHAT A WONDERFUL SON

220
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,563
-How do you eat these?
-These.

221
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,901
My mom always made fried chicken at home
since I was a child.

222
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,205
So this is an ingredient
we always have to keep at home.

223
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,807
You always have to have chicken.

224
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,910
-Yes, it's soul food for me.
-It's not that easy to make.

225
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,148
That was everything from MARK's fridge.

226
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,583
Those were MARK's ingredients.

227
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,117
Remember to take these home yourself.

228
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,586
Yes, all right.

229
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,188
We can't deliver these for you.

230
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,058
Everything starting here is
ingredients from CHENLE's fridge.

231
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,127
Most K-pop idol members
usually have a lot of delivery food,

232
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,229
but he doesn't have anything like that.

233
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,931
I never order delivery food at home.

234
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,200
-Do you cook everything?
-That's so amazing.

235
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,370
It's much healthier for me to cook
than to eat something I order.

236
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,807
And you've even made your own lunch boxes?

237
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,708
I have.

238
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,610
-Lunch boxes?
-Have you tried it, MARK?

239
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,879
-He brought that chicken…
-Do you know what Hainan chicken rice is?

240
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,014
Hainan?

241
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,351
-Chicken rice is a famous Asian dish,
-Yes, chicken rice.

242
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,821
made with rice cooked in chicken broth.

243
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:26,125
And I prepared enough chicken
to share with my members.

244
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,694
He brought it
when we practiced for our concert.

245
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,430
So he's just super diligent.

246
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,300
What's this?
He put something in this tiny container.

247
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,401
-Huh?
-What's that?

248
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,802
-Green onion? Parsley.
-Parsley.

249
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,973
That's what I use
to make Chef Hyun-suk's <i>vongole</i>.

250
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,744
-Dried parsley doesn't smell as fragrant.
-It doesn't.

251
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,946
Not many households keep

252
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,681
-chopped fresh parsley at home.
-No.

253
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,915
You only see it at restaurants.

254
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,351
You're right. Yes.

255
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,254
And what's next? Look what's here.

256
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,590
-Mushrooms.
-He has all kinds of mushrooms.

257
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,892
-I really love mushrooms.
-You like mushrooms?

258
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,260
I have a lot at room temperature.

259
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,929
These are all mushrooms too.

260
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,066
-You owe us an explanation, CHENLE.
-Can you tell us?

261
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,270
These have great textures,
and they're just fragrant enough.

262
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,505
What's this?

263
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,974
This is my favorite mushroom.

264
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,076
These are bamboo mushrooms.

265
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,678
You have to soak them first,

266
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,580
-and I have those over there.
-You do? The soaked mushrooms?

267
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,716
He can cook with bamboo mushrooms?
That's amazing.

268
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,818
I'm amazed he even knows what it is.

269
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,155
It's often used in medicinal cooking
in Chinese cuisine.

270
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,423
Do you also like mushrooms, MARK?

271
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,125
I don't like them
as much as CHENLE does, but…

272
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,494
-He does.
-I do.

273
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,629
-You do?
-What's wrong?

274
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,330
Just now, he…

275
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,832
"I don't like them
as much as CHENLE does, but…"

276
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,067
"He does!"

277
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,768
SO DOES HE OR DOESN'T HE?

278
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,337
I already know what he likes.

279
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,173
Even after he says
he doesn't like something,

280
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,942
if I secretly throw it into a dish
and make it delicious, he'll enjoy it.

281
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,777
Well, as long as it's delicious.

282
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,614
-He's right.
-If it's delicious, anyone will eat it.

283
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,349
Do any of these belong to MARK?

284
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,785
The thing is, what's his is mine.

285
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,053
MY FRIDGE IS YOUR FRIDGE

286
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,321
What's his is as good as mine.

287
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,924
He cooks for me very often,

288
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,194
so I personally thought
his fridge was as good as mine.

289
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,162
That could be the case.

290
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,431
What do you do while CHENLE cooks?

291
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,334
-He has the most important job.
-What's most important?

292
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,437
-Doing the dishes.
-The dishes?

293
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,172
-I make them spick-and-span.
-I see.

294
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,941
I cook for him the most often.

295
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,276
He has to earn his keep, right?

296
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,079
-You don't even get paid.
-He did the dishes, but a problem came up.

297
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,549
-He broke my favorite wine glass.
-While doing the dishes?

298
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,120
-I guess he wasn't used to it.
-So I told him,

299
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,322
"You have to do my dishes
for the rest of your life."

300
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,925
"Since you destroyed my wine glass."

301
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,129
-So he had to do it for over a year.
-It must've become a habit.

302
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,198
Then one day,
I began to feel sorry for him.

303
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,336
So I said, "You can stop doing the dishes.
I'll manage from now on."

304
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,073
-But he had to finish what he was doing.
-The last dishes.

305
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,308
While he finished up,
he broke another wine glass.

306
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,578
That thing is way too thin!

307
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,780
The glass was too thin.

308
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,915
-Did you grab it hard?
-I swear that I didn't.

309
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,316
You didn't, yet it broke?

310
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,118
I'm dead serious.

311
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,755
I said, "You'll have to do the dishes
at my place for the rest of your life."

312
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,257
I see there was a backstory.

313
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,925
-It's kind of unfair for MARK.
-He did his best.

314
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,995
But he really liked those glasses, so…

315
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,164
-He has lots of vegetables.
-Vegetables.

316
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,166
He has many different kinds.

317
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,333
Do you enjoy vegetables?

318
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,602
-I love them.
-You love them?

319
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,871
And to the door bins.

320
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,008
-I can see some Chinese ingredients.
-You're right.

321
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,911
He has almost all the ingredients
a Chinese restaurant would keep.

322
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,380
-Can you tell us about these, CHENLE?
-May I?

323
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,048
Please stand here.

324
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,784
-This is <i>doubanjiang</i>.
-<i>Doubanjiang</i>.

325
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,987
-Hot pot sauce.
-This is a hot sauce from Haidilao.

326
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,059
-This is often used in Chinese cuisine.
-<i>Huangdoujiang</i>?

327
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,696
-This is lard, right? It's lard.
-Pig fat.

328
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,731
You gotta deep-fry using that.

329
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:56,569
-I use this to make pasta.
-Anchovies?

330
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,705
-There are so many.
-And that's about all for the sauces.

331
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,240
Let's look at the freezer.

332
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,943
-The rest of his ingredients.
-This is the highlight.

333
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,077
-The highlight?
-What's this?

334
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,848
Oh, this is Chef Hyun-suk's product,

335
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,050
spaghetti <i>vongole</i> meal kit.

336
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,054
Was there a special deal between you two?
There are way too many of these in here.

337
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,288
Actually,

338
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,392
I've been eating those
way before I first contacted him.

339
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,895
I can tell by the way
he keeps those in his freezer

340
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,730
-that he knows what good food is.
-Right.

341
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,466
Perhaps CHENLE and my encounter

342
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,735
was already written in the stars.

343
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,637
TOUCHED

344
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,740
-I found some beef.
-He has lots of meat.

345
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,909
Yes, he does. This is pork.

346
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,111
My gosh. He has crab too.

347
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,614
-I have seafood.
-He has lots of seafood too.

348
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,115
-My gosh.
-Blue crabs.

349
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,217
These are so neatly organized.

350
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,053
Sometimes I make Cantonese seafood congee,

351
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,589
and I need to throw in
lots of seafood to make that.

352
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,158
-Seafood congee?
-Seafood congee.

353
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,729
That was all for MARK and CHENLE's fridge.

354
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,797
The ingredients are the most unique yet.

355
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,701
Now, let's find out
what these two have ordered.

356
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,437
Please show us their orders.

357
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,440
What do MARK and CHENLE want to eat?

358
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,242
Both orders came out at once.

359
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,311
K-food pasta hunters

360
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,114
and K-food Chinese cuisine hunters.

361
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,116
Okay, those are the orders.

362
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,551
-KCH.
-KPH and KCH.

363
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,654
The line for Chinese food
has already been decided.

364
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,689
That's the Chinese cuisine team round,

365
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,659
so Ji-sun, Eun-yeong,
Poong, and Tae-hun are up.

366
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,028
That round is already sealed.

367
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,332
And now, we need someone to take
K-food pasta hunters.

368
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,501
First of all, we both love noodles,

369
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,870
and even when we're on a world tour,

370
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,505
we always end up getting pasta.

371
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,942
If you make us
a globally phenomenal pasta dish,

372
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,277
we'll eat it with lots of gratitude.

373
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,381
In that case,
we have a few chefs in the pasta industry.

374
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,451
It looks like I need to take that round.

375
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,387
They wanted to eat
globally phenomenal pasta,

376
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,256
-so I'll have to do it.
-You?

377
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,192
GIGGLE

378
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,027
Isn't Sam also famous for his pasta?

379
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,762
-Yes, it's Sam.
-Sam should go.

380
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,264
-Well, now--
-I'll go.

381
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,999
Sam is up!

382
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,801
-I knew it.
-He thought about it.

383
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,470
It probably wasn't easy
for him to take up that round

384
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,772
after Hyun-suk decided to go for it.

385
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,375
Sam wants to get Hyun-suk
with a pasta dish.

386
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,212
Then let us begin the 15-minute cook-off!

387
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,353
This is the first round
with ingredients from the fridge

388
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,555
provided by MARK and CHENLE of NCT.

389
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,391
They're about to fill the order titled
K-food pasta hunters.

390
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,327
The battle is between
the historical rivals of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,

391
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,364
Chef Choi Hyun-suk aka Crazy Penne

392
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,967
and Chef Sam Kim aka Pasta Madman.

393
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,838
Many people are reminded of Sam
when they think of pasta.

394
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,973
He became a celebrity chef
thanks to the drama Pasta…

395
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,641
-Yes.
-…and you've been doing this

396
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,910
for over 20 years now, I believe.

397
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,279
-About 25 years.
-It's been 25 years.

398
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,347
That's amazing.

399
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,685
He's been making pasta
since before CHENLE was born.

400
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,554
This match may be
disadvantageous for Sam, don't you think?

401
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,956
From CHENLE's perspective,

402
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,793
Hyun-suk is a guy who replies to his texts
even at 5 a.m.

403
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,828
If you don't give him a star today,

404
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,164
-he may leave the chat.
-You're right. That's possible.

405
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,266
-He holds grudges.
-Yes.

406
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,136
I can be available around the clock.

407
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,472
READY FOR CHENLE AT ALL TIMES

408
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,175
-I'm moved.
-You complained that he texts you late,

409
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,110
but Sam's ready around the clock.

410
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,712
He'll even call him.

411
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,114
-May I say something to CHENLE?
-Sure.

412
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,315
CHENLE.

413
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,018
You're more serious about cooking
than anyone I know.

414
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,922
Don't mind our friendship
and please make an unbiased decision.

415
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,791
You're scaring him even more.

416
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,994
What you're doing
is totally pressuring him.

417
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,497
How is he supposed to judge now
after you gave him those eyes?

418
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,367
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS:
PRAWN, CRAB, SCALLOP, SPINACH, MILK

419
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,502
CREAM CHEESE, BUTTER,
WHOLE TOMATO, HONTSUYU, PREMIUM SALT

420
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,272
You're up first, Chef Hyun-suk.
What are you making?

421
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,640
My dish is titled

422
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,041
World-Class Pasta Dream.

423
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,211
-World-Class Pasta Dream.
-World-Class Pasta Dream.

424
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,880
NCT DREAM is a world-renowned group,

425
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,883
-so I want to make bisque cream <i>trofie</i>.
-<i>Trofie</i>.

426
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,686
It takes forever to make bisque,

427
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:12,057
but I'll make a seafood cream
full of flavor in 15 minutes,

428
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,027
and make green water with spinach

429
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,031
to make a special pasta called <i>trofie</i>
from scratch.

430
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,332
What's <i>trofie</i>?

431
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,900
It's short fresh pasta

432
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,336
-shaped like screws. You press it out.
-Like screws?

433
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,408
-So you'll make fresh pasta?
-Have you ever seen me use pre-made pasta?

434
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,744
-I have.
-I've seen you do it.

435
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,780
-He uses it often.
-A few times. Quite a lot.

436
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,515
-You've done that often.
-Yes.

437
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,350
-He used it often.
-He did.

438
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,385
-I've seen it a lot.
-We don't see fresh pasta often.

439
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,255
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS: SPAGHETTI,
ANCHOVY FILLETS, SHRIMP, CRAB, VENUS CLAM

440
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,390
MUSSEL, ABALONE, ZUCCHINI, PEPERONCINO,
CHERRY TOMATOES, PARSLEY, LEMON JUICE

441
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,326
I prepared a dish called

442
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,928
It's here, it's here. Pasta Czennie Here.

443
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,765
-It's here, it's here. Pasta Czennie Here.
-It's here, it's here. Pasta Czennie Here.

444
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,836
-NCT's fandom is nicknamed Czennie.
-That's right. They're Czennie.

445
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,572
-That's amazing.
-So I named it Pasta Czennie Here.

446
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,841
May I modify the title of my dish?

447
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,043
You want to change its name?

448
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,946
-It was okay.
-It's here, it's here. World-Class Pasta.

449
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,184
It's way too late.

450
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,920
-The key was Czennie, not "It's here."
-It was Czennie.

451
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,855
He called it Czennie.

452
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,692
-Is this for real?
-He didn't know any better.

453
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,562
The dish I'll make is
something rather simple.

454
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,697
It's a seafood pasta

455
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,967
served with a bit of veggies.

456
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,136
It's a nutritious and savory dish,

457
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,473
so I'll make that for you today.

458
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,475
-All right.
-Are you using dried pasta?

459
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,244
-I'm using dried pasta.
-Dried pasta.

460
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,380
Fresh pasta isn't always good.

461
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,348
Yes, that's true.

462
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,685
He already had dried pasta
as a go-to safety net.

463
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:50,189
The winning chef will get a star

464
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:54,459
and the gold bar edition of SPAM
to celebrate the upcoming holidays.

465
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,862
I want that.

466
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,597
There's a prize at stake,

467
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,865
-so please decide fairly.
-All right.

468
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,000
-Please make a wise decision.
-Okay. Yes.

469
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,268
All right.

470
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,805
Let us begin the round
titled K-food pasta hunters.

471
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,944
He's here to take down Sam Kim,
the original celebrity pasta chef,

472
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,013
Chef Choi Hyun-suk
aka the canine tooth hunter.

473
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,617
But this man right here will
shut Choi Hyun-suk's mouth for good today.

474
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,721
Chef Sam Kim aka the show-off hunter.

475
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,423
Who'll rise as the winner

476
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,259
in this round between pasta experts?

477
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,828
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

478
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,898
Hoo!

479
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,433
It's a pasta round.

480
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,002
You have exactly 15 minutes.

481
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,303
Begin!

482
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,539
LET US BEGIN

483
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,676
SEPARATING PRAWN HEADS

484
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,979
-You have exactly 15 minutes.
-The prawn first. How amazing.

485
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,816
That's how much time you have
to prepare the ingredients and serve.

486
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,984
DESTROYING MERCILESSLY

487
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,120
He has to make bisque.

488
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,822
What are you roasting, Chef Hyun-suk?

489
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,490
Crab and shrimp.

490
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,360
-Crab and shrimp?
-Into the oven?

491
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,795
-In the oven?
-In the oven?

492
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,199
Wait, it's crooked!
Hyun-suk, it didn't go in right.

493
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,533
I just saved you.

494
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,336
SUPER PATRONIZING

495
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,072
He's actually listening to Poong.

496
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,142
He used to ignore everything Poong said.

497
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,378
You end up listening to him.

498
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,813
WHAT ABOUT CHEF CANINE TOOTH?

499
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,583
He's using dried pasta.

500
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,687
You'll have more free time
by using dried pasta instead of fresh.

501
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,890
Chef Sam, are you using anchovies?

502
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,258
Yes, I am.

503
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,761
WOW

504
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,630
Sam is the one to go to
when it comes to anchovies.

505
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,734
Sam quickly takes the upper hand.

506
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,003
It's been a minute already.

507
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,471
It's been a minute already. Yes.

508
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,106
Time really flies.

509
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,010
-Spinach.
-He said he'd use it to color the pasta.

510
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,945
1. PARBOIL SPINACH AND COOL IN COLD WATER

511
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,082
He'll color the pasta with spinach, right?

512
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,617
He parboiled the spinach.

513
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,286
-Spinach will give it a nice color.
-Right.

514
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,788
Yes, and it's good for you.

515
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,757
We'll get to see traditional Italian pasta

516
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,226
-called <i>trofie</i>.
-<i>Trofie</i>.

517
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,163
-Things are going so smoothly over here.
-Yes.

518
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,700
2. BOIL OLIVE OIL, CRUSHED GARLIC,
PARSLEY, VENUS CLAM, AND WATER

519
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,968
-Clams. Venus clams?
-Venus clams.

520
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,237
TUTTING

521
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,574
Chef Sam cuts shrimp.

522
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,577
Both chefs are using seafood.

523
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,946
He cuts some abalone on the other side.

524
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,449
Chef Sam is using abalone, shrimp,
and what else?

525
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,684
He's cooking abalone, shrimp, and clam.

526
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,919
STIR-FRYING CHOPPED SEAFOOD

527
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,721
You know what? That looks good.

528
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,856
WHAT ABOUT HYUN-SUK?

529
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,126
-And the spinach.
-The color looks good and vibrant.

530
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,762
-Good color. Now mixing it with starch.
-It's pretty.

531
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,931
The mix is important.

532
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,434
-Oh, yes.
-His performance.

533
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,070
HE MISSES EVERYTHING

534
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,307
He didn't have to do that,
but he chose to.

535
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,142
I want to learn to do those things.

536
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,543
-You want to learn that?
-Right.

537
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,480
-It's important for us.
-Performances are key for idol stars.

538
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,981
You hate doing the dishes, right?

539
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,516
-Right.
-Then don't learn that.

540
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,885
-MARK will clean it up for me.
-Right. He will.

541
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,253
You have MARK.

542
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,722
HOWEVER…

543
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,025
The dough won't mix.

544
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,696
-It's an emergency.
-The top doesn't fit.

545
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,532
-No! It's an emergency.
-Put the top on again.

546
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,668
-It's not working.
-Oh, no!

547
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,337
PANIC

548
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,707
-This looks really bad.
-No, it's okay.

549
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,575
No, the dough isn't moving.

550
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,611
-It won't?
-Get your hands in there.

551
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,714
-Use your hands!
-They'll end up eating raw pasta.

552
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,616
At this rate, you'll eat raw pasta.

553
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,520
-He'll have to knead it himself, then.
-There's no other way.

554
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,489
Chef Hyun-suk
handles the situation quickly.

555
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,291
I'm getting anxious.

556
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,960
THE SHADOW OF DEFEAT LOOMS OVER HIM

557
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,329
He quickly fixes the situation.

558
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,131
BEGONE!

559
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,733
-He's…
-All right!

560
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,135
WARDS OFF THE SHADOW WITH FLOUR

561
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,337
-He still finds moments to do that.
-Quite amazing.

562
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,873
DEEPLY MOVED…

563
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,642
Hyun-suk is falling behind a little

564
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,378
after facing an unexpected situation.

565
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,880
-This makes the spectators nervous too.
-Right?

566
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,451
HE BEGINS TO MAKE TROFIE!

567
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,287
I see. He has to press it with his hand.

568
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,123
That's how it's done? In that shape?

569
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,891
HE MAKES THE SPIRAL SHAPE WITH HIS HAND

570
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,360
He doesn't just roll it.
Watch what he does at the end.

571
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,628
MISSES

572
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,264
PRETENDING LIKE IT WENT WELL

573
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,267
Didn't we use to do that as kids
while erasing some pencil marks?

574
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,669
-Eraser bits!
-Yes.

575
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,838
-Yes, they look like eraser bits.
-Yes, eraser bits.

576
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,574
-He's making the shapes.
-So this is the eraser bit pasta.

577
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,909
How many of those does he have to make?

578
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,478
It doesn't look so…

579
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,080
-He retries when the shape isn't right.
-It didn't work.

580
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,050
-They only have ten minutes.
-You'll have to make a lot for two.

581
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,551
That takes forever.

582
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,886
Will you be quiet?

583
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,254
You're failing to make the shapes!

584
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,490
-It's an emergency.
-You're in trouble.

585
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,427
-To us, those shapes look all the same.
-He's in trouble.

586
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,330
He's having a bit of trouble.

587
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,732
-My goodness. Look at that.
-It came undone.

588
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,768
You're going to make the pasta salty.

589
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,070
Can you stop rubbing that?

590
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,206
-It'll taste too salty!
-It's taking way too long.

591
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,475
It'll take you forever
to do that with your hands.

592
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,211
He begins to make those half-heartedly.

593
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,847
He gets sloppy after a few strands.

594
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,682
Things are looking hectic.

595
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,451
-That's way too sloppy.
-Right?

596
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,152
THIS IS HILARIOUS

597
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,755
-The shapes aren't coming out.
-It's coming apart.

598
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,157
-This doesn't look easy.
-Goodness.

599
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,692
-It's not easy.
-Hyun-suk's in trouble.

600
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,029
-Dried pasta is always the best choice.
-Right.

601
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,565
Hyun-suk is in a tough spot,

602
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,136
but Sam isn't bothered.
He even looks serene.

603
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,372
That's Chef Sam for you.

604
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:45,076
He'll have more time
because he's using dried pasta.

605
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,778
-Everything is so smooth.
-He's relaxed.

606
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,714
-He's back to himself as a saint.
-That's right.

607
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,184
-That looks so good.
-Hyun-suk is in a tough spot,

608
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,153
while Sam cooks as a naturalist.

609
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,088
He's using lots of vegetables.

610
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,523
-That looks good.
-Zucchinis look so good.

611
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,093
-This isn't easy.
-You have ten minutes left.

612
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,728
-What is this?
-You don't have much time!

613
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,663
What is this?

614
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,664
FAILS AGAIN…

615
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,433
-Isn't that way too hard?
-Sam isn't bothered.

616
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,201
Why did he want to make fresh pasta?

617
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,871
That's hard to do.

618
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,539
It's hard to make the screw shapes.

619
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,941
But the color is so nice.

620
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,876
-Chef Hyun-suk!
-Yes?

621
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,278
I don't think
it's too late to use dried pasta.

622
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,179
Sam.

623
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,048
WHAT?

624
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,215
Do you have extra dried pasta?

625
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,519
DRIED PASTA URGENTLY WANTED

626
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,521
Right here.

627
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,289
I'LL LEAVE IT HERE

628
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,058
…DISPIRITED CHUCKLE

629
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,126
"Right here."

630
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,895
Or do you want me to cook some

631
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,296
and share it with you?

632
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,432
THE PASTA GAP IS HUGE

633
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,534
You don't have enough time.

634
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,037
-So those are noodles, right?
-Yeah.

635
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,907
-Then it's too…
-Is the dough too wet?

636
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,041
You have to cook for two.

637
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,209
It's such a shame.

638
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,478
Should he have kept it
in the blender a bit longer?

639
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,846
No, everything is going well!

640
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,348
HE'S MAD

641
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,283
WE'RE ONLY TRYING TO HELP

642
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,218
We were just worried. Jeez.

643
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,754
Things are going perfectly fine.
What's with all of you?

644
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,090
ALL RIGHT

645
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,825
We're all here to cook pleasantly.

646
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,793
-Why are you getting mad?
-He's sensitive.

647
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,795
WHAT ABOUT SAM, WHO ISN'T SENSITIVE?

648
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,431
Sam's using zucchini.

649
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,266
-Zucchini.
-He's showing a smile too.

650
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,669
It looks like he knows he'll win today.

651
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,305
No way. It's not like that.

652
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,740
-No way.
-"This week, I win."

653
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,110
I went up there
to see the ingredients they picked out,

654
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,812
and Chef Sam told me
his dish will be really delicious.

655
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,016
-He told you ahead.
-He even touted?

656
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,884
Gosh, Sam.

657
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,853
-That's so cool.
-You even touted.

658
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,855
-You said it'll be delicious.
-It'll be delicious today.

659
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,191
-He's adding the broth.
-It does look good.

660
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,794
-It looks so good.
-He uses the broth.

661
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,764
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds left.

662
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,666
You're halfway there,

663
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,702
-He's wasting his time making pasta.
-exactly half of your time.

664
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,837
He's been making pasta for five minutes.
What now?

665
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,573
I got this.

666
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,042
When will you cook the pasta?

667
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,344
-It won't take long.
-It'll take 30 seconds.

668
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,780
That's true, but he hasn't made the sauce.

669
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,416
-He's been doing that for five minutes.
-Exactly.

670
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,284
You have to stop. That's enough.

671
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,053
That must hurt his palms.

672
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,055
He's slowly losing his fingerprints.

673
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,323
His palms might be bleeding.

674
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,992
-He's smooshing it.
-The board is splitting.

675
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,694
HALF WORRIED, HALF TEASING

676
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,497
But he continues until the very end.

677
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,399
So what he's making is from Italy?

678
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,300
Right?

679
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,236
-The shape is called <i>trofie</i>.
-<i>Trofie</i>?

680
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,072
THESE TWO ARE CHATTING IN ENGLISH

681
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,808
He only has six minutes, though.

682
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,477
Sam continues to make his dish.

683
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,280
He's sailing smoothly.

684
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,848
-He keeps checking the time.
-Yes.

685
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,718
Wow. Sam Kim. Wow.

686
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,155
5. CHOP GRILLED ZUCCHINI PIECES

687
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,790
Look at those. They look good.

688
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,992
CHOPPING FRESH PARSLEY

689
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,129
Sam's broth looks really good.

690
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,697
-It looks so good.
-Doesn't it?

691
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:57,068
-He made it with Venus clam broth.
-He used Venus clams.

692
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,105
-Venus clam broth.
-I can smell it from here.

693
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,906
He's finally making the sauce.

694
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,541
That's cream.

695
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,642
He's using cream.

696
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,179
It looks like Chef Hyun-suk
doesn't have enough time on his hands.

697
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,282
PULLING THE ROASTED SHELLFISH OUT

698
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,017
They look golden brown. Not bad.

699
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,288
-They're too hot!
-He throws them into the pot.

700
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:18,790
It went into the broth.

701
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,692
Is he using the broth? What's he doing?

702
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,494
-Is he making broth?
-He is.

703
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,165
-He can't even answer you right now.
-It's still hot.

704
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,901
-Oh, no.
-He's making a mess.

705
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,705
He wouldn't have breathed
so heavily before,

706
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,340
but he's staggering now.

707
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,541
HURT

708
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,576
-Staggering?
-Was that too much?

709
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,378
-Toddling.
-He's toddling.

710
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,780
WHOLE TOMATOES

711
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,648
-Tomatoes?
-Tomatoes.

712
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,316
That looks so good.

713
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,384
It smells so good.

714
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,419
Five minutes. They have five minutes left.

715
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,488
-Five minutes!
-Sung-ju!

716
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,157
Please report from the kitchen.

717
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,625
Yes, I'll go out there.

718
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,194
Hyun-suk is at a serious disadvantage.

719
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,062
You have 4 minutes and 30 seconds left.

720
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,399
CHENLE said this soup looked really good.

721
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,301
It's this soup, right?

722
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,470
He begins to throw the pasta in.

723
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,172
-It looks good.
-He puts the pasta in

724
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,239
after pulling them out.

725
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,010
He begins to throw the pasta in.

726
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,044
DANG IT!

727
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,879
HEIGHTENED INTEREST
WHAT'S GOING ON?

728
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,582
ONE MORE TIME!

729
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,918
GOT HIM(?)

730
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,019
REVENGE FOR "TODDLING"

731
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,387
He just threw flour around.

732
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,855
I'M NOT OLD

733
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,057
I'M GOLDEN!

734
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,793
He sprinkles flour around

735
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,328
and begins to cook the pasta.

736
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,964
He's now working with the noodles.

737
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,567
I want to know what the soup is like.

738
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,801
Can you try the sauce?

739
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,369
-May I?
-Please.

740
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,270
All right.

741
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,471
HOW'S THE SAUCE?

742
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,974
Is it really pasta season?

743
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,909
Is it really pasta season?

744
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,946
Goodness. It tastes a bit too salty.

745
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,715
-It's a bit salty.
-You have to eat it with the pasta.

746
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,984
-Right.
-I don't trust you anymore.

747
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,519
-You don't?
-No.

748
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,020
WHY WON'T YOU TRUST ME?

749
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,021
Never.

750
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,057
SAINT SAM:
"WON'T TRUST SUNG-JU'S REVIEW AGAIN"

751
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,326
He won't trust you.
He has his own convictions.

752
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,194
You didn't lose because of me.

753
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,231
I'm just sharing my thoughts.
It was salty, so I said it was.

754
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,333
Would I do that if it were sweet?

755
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,469
Yes, stick to your convictions.

756
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,104
He's now showing his canine tooth.

757
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,839
-Did he?
-Yes.

758
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,942
-Do you have beef with me, Sam?
-No.

759
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,345
SUPER HILARIOUS TO WATCH

760
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:24,082
Well, it was too salty for my taste,
but he must have a reason.

761
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,017
HE'S MAKING SAUCE IN SOLITUDE

762
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,919
Scallops.

763
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,154
POURING THE CREAM SAUCE

764
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,056
BUTTER, HONTSUYU

765
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,858
AND…

766
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,126
SALT!

767
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,230
NO ONE IS WATCHING, YET HE DOES HIS BEST…

768
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,000
He's hilarious.

769
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,835
And this side.

770
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,670
What's this? Look at the color!

771
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,305
LOVING IT, GIGGLING

772
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,407
I CAN DO IT WITH BOTH ARMS

773
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,175
What are you doing?

774
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,477
I WON'T FORGET TO PUT ON A SHOW!

775
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,079
-What was that?
-He did it with both arms.

776
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,348
What happened to your shoulders?

777
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,450
Are they frozen?
Your arms didn't go up much.

778
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,452
-The angles are softer.
-They used to go all the way up.

779
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,221
BUT HE MAKES THEM LAUGH

780
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,822
What's going on with him today?

781
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,525
Let me try this sauce.

782
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,693
Chef Hyun-suk's sauce.

783
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,562
Is his sauce world-class?

784
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,364
Is his sauce world-class?

785
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,668
-This is a little too bland for me.
-Is it?

786
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,303
It's a bit bland.

787
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,738
Let me try this soup.

788
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,740
This one. The white one.

789
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,809
That one looks so good.

790
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,912
It's a bit bland for me. Is that okay?

791
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,781
You have 2 minutes and 20 seconds. Huh?

792
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,582
He's squeezing it out.

793
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,684
He's squeezing that.

794
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,619
-Oh, it's hot.
-Is it?

795
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,687
It's so hot!

796
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,488
It's still hot! Hyun-suk is in pain.

797
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,558
I've never seen him like this before.

798
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,094
But that looks so good.

799
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,262
Emulsify.

800
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,598
EMULSIFYING WITH OLIVE OIL

801
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,800
It smells good.

802
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,470
It was a bit bland before.

803
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,539
-It'll be fine once he puts pasta in.
-It's still bland.

804
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,641
It's both pasta,
so whoever ends first has the upper hand.

805
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,276
SAM BEGINS TO SERVE!

806
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,411
-He's serving.
-One more time.

807
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,779
Sam's already serving the food.

808
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,014
They're making pasta,

809
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,283
-so whoever ends first has the upper hand.
-That's true.

810
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,485
You have one minute left.

811
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,855
Chef Hyun-suk has never been
in such a rush before.

812
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,624
Whoever finishes first will have
less soggier noodles.

813
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,495
It'll taste so good
with the zucchini on top.

814
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,797
You have a minute left!

815
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,367
You have under a minute!
Sam still looks relaxed.

816
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:26,270
He's not listening to anything I say.

817
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,872
-He's ignoring me.
-I'm done.

818
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,173
He won't trust anyone.

819
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,042
The bell. Is it too hot?

820
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:31,943
SAM FINISHES FIRST

821
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,578
This looks really good.

822
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,380
HYUN-SUK SUDDENLY FINDS PEACE
AFTER SERVING

823
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,814
He found a bit of peace.

824
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,017
CHARGING UP HIS ANNOYANCE LEVEL

825
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,486
He finally has a moment to spare.

826
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,920
He finishes up.

827
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,523
That means he's practically done.

828
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,326
-Ten seconds.
-That means he didn't have to put that in.

829
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,794
-He doesn't have to.
-He doesn't.

830
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,695
He's done!

831
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,697
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

832
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,565
Hyun-suk finishes with five seconds left.

833
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,467
Those look like peas.

834
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,469
They look so good.

835
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,904
I'm already hungry.

836
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,639
That was so cool.

837
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,776
Both dishes are finished.

838
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,711
Oh, my god.

839
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,646
I'm curious.

840
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,081
SHOOTING THE INSERTS

841
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,084
-I've been to his restaurant once.
-Oh, really?

842
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,919
Oh, yeah. It was good.

843
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,487
Fifteen minutes? Dude.

844
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,756
Yeah, it's totally crazy.

845
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:19,891
It's insane.

846
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:25,163
And now, both pasta dishes are finished
for MARK and CHENLE.

847
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,398
I think they're simply amazing.

848
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,067
-I have so much respect for them.
-Right?

849
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,702
Just like how idol groups look cool
when you dance and perform.

850
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,239
It was amazing
that he even had time to dance.

851
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,443
That means Chef Hyun-suk's performance
looked like a dance.

852
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,877
-Yes.
-That's amazing.

853
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,679
-He danced.
-Okay, then.

854
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,980
You'll try the dish

855
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,516
-made by the chef who finished first.
-I'm aware.

856
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:50,388
It's Chef Sam's dish,
it's here, it's here, Pasta Czennie Here.

857
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,458
OIL PASTA WITH AN AMPLE AMOUNT
OF SEAFOOD AND VEGGIES

858
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,727
LOTS OF ZUCCHINI TOO

859
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,665
CHEF SAM'S PASTA CZENNIE HERE

860
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,500
This is crazy.

861
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,402
-How is it crazy?
-It looks insane.

862
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,303
Up close?

863
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,804
SNIFF

864
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,640
-Gosh. Thank you for the dish.
-Sure.

865
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,610
-It looks so good.
-First of all…

866
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,245
Look at that luster.

867
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,480
Thank you so much.

868
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,116
I don't have to try it.
I can already tell that it's good.

869
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,384
You two can relax and try the dish.

870
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,820
CHENLE is going at it.

871
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,622
-What's it like?
-I can already tell it's good.

872
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,226
-What do you think?
-Look at MARK's face.

873
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,495
MARK nods and nods.

874
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,630
This is seriously delicious.

875
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,300
-It's not salty at all.
-It's not?

876
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,069
Why isn't it salty?

877
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,738
-Sung-ju must hate me.
-No, it's his taste buds.

878
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,407
-Are they broken?
-They've been down for a while.

879
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,176
THIS GUY LOST HIS SENSE OF TASTE

880
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,345
He has frozen taste buds,
just like his shoulders.

881
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,646
I need to get

882
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,047
Chef Sam's number.

883
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,452
I'll be available around the clock.

884
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,257
-I can even cater.
-You'll do that?

885
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,458
What's it like?

886
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,094
The flavor from all the different seafood
filled up my mouth,

887
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,963
finishing off with a hint of parsley.

888
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,198
It must be noticeable later.

889
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,700
You seemed to enjoy parsley,

890
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,903
so I chopped up a lot into big pieces.

891
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,671
I added some initially and at the end.

892
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,174
It's always a wonder
that it kicks in toward the end.

893
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,776
Also, it's full of different textures,

894
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,280
from zucchini, seafood, to pasta.

895
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,582
So it's a lot of fun to eat this,
and it's so delicious.

896
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,717
-It sounds good.
-It's fun and delicious.

897
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,286
ABOUT TO KISS THE DISH

898
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,455
If I may dare to add something,

899
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,891
this is the dish I imagine

900
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,127
when I say I'm craving pasta.

901
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,695
-I see.
-Yes.

902
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,530
That's high praise.

903
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,431
It's the best review.

904
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,368
I never knew which my favorite pasta was,
between the red one,

905
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,204
cream pasta, or oil pasta.

906
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,240
But it just became oil pasta.

907
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,775
This must be my favorite.

908
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,010
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

909
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,314
He finally found out what he likes.

910
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,684
Felix is busy smacking his lips.

911
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,285
-Gulp, gulp.
-Are we the only ones who get to eat this?

912
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,056
-Can we just finish this?
-Those are just for the fridge owners.

913
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,692
-They'll eat in the next episode.
-Yes.

914
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,695
Sam finishing first
may have an impact on the result.

915
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,763
They're both busy eating.

916
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,399
-That should've been enough…
-His face is right on the dish.

917
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,971
This wait must put him
in a serious disadvantage.

918
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:24,141
-That's considered a penalty.
-It really is.

919
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,143
Or else you should finish first.

920
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,712
-It must be that good.
-They're serious.

921
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,113
Fresh pasta

922
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,381
quickly gets soggy.

923
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,517
-Let me do it.
-They're done.

924
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,219
Let's move on to the fresh pasta.

925
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,887
World-Class Pasta Dream.

926
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:40,891
SCALLOPS PLOPPED INTO BISQUE CREAM SAUCE

927
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,195
PEA-COLORED SPINACH TROFIE

928
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,099
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
WORLD-CLASS PASTA DREAM

929
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,968
Use a spoon to eat the sauce,

930
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,838
a scallop, and the pasta altogether.

931
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,607
You eat it thinking it's veggie,
but it's actually pasta.

932
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,476
-Isn't that uncanny?
-It is.

933
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,378
That's how he made the pasta.

934
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,879
-He dyed it.
-The pasta.

935
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,781
Look at CHENLE's face.

936
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,350
-He just giggled.
-He giggled.

937
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,652
GIGGLING

938
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,719
What does that mean?

939
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,990
Look at CHENLE's face. He just giggled.

940
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,893
I've never had
anything that tasted like this before.

941
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,564
It's a new kind of cream pasta.

942
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,135
I can taste the rich seafood broth
inside this cream sauce.

943
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,505
People don't usually make pasta like this.

944
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,373
THEY BOTH TAKE ANOTHER BITE

945
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,741
-Are the noodles cooked through?
-It's so good.

946
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,610
-What about the texture?
-It's so good.

947
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,911
Oh, the noodles?

948
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,947
-It tastes like <i>sujebi</i> dough.
-<i>Sujebi</i>.

949
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,817
The cream seeps in between the ridges.

950
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,586
It'll go into the ridges
when he pressed it out.

951
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:47,692
-CHENLE can't hide his smile. He's happy.
-It must be good.

952
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,959
It's so good.

953
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,128
-Is it? Do you mean it?
-I mean it.

954
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,231
You said oil pasta was your favorite,
but this is cream pasta.

955
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,635
-What now?
-It's not that I don't like this.

956
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,738
This was like
a plate of my most ideal pasta.

957
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,507
But this was a kind of pasta
I could never imagine.

958
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,710
-That's so accurate.
-Really.

959
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,311
THE IDEAL TASTE VS THE UNIMAGINABLE TASTE

960
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,181
The ideal taste or the unimaginable taste?

961
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,851
Let's hear from the two members
of Stray Kids too.

962
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:20,157
They must've had lots of pasta
as they traveled around the world.

963
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,792
His eyes widened.

964
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,827
Whoa.

965
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,629
How can I put this?

966
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,865
The cream is

967
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,834
filling up my mouth,

968
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,438
and I feel like I'm riding a crab.

969
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,906
Riding a crab?

970
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,977
-Riding a crab?
-Flying across the sky on a crab.

971
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,579
On a blue crab.

972
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,749
It feels like
he's flying across the sky on a crab.

973
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:49,920
Next, please try Chef Sam's dish,
Pasta Czennie Here.

974
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,123
This is amazing too.

975
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,591
There's a difference here.

976
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,894
He eats it Australian style,
and he's doing it the Gimpo way.

977
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,830
He's using chopsticks. I knew it.

978
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,298
-That's how I do it too.
-Yes.

979
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,366
-Both of us.
-Right.

980
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,070
Look at those big bites he's taking.

981
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,605
A BIG BITE

982
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:11,242
-This is what pasta is.
-It's not easy to make basic pasta.

983
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,778
-Whoa.
-What is it?

984
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,413
-Whoa.
-It's so hard, isn't it?

985
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,516
I also couldn't imagine
he could make a flavor like this.

986
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,551
-You didn't think it'd be so good?
-No.

987
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,186
I had two lunch boxes. What's with me?

988
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,889
Wait. Just wait.

989
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,757
Tell me who you'll choose.

990
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,627
Stray Kids, can you tell us
who you'll choose?

991
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,594
-Us?
-Yes.

992
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,530
-Just write it down there.
-I want to try that.

993
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,800
-It's finally your time to choose.
-I'm concerned.

994
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,268
-Already?
-You've tried both now.

995
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,805
-They have to talk.
-CHENLE is torn until the end.

996
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,072
Press one for Sam

997
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,641
and two for Hyun-suk.

998
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,210
Please press the button!

999
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,511
-Ho!
-Ho!

1000
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,679
Press it!

1001
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,948
CHENLE!

1002
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,616
-Press it!
-I did.

1003
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,286
-You did?
-This is way too hard.

1004
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,987
They both pressed the button.

1005
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,357
Let us check and see
if they're on the same page.

1006
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,327
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1007
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,896
-Their opinions…
-Opinions?

1008
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,532
-are different!
-Whoa.

1009
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,900
Argh!

1010
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,736
-They are different!
-Whoa.

1011
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,208
-Please feel free to discuss this.
-You can talk now.

1012
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,210
-But make it quiet.
-Quietly.

1013
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,512
We'll only press one of the two.

1014
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,114
When it came to the shock factor,
it was this one.

1015
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,117
This gained my respect
and showed me the chef's world.

1016
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,287
I don't think I can choose one.

1017
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,522
-It's almost…
-It's the balance.

1018
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,357
They're so serious.

1019
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,226
-It's as if they're buying real estate.
-It's like this.

1020
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:39,396
Their discussion is as serious
as how they talk about their choreography.

1021
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,998
-It's harder than that.
-It is?

1022
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,266
This is harder?

1023
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,802
-It's the difference in identity.
-Right.

1024
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,204
-It became a matter of identity.
-It must be so hard.

1025
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,540
-Please press a button.
-You must decide first.

1026
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,741
Have you decided?

1027
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,810
This is the final decision.

1028
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:53,878
Press it!

1029
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:54,879
PRESS THE BUTTON!

1030
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,448
WHICH WAY WILL THE RESULTS GO?

1031
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,116
The decision has been made.

1032
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,854
FYI, the two members of Stray Kids chose

1033
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,257
-Chef Hyun-suk.
-Whoa.

1034
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,259
-That's amazing.
-It was Hyun-suk.

1035
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,227
-Gosh, that's crazy.
-Wait.

1036
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,762
They're confused.

1037
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,731
-Whoa.
-Hey.

1038
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:17,201
Let's find out which one
the two members of NCT chose.

1039
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,636
It must've been hard.

1040
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,070
This was the pasta round

1041
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,506
between the two pasta experts.

1042
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,708
Will it be Hyun-suk
and his 30 years of experience?

1043
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,644
Or will it be Sam who's done it
for 25 years?

1044
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,880
Who did MARK and CHENLE choose?

1045
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,448
Which side will it lean to

1046
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,584
after the one-to-one tie?

1047
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,021
Who is it?

1048
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,090
Which one was it?

1049
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,192
SAM KIM WINS

1050
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,427
Who is it?

1051
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,696
CHEF SAM'S PASTA CZENNIE HERE WINS

1052
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:46,764
Sam Kim!

1053
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,533
HE WINS THE PASTA ROUND

1054
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,671
Sam beats Hyun-suk.

1055
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,005
What is pasta?

1056
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,073
FEELING SORRY

1057
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,776
-I see.
-How did this happen?

1058
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,580
I was responsible
for only 10% of the fridge,

1059
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,916
but this result was 90% insisted on by me.

1060
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:10,521
I chose this because it was
the kind of pasta I can keep eating.

1061
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,223
They were both absolutely delicious,

1062
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:18,195
so I set up that criterion,
and it helped me pick one easily.

1063
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,731
If I had to vote after the first bite,

1064
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,167
I would've picked Chef Hyun-suk.

1065
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,271
But as I tried more and more,
I could taste the rich flavors.

1066
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,808
In the end,
they were both on the same level.

1067
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,643
I have a question.

1068
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,546
-Yes? A question? Go ahead.
-I have a question.

1069
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,617
-Four guests voted just now.
-Yes.

1070
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,719
I got three votes, yet one vote won.

1071
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,886
How did I lose?

1072
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,023
IT'S A WIN IN HIS HEART…

1073
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,027
-Yes, that's life.
-It happens.

1074
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,396
Not winning the star doesn't bother me.

1075
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,764
What makes me sad

1076
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,601
is that I can no longer
accept texts from CHENLE.

1077
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,571
OH, NO

1078
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,806
-But now he has Sam to turn to.
-He does!

1079
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,375
Can you make this or not?

1080
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,311
I can make that while I'm on my back.

1081
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,079
He can do it lying down.

1082
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,281
This means Sam gets…

1083
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,118
-Gosh, I'm jealous.
-I'm jealous.

1084
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,353
I want this more than the star.

1085
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,122
-Is that real gold?
-It's the prize.

1086
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,990
I want that, Ji-sun.

1087
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,358
Let's take it.

1088
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,862
Sam Kim takes the star!

1089
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,531
He wins both a star
and the golden Spam set.

1090
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,167
-It was so delicious.
-Congratulations, Sam.

1091
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,202
-He beats Hyun-suk!
-Thank you so much.

1092
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,571
-Congratulations, Sam.
-Thank you.

1093
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:40,010
This is the second round with ingredients

1094
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,112
provided by MARK and CHENLE of NCT.

1095
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,650
This will be our first team battle
in this season.

1096
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,722
The Huntrix of Chinese cuisine,
Chef Jung Ji-sun and Park Eun-yeong

1097
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,160
are up against the heretics, Sapa Boys,
Chef Lim Tae-hun and Artist Kim Poong.

1098
00:44:56,226 --> 00:45:00,264
I heard Poong expected Team Huntrix
to face difficulties. What do you mean?

1099
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,466
There is always one captain

1100
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,802
-who sails a ship.
-Right.

1101
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,904
But it feels like there are two captains

1102
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,772
trying to sail the same ship.

1103
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,407
-You don't have to worry.
-Why not?

1104
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,609
I'm the boss here.

1105
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,244
-Isn't that so?
-You're absolutely right.

1106
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:15,846
-Yes.
-Will you let her do this, Eun-yeong?

1107
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,815
She started much earlier than I did.

1108
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,616
-Did you agree to this?
-I did.

1109
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,085
That's our disciplinarian.

1110
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,120
I'm actually rather anxious

1111
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,988
because Chef Ji-sun has never lost.

1112
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,592
I'll end up feeling really bad
if she loses this round.

1113
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,427
That's a possibility.

1114
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,030
Did you get a big lecture from her?

1115
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,300
Even during our short conversation,

1116
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,169
she strictly said,
"That's not how it's done."

1117
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,705
She already started to nag. She's nagging.

1118
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,808
-You got scolded.
-I can see some discipline over there.

1119
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,512
This side is the problem.
The heretics, Sapa Boys.

1120
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,682
Actually, I thought I received a chance

1121
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,117
to win a star with Poong.

1122
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,785
Is Poong the leader?

1123
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,920
-Yes, it's him.
-Are you serious?

1124
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,422
He's really holding himself back.

1125
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,891
Isn't that too big of a burden, Poong?

1126
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:01,959
No.

1127
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,928
I also find it odd
that it doesn't feel like a burden.

1128
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,798
HOW WILL THIS GO?

1129
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:11,201
JI-SUN AND EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:
BEEF TENDERLOIN, PORK BELLY, SHRIMP

1130
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,804
ABALONE, SEASONED CUCUMBER PICKLES,
SHIITAKE, BAMBOO MUSHROOM, AND MORE

1131
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,405
The dish we're making is

1132
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,241
Golden Dim Sum.

1133
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,511
-Golden Dim Sum?
-Golden Dim Sum.

1134
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,579
Whoa. Dim sum.

1135
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,148
This means they'll fight to win.

1136
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:28,719
We must protect the Chinese cuisine
honmoon from the Sapa Boys,

1137
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,922
so we're preparing a plate of dim sum.

1138
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,558
She's doing this to protect the honmoon.

1139
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,427
We plan to do everything,
steaming, toasting, and deep-frying.

1140
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:38,529
How many will you make?

1141
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,330
-We prepared six types.
-Six types?

1142
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,833
But they won't be the usual shapes
of dumplings that you'd recognize.

1143
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,969
Some of them will be deep-fried,
and some will be covered in dried laver.

1144
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,706
Chef Ji-sun and I will make
six different dim sums for you.

1145
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:50,774
I see.

1146
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,178
POONG AND TAE-HUN'S INGREDIENTS:
BEEF TENDERLOIN, SHRIMP, BAMBOO MUSHROOM

1147
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,780
SHIITAKE, OYSTER MUSHROOM, BOK CHOY,
CHERRY TOMATOES, CABBAGE, AND MORE

1148
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,283
The name of our dish is…

1149
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,618
It's not "Soda Pop," but "Knife-Cut Pop."

1150
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,854
They must be making knife-cut noodles.

1151
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:08,125
-Is this a reference to knife-cut noodles?
-Yes. Knife-cut noodles.

1152
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:13,564
As you already figured it out,
we'll attempt to make knife-cut noodles.

1153
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,300
Also, I believe
making knife-cut noodles in 15 minutes

1154
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,069
will be a scene never before seen
in the history of TV.

1155
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,337
Is it possible as a duo?

1156
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,140
-Yes, it's possible because we're two.
-I see.

1157
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,441
I'll make water-boiled beef,

1158
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,344
a spicy braised beef dish
originated from Sichuan

1159
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:30,614
served with oil on top,
something you scoop out to eat.

1160
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,650
I have a question.
How spicy do you like your food?

1161
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,786
I don't prefer something that's too spicy.

1162
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,088
It's not completely spicy.
It's more like hot pot.

1163
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,389
It has to be less spicy.

1164
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,994
He decided on the wrong menu.
I don't think Sichuan cuisine will work.

1165
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,364
-I don't think this is it.
-Remove a few of them.

1166
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,567
-I have a question.
-Drop those.

1167
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,769
-I have a question too.
-Yes?

1168
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,137
-He has a question.
-Sure.

1169
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,573
I do have ready-made knife-cut noodles.

1170
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,841
Did you choose to do this?

1171
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,576
I saw that he had ready-made noodles,

1172
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,346
but those can't bring out
the texture of fresh noodles.

1173
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,247
I like that.

1174
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,915
If you face a problem, use those.

1175
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,584
-If you face a problem later.
-Just in case.

1176
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,619
All right.

1177
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:13,924
It's time to fill MARK and CHENLE's
K-food Chinese cuisine Hunters order.

1178
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,326
They came to protect the honmoon

1179
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,295
from these Chinese demons.

1180
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:22,165
The Huntrix of Chinese cuisine,
Chefs Jung Ji-sun and Park Eun-yeong.

1181
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,569
Even these two have no idea
what they're going to make.

1182
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,504
The Sapa Boys of Chinese cuisine,

1183
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,107
Kim Poong and Chef Lim Tae-hun are
ready to fight.

1184
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,676
This is the first team round
in the new season.

1185
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,879
Which team will take the glorious victory?

1186
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:39,383
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1187
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,550
THE ORTHODOX VS THE HERETICS

1188
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,620
THE 15-MINUTE COOK-OFF BEGINS!

1189
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,789
JUNG JI-SUN, PARK EUN-YEONG

1190
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,457
VS KIM POONG, LIM TAE-HUN

1191
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:51,528
We won't give you more time
just because this is a team round.

1192
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,130
You still get 15 minutes.

1193
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,132
He's already on it.

1194
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,036
Ji-sun works on mushrooms,
while Eun-yeong is on meat.

1195
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,307
Poong is using garlic cloves,
while Chef Tae-hun is on a blender.

1196
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,677
It looks like Chef Tae-hun is
making the dough.

1197
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:07,945
Why is he making so much dough?

1198
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,614
This is the most important
for knife-cut noodles.

1199
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:14,318
You need a large lump to cut the noodle,
so it can't be small.

1200
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,653
You can't cut it out if it's this tiny.

1201
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,255
REDUCING THE RIPENING TIME
BY USING HOT WATER

1202
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,823
He's using hot water to make the dough.

1203
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,828
Chef Ji-sun is in charge of veggies,
and Chef Eun-yeong is in charge of meat.

1204
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,163
Is this enough?

1205
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,464
Yes, it's more than enough.

1206
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,868
My gosh. They're using both beef and pork.

1207
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,105
They're making six different dim sums,
which means six different fillings.

1208
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,709
Chefs Ji-sun and Eun-yeong are
busy preparing the ingredients first.

1209
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,945
That team seems more organized.

1210
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,514
-That's right.
-Chef Eun-yeong is making the filling.

1211
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,916
The dim sum filling.

1212
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,184
+GINGER, +LARD
PORK BELLY

1213
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,653
SHE MUST MAKE SIX DIFFERENT FILLINGS

1214
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,122
-Yes.
-Pork belly, beef…

1215
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,758
SHRIMP, LARD, GINGER

1216
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,730
1. BLEND PORK BELLY, TENDERLOIN, SHRIMP,
WITH GINGER JUICE AND LARD

1217
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,399
EUN-YEONG CLEARS HER MISSION!

1218
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,134
Whoa.

1219
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,068
It's the real deal.

1220
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:06,970
GREEN ONION

1221
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,172
GARLIC

1222
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,574
Poong's chili oil.

1223
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,976
-He's making the chili oil, right?
-Chili oil.

1224
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,911
-Always.
-Always.

1225
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,047
Isn't that too much
red pepper powder, Poong?

1226
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,116
It's okay. I need lots of chili oil.

1227
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,651
-That's more than I expected.
-That's a lot.

1228
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:22,786
It does seem a lot.

1229
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,921
-Why did you ask them?
-Isn't that too much?

1230
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,990
I've never seen anyone use that much.

1231
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,558
EGG YOLK

1232
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,260
ONE EACH

1233
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,195
2. KNEAD FLOUR, WARM WATER,
EGG YOLK, SALT, COOKING OIL

1234
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,931
He's even adding cooking oil to the dough.

1235
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,835
Here's the egg whites.

1236
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,139
POONG WILL USE THE REMAINING EGG WHITES

1237
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,274
IN CHARGE OF VEGGIES

1238
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,644
I can hear the blender going off loudly.

1239
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,981
Both teams are busy
preparing the ingredients.

1240
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,752
They'll prepare the ingredients first,

1241
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,988
-and then cook everything toward the end.
-Yes.

1242
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,590
It takes a while
for them to prepare the ingredients.

1243
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,693
CHOPPING SHIITAKE INTO SMALL PIECES

1244
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,363
AND SMASH THE GARLIC CLOVES!

1245
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,698
THE VEGETABLES ARE READY TO GO!

1246
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,534
-Wait a second. I'll do it.
-The meat.

1247
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,768
Can you flatten it out?

1248
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:12,669
BECAME POONG'S HANDS

1249
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,272
-Is this enough?
-Yes, that's enough.

1250
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,706
Chef Tae-hun is

1251
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,842
preparing the ingredient
and kneading the dough.

1252
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,144
Poong has done nothing
except for making the chili oil.

1253
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,614
That's true.
Why is the leader not doing much?

1254
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,550
It seems like Tae-hun is doing everything.

1255
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,119
STEALING

1256
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,354
He's moving the chopped beef into a bowl.

1257
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,756
-Poong?
-Yes.

1258
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,393
-It looks like you don't have much to do.
-Not true.

1259
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,894
I have an important role.

1260
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,596
You look like the assistant.

1261
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,432
-Tae-hun shakes both blenders.
-Poong said

1262
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,367
-there can't be two suns in the sky.
-No.

1263
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,471
And he has to be the sun for this team,

1264
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,040
so the sun didn't rise over here.

1265
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,708
The sun hasn't risen yet.

1266
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,877
It's still 5 a.m.

1267
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,781
Things look pretty grim over here
for Tae-hun.

1268
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,983
He's working alone.

1269
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,218
What are you doing, Poong?

1270
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,019
I added soy sauce

1271
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:06,089
-And <i>huangjiu</i>.
-and <i>huangjiu</i> to the beef for seasoning.

1272
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:10,160
I see.
But the team needs Poong to do more.

1273
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,496
Tae-hun has a lot on his shoulders.

1274
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,798
HE'S DONE MIXING THE DOUGH IN THE BLENDER

1275
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,602
Poong is doing nothing else
except for chopping things.

1276
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,437
Tae-hun is in charge of the dough.

1277
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:24,040
-I hope it comes together soon.
-I do too.

1278
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,042
You have ten minutes left!

1279
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,043
Ten minutes.

1280
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,812
-Already?
-It's been five minutes.

1281
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,014
-The dough is ready.
-Is it?

1282
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,083
-Is it good enough?
-It's done.

1283
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,752
Eun-yeong and Ji-sun are moving as a team.

1284
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,853
Their teamwork is great.

1285
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,955
The teamwork on this side is perfect.

1286
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,257
-Right?
-They divided the tasks.

1287
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:44,194
Eun-yeong cooperates smoothly
under Ji-sun's leadership.

1288
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,763
-I ground everything.
-Okay.

1289
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,001
REMOVING THE SKIN AND STALK
FROM BOILED TOMATOES

1290
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,237
Nothing is stopping Huntrix.

1291
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,039
-No.
-Everything is going smoothly.

1292
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,908
We don't have enough shrimp.

1293
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,110
-What?
-Is this all of the shrimp?

1294
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,179
-Yes, that's all.
-It's not a lot.

1295
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,514
OYSTER SAUCE

1296
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,650
ANXIOUS

1297
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,919
We have a bit more…
We do have a little bit more.

1298
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,588
Should we use more? There's a little more.

1299
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,023
-We do?
-A little.

1300
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,493
-A little more?
-No, let's just continue.

1301
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,564
Even though their conversations aren't
that long…

1302
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,265
-May I use the board?
-Go ahead.

1303
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,634
All they have to do is look at each other.

1304
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,237
Gosh. That's so cool.

1305
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,774
They're preparing
different kinds of fillings,

1306
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,010
and the vegetables are separated
and ready to be used.

1307
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,879
What are you up to, Chef Eun-yeong?

1308
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:36,980
I made egg garnish.

1309
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,715
Thin egg garnish.

1310
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,684
It looks like skin.
Are you making spring rolls?

1311
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,285
Yes, spring rolls.

1312
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,853
When did she make that?

1313
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,355
Jeez.

1314
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,090
POONG BEGINS TO SEASON THE SHRIMP

1315
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:51,394
Poong is now seasoning
something that looks important.

1316
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,964
Can you julienne the rest?

1317
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,300
JULIENNING: SLICING INTO THIN PIECES

1318
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,436
Is Poong still working on chili oil?

1319
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,304
He's sifting the oil.

1320
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,073
How long has he been working on that?

1321
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,574
Six minutes.

1322
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:08,945
Chef Tae-hun has so much work to do.

1323
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,849
He just finished making the dough

1324
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,851
and began to help out Poong, right?

1325
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,254
We're doing this together.
Who's helping whom?

1326
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,122
Goodness, this is…

1327
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,991
-That's too much red pepper.
-That's way too much.

1328
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,460
If that's my dried red pepper,
it'll be way too spicy.

1329
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:24,861
HORRIFIED

1330
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,730
-Is the pepper spicy?
-Maybe not.

1331
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,032
-He added Sichuan peppers too.
-No, it's not spicy.

1332
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,201
He threw in a fistful of Sichuan peppers.

1333
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,870
Those can be numbing.

1334
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,972
MARK, do you enjoy
spicy and intense flavors?

1335
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,441
-Not too much.
-He doesn't like it too much.

1336
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,877
He doesn't eat mala soup
when we eat hot pot together.

1337
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,847
JI-SUN IS DONE SEASONING THE FILLINGS

1338
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,483
SHRIMP GOES INTO A BAG

1339
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,918
Why are things so hectic?

1340
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,121
-I'll stir-fry these.
-Okay.

1341
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:55,158
5. STIR-FRY SHIITAKE, OYSTER MUSHROOMS

1342
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,394
ONION, GREEN ONION, GARLIC,
AND OYSTER SAUCE

1343
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,997
VEGETABLE STIR-FRY, FINISHED

1344
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,667
Just now, Chef Eun-yeong topped

1345
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,568
-the egg garnish with…
-She topped it with mushroom

1346
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,870
and seasoned cucumber pickles.

1347
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,271
It's MARK's pickles.

1348
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:11,007
THE SEASONED PICKLES HIS MOTHER MADE!

1349
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,175
Gosh, thank you.

1350
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,911
-It's the side dish his mother made.
-Thank you so much.

1351
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,747
MARK's ingredient is used for this dish.

1352
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,383
She's filling up bamboo mushrooms…

1353
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,352
-Bamboo mushrooms?
-…with shrimp.

1354
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,788
She's filling bamboo mushrooms with that?

1355
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,923
-That's amazing.
-The mushroom became the skin.

1356
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,225
I'm trying to squeeze it out.

1357
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,828
The mushroom is the skin,
so she's filling it up.

1358
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,930
FOCUSED

1359
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,766
-That's what she did there.
-That's not a bad idea.

1360
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,501
You have seven minutes left.

1361
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,870
You're over halfway done.

1362
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,406
Do you have the noodles?
The knife-cut noodles?

1363
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,608
The dough is rising now.

1364
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,210
Here he goes!

1365
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,379
Tae-hun brings the dough.

1366
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,049
KNIFE-CUT NOODLES

1367
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,884
He's making knife-cut noodles.

1368
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,154
It's a bit different.

1369
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:01,558
The noodles should pop out automatically
when he slices the dough,

1370
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,226
but it keeps breaking.

1371
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,061
-Why won't it pop out?
-It hasn't risen enough.

1372
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,832
The dough needs to be firmer
for it to work better.

1373
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,266
Is it too thin?

1374
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,635
He goes back and makes the dough again.

1375
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,272
HE BEGINS TO KNEAD IT
WITH HIS HANDS AGAIN!

1376
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,776
This is why fresh noodles
isn't for everyone.

1377
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,380
DRIED RED PEPPER AND SICHUAN PEPPER

1378
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,751
HE CHOPS WELL-COOKED PEPPERS WITH A KNIFE

1379
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,219
These are burnt.

1380
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,354
Darn it. These are burnt.

1381
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,189
-The pepper got burnt.
-They're burnt.

1382
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,892
GIVES UP

1383
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,329
A HUGE DISASTER

1384
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,097
What was that, Poong?

1385
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,665
The peppers burned.

1386
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,301
-Their peppers got burnt.
-Let's go!

1387
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,037
I'm sure they each play a role.

1388
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:51,174
7. FRY ROLLED-UP EGGS
AFTER COATING THEM WITH STARCH WATER

1389
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,510
What's Chef Eun-yeong frying?

1390
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,878
The spring roll.

1391
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,746
-I see.
-She made spring rolls.

1392
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,181
It's a dim sum made with eggs.

1393
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,449
-I see.
-It looks so good.

1394
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:03,153
Chefs Ji-sun and Eun-yeong are
moving around here and there.

1395
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,821
They're like friendly sisters.

1396
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,290
They're making something else with bread.

1397
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,593
They work as if
they've always been a team.

1398
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,097
8. PRESS WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD
AND CUT INTO SQUARES

1399
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,166
What are you doing, Chef Ji-sun?

1400
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,535
-The scallion pancakes.
-Pancakes.

1401
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,970
Scallion pancakes? Whoa.

1402
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:24,174
BEEF TENDERLOIN
INSIDE THE SCALLION PANCAKE

1403
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,145
She's making six different dim sums,
which means six different fillings.

1404
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,713
That's right.

1405
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,384
Dim sum versus knife-cut noodles.

1406
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,920
Artist Poong will do something
at some point.

1407
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:37,921
OIL PAN WITH CHILI OIL

1408
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,024
AND ADD JULIENNED VEGETABLES

1409
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,058
Where is it?

1410
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,993
TAE-HUN RETURNS
AFTER KNEADING THE DOUGH SOME MORE

1411
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,362
This time, the dough…

1412
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,897
It's working nicely now.

1413
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,767
Can he cut the knife-cut noodles?

1414
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,535
WHAT'S THIS LIQUOR BOTTLE?

1415
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,304
Isn't that an expensive bottle?

1416
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,805
-It's Maotai.
-It's a <i>baijiu</i>.

1417
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,308
-Maotai?
-A type of <i>baijiu</i>.

1418
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,477
6. STIR-FRY VEGGIES AND BAIJIU IN A PAN
OILED WITH CHILI OIL

1419
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,312
-They have five minutes left.
-Yes!

1420
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,747
-Please go out to the kitchen, Jung-hwan.
-Sure.

1421
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,585
It usually looks really cool
when the pan catches on fire.

1422
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,386
Not everyone can make it seem so uncool.

1423
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,791
Time flies by so quickly.

1424
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,860
Things are going smoothly on this side.

1425
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,497
So you filled up
bamboo mushrooms with fillings.

1426
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,601
-Excuse me.
-And these are eggs.

1427
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,169
MIXING PORK BELLY AND SHRIMP MEAT

1428
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,370
FOURTH DIM SUM
PORK BELLY AND SHRIMP MENBOSHA

1429
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,038
Is she making menbosha?

1430
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,040
-What are you up to?
-Menbosha.

1431
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:34,210
-Menbosha.
-Okay.

1432
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,145
SESAME

1433
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,983
There are too many ingredients here.

1434
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,718
The smell of the hot pot is no joke.

1435
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,120
DROPPING IN THE MENBOSHA

1436
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,423
SHE COOKS MENBOSHA AT A LOW TEMPERATURE

1437
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,159
-Are the knife-cut noodles done?
-Yes.

1438
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,594
-What are you stir-frying?
-Is this enough?

1439
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,062
Yes, that's enough.

1440
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,364
You have four minutes left.

1441
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,532
CHILI-OIL VEGETABLE STIR-FRY IS DONE

1442
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,166
Everyone is busy.

1443
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,401
Wait, I know what these are.

1444
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,504
-It looks way too spicy.
-It's the Haidilao sauce.

1445
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,207
-Let's go with this.
-It's the hot pot sauce.

1446
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,875
That sauce is really spicy.

1447
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,977
I can smell it from here.

1448
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,946
It reeks of hot pot here.

1449
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:13,950
-Is that tomato?
-He mixed tomato sauce and hot pot sauce.

1450
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,719
Goodness, it smells like
I'm at a hot pot place.

1451
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,821
-It's pretty salty too.
-He threw in tomatoes.

1452
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,591
-He said it's pretty salty.
-It's salty.

1453
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,393
7. STIR-FRY VEGGIES
IN THE MALA AND TOMATO SOUP MIX

1454
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,861
STRUGGLING

1455
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:27,230
Darn it. How do you do this?

1456
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,866
He doesn't know how to toss a wok,
so he just asked how.

1457
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:35,004
How do you do this?

1458
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,474
It'll become a hot pot with some water,
hot pot with all kinds of ingredients.

1459
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,877
-What's that?
-The meat?

1460
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,613
8. ADD WATER AND BEEF TENDERLOIN
TO THE MIX AND MAKE BOILED BEEF

1461
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,781
Why are we out of time?

1462
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:48,618
But this team over here is
doing a great job.

1463
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,954
I feel like I'm at a holiday party.

1464
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,590
Yes, they're working in great harmony.

1465
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:54,791
Should I parboil this?

1466
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:58,161
FIFTH DIM SUM

1467
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,631
-I'll make the sauce.

1468
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,701
-This side is such a dream team.
-They are.

1469
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,436
-This is great.
-Let's make the sauce here.

1470
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,005
-I'll make the tomato dim sum sauce.
-I'll work on something else.

1471
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,107
Chef Eun-yeong has become a docile sheep.

1472
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,110
-She only does as Ji-sun asks.
-Is this right, Ji-sun?

1473
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,511
-Yeah.
-She asks, "Is this right?"

1474
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,814
THAT'S RIGHT, APPLE JAM

1475
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,582
I knew it.

1476
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,785
-Is this right?
-Okay.

1477
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,555
She keeps checking
every single ingredient.

1478
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,090
Even checking the smell of them.

1479
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,959
13. MAKE TOMATO DIM SUM SAUCE BY MIXING
SOY SAUCE, APPLE JAM, AND DARK VINEGAR

Hey.

1481
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,496
WHAT ABOUT JI-SUN'S SAUCE?

1482
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,866
SHE'S MAKING ROCK SUGAR

1483
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:39,202

1486
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,012
Can you please take a look
at the spring rolls?

1487
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,480
The spring roll looks so good.

1488
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:52,448
Whose is this? Let me use it.

1489
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,718
-Let me use this!
-What? Why? We need it!

1490
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,920
He has to use chopsticks.

1491
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,490
A MASTER DOESN'T BLAME HIS TOOLS!

1492
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:02,692
SEASONED SHRIMP

1493
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,093
-Was that shrimp?
-Yes.

1494
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,128
One or two minutes left?

1495
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,163
POONG CAN MULTITASK!

1496
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,898
I got the noodles.

1497
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,366
Jung-hwan.

1498
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,902
Take a look at the knife-cut noodles.
He scooped those out.

1499
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:16,572
-Did you take them out?
-How did the noodles turn out?

1500
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,875
-The noodles are the most important.
-How are the noodles?

1501
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,511
Let me try a small piece
of the knife-cut noodles.

1502
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:22,945
-Warm up the rice.
-The rice?

1503
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,648
-I've had knife-cut noodles often.
-I see.

1504

9. WARM UP INSTANT RICE IN A MICROWAVE

01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,722
What are the noodles like?

1508
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,557
What are the noodles like?

1509
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,362
It's amazing. It's very delicious.

1510
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,964
I love this texture.

1511
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,000
-Bamboo mushrooms.
-Put it in.

1512
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,035
-That's unexpected from Poong.
-It's not bad.

1513
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,404
-The noodles turned out nicely.
-Yes, they did.

1514
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,640
You have a minute and 30 seconds.

1515
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,376
-That's good.
-Should I put the noodles in here?

1516
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,011
Yes, put them in.

1517
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,113
Mix the shrimp filling with this.

MEATBALLS COVERED IN DRIED LAVER

1521
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,992
15. COVER THE MEATBALL
WITH DRIED LAVER AND DEEP-FRY

1522
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,195
-It's not bad.
-Throw them in here.

1523
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,496
Okay.

1524
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,731
You're throwing in everything?

1525
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,866
It's a bit too much. Pull some out.

1526
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,434
He says it's too much.

1527
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,336
POONG-STYLE MEASURING METHOD

1528
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,939
-Let's take some out. Okay, parsley.
-I'll do it, Poong.

1529
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,842
They threw in the bok choy,
turning the pan into a green field.

1530
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,710
Move aside.

1531
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,212
There's nowhere to put this.

1532
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,514
Let me clean these for you.

1533
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,683
Jeez! My arm hurts.

1534
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,118
My arm hurts.

1535
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,355
You have a minute left! One minute!

1536
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,557
-You have a minute!
-A minute!

1537
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,527
Do you have to pour this in?

1538
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,295
POURING THE SICHUAN BOILED BEEF!

1539
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:47,897
-Whoa.
-Man!

1540
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:48,898
It looks like a feast.

1541
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,334
His tongue will go numb
if he tries this first.

1542
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,536
-May I use your knife?
-Sure.

1543
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,672
PERILLA LEAVES, ABALONE

1544
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:57,907
Things were hectic before,

1545
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,776
-but things are coming to an end.
-They should be.

1546
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:02,445
We need to see a few dishes
at this point in time.

1547
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:07,250
The other side, Ji-sun and Eun-yeong,
also don't have a lot of time.

1548
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:08,785
GOLDEN DIM SUM: 1 OUT OF 6 READY

1549
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,019
We have no choice now.

1550
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,120
He's adding more chili oil.

1551
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,722
Will that be okay?

1552
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,757
He poured in everything.

1553
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,093
-It looks way too red.
-Thirty seconds.

1554
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,328
Thirty seconds. You have to finish up!

1555
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:22,532
13. ADD CHILI OIL AND MALA OIL

1556
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,167
-I'll do it.
-This side, please!

1557
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,903
A WHOLE LOT OF PARSLEY THAT THEY LIKE

1558
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,838
-Let's serve these now.
-Thirty seconds.

1559
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,374
MENBOSHA & GREEN ONION PANCAKES DONE

1560
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,377
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds.

1561
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,912
This side, please.

1562
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,947
Where's your food, Huntrix?

1563
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,883
GETTING ANTSY

1564
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,120
-You have 15 seconds!
-You only have 15 seconds.

1565
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,356
You have to ring the bell soon.

1566
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,992
-Ten. Nine. Eight.
-Nine. Eight.

1567
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,861
-Seven. Six.
-Ring the bell first.

1568
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,697
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1569
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:58,167
-Three. Two. One. It's over.
-Three. Two. One.

1570
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,269
You have to hurry. Ten seconds!

1571
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,239
-Nine. Eight. Seven.
-Nine. Eight. Seven.

1572
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,742
-Six. Five. Four.
-Put it on top of this one.

1573
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,911
-Three. Two.
-Three. Two.

1574
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,047
-One.
-One. It's over.

1575
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,049
GOLDEN DIM SUM, 5 OUT OF 6

1576
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,250
-We're done.
-Poong finishes first.

1577
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,419
They're done.

1578
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:18,487
That was so rough.

1579
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:19,455
It was.

1580
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,592
This is how much food you get
when you go to a Chinese restaurant.

1581
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,727
Both dishes were finished!

1582
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,729
In just 15 minutes?

1583
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:29,365
-This is crazy.
-Beautiful.

1584
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,601
All of us can share that.

1585
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:34,036
This does look really spicy.

1586
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:37,006
It does. The knife-cut noodles.

1587
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:40,576
Then please try the dish
made by the Sapa Boys first.

1588
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,212
-Sichuan boiled beef.
-That one tastes really strong.

1589
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:48,417
THE DEMONICALLY SPICY
SICHUAN BOILED BEEF WITH KNIFE-CUT NOODLES

1590
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:53,389
SAPA BOYS' KNIFE-CUT POP

1591
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,324
-This is a lot of food.
-Whoa.

1592
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,561
Please try Sapa Boys' dish first.

1593
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,196
-See how spicy it is.
-Right.

1594
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,797
And try some rice too.

1595
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,268
IT SMELLS SPICY TOO

1596
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:06,802
It looks good, though.

1597
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,272
It's obviously Chinese food,
but it looks spicy.

1598
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,141
That's what you expect from Chinese food.

1599
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,911
-You can tell that Poong led this.
-Yes.

1600
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,146
-That's true.
-It's a dish he made.

1601
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,317
MARK looks anxious.
Should he eat this or not?

1602
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,587
-MARK seems hesitant.
-Thank you so much for the food.

1603
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,856
It may be spicy, so be careful.

1604
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,057
TAKING A BIG BITE

1605
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,026
-The spiciness must be important.
-Yes.

1606
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,962
He's trying Sichuan boiled beef.

1607
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,901
-He looks pleased.
-Is it good?

1608
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,636
-It's not as spicy as I thought.
-No?

1609
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,371
-It's not spicy?
-No?

1610
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,974
-Do you not find it spicy, MARK? You okay?
-I'm fine.

1611
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,310
-It's just deliciously spicy enough.
-Deliciously spicy.

1612
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,911
CHENLE nods too.

1613
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,580
-It's just so good.
-Is it?

1614
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,616
The noodles are so good.

1615
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:55,384
It must've turned out nicely.

1616
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,954
Great job with the noodles, Tae-hun.

1617
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,089
First, the noodles were a success.

1618
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,224
They are. They're so good.

1619
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,426
TWO BITES OF MEAT

1620
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,861
-He has another bite.
-It must taste good.

1621
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,997
GULP

1622
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:10,199
-The meat is so delicious.
-It is.

1623
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,233
-The meat?
-Yes.

1624
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,202
It's tender and delicious.

1625
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,737
It's tender and delicious.

1626
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,505
Goodness. It must've turned out nicely.

1627
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,875
It must be fun digging up the food.

1628
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:22,745
-It reminds me of hot pot.
-It's like hot pot?

1629
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,947
MARK begins to cough!

1630
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:29,151
He caught a coughing spell.
Have some water!

1631
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:32,054
I think the spiciness got to him.

1632
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,556
They should've had dim sum first.

1633
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:34,557
Right? Gosh.

1634
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,327
Their mouths are probably numb
with the mala spice.

1635
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,829
It must be thrilling.

1636
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,764
CHENLE CONTINUES TO EAT IN PEACE

1637
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,898
The meat and noodles.

1638
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:45,434
-It's addictive, so they keep eating more.
-Mala does that.

1639
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,672
I eat hot pot from time to time,

1640
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:54,243
but this was my first time
mixing mala soup with tomato soup.

1641
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,812
The balance was
much nicer than I expected.

1642
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,749
Unlike your expectation?

1643
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,118
-The noodles are so good.
-The noodles are so good.

1644
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,586
-He did a great job.
-He keeps eating more.

1645
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,689
MARK keeps going back
for more knife-cut noodles.

1646
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,059
It's not as spicy as I thought.

1647
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,360
-It's good.
-I see.

1648
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,461
HE BEGINS TO STUTTER

1649
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,231
His tongue is slowly numbing.

1650
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,366
Next, the Chinese cuisine Huntrix.

1651
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,635
A DIM SUM PLATE
MADE BY CHINESE CUISINE HUNTRIX

1652
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,104
SHRIMP AND BAMBOO MUSHROOM

1653
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,640
SPRING ROLL WITH SEASONED CUCUMBER PICKLES

1654
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,276
BEEF TENDERLOIN AND GREEN ONION PANCAKE

1655
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,312
SHRIMP AND TOMATO DIM SUM

1656
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,314
FRIED MEATBALL COVERED IN DRIED LAVER

1657
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,518
PORK BELL AND SHRIMP MENBOSHA

1658
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:37,520
AND DIM SUM DIP

1659
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:42,391
CHINESE CUISINE HUNTRIX'S GOLDEN DIM SUM

1660
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,730
CHENLE is covered in sweat.

1661
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:51,033
-It was a strong dish.
-It might be a part of Poong's plan.

1662
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,436
We had to numb his sense of taste

1663
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,238
to make the dim sum taste flat.

1664
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:57,573
Where do we begin?

1665
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,708
Try the tomato dim sum first,

1666
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,177
then, bamboo mushroom.

1667
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,979
What's in the tomato dim sum?

1668
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,714
Shiitake and shrimp.

1669
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,817
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

1670
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:09,552
-It's in the tomato.
-Yes.

1671
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,387
-Wow.
-Did she hollow it out?

1672
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:14,757
-Gosh. Thank you.
-This is the first out of six.

1673
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,060
They're both nodding.

1674
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,495
He looks brighter now.

1675
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,931
-He looks different.
-He does.

1676
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,401
-Very much.
-The smell of the mushroom in the tomato

1677
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,569
-spreads out.
-Did it burst out?

1678
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:30,406
CHENLE found his smile again.

1679
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,641
The other dish was good too,
but it was just spicy.

1680
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,676
-I see.
-It's good.

1681
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,779
The bamboo mushroom may taste bland,

1682
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,482
so you can have it with the sauce
if that suits you,

1683
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:41,317
but it'd be better if you had it as is.

1684
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,319
You can choose to dip the sauce.

1685
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,888
EATING IT IN ONE BITE
WITHOUT HESITATION

1686
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,292
MARK didn't want to dip it.

1687
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,528
He doesn't like it
when something is too spicy.

1688
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,763
Then please try it with the sauce.

1689
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,865
Mmm.

1690
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,700
-It needs sauce.
-It does?

1691
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:00,402
-That brings in more flavors.
-It must.

1692
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,138
There's a reason why she served it.

1693
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,273
-What should they eat next?
-The spring roll.

1694
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,911
It's filled with seasoned cucumber pickles
MARK's mother made.

1695
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,113
I wanted you to have a taste of that.

1696
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,648
-Yes, right.
-Your mom's food.

1697
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,383
-That's it.
-Thank you.

1698
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,985
-That looks good.
-That's made

1699
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,488
with the seasoned cucumber pickles
made by MARK's mom.

1700
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,024
-Spring rolls?
-MARK's response is important.

1701
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,026
They had three out of six so far.

1702
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:24,960
It's so good.

1703
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:26,962
-He's amazed.
-It must be good.

1704
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:29,899
That's the power of his mother's cooking.

1705
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,600
-What's the green thing?
-Perilla leaves.

1706
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,801
-Perilla leaves?
-Yes.

1707
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:36,405
-I filled it with ground tenderloin.
-Ground tenderloin?

1708
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:38,240
Green onion pancakes
are usually eaten as is,

1709
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,910
but I turned them back into dough
and made them into dim sum skin.

1710
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,379
TRIES A BITE RIGHT AWAY

1711
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,414
It's the fourth dim sum.

1712
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:46,749
PERFECT HARMONY

1713
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:47,883
Was that a choir?

1714
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,919
THE FOOD TASTING CHOIR

1715
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,087
What made you make that sound?

1716
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:55,191
The texture was already great
before I had a chance to taste it.

1717
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,759
-The texture?
-It must've been soft.

1718
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:59,261
-It felt great in my mouth.
-It felt great.

1719
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,730
-The dim sums were all different.
-They were?

1720
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:05,467
It's fun to taste
different textures and flavors.

1721
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,603
-The fifth one.
-The fifth one. Next.

1722
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,507
-This one looks like a rice ball.
-It does.

1723
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:12,675
What's inside?

1724
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,376
-Shrimp.
-Shrimp and pork.

1725
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,313
This is the fifth dim sum.

1726
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:19,715
CRUNCH

1727
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,918
Something sounds crunchy

1728
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:27,056
-I think it's from the pork belly.
-The cartilage?

1729
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,557
It must be the cartilage.

1730
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,693
I see. Shouldn't she have cut it out?

1731
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,529
-You didn't remove those?
-Ji-sun turns to Eun-yeong right away.

1732
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:35,998
GETS MAD RIGHT AWAY(?)

1733
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,033
-"I told you to cut it out!"
-"If we lose, it's on you."

1734
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,502
-"What happened?"
-Was it intentional?

1735
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:43,439
If CHENLE hurts one of his molars,

1736
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,908
you'll also lose one, Eun-yeong.

1737
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:49,245
-Look at her face.
-"If we lose, it's all on you."

1738
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,180
"You'll lose a molar too."

1739
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,082
I personally like the cartilage.

1740
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,883
-You do? I'm glad.
-The crunchy bone.

1741
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,385
Was this intentional?

1742
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,754
I left a little inside to add texture.

1743
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,590
I think my molars will be fine
because both CHENLE and MARK

1744
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,726
seem to enjoy the dish.

1745
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,761
EXTRACTION POSTPONED

1746
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,796
-She's disciplined.
-How scary.

1747
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,198
I just got work done on them.

1748
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,833
She just got work done.

1749
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,268
What's the last one?

1750
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:13,869
-The last one.
-Is it made with bread?

1751
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,872
-It's menbosha.
-It's menbosha.

1752
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,474
That's menbosha.

1753
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,245
You don't need the sauce for this one.

1754
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,947
-Please try it as is.
-It's good.

1755
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,750
MARK is already smiling.

1756
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:31,520
He says it's good. Wow.

1757
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,056
CHEWING…

1758
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,092
Is it too dry?
He's been chewing for a while.

1759
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,428
There's some cartilage in here too.

1760
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,297
There's more cartilage!

1761
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,865
You didn't remove them?

1762
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,767
Where did they come from?

1763
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,069
This time, she'll lose her incisors.

1764
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,773
She keeps feeling her molars.
The ones she just got done.

1765
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,841
-It's really good.
-He says it's really good.

1766
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:56,078
Then let's have this side
try the Knife-Cut Pop noodles.

1767
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,514
A BIG BITE

1768
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,749
COUGH!

1769
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,919
-Lee Know is feeling it now.
-Right away.

1770
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,988
-Lee Know.
-He's feeling it now.

1771
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,190
This is what I call Chinese food.

1772
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,527
-Right away.
-He's feeling it.

1773
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:15,564
-Felix is feeling it too.
-He's turning red.

1774
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,067
-His face turned red.
-He's turning red.

1775
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:19,868
TAKING A BREAK

1776
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,037
Taking a break from tasting.

1777
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,906
His entire body is turning red.

1778
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,041
His face must feel really hot.

1779
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,143
-I couldn't imagine that.
-He couldn't imagine that.

1780
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,346
They were good with spicy food.

1781
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,247
CHENLE keeps going back for more.

1782
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,316
The more I eat it,
the more delicious it is.

1783
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,452
I keep going back for more.

1784
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,120
-I keep craving more.
-Do you?

1785
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,989
-I'm sure.
-My gosh.

1786
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,325
-It might have been odd at first…
-The taste you crave.

1787
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,361
…but once you eat it, you go for more.

1788
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,131
THE CHEFS BEGIN TO TRY THE DISHES

1789
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,866
SLURP

1790
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:51,967
COUGH!

1791
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,435
It's spicy.

1792
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,170
What's wrong, Sam? Is it spicy?

1793
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,973
-I…
-Is it too spicy?

1794
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,508
What's wrong?

1795
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,010
-Is it too spicy?
-I'm not good with spicy food.

1796
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:03,746
COUGH

1797
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,648
He's never done that before.
Did he actually cough?

1798
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,985
THE INTENSE FLAVOR EVEN SHOCKED NAM-NO

1799
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,121
-How did you two eat this?
-Right?

1800
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,591
The spicy smell rises up right away,

1801
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,992
but it disappears quickly.

1802
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,761
-I see.
-So I keep craving more.

1803
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,863
It must be true.
You've found your peace again.

1804
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:23,265
-Yes.
-He's okay now.

1805
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:26,802
You were completely red before,
but you've found your peace again.

1806
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,905
All right, then. It's the moment of truth.

1807
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,775
Press one for the Chinese cuisine Huntrix,
Jung Ji-sun and Park Eun-yeong.

1808
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:35,811
Press two for Sapa Boys,
Kim Poong and Lim Tae-hun.

1809
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:39,381
Will it be two to zero or one to one?

1810
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,682
-I pressed it.
-You did?

1811
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,418
-He's still thinking.
-All right.

1812
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,086
-Five. Four.
-Four.

1813
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,488
He chose one.

1814
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:49,024
Are they on the same page?

1815
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,026
This time…

1816
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,728
Once again, it's different.

1817
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,930
-My gosh!
-They chose different teams.

1818
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:55,998
WE CHOSE DIFFERENT TEAMS!

1819
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,767
GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTING

1820
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,036
We'll give you a chance to discuss.

1821
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,706
Look at them,
sitting across from each other.

1822
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,143
-You're sweating again after finishing it?
-He's sweating.

1823
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,914
My face rarely sweats even when I perform.

1824
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,382
Even during your concerts?

1825
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,951
It was the first time this year
that my face got sweaty.

1826
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,487
-His sweat glands are at work.
-It must've been spicy.

1827
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,590
-Are you done? They've decided.
-Are you?

1828
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,125
-All right.
-So?

1829
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,960
What's your final decision?

1830
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:25,861
Please press one.

1831
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,498
DECISION MADE

1832
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,901
Let's find out. Show us!

1833
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,304
Let's find out who the winner is.

1834
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,805
K-food Chinese cuisine Hunters.

1835
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,807
-This was a team round for Chinese food.
-No way.

1836
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:42,811
-We have to save Eun-yeong's molar.
-Ji-sun's win streak is at stake.

1837
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:46,048
If she loses today,
she'll lose that streak.

1838
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:50,519
If Poong wins,
he'll become the sole second place again.

1839
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:52,354
MANY THINGS ARE AT STAKE

1840
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,623
Gosh. Hey, wait.

1841
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,558
His sole second place and her molar.

1842
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,161
-Their fate has been decided.
-Her molar.

1843
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:02,898
Which side did MARK and CHENLE choose?

1844
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:04,266
No way.

1845
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,534
Who won?

1846
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,568
Who will it be?

1847
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,570
Which team won?

1848
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,606
Who is it?

1849
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,241
WHOA

1850
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,542
Who is it?

1851
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,377
JUNG JI-SUN, PARK EUN-YEONG WINS

1852
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,912
JUNG JI-SUN, PARK EUN-YEONG'S
GOLDEN DIM SUM WINS

1853
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,415
Ji-sun and Eun-yeong take the victory!

1854
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,251
CONGRATULATIONS

1855
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,819
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1856
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,822
I saved my molar.

1857
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,590
This means

1858
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,826
Chef Ji-sun saved her winning streak,

1859
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,795
and Chef Eun-yeong saved her molar.

1860
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,533
Please put stars on them!

1861
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,368
-It was so delicious.
-All right!

1862
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,203
Ji-sun and Eun-yeong.

1863
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,607
Please take both the star
and the golden Spam set.

1864
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,609
-The Spam too.
-Thank you so much.

1865
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,178
-Congratulations!
-It was delicious.

1866
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:51,613
HIS REAL SELF HOLDS A SURPRISE?

1867
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,181
You can make that kind of voice too!

1868
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,483
-My name is Lee Yong-bok.
-You're Yong-bok?

1869
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,784
Yong-bok!

1870
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,185
His high voice sounds like Yong-bok.

1871
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,121
Lee Know's nicknamed Cook Lee Know.

1872
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:00,455
WOW

1873
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,124
I tried making those by watching videos.

1874
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,292
-Really?
-He's serious.

1875
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:04,860
I love sweets so much.

1876
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:05,861
That's amazing.

1877
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:09,298
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin
for Lee Know and Felix!

1878
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,600
I can smell something delicious over here.

1879
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,701
FULL OF EXPECTATION

1880
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,036
-May I use UNICHEF?
-He's using it!

1881
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,203
Can you open this?

1882
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,805
My gosh.

1883
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,540
WHAT'S THE DESSERT
THAT MADE THEM GO CRAZY?

1884
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,343
-I want to trigger his Poongphobia.
-That's Kwon Poong!

1885
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,345
-That's how Poong chops.
-He reminds me of Poong.

1886
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,514
You've learned well.

1887
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,415
Oh, please.

1888
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,450
Don't come near me!

1889
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:29,451
It's Poong's curse!

1890
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,653
HOW WILL THEIR BATTLE GO
WITH THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTACK?

1891
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,191
-My gosh!
-What is it?

1892
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,627
-What's it like? He fainted.
-Is it good?

1893
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,830
-It's good!
-My gosh.

1894
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:56,278
