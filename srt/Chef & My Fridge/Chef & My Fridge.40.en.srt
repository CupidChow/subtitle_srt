PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,118
CHENLE AND MARK OF NCT

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,153
FELIX AND LEE KNOW OF STRAY KIDS

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,921
You grew up in Canada, right?

5
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,056
Felix, in Australia, correct?

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,958
Lee Know, which country…

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,993
I'm from Daegot-myeon, Gimpo.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,696
SHOUT OUT TO GIMPO

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:30,964
I love to cook.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,899
He'd even text me at 5 a.m.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,035
So I decided to make him my apprentice.

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,938
He wanted every chef's number today.

13
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,774
He's more like a zealot.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,509
A FULL FRIDGE

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,178
INGREDIENTS YOU'D SEE IN A RESTAURANT

16
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,547
He has almost all the ingredients
a Chinese restaurant would keep.

17
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,583
HOW ABOUT STRAY KIDS' FRIDGE?

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,252
We're here with K-Pop Mainstream Hunters,

19
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,320
MARK and CHENLE of NCT,

20
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,258
as well as Lee Know and Felix
of Stray Kids.

21
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,727
Stray Kids is amazingly popular
all around the globe.

22
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,963
They recently became the first K-pop group

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,734
to perform at Stade de France
and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,202
with their exclusive concert.

25
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,006
It's quite meaningful for us too.

26
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,341
It was the very stadium
where Son Heung-min played.

27
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,376
That's right.

28
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,511
Most countries where soccer is popular

29
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,314
rarely rent out their stadium
for other occasions, almost never.

30
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,049
It's amazing that you did that.

31
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,052
It was such an honorable occasion.

32
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,356
We got to see the locker room
where Son Heung-min used,

33
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,358
and we got to use the shower too.

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,894
The second from the right is Son's locker.

35
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,997
We just trickled some water,
washed our hands,

36
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,399
and put it back.

37
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,002
-But it was such a beautiful venue.
-Cute.

38
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,340
Your newest album, KARMA,

39
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,910
debuted in the Billboard 200
at first place.

40
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,246
That's amazing.

41
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,349
This is the first time
in the history of K-pop

42
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,884
for a group to hit the top seven times.

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,486
-Yes.
-It's the first time.

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,054
The article came out today.

45
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,422
-This morning.
-This morning, right?

46
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,890
I saw it and was surprised.

47
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,694
Many reporters are
probably dying to get an interview,

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,429
but allow us to do it first.

49
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,164
Oh, nice. Let's do it.

50
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,166
We're from <i>Chef & My Fridge</i><i>Daily</i>.

51
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,535
How do you two feel?

52
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,872
This is an experience
we never thought we could have.

53
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,007
I am truly happy.

54
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,809
People in Gimpo must be happy for you.

55
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,944
-Of course.
-They must be out of control.

56
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,982
-They should put up a banner.
-He's the pride of Daegot-myeon.

57
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,618
I want to thank everyone.

58
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,319
Isn't this an amazing record?

59
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:37,190
One of our chefs has kept an eye on Felix

60
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,893
and even claimed to be a fan.

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,227
Who is it?

62
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,129
-Is it you again?
-It's not me.

63
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,565
-This time, it isn't you?
-It's not?

64
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,900
It's not you?

65
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,535
It's Chef Jong-won.

66
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,969
IT'S ME

67
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,173
I got here today
while listening to "CEREMONY."

68
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,541
It feels like

69
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,810
he's melting my ears
just by sitting next to me.

70
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,746
You got yourself a nickname

71
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,148
thanks to your low voice.
What's "That Part Guy"?

72
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,550
-That Part Guy.
-Oh.

73
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:07,053
It's because he usually gets
the most iconic part.

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,423
-I see. That Part Guy.
-They go, "So that's him."

75
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,193
I heard Jong-won prepared something
to ask Felix for a favor.

76
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,195
-A favor?
-What did you prepare?

77
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,665
I wanted to ask him
to do the opening line in English.

78
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,802
THE SIGNATURE OPENING LINE
OF CHEF & MY FRIDGE

79
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,904
-He'll need the lines, then.
-I have it.

80
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,439
You prepared it?

81
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,209
-He brought it himself.
-You did prepped it in English?

82
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,777
-Thank you so much.
-He did.

83
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,146
-Can you do it for us, Felix?
-That's so cool.

84
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,681
A project to elevate

85
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,684
the status of leftover ingredients
in your refrigerator!

86
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,354
Korea's top chefs will thoroughly
clean out your fridge inside out!

87
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,690
The classy cooking talk show has returned.

88
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,391
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

89
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,563
HIS VOICE MELTS US

90
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,665
-<i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.
-He's got something in his voice.

91
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,667
Were you thrown off
by his extremely low voice

92
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,768
when you two first met?

93
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,972
His voice wasn't this low
when he first spoke to me.

94
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,206
-It wasn't?
-No?

95
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,610
I become more bubbly
when I'm with my members

96
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,578
-Right.
-as we hang out together.

97
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,713
When we do that,

98
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,582
I sometimes talk like,
"Hey! What is this?"

99
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,951
-You can make that kind of voice too!
-I can.

100
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,419
He's like, "Hey! What is this?"

101
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,488
FAMILIAR ALL OF A SUDDEN

102
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,924
Felix is nicknamed That Part Guy,

103
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,126
while Lee Know's nicknamed Cook Lee Know.

104
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,395
-Is he good at cooking?
-Yes.

105
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,130
I'm not sure if he's as good as CHENLE,

106
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,766
but he's called Cook Lee Know
because he's good at cooking.

107
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,403
There was one memorable dish
he made for me.

108
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,804
On my birthday,

109
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,307
-he made Beef Wellington for me.
-Beef Wellington?

110
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,642
-He made that?
-Really?

111
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,210
-That's amazing.
-It was

112
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,545
definitely the most delicious
Beef Wellington

113
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,348
I've ever had in my life.

114
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,583
That means he's a good cook.

115
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,684
Is that amazing, CHENLE?

116
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,121
-It was a dish I wanted to learn to make.
-Beef Wellington?

117
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,622
CHENLE gave you his approval.

118
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,057
Thank you so much.

119
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,358
NO, IT'S NOT THAT

120
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,428
-He gave his approval.
-I'm not that good at cooking.

121
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,929
-He'll message him too.
-He approves.

122
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,431
Will you give him your number?

123
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,432
FOR LATE-NIGHT MESSAGES?

124
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,401
You're done getting good sleep!

125
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,935
You won't be able to sleep anymore.

126
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,406
We have a picture of dishes Lee Know made.

127
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,042
-So there's proof?
-Yes, there's proof.

128
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,311
-What he made.
-I feel like I'm getting evaluated.

129
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,545
There are Lee Know's dishes!

130
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,947
TA-DA

131
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,750
-Can you tell us about these?
-They look amazing.

132
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,987
The first picture is Beef Wellington,
the one I made on Yong-bok's birthday.

133
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,155
Who's Yong-bok?

134
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,956
-Me.
-Felix.

135
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,327
-Your name is Yong-bok?
-Yong-bok?

136
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,929
My Korean name is Lee Yong-bok.

137
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,532
-You're Yong-bok?
-My grandfather gave me that name.

138
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,600
-Yong-bok.
-It sounds much more neighborly.

139
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,637
He said, "He has to be that name!"

140
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,871
"You must!"

141
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,574
-"You must be Yong-bok!"
-"My grandson must be Yong-bok!"

142
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,144
Yes, and my mother cried
her heart out for the next six months.

143
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,980
-The name's nice. It has a twist.
-How many siblings do you have?

144
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,249
I have one older sister
and one younger sister.

145
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,485
What are their names?

146
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,854
My older sister is Lee Ji-su,

147
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,456
and my younger sister is Lee Ji-min.

148
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,926
-They both sound ordinary.
-Why did your grandpa insist on your name?

149
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,195
-Why did he come up with that?
-Why did he…

150
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,364
He expected a name like Yong-yeo.

151
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,466
Yes, I thought they'd be called Yong-yeo.

152
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,335
He had to give me a name that ends in Bok
because that was

153
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,170
the common syllable for men
in my generation.

154
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,705
It was the generational thing.

155
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,707
-Names like Man-bok.
-He's from a good family.

156
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,477
-Yes, only prestigious families do that.
-His family keeps tradition.

157
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,346
-So that was the dish Yong-bok loved?
-Yes.

158
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,549
-The one Lee Know made for Yong-bok.
-On his birthday.

159
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,952
-Beef Wellington.
-It looks perfect.

160
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,286
The meat is finished nicely.

161
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,821
I think he's a better cook than me.

162
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,490
Where are photos of CHENLE's dishes?

163
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,158
-I don't take pictures.
-You don't?

164
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,993
What a shame.

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,963
MARK feels more wronged than CHENLE.

166
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,233
"CHENLE is really good too! My gosh."

167
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,903
-"Where are the photos? What about him?"
-"Why doesn't he have photos?"

168
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,839
What a shame. Where are his photos?

169
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,940
CHENLE's photos.

170
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,409
We have another picture.

171
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,345
-You're also into baking.
-Yes.

172
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,880
He's serious about it.

173
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,948
WHOA

174
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:56,849
He's dead serious.

175
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,051
You should run a bakery in Gimpo.

176
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,653
You seem like a professional baker.

177
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,455
I tried making those by watching videos.

178
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,356
HE TAUGHT HIMSELF!

179
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,792
-Those are muffins.
-I just noticed

180
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,860
how CHENLE is no longer smiling.

181
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,529
He's the only one.

182
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,165
-I just glanced at him.
-I noticed too.

183
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,868
-No, not at all. He's so…
-Everyone is amazed but him.

184
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,704
-Please don't frame it in that way.
-No?

185
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,874
-We're only here to enjoy the dishes.
-Is that so?

186
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,743
CHENLE, do you not bake?

187
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,344
-I can do it.
-You can?

188
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,847
-He knows how to bake!
-He says he knows.

189
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,649
MARK just asked not frame it like that.

190
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,083
-Was that the case?
-Yes.

191
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,952
-I do know how to bake.
-In that case,

192
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,254
I'll take pictures from now on…

193
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,489
-Please do.
-…because he doesn't.

194
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,924
It's a shame only I saw them.

195
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,592
Please send us pictures next time.

196
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,828
-I finally realized what my role is.
-Okay.

197
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,363
Lee Know, did you start baking

198
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,832
because of Felix?

199
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,868
It was when Yong-bok was
really into making brownies,

200
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,503
-so I thought…
-He bakes brownies?

201
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,804
-They're so good.
-I should start.

202
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,839
-Really?
-Really.

203
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,142
A while ago, it must've been
during an awards show,

204
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,312
Felix baked a batch of brownies for NCT
and gave them to us.

205
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,914
-They were so good.
-I thought he was such an angel.

206
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,851
I feel kind of bad for CHENLE again.

207
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,453
Felix also has pictures
of his baked goods.

208
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,021
Come on!

209
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,190
-Why doesn't NCT have pictures?
-He didn't take pictures.

210
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,161
I have seen so many dishes
CHENLE made with my eyes,

211
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,597
-but pictures…
-Why is this happening to them?

212
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,965
Show us Yong-bok's picture.

213
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,867
-Should we show it or not?
-Sure.

214
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,002
-I think we need your approval.
-Just…

215
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,904
-Show us one last picture.
-One last one.

216
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,639
-Just this one.
-Okay.

217
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,541
-His baked goods.
-Yong-bok's picture.

218
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,243
Let's take a look.

219
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,812
OH MY

220
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,082
-But I keep looking at the lower half.
-Let's see.

221
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,451
-He's good at everything, even at cooking.
-They look great.

222
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,352
They look delicious.

223
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,955
The first dessert
I've ever made was brownies.

224
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,992
-So I topped it with ice cream.
-Ice cream.

225
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,161
And then I topped it
with caramel drizzle too.

226
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,763
It must be insanely good.

227
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,633
-What's that?
-Those are chocolate chip cookies,

228
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,303
and the last one is a brownie cake
I baked for my fans as a present.

229
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,172
-I wanted to thank them with the photo,
-By sending that photo.

230
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,941
-with the "I love you" candles.
-How cool.

231
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,342
-That's so cool.
-I see.

232
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,511
So CHENLE, you don't have
pictures like these?

233
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,813
CHENLE's pictures? I'll show them to you.

234
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,550
-Show us.
-Yes, show us some.

235
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,751
That's so touching.

236
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,886
This is a photo that came in at 5 a.m.

237
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,521
HE REALLY SENT IT AT 5 A.M.

238
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:20,126
We wouldn't have gotten to see these
if not for Chef Hyun-suk.

239
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,994
What a great teacher-apprentice
relationship.

240
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,629
-Thank you.
-Yes.

241
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,165
JYP Entertainment's popular idol group,

242
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,135
Stray Kids' Cook Lee Know

243
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,772
and Master Baker Yong-bok
have presented their fridges to us.

244
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,974
-Master Baker Yong-bok?
-Master Baker?

245
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,276
Do you two live alone now?

246
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,412
-We're in dorms.
-We live in dorms,

247
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,881
but the eight of us split into twos.

248
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,917
-We're living in different places.
-You two don't live together.

249
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,919
We also combined our fridges

250
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,222
with the ingredients I often use
and what he likes to eat.

251
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,424
You two combined yours too.

252
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,293
I look forward to seeing
another unique fridge today.

253
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,262
Why don't we take a look?

254
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,397
We present the fridge

255
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,666
of two members of Stray Kids!

256
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,068
FULL OF ANTICIPATION

257
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,469
Stray Kids' fridge!

258
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,107
ORGANIZED YET EMPTY HERE AND THERE

259
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,109
There's nothing on this side.

260
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,178
Look over here. What's going on?

261
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,913
-What's going on here?
-Right here?

262
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,781
-Right there.
-Are they minimalists?

263
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,284
It looks much emptier than last week.

264
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,320
Goodness. Did we have grand expectations?

265
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,856
We often perform abroad

266
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,691
-and ingredients spoil.
-Right.

267
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,928
-That's true.
-I always end up throwing everything out.

268
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,464
-We only keep simple ingredients.
-Yes.

269
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,432
But we're grateful to see this much food.

270
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,834
-It's neatly organized.
-It is.

271
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,804
The top two shelves,
up until the bananas, are Yong-bok's food.

272
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,773
and the rest of the shelves are mine.

273
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,841
These are Lee Know's.

274
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,311
For the freezer, the top two are mine,
and the lower part is Yong-bok's.

275
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,613
-These right here.
-The meat.

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,883
The first shelf. This must be…

277
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,120
I love shabu-shabu, so…

278
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,321
Shabu-shabu.

279
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,057
I have to stay in shape,

280
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,394
so I just eat a simple meal
like shabu-shabu.

281
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,095
I like that sweet chili sauce,

282
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,198
-so I usually dip it in that.
-I see.

283
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,367
-Yes, I see three bottles of the sauce.
-You're right.

284
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,036
-He had those there.
-Yes.

285
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,471
-They're the same sauce. Yes.
-He likes this chili sauce.

286
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,939
Do you enjoy this one? What's this?

287
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,009
I recently went to Haidilao Hotpot
and tried coconut milk for the first time,

288
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,312
-and it was so delicious.
-I feel you.

289
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,681
-I feel you.
-Back then,

290
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,751
I somehow ended up trying that
and realized it was better than I thought.

291
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,754
-I got ten cans…
-Coconut milk.

292
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,589
…and I drink it often.

293
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,959
Do you often order food
through a delivery app?

294
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,130
I often do,
because we're often working abroad.

295
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,899
What do you usually order?

296
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,668
I often order shabu-shabu,

297
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,005
and I also get steak pretty often.

298
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,540
-Pasta. Cream pasta.
-Pasta?

299
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,843
-I really love cream pasta.
-I see.

300
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,780
Through my tour, I found out
cream pasta tastes different by country,

301
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,784
so they're all different
in countries like France, Italy, and more.

302
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:04,190
-There's fresh cream on the second shelf.
-There's fresh cream.

303
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,259
The most recent thing I want to bake

304
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:12,198
is called banana bread,
something I had often in Australia.

305
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,266
So those are the ingredients…
One moment.

306
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,569
So those are the ingredients…
One moment.

307
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,870
THE MASTER BAKER GETS UP

308
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,805
-With this?
-He must have a recipe.

309
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,308
-I sometimes drink banana milk as is.
-You drink this.

310
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,679
And the banana.
I have to use lots of flour

311
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,014
to make baked goods.

312
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,817
So I'm trying to make banana bread soon.

313
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,452
-You use that to bake.
-For baking.

314
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,187
That's why he has cake flour.

315
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,257
That's Master Baker Yong-bok.

316
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,892
These all look like baking supplies.

317
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,528
Yes, I have lots baking supplies.

318
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,131
-The thing is, I really love desserts,
-Desserts.

319
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,532
such as ice cream,

320
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,502
French toast, and more.

321
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,905
I have a huge thing
on how I always have to have dessert

322
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,573
as soon as I finish my meal.

323
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,408
When I bake brownies,

324
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,711
I need cocoa powder,

325
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,815
and I always add
a bit of instant coffee to add a scent.

326
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,318
I finish it off
with a hint of sweet and saltiness

327
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,787
by sprinkling kosher salt.

328
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,955
HIS BROWNIE RECIPE IS DIFFERENT

329
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,991
Maple syrup for French toast.

330
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,226
Almond powder.

331
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,694
I have baking soda too.

332
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,863
I like to use organic brown sugar.

333
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,199
LOTS OF BAKING SUPPLIES

334
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,601
I'm also big on steak,

335
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,637
-so I prepared this.
-It looks like this.

336
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,139
-I'm into garlic steak.
-Garlic steak.

337
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,408
I also like to cook a simple steak

338
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,878
-along with thyme and rosemary.
-I see.

339
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,880
Next up, Lee Know.

340
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,216
Please have a seat, Master Baker.

341
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,952
That was all for Yong-bok,
and it's now Lee Know's time.

342
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,688
-He's good at explaining.
-He is.

343
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,057
-He has things to cook with.
-He does.

344
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,592
And now, Lee Know's stuff.

345
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,929
He also has lots of things here.

346
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,664
-Some sauces.
-Sauces.

347
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,365
And cheddar.

348
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,567
Should I open this?

349
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,769
There are some veggies.

350
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,271
-Mushrooms.
-And onions.

351
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,906
What are these called?

352
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,908
-Shallots.
-Shallots.

353
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,377
-Shallots?
-He has shallots?

354
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,946
What do you use it for?

355
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,480
I use them to make Beef Wellington,

356
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,483
and they're a good substitute for onions.

357
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,052
Right. They're similar.

358
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,155
-These two shelves are yours too, right?
-You're right.

359
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,890
-Meat. Beef.
-Yes.

360
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,525
-These are drumsticks.
-Chicken.

361
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,393
I always have to keep meat around.

362
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,395
Do you usually grill it?

363
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,564
I thaw the drumsticks in the fridge

364
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,266
the night before.

365
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,302
Then I start grilling it skin first
without grease,

366
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,671
because enough fat comes out
and makes it crispy.

367
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,307
-He knows how to cook it properly.
-I do that often.

368
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,178
It's also nice to cook some veggies
like green onion in the grease.

369
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,981
-Cook Lee Know.
-He has his tips.

370
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,282
Room temperature ingredients.

371
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,252
Those are mine.

372
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,755
Are you sure you brought this?

373
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,624
Yes, well, the thing is…

374
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,927
This doesn't match
the food you showed us in the photo.

375
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,897
-What's bad about MSG?
-He's leaning toward a knockoff cook.

376
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,367
-I just use it to make egg soup.
-Using MSG…

377
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,236
It's easy to make egg soup by using that.

378
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,638
I use it only then.

379
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,139
-Only to make egg soup?
-Yes.

380
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,440
ACKNOWLEDGED

381
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,110
All right, then.
That's everything in their fridge.

382
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,178
FINISHED INSPECTING
LEE KNOW AND FELIX'S FRIDGE

383
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,850
What kind of dishes
do they want to eat today?

384
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,985
Here are their orders.

385
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,687
Lee Know and Felix.

386
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,156
Hooray! A dish that calls for a ceremony.

387
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,659
This is a part of your lyrics, right?

388
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,994
-I loved that part.
-Our new song.

389
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,997
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Hooray! Something like that.

390
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,968
I wanted to ask you to make a dish so good

391
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,170
that we'll want to put on a ceremony.

392
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,405
-And fun.
-So that's my order.

393
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,940
Can you show us the moves?

394
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,008
Hah! Cere…

395
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,144
"Karma." You know.

396
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,545
-Is this it?
-Look at him.

397
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,681
You didn't do it right
if they don't go, "Hooray!"

398
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,848
What's the next order?

399
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,053
-Dessert, that's very nice.
-That's hard.

400
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,454
-Very nice.
-I knew I'd see dessert.

401
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,022
-That's hard.
-That's very nice.

402
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,825
When I get full after a meal,

403
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,294
I always find myself craving some dessert.

404
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,396
And when I have a delicious bite,

405
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,799
I'd say something like,
"That's very nice."

406
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,335
I always say things like that
without thinking too.

407
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,937
Desserts that'll make you go,
"That's very nice."

408
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,138
-Dessert. Right.
-Yes.

409
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,406
Right now,

410
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,310
Ho-young, Jong-won,
Nam-no, and Sung-jun remain.

411
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,181
I'll join the dessert round,
"Dessert, that's very nice."

412
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,917
-The dessert round.
-Okay.

413
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,353
-It's an honor.
-Jong-won takes the dessert round.

414
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,021
I'll make them say, "Hooray!"

415
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,223
NAM-NO PICKS
HOORAY! A DISH THAT CALLS FOR A CEREMONY

416
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,225
-Make them say, "Hooray!"
-It suits you.

417
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,028
I have to run away from Chef Jong-won.

418
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,896
The two took different rounds.

419
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,732
-I'll go first.
-Sung-jun?

420
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,400
RAISES HIS HAND FIRST

421
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,402
I'll take the top.

422
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,903
SUNG-JUN PICKS
HOORAY! A DISH THAT CALLS FOR A CEREMONY

423
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,073
I once fought him
and had to change my hair color,

424
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,642
-so I must get my revenge.
-It's a return match.

425
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,944
Do you feel confident today?

426
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,580
Chef Ho-young, are you okay
with the dessert round?

427
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,715
-Dessert?
-I was thinking for a moment.

428
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,218
-He'll make dessert?
-He was trying to pick one.

429
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,552
You should've moved faster.

430
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,423
I'll have to pull out a dessert
recipe from my pocket.

431
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,959
-The dessert round.
-He seems so chill.

432
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,428
And Felix,

433
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,163
are you an ambassador for UNICEF?

434
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,498
-Are you?
-I am.

435
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,968
Yes, I've volunteered with UNICEF,

436
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,870
and I've been creating projects.

437
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,973
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> also has
a system called UNICHEF.

438
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,541
Should we pull it out?

439
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,045
-Should we make things lively today?
-Should we implement UNICHEF today?

440
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,881
You can call for UNICHEF
if you need help at all times.

441
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,848
-That's great.
-All right.

442
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,984
The first round,
"Hooray! A dish that calls for a ceremony"

443
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,218
is between Nam-no and Sung-jun.

444
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,854
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

445
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,960
This is the first round of the cook-off
with ingredients found in the fridge

446
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,229
provided by Lee Know
and Felix of Stray Kids.

447
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,765
A chef whose name rhymes
with Cook Lee Know, Yoon Nam-no,

448
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,637
is up against the low voice
of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>, Kwon Sung-jun.

449
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,373
This is their third battle.

450
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,275
Chef Nam-no has won

451
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,011
the previous two rounds they fought.

452
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,647
He's the Mafia killer.

453
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,350
Sung-jun got utterly humiliated,
although he was the winner

454
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,087
-of <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.
-Right.

455
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,322
He suffered with all kinds
of ridicule and mockery.

456
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,660
Nam-no has a knack for mocking people.

457
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,896
Sung-jun has been suffering
from a total defeat.

458
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,199
Also, Chef Nam-no has done well

459
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,635
whenever members of idol groups came.

460
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,105
HOSHI and WOOZI of SEVENTEEN

461
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,474
and Doh Kyung-soo of EXO

462
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,075
both picked Nam-no.

463
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,543
NAM-NO DOMINATED SUNG-JUN!

464
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,414
This must mean Chef Sung-jun
isn't a good match with idol groups.

465
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,715
-Right?
-You're right.

466
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,383
Actually, I think

467
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,919
I'm a better match with girl groups
instead of boy bands.

468
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,656
-Are you sure you want to say that?
-It's just the beginning.

469
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,325
He's going to give up already?

470
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,926
You've lost the girl group rounds too.

471
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,629
You lost both times
when Yoona and Jang Won-young came.

472
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,563
What's going on?

473
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,034
Anyway, Chef Sung-jun prepared something
to defeat Nam-no today.

474
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,903
He didn't come empty-handed. What is it?

475
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,374
First of all,
I wanted to trigger his Poongphobia.

476
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,543
-Yes?
-So I have Poong's kitchen knife here.

477
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,044
Are you using his knife?

478
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,346
-Also…
-Why did you say yes?

479
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,815
…if it's all right,
I'd like to borrow his glasses.

480
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,216
Aren't those prescribed?

481
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,318
-These are just the frames.
-They are?

482
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,319
EMPTY GLASSES

483
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,255
-Just the frames.
-It has no lenses.

484
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,223
No one recognizes me without these.

485
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,093
So he wants to borrow Poong's glasses.

486
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,227
-I got it.
-Okay. Fine.

487
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,296
KIM POONG'S GLASSES

488
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,399
Kim Poong's knife and glasses.

489
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,169
-And that pose.
-That's right.

490
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,171
-It's his signature pose.
-I won.

491
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,340
-You're right.
-Yes.

492
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,243
-It's his signature pose.
-I won.

493
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,113
CHEF KWON POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
SHABU-SHABU VEGGIES, BROTH, BEEF, NOODLES

494
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,248
BEEF TENDERLOIN, SHALLOTS, NUTMEG,
PARSLEY, FRESH CREAM, PARMESAN

495
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,350
Chef Kwon Poong.

496
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,119
What are you making today?

497
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,555
-I can't look at him.
-I prepared a dish called

498
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,656
Poong, Shabu, and I Are One.

499
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,357
Poong, Shabu, and I Are One?

500
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,959
He's now sticking with him?

501
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,628
I learned it from my teacher,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

502
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,263
-His teacher?
-He's your teacher?

503
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,831
He said he liked shabu-shabu,

504
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,668
so I'm going to use
shabu-shabu ingredients to make pasta.

505
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,004
I'll top it with meat,
which Lee Know likes,

506
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,839
combined with noodles, what Felix likes.

507
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,007
What are you using as pasta?

508
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,011
I'll use the noodles that came
with the shabu-shabu kit.

509
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,681
-Yes, there are noodles.
-I see.

510
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,584
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS: RIB EYE,
BEEF TENDERLOIN, SHABU-SHABU VEGGIES

511
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,686
EGG SOY SAUCE, SHREDDED CHEESE,
ALMOND POWDER, PECANS

512
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,387
My dish is called

513
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,855
Maniac's Godly Menu.

514
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,925
Maniac's Godly Menu?

515
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,160
LIKE STRAY KIDS' SONG

516
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,129
He makes a reference just like that.

517
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,164
That's a crazy name.

518
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,000
What I'm going to make is called <i>tsukune</i>.

519
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,568
-Tsukune?
-Yes.

520
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,303
It's Japanese-style meatball skewers,

521
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,472
often made with chicken.

522
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,809
However, this is a special meal,
so I plan to use some beef.

523
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,245
And to make them
automatically scream, "Hooray,"

524
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,981
I'll use beef and cheese
to make some fries.

525
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,282
I see.

526
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,417
They wanted a dish
that makes them go, "Hooray!"

527
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,354
-Hooray!
-A dish that calls for a ceremony.

528
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,590
After you try both dishes,
what kind of a celebration

529
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,227
can we expect to see if it tastes good?
Did you come prepared?

530
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,063
-How about the kiss the ring celebration?
-Kiss the ring?

531
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,065
We'll do it for our fans, STAY.

532
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,601
-For STAY.
-That sounds wonderful. How cool is that?

533
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,671
We'll begin the cook-off now.

534
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,739
Three consecutive wins.

535
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,341
IN THAT CASE!

536
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,476
All right.

537
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,877
RE-EQUIPPED WITH HIS WEAPON

538
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,312
He's holding the knife.

539
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,748
He's trying so hard to mess with my mind.

540
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,118
Do I look that ridiculous?

541
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,488
-This man will make a godly dish…
-Stop looking at me.

542
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,591
…and become a god to Sung-jun,
Cook Lee Know of the show, Yoon Nam-no.

543
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,826
But this man has a plan

544
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,396
to trigger Poongphobia
by mimicking everything Kim Poong does.

545
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,333
The Taste-rix of the show,
Kwon Sung-jun is up against him.

546
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,637
Which one of them will win
and shout, "Hooray"?

547
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,840
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

548
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,376
EXCITED

549
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,878
Begin!

550
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,046
For three consecutive wins!

551
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,116
-You're allowed to use UNICHEF…
-I want to watch them.

552
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,985
…for a minute during your cook-off.

553
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,553
You get a minute.

554
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,121
I'll use it now.

555
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,023
-Can you help me with these?
-These?

556
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,258
You're using UNICHEF?

557
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,492
Yes, I just did.

558
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,328
Show us the time limit for UNICHEF!

559
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,096
-One minute!
-You get one minute.

560
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,066
Sung-jun…
No, Nam-no uses his chance right away.

561
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,234
-He used a minute of UNICHEF.
-A minute.

562
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,469
Everything, including these.

563
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,705
-Nam-no has used the chance.
-The butter.

564
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,906
AND THIS MAN!

565
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,342
If Sung-jun plans on cooking like Poong…

566
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:27,379
-Yes?
-…he'll do it the unorthodox way, right?

567
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,514
-He'll need some sloppy moves.
-He needs to.

568
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,717
-Yes.
-That's what I usually do.

569
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,784
Right.

570
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,288
Goodness.

571
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,522
1. GRIND SHABU-SHABU VEGETABLES

572
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,925
POONG WOULD HANDLE EVERYTHING
WITH A SINGLE KNIFE

573
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,626
What's he doing? What's he grinding?

574
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,196
-He ground the shabu-shabu veggies.
-What?

575
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,664
Shabu-shabu veggies?

576
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,999
2. GRIND BEEF CHUCK IN A BLENDER

577
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,801
What's that going to taste like?

578
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,938
Chef Nam-no implements UNICHEF
as soon as he begins.

579
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,474
He's working on green onion.

580
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,077
THE 8TH BUTTER

581
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,312
DONE!

582
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,080
-Do you need anything else?
-No.

583
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,949
You still have some more time left!

584
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,117
He doesn't need me.

585
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,551
-He doesn't?
-He doesn't need you.

586
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,120
I'm all done.

587
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,055
HE BEGINS TO COOK THE GODLY MENU!

588
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,524
Is Nam-no making the sauce?

589
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,694
He's mixing soy sauce, sugar,
garlic, and ginger for the sauce.

590
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,696
-I see.
-It's the <i>tsukune</i> sauce.

591
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:18,764
TSUKUNE SAUCE!

592
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,565
Onion? He's using an onion.

593
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,368
Nam-no is trying to cut the onion
into a certain shape.

594
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,537
He's only using the outer layer.

595
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,240
He'll probably fill the onion
with the meatball mixture.

596
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,176
CHOPPING NAPA CABBAGE
INTO BITE-SIZE PIECES

597
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,577
DONE WITH VEGGIES! AND BEAN SPROUTS!

598
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,013
Sung-jun isn't in a rush.

599
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,783
THIS IS HOW A TOP CHEF CHOPS SHALLOTS!

600
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,988
-He still can't give up on looking cool.
-No.

601
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,857
-He should be sloppier.
-He should be, right?

602
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,125
He's still too good.

603
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,627
He looks too professional.

604
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,061
How can you be "too professional?"

605
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,098
He has to be sloppier
in order to trigger Nam-no.

606
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,734
He needs to look rushed too.

607
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,070
-And run about in confusion.
-And say things like, "Uh-oh."

608
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,206
-Also, "Shoot. Whatever!"
-What?

609
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,908
It's not easy.

610
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,776
Hold on.

611
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,877
LOOKING AROUND!

612
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,313
-That was good. You looked awful.
-That was similar.

613
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,781
Hey, wait.

614
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,617
Yes, that's it. That's the right vibe.

615
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,553
-Darn it.
-Is he turning into Poong?

616
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,388
We're starting to see Poong in him.

617
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,723
Hey, the meat.

618
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,392
-He's using the meat.
-Start.

619
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,928
-Are you making steak too?
-Yes.

620
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:26,231
I'll cook something
that's easy for you to do at home.

621
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,365
I see.

622
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,602
A recipe that'll help you cook
a delicious piece of steak at home.

623
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,170
I'd like to use UNICHEF.

624
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,439
-I'd like to use UNICHEF.
-UNICHEF.

625
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,575
I want to ask Webtoon Artist Poong.

626
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,477
Me? What can I do?

627
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,912
He's using Poong for UNICHEF!

628
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,380
-Just come.
-Now?

629
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,449
Don't come near me!

630
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,851
Can you put this in here?

631
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,620
He blatantly brings Poong into the round.

632
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,489
There are two Poongs!

633
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,090
-Jeez.
-Two of Poong.

634
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,826
CHOSEN TO MESS WITH NAM-NO'S MIND!

635
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,828
-Just one?
-What's he doing?

636
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:57,863
Two packets.

637
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,364
-Two.
-He pours MSG into the water!

638
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,834
GO TO A PHARMACIST FOR MEDICINE,
GO TO POONG FOR MSG!

639
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,869
I BELIEVE IN YOU

640
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,103
THE SECOND PACKET!

641
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,439
-That's what I'm talking about!
-This one. Veggie broth.

642
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,540
-Veggie broth?
-Come on!

643
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,509
-The veggie broth.
-The broth? This one? Everything?

644
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,512
5. MIX MSG AND SHABU-SHABU BROTH
WITH BOILING WATER

645
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,679
Nam-no!

646
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,651
-You need to stop! I can't focus!
-All right! Here we go!

647
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,320
-Awesome job.
-Here we go!

648
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,456
-Go bug him.
-No, don't! Get away.

649
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,091
THE REAL POONG'S HERE!

650
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,192
Stop it!

651
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,996
WHAT A WAY TO USE THE UNICHEF

652
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,765
No, I mean it. Stop it!

653
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,900
Cut it out! I'm serious!

654
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:35,800
KNOCKDOWN

655
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,302
Please!

656
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,739
-He still has 30 seconds.
-He has 30 seconds.

657
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,574
-Please stop.
-You have some time left.

658
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,210
You have to hang in there
for 30 more seconds.

659
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,312
He still has 30 more seconds!

660
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,214
-He's serious.
-He's losing his focus.

661
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:50,949
Awesome job.

662
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,350
Yes, awesome job.

663
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,685
UNICHEF PLAN WORKED LIKE A CHARM

664
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,720
NOW MAKING FELIX'S FAVE, GARLIC STEAK!

665
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,255
-Am I doing this right?
-Yes.

666
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,224
-Can you deep-fry these too?
-Fry? Okay.

667
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,928
-Poong still has more time to help.
-Higher heat.

668
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,763
You have 20 seconds left.

669
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,897
The oil isn't hot enough.

670
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,133
You're right. The temperature…

671
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,569
-Okay.
-The oil doesn't seem hot enough.

672
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,203
It's a bit… Wait.

673
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,006
-Poong, you're done. Please come back.
-You've done enough.

674
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,675
You have 10 minutes and 30 seconds left.

675
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,376
KIM POONG-STYLE VEGGIE(?) BROTH

676
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,180
7. BOIL GROUND MEAT AND VEGGIE
WITH VEGGIE(?) BROTH AND CREAM

677
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,583
NAM-NO LOST ALL HIS FOCUS

678
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,052
WHINING AND SOBBING

679
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,355
HE TRIES TO GRIND BEEF IN A BLENDER, BUT…

680
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,623
What's with this?

681
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,625
-Why isn't this working?
-Is that not working?

682
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,762
The blender stopped working
soon after Poong visited the kitchen!

683
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,198
-This is Poong's curse!
-Poong's curse!

684
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,101
Nam-no is still traumatized by Poong!

685
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,402
HE'S ABOUT TO CRY…

686
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,405
If he's going to shake it himself,
why is he using the blender?

687
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,506
What can I do?

688
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,908
It wasn't my fault.

689
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,176
THANKFULLY, IT CAME OUT WELL

690
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,545
Okay. I'm done.

691
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,381
-You have ten minutes left.
-Yes, ten minutes.

692
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,150
Those meatballs usually use chicken,
but he's using beef today.

693
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,753
In Japan, you'll find a dish
called bell pepper <i>tsukune</i>,

694
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,422
pieces of bell pepper
stuffed with ground meat.

695
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,992
I think he'll stuff the onion
instead of bell pepper.

696
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,828
-Because they didn't have bell pepper.
-Just like that?

697
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,196
He's using onion instead.

698
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,699
-Meat and onion go well together.
-Yes.

699
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,670
SETTING THE TIMER FOR 2 MINUTES!

700
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,339
-I wonder what the steak is like.
-Right?

701
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,509
If you want to cook steak at home,
take a close look right now.

702
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,344
This is a great tip.

703
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,780
Chef Sung-jun is cooking steak.

704
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,482
How do you like your steak?

705
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,183
-About medium-rare.
-Medium-rare.

706
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,285
-The same for me.
-They like it the same way.

707
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,222
Both Felix and Lee Know
like their steak medium-rare.

708
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,891
Sung-jun begins to cook the noodles.

709
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,864
IN A FRENZY

710
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,098
PFFT…

711
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,567
AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF OLIVE OIL

712
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,770
IN GOES THE ONION TSUKUNE!

713
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,772
He's cooking them
with the meat faced down.

714
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,273
He turns them over and cooks those.

715
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,709
The timer.

716
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,045
What is this?

717
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,613
Why did you put this here?

718
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,014
1 SECOND, 2 SECONDS

719
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,449
LOSING 3 SECONDS

720
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,518
I didn't even need the timer!

721
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,388
He doesn't need a timer,
but Sung-jun left it next to him,

722
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,157
hiding it in secret.

723
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,526
Nam-no became flustered when it went off.

724
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,428
That was unexpectedly clever.

725
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,529
He's doing a great job.

726
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:22,033
-Sung-jun is the biggest cheater today.
-That's Kwon Poong for you.

727
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,201
Don't you feel anxious?

728
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,969
Damn it. Come on!

729
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,172
He's mimicking Poong 100%.

730
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,808
-You must feel anxious.
-Right.

731
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,876
He might have other moves up his sleeve.

732
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,045
-He's probably hiding something.
-Yes.

733
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:34,946
Jeez.

734
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,247
I'm running out of time.

735
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,284
Nam-no looks all shook up
after the timer incident.

736
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,218
He's losing his focus.

737
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,253
Yes. Cabbage and lots of other vegetables.

738
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,124
-Yes, I'm preparing the garnish.
-The garnish.

739
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,726
That looks good.

740
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,927
6. STIR-FRY VEGGIES IN TSUKUNE SAUCE

741
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,629
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds,
halfway through.

742
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,499
The steak. It looks nicely cooked.

743
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,801
GULP

744
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,303
That looks good.

745
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,205
The fried enoki looks great.

746
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,539
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

747
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,110
And the noodles…

748
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,845
He's done making pasta already.

749
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,180
He's doing that with <i>kal-guksu</i> noodles?

750
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,215
How fascinating.

751
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,850
DOENJANG

752
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,285
BUTTER HO-YOUNG PUT TOGETHER
AND ALMOND POWDER

753
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,554
He's adding lots of butter
mixed with <i>doenjang</i>

754
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,124
-into the vegetable stir-fry.
-He used <i>doenjang</i>?

755
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,358
I made <i>doenjang</i> butter.

756
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,227
Doenjang butter.

757
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,194
I need to see this.

758
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,530
THE BLONDE MEERKAT
GOES OUT FOR THE 2ND TIME

759
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,537
SMOKY VEGETABLE STIR-FRY!

760
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,938
My gosh.

761
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,373
IN A RUSH

762
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,008
GOLDEN BROWN TSUKUNE!

763
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,076
They look so good.

764
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,577
They look well-cooked.

765
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,213
These look so well-cooked.

766
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,384
-It's going off again.
-The timer.

767
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,187
-Come on!
-Why is it going off again?

768
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,556
Why is it going off again?

769
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,591
How many timers did you leave around?

770
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,362
-Sung-jun is desperate to win today.
-He's dead serious.

771
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,897
It's ringing every two minutes.

772
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,566
He just threw the timer on the ground.

773
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,135
-Don't throw my timer.
-The timer attacks come at intervals.

774
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,504
Kwon Poong.

775
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,772
THE KIM POONG-STYLE MOVE!

776
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,607
-Excellent.
-That's how Poong chops.

777
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,676
THRESHING THE KITCHEN KNIFE!

778
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,648
-He's chopping just like Poong.
-Why is he using the knife like that?

779
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,649
You're like Poong.

780
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:18,817
UP AND DOWN

781
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,619
-Excellent.
-That's how Poong chops.

782
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,288
PLEASED

783
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,790
-You've learned well.
-He learned how to chop like Poong.

784
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,993
HE'S BECOME KIM POONG!

785
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,029
-He chops like Poong.
-He slams the knife violently.

786
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,864
-He's Poong.
-The shape doesn't matter.

787
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,599
11. CHOP CABBAGE AND BOK CHOY
AND ADD TO PASTA

788
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,767
That looks good.

789
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,569
Doesn't it look great?

790
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,537
SIZZLE

791
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,007
He's done cooking the meatballs.

792
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,212
8. TOP ONION TSUKUNE WITH SHREDDED CHEESE
AND TOAST IN THE OVEN

793
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,414
He topped it with cheese
and put it in the oven.

794
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,015
-Gosh.
-I see.

795
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,084
-It looks…
-It went into the oven with cheese on top.

796
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,253
-He'll toast it once again.
-I see.

797
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,089
Felix can't take his eyes off him.

798
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,693
HE PUTS ON
A FANCY PERFORMANCE WITH THE FIRE

799
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,995
It looks burnt.

800
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,764
Seriously, stop talking to me.
You're torturing me right now.

801
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,633
-I can't even look at you.
-He's having a rough time.

802
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,803
NCT and Sung-ju, please go out there
and tell us what's going on.

803
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,906
-CHENLE, please get ready too.
-Please get ready to go out.

804
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,774
-We're on our way!
-Let's go!

805
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,276
I'm out here with NCT

806
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,044
for the five-minute interim check.

807
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,013
First, we take a look at both sides.

808
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,082
CHENLE FINALLY GETS TO BE
ON THE STAGE OF HIS DREAMS!

809
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,484
Now, let's see.

810
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,785
How will you use the egg yolk?

811
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,988
-It's the sauce.
-Which one looks better?

812
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,522
I WON'T MISS A SINGLE SHOT

813
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,993
He's going to serve this like garnish.

814
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,995
Let's try this sauce.

815
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,563
MARK?

816
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,898
Please try this, MARK.

817
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,167
This is the sauce
mixed with kal-guksu noodles.

818
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,503
-Thank you.
-I haven't added cheese yet.

819
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,605
Please try it, MARK.

820
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,606
MARK TAKES A BITE FIRST

821
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,576
So, MARK? What's it like?

822
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,710
MADE WITH GROUND VEGGIE AND BEEF

823
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,345
-What's it like?
-It's so good.

824
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,147
Is it good? It's already good.

825
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,548
It's not too salty?

826
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,783
-No.
-It's okay?

827
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,585
-It's probably bland without cheese.
-It's really good.

828
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,620
Let me try it, then.

829
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,822
The interim check. Please try it, CHENLE.

830
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,357
How will it satisfy his taste?

831
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,425
NODDING

832
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,527
He keeps nodding.

833
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,730
That's about all we get to try. Good.

834
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,399
PECANS

835
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,867
10. ADD GROUND PECANS TO VEGGIES
AND STIR-FRY

836
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,435
Things are hectic over here.

837
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,971
This one seems important.

838
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,306
-You can try it.
-It looks important.

839
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,407
Three minutes left.

840
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,644
Why don't you try this, MARK?

841
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,314
-Thank you.
-Okay, MARK.

842
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,950
MARK's taste check.

843
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,886
That sauce was good. And? How's this?

844
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,889
MARK?

845
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,123
It's a little salty.

846
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,458
It's a little salty?

847
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,927
-It's a little salty!
-It's salty.

848
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,996
It's a little salty.

849
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,365
-It's a little salty!
-Okay!

850
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,800
-It's salty.
-It's a little salty!

851
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:49,767
Good.

852
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,236
-It's a little salty!
-Okay!

853
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,504
-It's salty.
-Good.

854
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,405
-Good.
-Nam-no.

855
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,341
-It's a bit salty.
-Good!

856
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,476
-It's so good, but it's a bit salty.
-Okay!

857
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,345
It'll turn even saltier.

858
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,914
KWON POONG BEGINS TO SERVE HIS FOOD

859
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,848
-Oh, no.
-No.

860
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,283
-I just need some sugar.
-Sugar.

861
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,418
-Please make it better.
-Is it too salty?

862
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,821
You're very sensitive to taste.

863
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,056
The choice is yours, though.

864
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,892
-Don't blame us and make the decision.
-That's his personal taste.

865
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,463
-Sung-jun begins to serve his food.
-But it's so good.

866
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,231
NAM-NO STARTS PLATING

867
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,934
Nam-no begins to serve the food too.

868
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:23,835
VEGGIE GARNISH FIRST

869
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,069
It looks so good.

870
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,738
Sung-jun is almost done.

871
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:27,972
When will you grab the <i>tsukune</i>?

872
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,440
I have to cook it until time's up.

873
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,044
Sung-jun begins to serve his food.

874
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:33,945
CUTS OFF THE TIPS

875
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,346
-My gosh.
-You're cutting that off?

876
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,048
That looks good.

877
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,950
TOPPED WITH GARLIC STEAK!

878
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,252
He's also topping steak on the pasta.

879
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,689
-Sung-jun is almost done.
-That looks beautiful.

880
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,891
PARSLEY

881
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,393
Are you not using these?

882
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,094
-Do you want to try it?
-Yes.

883
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,031
That's Kwon Poong.
Sung-jun has become Poong.

884
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,165
Is it good?

885
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,100
He begins to serve the dish.

886
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,002
-Are you not using this?
-Sung-jun has become Poong.

887
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,370
I'm not using it.

888
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,773
-You made three of these, right?
-It's not fully cooked.

889
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,974
It's not fully cooked.

890
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,475
-It's not cooked?
-No.

891
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,277
Is it supposed to be undercooked?

892
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,713
This one is ruined.

893
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,182
-It's ruined?
-One of them.

894
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,084
Sung-jun finishes!

895
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,919
Sung-jun is finished.

896
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,355
He's done cooking.

897
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,023
THE TSUKUNE HAS TO BE COOKED
TO THE END

898
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,159
Yes, you have a minute and 20 seconds.

899
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,193
GOOD VIBES TEMPERATURE CHECK

900
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,227
-The oven…
-Please.

901
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,395
I don't think it'll be done.

902
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,997
Shouldn't you start basting, then?

903
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,765
-I still have a minute.
-He has a minute.

904
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,133
You have a minute left.

905
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,703
GOOD VIBES TOWEL

906
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,839
ANXIOUS AND NERVOUS

907
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,875
PLEASE…

908
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,411
He doesn't have much time.
Twenty seconds now!

909
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,613
You have 20 seconds left!

910
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,116
-You have 20 seconds left, Nam-no!
-He got them out.

911
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,652
-You have time. It's all right.
-It's okay.

912
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,587
This is important.

913
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,222
Ten seconds. Nine.

914
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,057
FINISHING OFF WITH PECANS

915
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,959
-Seven. Six.
-They aren't done.

916
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,327
STRETCH

917
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,097
VEGGIE GARNISH ON TOP!

918
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,164
-One.
-One.

919
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,900
-Time's up.
-Time's up.

920
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,168
YOON NAM-NO'S MANIAC'S GODLY MENU IS DONE

921
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,303
He's done.

922
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,338
I DID EVERYTHING I WANTED TO

923
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,607
My gosh. The chefs.

924
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,877
THE CRAZIEST MIND GAME ROUND IS OVER

925
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,917
And now, both dishes
for Lee Know and Felix are finished.

926
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,386
I didn't expect him
to summon Webtoon Artist Poong.

927
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,088
Excellent move.

928
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,456
-Good one.
-You broke Nam-no then.

929
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,792
That's when he became all shook up.

930
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,727
On top of that, the timer went off.

931
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,662
The timers. The timer attack.

932
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:35,299
Please try Chef Kwon Poong's dish first.

933
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,567
Poong, Shabu, and I Are One.

934
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,237
A DISH HE MADE AS HIS TEACHER, KIM POONG

935
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:44,775
PASTA AND TENDERLOIN STEAK
MADE WITH SHABU-SHABU INGREDIENTS

936
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,147
CHEF KWON POONG, KWON SUNG-JUN'S
POONG, SHABU, AND I ARE ONE

937
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,182
-Poong, Shabu and I are one. Thank you.
-Thank you.

938
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,584
Try the noodles and the sauce first.

939
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,653
And then try the meat and the noodles.

940
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,421
First, try just the noodles.

941
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,024
Yes, please try the noodles first.

942
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,461
Try the noodles first,
and then have everything together.

943
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,865
YONG-BOK TAKES A BITE TOO

944
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,468
-My gosh.
-"My gosh." What do you mean?

945
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,904
They have different responses.

946
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,708
It seems like a kind of dish
that he might have had in Australia.

947
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,411
Felix tries another bite. And Lee Know.

948
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,079
Is it too hot, Lee Know?

949
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,614
Is it too hot, Lee Know from Gimpo?

950
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,815
What's wrong?

951
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,286
-It's much more delicious with the steak.
-Is it?

952
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,254
-I see.
-I see.

953
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,423
He says it's more delicious with steak.

954
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,725
I tried the steak,

955
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,528
and it was cooked perfectly
to my preference, medium-rare.

956
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,263
They're enjoying it very much.

957
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,300
-They are.
-And the cream isn't overly rich.

958
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,636
-It's not?
-It's more like ragu made with mushrooms.

959
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,872
-Like ragu.
-Ragu.

960
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,107
It felt like

961
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:53,945
my dad's barbecue, just like how he would
grill and give me some meat to eat.

962
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,346
MOVED

963
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,682
And the pasta felt like my mother's dish,

964
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,417
served with my father's steak.

965
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,618
The game is over.

966
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,220
He was reminded of both parents.

967
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,755
It felt a lot like a meal
my parents would make me.

968
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:05,656
Nam-no's finished.

969
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,925
He's Felix, not Yong-bok.

970
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,595
-He thought of his parents.
-The taste of his hometown.

971
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,297
Lee Know tries it once again.

972
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,800
-Gosh.
-He's enjoying the dish.

973
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,869
It was already delicious
when I had just steak and pasta.

974
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,271
-Is this enoki?
-It is.

975
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,372
This is the kick.

976
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,307
Enoki? Really?

977
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,576
-It smells fantastic.
-It does?

978
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,013
-Didn't Poong deep-fry that?
-I did.

979
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,982
-No wonder.
-Is that so?

980
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,617
-The enoki.
-Really?

981
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,085
-Gosh.
-It's so good.

982
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,386
Does that play a part?

983
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,587
It smells really good.

984
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,689
-Goodness!
-What is it?

985
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,325
He's about to cry. Why
are you crying, Felix?

986
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,127
-It's so good.
-Is it that good?

987
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,530
But I'm not seeing any celebrations.

988
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,201
-We need to see their ceremony.
-They aren't quite there yet.

989
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,702
You aren't sure after just this one.

990
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,871
-It's too early to celebrate.
-It's too early.

991
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,640
-I'm holding myself back.
-He's holding back.

992
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,875
-They just had a taste of home.
-They did.

993
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,310
-They look happy.
-They do.

994
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,145
BIG MOUTHFUL

995
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,948
NOTICES SOMETHING

996
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,218
The steak pieces are
a bit too big for Lee Know.

997
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,786
Whenever he has a bite…

998
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,421
MAKING A BIG EFFORT

999
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,757
But it must be good.

1000
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,661
-He puts everything in at once.
-It's better when your mouth is stuffed.

1001
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:21,532
I love how tender it is, so it feels great
when my mouth is full of food.

1002
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,567
-That abundance.
-Of course.

1003
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,236
Next, Nam-no's dish.

1004
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,572
A NEW MENU JUST FOR STRAY KIDS

1005
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:33,477
BEEF TSUKUNE
SERVED WITH A SIDE OF EGG SAUCE

1006
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,482
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S MANIAC'S GODLY MENU

1007
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,051
This is Maniac's Godly Menu.

1008
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,986
-My gosh.
-Godly Menu.

1009
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,254
You should beat the egg yolk.

1010
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,156
Beat the egg yolk? The sauce?

1011
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,125
-So they'll dip it like sukiyaki, right?
-He served it on the side.

1012
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,560
It's fully cooked.

1013
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,895
-It's fully cooked.
-It's done.

1014
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,929
-Is it fully cooked?
-Yes.

1015
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,165
It was fully cooked in the oven.

1016
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,267
Do they need a good amount of sauce?

1017
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,403
-Pour a little on top with a spoon.
-Over the top.

1018
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,372
-Pour it on top.
-Don't use too much.

1019
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,507
Felix, will you eat that in one bite?

1020
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,243
CAN HE DO IT LIKE LEE KNOW?

1021
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,179
How is he going to do that?

1022
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,747
-Hey!
-Hey!

1023
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:10,715
Will you do it?

1024
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,351
YONG-BOK WON'T SAY NO

1025
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,886
He knows how to eat it deliciously.

1026
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,121
FULL CHEEKS

1027
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,422
-My gosh!
-Why?

1028
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,857
-Why?
-What's it like?

1029
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,192
-The celebration.
-He's feeling it.

1030
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,830
-The ring kiss celebration!
-He kissed the ring!

1031
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,765
-He did it.
-That was his ceremony!

1032
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,134
Gosh. Oh, yeah! I'm so curious.

1033
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,769
He must've felt it.

1034
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,939
HE CAN'T STAY SEATED AFTER EATING THAT

1035
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,707
-It must be good.
-Lee Know!

1036
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,810
It looks nicely wrapped up like a present,

1037
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,446
and when I opened it,

1038
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,049
-everything came out, and it was a gift.
-It must be that good.

1039
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,852
It looked good. It did.

1040
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,988
Lee Know feels rushed now.
He takes a bite too.

1041
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,257
He wanted to pick up a small piece,

1042
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,793
-but switched to a big piece.
-Yes!

1043
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:57,995
-It must be good.
-Lee Know!

1044
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,297
All right, Lee Know.
Let's see how he responds.

1045
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,133
CEREMONY

1046
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,701
-Hey!
-Yes!

1047
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,072
They didn't do that for Kwon Poong,
but for Nam-no.

1048
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,007
-Oh, no.
-They celebrated.

1049
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,576
The juice is all retained on the inside,

1050
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,613
and everything explodes
as soon as you chew it in your mouth.

1051
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,316
When the juice from the meat
and the onion mixed in my mouth…

1052
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,853
It just feels like… Like that.

1053
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,257
-Like that.
-It must've felt like fireworks in there.

1054
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,694
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

1055
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,630
JOYFUL NAM-NO

1056
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,533
Only Kwon Poong shakes his head right now.

1057
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,568
They didn't do that for him.

1058
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,439
He even borrowed Poong's glasses
and Chinese kitchen knife.

1059
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,307
Isn't the game over?

1060
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,043
-May I try this once again?
-Please do.

1061
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,213
-They should try it again before deciding.
-Yes.

1062
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,515
They'll make a sound decision.

1063
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,651
EYES SHUT TIGHTLY

1064
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,953
-He's feeling that dish too.
-This one's good too.

1065
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,823
Your father's steak
and your mother's pasta.

1066
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,524
You have to think of that.

1067
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,927
-It's hard to choose.
-Right?

1068
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,829
I wonder what those are like.

1069
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,363
Do you two want to try those?

1070
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,631
I do want to.

1071
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,834
-He's been losing his mind.
-He almost lost his mind?

1072
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,704
-The members of NCT will try now.
-Okay.

1073
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,473
-Thank you.
-MARK takes a bite.

1074
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,775
He tends to leave an objective evaluation.

1075
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,778
Yes, and CHENLE takes a bite.

1076
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,080
-It's so good.
-Is it?

1077
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,982
His eyes became huge.

1078
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,584
-It's so good.
-Isn't it?

1079
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,554
-CHENLE keeps nodding his head.
-It's so good.

1080
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,390
Why? What's it like? Tell us something.

1081
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,126
It's like a hamburger patty

1082
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,162
without the buns, just the meat.

1083
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,763
It's really different.

1084
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,700
-It really tastes like something new.
-A new dish.

1085
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,835
-It's a really new dish.
-It's so good.

1086
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,203
-Here's the next dish.
-Thank you.

1087
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,272
-Thank you.
-I'm glad they're done promoting.

1088
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,842
-He just pushed my dish away.
-He just pushed it away.

1089
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:56,146
-Chef Sung-jun currently feels anxious.
-They already had a lot.

1090
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,182
-MARK moves on right away.
-Right away?

1091
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,316
Take a bite, MARK!

1092
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,384
RIGHT AWAY

1093
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,254
-It's a shame that there's no more steak.
-That's a shame.

1094
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,356
But we can't help it.

1095
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,924
Stray Kids had it all.

1096
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,727
-Look at how MARK is melting.
-It's so good.

1097
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,696
-It's so delicious.
-Is it that delicious?

1098
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,532
It's unbelievably good.

1099
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,167
They're both good.

1100
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,203
-You two put on some weight.
-You finished those.

1101
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,140
-Their cheeks look chubbier.
-After just one episode.

1102
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,843
-And they have better complexions.
-They still have more tour dates.

1103
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,179
Aren't the members of NCT known
for eating only small portions?

1104
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,081
-You're right.
-But you two are devouring.

1105
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,249
It's really good.

1106
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,651
-You're eating the most yet.
-You're right.

1107
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,219
I'm enjoying everything so much.

1108
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,122
WHILE NCT IS BINGE-EATING…

1109
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,657
Start from that side.

1110
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,359
THESE TWO ARE WORKING ON
POONG, SHABU, AND I ARE ONE

1111
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,662
They went out and watched them cook.

1112
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,629
DEVOURING

1113
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,799
Hey, look at them.
You two are still working on it?

1114
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,334
They're still torn.

1115
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,603
-It's…
-The pasta feels like risotto now.

1116
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,972
-Risotto? After it got cold?
-It got cold.

1117
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,808
The second dish, the <i>tsukune</i>,

1118
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,812
left a big impression
because it exploded in my mouth.

1119
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,582
But after a while,
I began to crave pasta a little more.

1120
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,084
-It slowly catches up to you.
-From behind?

1121
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,119
Yes, it catches up from behind.

1122
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,256
That's actually
the authentic Kim Poong style.

1123
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,024
That's true.

1124
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,329
Sung-jun gave up the glasses,
but he picks them up again.

1125
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,999
-They keep craving for more later.
-They keep craving it.

1126
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,233
Just like last episode,

1127
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,102
the winning chef will receive

1128
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,672
a gold bar edition SPAM gift set
to celebrate the upcoming

1129
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,874
-Chuseok holiday.
-I'm so jealous.

1130
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,511
-It's time to make a decision.
-It's time.

1131
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,614
Press one for Nam-no,

1132
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,716
and two for Kwon Poong.

1133
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,618
Will it be Felix's parents or the gift?

1134
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,054
The gift or his parents?

1135
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,189
THEN IT SHOULD BE ME

1136
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,857
Parents are too hard to beat.

1137
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,426
-Lee Know has chosen.
-It must be hard.

1138
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,794
We're waiting for Felix.

1139
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:51,862
THINKING

1140
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,264
He must be rather torn.

1141
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,367
-I pressed it. Yes.
-You did?

1142
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,502
A SHOCKING RESULT

1143
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,104
The results are in.

1144
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,605
The two

1145
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,140
made the same choice.

1146
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,310
-It's been decided.
-That's a first.

1147
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,645
-Yes.
-Great teamwork.

1148
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,446
That means twice the damage.

1149
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,917
-Twice the damage.
-Twice the pain.

1150
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,986
This was the craziest decision yet.

1151
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,822
Which dish
did the two members of Stray Kids

1152
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,425
both vote for?

1153
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,926
Let's find out.

1154
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,330
Hooray! A dish that calls for a ceremony.

1155
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:29,266
This was the third battle
between Sung-jun and Nam-no.

1156
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,702
Let's go three straight wins!

1157
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,737
-I'll root for you.
-Will Nam-no win all three rounds?

1158
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,240
Or will Sung-jun get his revenge?

1159
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,374
What's the decision?

1160
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,010
Lee Know and Felix's decision.

1161
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,245
Who is it?

1162
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,514
-Lee Know and Felix!
-I'm nervous too.

1163
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,582
Who did they both choose?

1164
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,186
YOON NAM-NO WINS

1165
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,754
YOON NAM-NO'S MANIAC'S GODLY MENU WINS

1166
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,389
-Hooray!
-It was Nam-no!

1167
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,591
Nam-no wins again!

1168
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,959
Oh, no.

1169
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,096
EXPUNGES HIMSELF OF KIM POONG

1170
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,498
-Nam-no wins again.
-He gave up.

1171
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,900
I'M DONE LIVING AS KWON POONG

1172
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,501
DISAPPOINTED AS WELL

1173
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:05,736
Nam-no won again.

1174
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,439
Both dishes were absolutely delicious.

1175
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,074
But considering the order,

1176
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,976
the second dish was
the one that made us celebrate.

1177
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,845
-It exploded in your mouth.
-Yes.

1178
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,582
I didn't expect that kind of flavor.
It was shocking.

1179
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,153
I realized this was
what it means to surprise someone.

1180
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,289
How are you feeling, Chef Sung-jun?

1181
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,891
First, I don't think
idol stars hit it off with me.

1182
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,494
-That's true.
-He lost every time.

1183
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,696
-Why is that so?
-He lost every time, including today.

1184
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,365
-That's really odd.
-That's not good.

1185
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:40,804
This means Nam-no will receive
a star and the Spam set.

1186
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,774
Please put a star on Chef Nam-no!

1187
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,344
Nam-no beats Sung-jun yet again!

1188
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,047
Thank you for the food.

1189
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,248
A dish like a present.

1190
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,117
It's quite heavy. Is it real gold?

1191
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,223
This is the second round of cook-off
with ingredients from the fridge

1192
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,625
provided by Lee Know and Felix
of Stray Kids.

1193
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,227
That's very nice.

1194
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,162
-The low voice.
-The low voice?

1195
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,297
You'd call these chefs "very nice."

1196
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,667
The kind-hearted chef of the show,
Chef Son Jong-won,

1197
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:15,506
and the kind-hearted old man of the show,
Chef Jung Ho-young, are up.

1198
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,473
They're both kind.

1199
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,408
-That's very nice.
-Nice.

1200
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,144
Can you do that for us?

1201
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,280
That's very nice.

1202
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,649
A DESIRABLE VOICE

1203
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:26,817
That's very nice.

1204
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,086
This is their first battle
on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

1205
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,821
-You're right.
-Yes.

1206
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,524
Chef Jong-won tends to be

1207
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,293
very advantageous
against the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance.

1208
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,829
-That's right.
-Sung-jun and Nam-no

1209
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,765
has never won against Chef Jong-won.

1210
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:42,933
-My gosh.
-Yes.

1211
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,702
And finally, the godfather
of the Anti-Good Vibes Alliance,

1212
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,972
Chef Jung Ho-young is up.

1213
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,074
-Captain!
-Yes.

1214
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,178
-Chef Ho-young has been on a roll lately.
-That's right.

1215
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,913
He's currently at five straight wins.

1216
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,481
-My gosh.
-That's insane.

1217
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,716
However, I heard Chef Jong-won

1218
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,919
relies a lot on Chef Ho-young.

1219
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,621
-What?
-What do you mean by this?

1220
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,857
When I first joined the show,

1221
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,625
everything was difficult and awkward.

1222
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,227
But he'd always check in on me,

1223
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,429
and he even called me on the days I lost

1224
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,264
-to see if I was okay.
-If you were okay?

1225
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,632
How kind.

1226
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,501
He's very nice.

1227
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,236
You don't call other people.

1228
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,371
Because it seemed reasonable
when others lost.

1229
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,007
Because it seemed reasonable?

1230
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,812
But Chef Jong-won has
an advantage in this round.

1231
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,647
-Right.
-A huge advantage.

1232
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,350
Chef Jong-won must be
better at making desserts, right?

1233
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,985
I wouldn't say I'm better,

1234
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,720
but I definitely have eaten more desserts.

1235
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,856
-The experience.
-Of course.

1236
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,657
Have you not had many desserts, Ho-young?

1237
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,426
I've had more actual meals.

1238
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,362
You didn't need a dessert
after a good meal?

1239
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,865
But I always carry
this cooking sack with me,

1240
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,867
and I also have some dessert ideas there.

1241
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,403
-So I'll prepare it with confidence.
-All right.

1242
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,340
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS: CAKE FLOUR,
COCOA POWDER, SUGAR POWDER

1243
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,408
FRESH CREAM, MILK, FROZEN MIXED BERRIES,
WALNUTS, MAPLE SYRUP

1244
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:02,446
The dish I'll make today
is called Dessert Maniac.

1245
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,780
I'll make cake

1246
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:07,050
so sweet that it makes your head spin.

1247
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:10,220
I'm going to make something
that recently became a big fad,

1248
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,222
known as the towel cake.

1249
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,591
I'll make this towel-shaped cake,

1250
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,627
and the recipe is easy to copy.

1251
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,997
I'll also make candied walnuts
to add crunchiness

1252
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,899
-to the sweet and soft cake.
-Will he have time?

1253
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:26,036
-I'll turn it into a delicious dessert.
-I see.

1254
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,972
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS: CAKE FLOUR,
VANILLA EXTRACT, WALNUTS, BANANAS

1255
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,041
CHOCOLATE, FRESH CREAM, MILK,
BANANA-FLAVORED MILK, COCOA POWDER

1256
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:34,411
The name of my dish is this.

1257
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,781
Eat Banana Crêpe, Yong-bok,
and Get Lucky, Lee Know?

1258
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,820
Eat Banana Crêpe, Yong-bok,
and Get Lucky, Lee Know?

1259
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,590
You probably stayed on a strict diet
so you couldn't eat sweets.

1260
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,825
You also said that you both loved to bake,

1261
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,995
but at times,
it gets too inconvenient to use an oven.

1262
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,564
So it's a no-oven recipe,
thanks to great ingredients you had.

1263
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,000
I'll use bananas, walnuts, and chocolate

1264
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,169
to make a crêpe cake today.

1265
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,837
THAT SOUNDS GREAT

1266
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:01,872
Crêpes?

1267
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,740
Let us begin the round titled

1268
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,444
"Dessert, that's very nice"
for Lee Know and Felix.

1269
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:11,949
This man wants to give a sweets therapy
to Yong-bok and Lee Know.

1270
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:15,252
The dessert fairy of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,
Son Jong-won.

1271
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:19,056
This man cannot give up
on both desserts and dancing.

1272
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,826
The dancing fairy of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,
Jung Ho-young.

1273
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,629
Who'll take the sweet star of victory?

1274
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,765
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1275
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,572
THE SWEETS TRAIN TAKES OFF

1276
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,873
A dessert round!

1277
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,609
1. MIX FLOUR, MILK, SUGAR,
MAPLE SYRUP, COCOA POWDER

1278
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,645
What's that? Ice cream?

1279
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,481
-He's using maple syrup.
-That was maple syrup?

1280
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,717
-Cocoa powder.
-And cocoa powder.

1281
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,485
MIXING

1282
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,619
I want to take a look.

1283
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,289
Felix gets up again.

1284
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,191
MARK is up too.

1285
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,059
You must be curious.

1286
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,494
It looks like

1287
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,997
Felix is curious
of Chef Ho-young's recipe.

1288
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,265
Milk, flour, and cocoa powder?

1289
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,201
-And cacao cream.
-Cacao cream?

1290
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,502
One egg.

1291
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,641
SIFT THROUGH A STRAINER

1292
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:15,178
-You have to be delicate to make desserts.
-Of course.

1293
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,780
He starts by melting butter.

1294
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:22,319
1. BEAT EGGS

1295
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,788
May I use UNICHEF?

1296
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,689
-UNICHEF.
-Already?

1297
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:26,990
Who do you want as UNICHEF?

1298
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,259
-Chef Nam-no.
-Nam-no!

1299
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,595
-Nam-no runs out!
-Run out!

1300
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,196
Can you whip fresh cream?

1301
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,732
Nam-no's minute begins.

1302
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,267
He has to whip the cream?

1303
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,102
-The cream.
-He has to whip it.

1304
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,771
-Make stiff peaks, please.
-Okay.

1305
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,241
HARD PEAK: HARD CREAM THAT DOESN'T FLOW
WHEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN

1306
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:45,442
SUGAR

1307
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,944
HE BEGINS TO WHIP THE CREAM

1308
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,380
Do I add this too?

1309
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,315
Yes, a little. Did you add sugar?

1310
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,283
I did.

1311
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,286
HE'S STILL WATCHING CLOSELY

1312
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,657
You're adding sugar powder first.

1313
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,459
-It was sour, so I want to make it sweet.
-What's that?

1314
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:03,460
To make it sweet.

1315
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,829
Are those blueberries?

1316
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,330
-What are those? Cherries?
-Cherries?

1317
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,465
That's a good tip.

1318
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,668
Chef Ho-young can still use UNICHEF.

1319
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,170
Do it.

1320
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,305
-This. Do this.
-UNICHEF.

1321
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,441
-Ho-young's using UNICHEF!
-This.

1322
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,743
-Whip it.
-He summons Sam.

1323
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,244
He's making cream too.

1324
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,946
Their recipes are similar.

1325
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,550
-Their dishes are alike.
-Yes, they're both making crêpes.

1326
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,286
Sam's turn begins too.

1327
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,988
AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT'S NAM-NO UP TO?

1328
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,092
I can't finish this.
I only have ten seconds left.

1329
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,928
HIS TIME IS ALMOST UP

1330
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:38,995
UNICHEF is ending.

1331
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,464
Nam-no's time is over.

1332
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,532
-It's not done, though.
-Just leave it and go.

1333
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,667
He's done.

1334
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,402
-I'm sorry.
-Leave it and go.

1335
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,671
-You have to keep it up there.
-Thanks.

1336
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,206
HE QUICKLY STARTS THE NEXT STEP

1337
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:53,176
2. MAKE BATTER BY MIXING MELTED BUTTER,
BEATEN EGG, SIFTED FLOUR, AND MILK

1338
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,644
He's sifting flour.

1339
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,279
This is regular milk.

1340
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,016
He added beaten eggs.

1341
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,452
GETS UP

1342
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,088
Lee Know went out
to watch Chef Jong-won cook.

1343
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,425
It looks like Chef Ho-young

1344
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,594
begins to make crêpes first.

1345
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,497
He's making chocolate crêpes,

1346
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,198
-but it burns easily.
-It does?

1347
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,800
Yes, it does, so he must be careful.

1348
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,301
He should be careful.

1349
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,871
Ho-young must work it delicately.

1350
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,172
What's Sam doing?

1351
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,574
-He's also whipping the cream.
-He's doing the same thing?

1352
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,943
Right. They're both making dessert.

1353
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,880
Felix must want to learn something.
He's keeping a close eye.

1354
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,049
He's doing everything
the same way I bake at home.

1355
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,851
Spinning the mixer.

1356
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,219
He's watching the baking recipe.

1357
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,289
Three, two, one.

1358
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,490
The end!

1359
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:41,992
Sam's time is up too.

1360
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,394
-It didn't peak, right?
-Yes, you have to work it a bit more.

1361
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,529
It didn't peak.

1362
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,531
Did you fail?

1363
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,865
WHAT DO YOU THINK

1364
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,201
-You can't do it in a minute.
-It's impossible.

1365
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,503
You have to keep going. It didn't peak.

1366
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,539
Just one minute?

1367
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,141
LEAVING THE WHIPPED CREAM BEHIND…

1368
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,010
HE BRINGS SOMETHING OUT
WITH A SERIOUS FACE

1369
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,612
-Four frying pans.
-Four frying pans.

1370
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,114
-Chef Jong-won.
-Four frying pans.

1371
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,250
This time,
Felix is in front of Chef Jong-won.

1372
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,652
He's using four pans.

1373
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,020
He's oiling the pans.

1374
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,922
-All four pans?
-Will he make four pieces?

1375
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,357
Is he going to layer the crêpes?

1376
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,260
One layer after another.

1377
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,963
He has to layer them,
so he must make many at once.

1378
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,731
-Because of the time limit?
-Yes.

1379
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,367
Jong-won makes four crêpes at once.

1380
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,535
He's so cool.

1381
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,505
It's impossible
to make a crêpe cake in 15 minutes.

1382
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,639
It's crazy.

1383
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,108
He's up for a serious challenge
with only ten minutes left.

1384
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,877
He has to cool them too.

1385
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,845
This is insane.

1386
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,849
AND ANOTHER MAN IS
ALSO UP FOR A CRAZY CHALLENGE…

1387
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,051
Hot.

1388
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,552
Did you burn yourself?

1389
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,854
-Oh, no. It's too hot.
-It won't come off the pan.

1390
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,423
It's too hot!

1391
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,657
TRYING TO FLIP IT WITH BARE HANDS

1392
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,359
SUCCESS

1393
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,427
Does it look good?

1394
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:51,861
It looks like a buckwheat crêpe.

1395
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,764
-It's chocolate-colored.
-Buckwheat crêpe?

1396
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,066
That's not enough batter.

1397
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,768
Doesn't Ho-young also need
two or more pans?

1398
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,770
-I only need two pieces.
-Just two pieces?

1399
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,973
You're only making two pieces?

1400
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,175
You aren't layering the cake, are you?

1401
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,044
-You're not stacking them?
-No, I'm rolling them.

1402
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,080
IT'S A ROLL
SO HE DOESN'T NEED A LOT!

1403
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,682
Jong-won finishes what Nam-no couldn't.

1404
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,719
He finishes it up.
Nam-no should've done it quickly.

1405
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,687
-He has a long way to go.
-Yes.

1406
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,724
-A minute wasn't enough.
-I can't do that in a minute.

1407
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,859
-He needs to whip it for over a minute.
-Yes.

1408
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,462
-He couldn't do it in a minute.
-He also stopped midway.

1409
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,063
Check on the whipped cream.

1410
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,066
Yes, but I can't go there because of this.

1411
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,802
The next piece.

1412
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,704
It looks like a gochujang pancake.

1413
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,606
-Also called <i>jangtteok</i>.
-Yes, it's like that.

1414
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,241
-It looks like <i>jangtteok</i>.
-Yes.

1415
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,110
It's so hot.

1416
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,611
-They look nice.
-The colors look great.

1417
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:42,679
They both look good.

1418
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:47,083
Chef Jong-won is making banana crêpe.

1419
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,685
WALNUTS

1420
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,453
GRINDING WITH A BLENDER!

1421
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,088
Just push it in instead of spinning it.

1422
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,224
WHIRRR

1423
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,761
-It's out of place. Move the inner piece.
-Watch your hand.

1424
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,363
-Pull everything out first.
-Watch your hand.

1425
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,232
Is it too stuffed?

1426
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,801
-Spin it around and push it in.
-Pull everything out.

1427
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,469
It never works when you feel rushed.

1428
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,439
-Can you help him?
-Pull it out.

1429
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,274
-Pull out everything.
-Pull out everything.

1430
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,511
Jong-won isn't bothered.

1431
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,446
-I knew it.
-He remains calm.

1432
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,781
WHAT'S HIS PLAN B?

1433
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,554
USING A KNIFE INSTEAD OF A BLENDER

1434
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,423
HE RISES TO THE OCCASION

1435
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,390
He's so cool.

1436
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,259
Take your time.

1437
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,561
-All right.
-You still have lots of time.

1438
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,929
-Bananas.
-Yes.

1439
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,265
The bananas smell crazy good.

1440
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,666
The smell of banana?

1441
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,068
I'm bananas for it right now.

1442
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,170
BANANAS FOR BANANAS

1443
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,705
Check on the crêpes too.

1444
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,508
Are they done, Chef Jong-won?

1445
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,277
Yes, that's it.

1446
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,145
-It looks great.
-That's good.

1447
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:52,015
-That's how it should look.
-It looks delicious.

1448
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,351
-That's how it should look.
-That's about right.

1449
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,920
It's hard to make crêpe

1450
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,955
in just 15 minutes.

1451
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,624
He can make a piece,
but he has to layer these.

1452
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,693
What he's making is
impossible to do within this time.

1453
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,730
You have eight minutes left.

1454
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,498
-Eight minutes left.
-Where is it?

1455
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:12,335
Ho-young also Ho-young also finishes
what Sam couldn't finish before.

1456
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,205
-Stronger. Even stronger.
-What?

1457
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,975
RAISING THE POWER

1458
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,844
CHECKS THE TIME

1459
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,179
JONG-WON BEGINS WHIPPING AGAIN

1460
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,781
That doesn't look good.

1461
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,785
I don't think it'll stiffen.
It's still too thin.

1462
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:29,953
No, it'll happen.

1463
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,521
I hope the cream turns harder.

1464
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,323
WILL IT WORK?

1465
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,557
It'll happen.

1466
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,526
-I hope it does.
-The whipping isn't going well.

1467
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,361
He's checking on the crêpe.

1468
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,496
Is that one done?

1469
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,265
-It is.
-It looks good.

1470
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,300
-It looks great.
-Okay.

1471
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,902
It's cooked deliciously.

1472
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,271
-It is.
-It looks good.

1473
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,206
HO-YOUNG IS STILL WHIPPING

1474
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,310
-If you over whip it, it'll split.
-I think it will split.

1475
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,045
Stop whipping.

1476
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,882
-If you continue, it'll split.
-It's practically done.

1477
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,284
JONG-WON BEGINS TO WHIP AGAIN

1478
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,154
It's not happening. It won't harden.

1479
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,122
TROUBLED

1480
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,125
He doesn't have enough time.

1481
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,629
-It's better to put it in the freezer.
-This is way too hard.

1482
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,832
HE MUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
DUE TO TIME

1483
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,001
He added whole bananas.

1484
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,203
Bananas, chocolate, and walnuts.

1485
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,572
-Walnuts. He used those too?
-Yes, in there.

1486
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,276
-That's more than enough.
-It's done.

1487
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,011
Excellent.

1488
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,180
They're busy.
Making dessert is a lot of work.

1489
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,682
It's not easy to make dessert.

1490
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,317
STARTS TO MAKE A SUGAR GLAZE

1491
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:37,520
Chef Ho-young is making
something called praline.

1492
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:38,822
-Praline?
-Yes.

1493
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,357
He's coating nuts with sugar.

1494
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,059
PRALINE: CARAMELIZED NUTS

1495
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,195
It's not easy to make, though.

1496
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,396
The thing is,

1497
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,931
those have to cool.

1498
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:51,668
Otherwise, it'll all melt inside the crêpe
because of the temperature.

1499
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,170
JONG-WON DOESN'T HAVE TIME
TO COOL THE CRÊPES

1500
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,006
It's still too hot.

1501
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,576
-It's hot, but he continues.
-It is, but he goes on.

1502
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,077
Those are still hot.

1503
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,745
He cuts those into smaller pieces.

1504
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,080
He has to shape them

1505
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,683
He'll now layer those, right?

1506
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,084
He needs many more layers,

1507
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,486
but he only has to make one piece,

1508
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,421
so he'll fold them for the same effect.

1509
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,689
HE'LL LAYER THE CRÊPE PIECES

1510
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,924
-He's spreading cream on it.
-He's spreading something.

1511
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,894
I wonder what that tastes like.

1512
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,462
-It looks good.
-Yes.

1513
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,232
And another layer.
Apply cream, another layer.

1514
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,833
Look at those.

1515
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,669
That cream is what's important.
That needs to be good.

1516
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,806
There are many things we can taste
because they're making dessert.

1517
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,408
Is he making millet crêpe?

1518
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,544
Or sweet red beans.

1519
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,412
-That's a millet crêpe, right?
-Red bean crêpe.

1520
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,881
-Or buckwheat.
-Buckwheat pancakes.

1521
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,049
-Millet crêpe.
-Buckwheat pancakes.

1522
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,018
-Five minutes, Jung-hwan!
-Already?

1523
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:45,788
I wonder who'll win the dessert round.

1524
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,557
What's he squeezing out on top?

1525
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,526
-Whipped cream he made.
-Whipped cream.

1526
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,028
Something smells delicious over here.

1527
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,564
-Jung-hwan, why don't you try the spread?
-Yes?

1528
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,267
He added lots of ingredients in here
including bananas.

1529
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,537
HE RUNS OVER
TO STICK THE CAKE IN THE FREEZER!

1530
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,672
How sweet is it?

1531
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,509
-This is important.
-It shouldn't be way too sweet.

1532
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:10,013
So? Does it taste very nice?

1533
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,548
Does it taste very nice?

1534
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,250
It's very nice!

1535
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,454
It's not too sweet. It's just right.

1536
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:19,689
-I see.
-Already?

1537
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,125
I like how I can chew on chocolate chunks.

1538
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,127
I see. Yes, he used chocolate.

1539
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,329
-That was excellent.
-I see.

1540
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,031
WHAT ABOUT HO-YOUNG?

1541
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,399
That looks really good.

1542
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,802
I love the color.

1543
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,104
You don't need to add a lot.

1544
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,606
MESSAGE RECEIVED

1545
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:40,944
Chef Ho-young said
he'd be making a towel-shaped cake.

1546
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,379
He rolled it up.

1547
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,448
-Another fold?
-Once more?

1548
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,184
-What are you folding, Ho-young?
-The towel shape.

1549
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,688
-He's making a towel-shaped cake.
-Is that the cake?

1550
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,689
That looks good too.

1551
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,158
-It's a fad among younger people.
-Don't let it pop.

1552
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,994
It's burning.

1553
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,329
What? It's burning!

1554
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,730
MOVING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

1555
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,066
RUNNING OVER

1556
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,401
-It's burnt. Turn the heat off.
-It's burnt.

1557
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,836
-It's burnt.
-Turn the heat off.

1558
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,605
The color doesn't look right.

1559
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,139
Will he throw those out?

1560
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,142
-It smells like honeycomb candy.
-Yes?

1561
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:17,347
-It looks good. It turned out nicely.
-It looks fine.

1562
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:20,249
-It's even better.
-Is it even better?

1563
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,952
Three minutes and thirty seconds.

1564
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,821
-It's all right.
-Can you open this for me?

1565
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:25,888
-My hands are slippery.
-Open what?

1566
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,523
THINGS ARE SO HECTIC

1567
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,459
-Why do you make me do this?
-It won't open.

1568
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,793
-It's done.
-Thanks.

1569
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:36,866
3. MIX COCOA POWDER AND SUGAR POWDER
WITH AN IMMERSION BLENDER

1570
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,835
-What are you blending?
-Sugar.

1571
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,737
-I'm making cacao syrup.
-Syrup?

1572
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:45,908
4. PUT ICE
AND BANANA-FLAVORED MILK INTO A CUP

1573
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,646
The recipes for desserts are
more complicated than I thought.

1574
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,481
We didn't know better.

1575
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,149
Maple syrup, right?

1576
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,818
COATS WITH MAPLE SYRUP

1577
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,421
-It's as if he's making sushi.
-I love maple syrup.

1578
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,656
Cacao powder?

1579
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,658
Cacao powder.

1580
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:02,792
Cacao powder.

1581
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,361
The towel…

1582
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,163
It's not towel-shaped.

1583
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,264
-It's…
-A dishcloth.

1584
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,668
-It's the size of a dishcloth.
-How is this towel-shaped?

1585
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,102
FUNCTION HAS CHANGED

1586
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,239
-It's covered in dust.
-It seems to be a used towel.

1587
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,274
THE DISHCLOTH LOOKS DIRTY

1588
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,376
Chef Jong-won runs over.

1589
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:21,811
Two minutes and a half.

1590
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,079
Two minutes and thirty seconds.

1591
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,881
CUTS IT IN HALF!

1592
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,516
Did he cut it in half?

1593
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,718
-Yes, he turned it into six layers.
-He did.

1594
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:29,852
-Okay.
-Two minutes left.

1595
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,320
It's not easy to make desserts.

1596
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:32,822
Is he serving it now?

1597
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,157
MOVES IT TO ANOTHER PLATE

1598
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,459
AND BACK TO THE FREEZER!

1599
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,960
You can do it.

1600
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,862
Okay. That's good.

1601
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:41,898
Excellent job.

1602
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:42,799
MORE DECORATION

1603
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,401
Walnuts. And fresh cream.

1604
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:48,337
Desserts require a lot of work.

1605
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,274
I think Chef Jong-won will
squeeze something out.

1606
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,609
-Where are you going?
-Where?

1607
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,645
-Where are you going? The fridge?
-The fridge.

1608
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,747
He's adding more cream.

1609
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,515
He's adding more cream.

1610
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,451
He's piping it in the freezer!

1611
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,619
Chef Jong-won pipes cream in the freezer!

1612
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,988
-You have a minute! You're almost done!
-He's in the freezer.

1613
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,725
He keeps the freezer open
and pipes the cream there.

1614
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:12,061
He's good at rising to the occasion
no matter what the situation is.

1615
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,931
AMAZED

1616
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,766
FINISHES BEFORE FREEZING

1617
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:17,967
Thirty seconds.

1618
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,002
He handled it quickly.

1619
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,105
Ho-young is now
trying to present his dish.

1620
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,806
-It turned out well.
-Ho-young.

1621
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,542
-I thought they burnt.
-They turned out perfectly.

1622
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,244
Is this because he's on a roll?

1623
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,213
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds.

1624
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,981
-Lucky guys stay lucky.
-Walnuts.

1625
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:35,985
Jong-won must be waiting
for the cake to harden in the freezer.

1626
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:37,453
-Twenty seconds.
-Twenty seconds.

1627
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,856
Is he waiting for the cake in the freezer?

1628
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,860
-Yes, 15 seconds.
-Pull it out as slowly as possible.

1629
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,195
Ring the bell at the very last second.

1630
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,931
-Ho-young finishes.
-Pretend like you can't hear him.

1631
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,934
-Don't listen to him and move slowly.
-Seven. Six. Five.

1632
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,604
-He's done too.
-Chef Jong-won finishes too.

1633
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,506
HOW INCREDIBLE

1634
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,841
-Chef Jong-won finishes.
-He's done too.

1635
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,409
BOTH DESSERTS ARE FINISHED

1636
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,611
Great work.

1637
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,313
-They're done.
-It looks so hard.

1638
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,649
THE DESSERTS ARE ON THEIR WAY

1639
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,084
Desserts are always the hardest.

1640
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,152
These look insane.

1641
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,155
-This is so pretty.
-In just 15 minutes?

1642
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,189
They look good.

1643
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,459
Chef Ho-young's Dessert Maniac.

1644
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,096
TOWEL-SHAPED CAKE
MADE WITH CHOCOLATE CRÊPES

1645
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:25,768
TOPPED WITH REFRESHING FRUIT
AND SWEET CANDIED WALNUTS

1646
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:31,073
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S DESSERT MANIAC

1647
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,944
-Thank you.
-Yong-bok is serious about desserts.

1648
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,480
He said he was the type
who had to have dessert.

1649
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,615
First of all, I love chocolate

1650
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,517
and crêpes too.

1651
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,420
You should try
a piece of candied walnut to start.

1652
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,556
-Okay.
-After that, cut the cake

1653
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,325
and try everything together
with the fruit and walnuts.

1654
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,063
First, candied walnut.

1655
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,700
There's a particular restaurant I know
that serves candied walnuts

1656
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:58,935
on the side,

1657
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,070
and I love it a lot.

1658
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,472
You managed to make what he likes,

1659
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,174
although you didn't know that.

1660
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,943
I've never shared it with anyone.

1661
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,413
-It has the right amount of crunchiness.
-Does it?

1662
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:13,149
-The crunchiness.
-I like that crunchiness.

1663
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:16,786
-Thank you.
-I wonder if it'll be very nice.

1664
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,155
-That looks good.
-It does.

1665
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,490
-You can see the cream inside.
-It looks good.

1666
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,491
Lee Know is about to take a bite.

1667
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,327
IN ONE BITE?

1668
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,896
That looks like the delicious part.
He puts everything in.

1669
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,664
HE EATS IT ALL!

1670
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,734
-Take another bite later.
-Look at how his chin trembled.

1671
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,069
WELCOME DESSERT

1672
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,937
ME TOO?

1673
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,272
I'm shivering with anticipation.

1674
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,741
ONE HUGE BITE

1675
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,011
-That's how you eat dessert.
-Felix takes a big bite too.

1676
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:45,147
He closes his eyes and savors the taste.

1677
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,816
-It looks so good.
-Wow to the both of them.

1678
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,986
-It tastes so light.
-Light?

1679
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,654
-It tastes light.
-Light.

1680
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:52,588
Light is good.

1681
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,190
-It's not too sweet…
-It must be light and good.

1682
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,692
-…and the amount of sugar is perfect.
-I see.

1683
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:00,563
It's the kind of flavor
you can eat forever.

1684
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,498
So, Felix? Is it very nice?

1685
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,534
-Very nice. It's very, very nice.
-Very nice.

1686
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,169
NICE!

1687
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,839
ANOTHER DELICIOUS BITE

1688
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,408
He goes back for another bite.

1689
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,010
HESITANT?

1690
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,811
-Did he find something?
-It's the fruit.

1691
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,881
He said it was too sour.

1692
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,449
-I see. The flavor?
-I thought

1693
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,551
it would be much sweeter than this.

1694
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,354
-But was the fruit sour?
-Yes, it's sour.

1695
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,558
But these are all sweet,
so it's a nice balance.

1696
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,761
The sourness adds balance.

1697
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,396
Why did you shudder, Lee Know?

1698
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,631
I tried just the fruit,

1699
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,366
-and…
-Because it was sour?

1700
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,636
-Well, yes. If you eat just the fruit.
-Of course.

1701
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,306
-It gets neutralized altogether, right?
-Yes.

1702
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,675
WANT SOME?

1703
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,410
Did MARK want some?

1704
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:48,544
No, I just…

1705
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,578
Do you want some?

1706
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:50,713
I'd be very grateful.

1707
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,449
-He wants to try it.
-He'd be grateful if he got to try it.

1708
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,519
But I am eating a lot today.

1709
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,853
I can somehow keep eating.

1710
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,722
You should eat on a day like this.

1711
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,824
-He's sharing right away.
-What good friends.

1712
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,225
Yes, please do share.

1713
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,728
-Let's try it together.
-Thank you.

1714
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,129
They're sharing everything
over two episodes.

1715
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,197
JEALOUS

1716
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,032
It was good together,

1717
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,401
-but just the fruit was…
-Was it too strong?

1718
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,471
I'M SO EXCITED

1719
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:18,641
Aren't you eating too much
since last week?

1720
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,742
Do you feel okay?

1721
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,510
I love <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

1722
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,980
A PLACE THAT GIVES US GOOD FOOD
IS A GREAT PLACE

1723
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:24,947
I'm just worried.

1724
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,649
I love sour food,

1725
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:30,152
so I go crazy for something that tastes

1726
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,520
both sweet and sour.

1727
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,856
-Everyone has different palates.
-It was perfect.

1728
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,959
Next, please try
Chef Jong-won's banana crêpe.

1729
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:40,162
CRÊPE PILED UP WITH BANANA CREAM

1730
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,266
HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE

1731
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,569
AND BANANA MILK

1732
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,140
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S EAT BANANA CRÊPE,
YONG-BOK, AND GET LUCKY, LEE KNOW?

1733
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,275
He's serving the banana crêpe.

1734
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,811
-That way, it looks better.
-He's…

1735
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,713
I'd buy this
if it's available in the market.

1736
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,717
I remembered that
you drink beverages with desserts.

1737
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,254
What's that?

1738
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,490
-I see.
-When did you make that?

1739
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,791
I thought it was for the crêpe.

1740
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,559
-I thought it'd go on top.
-Yes.

1741
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,229
It's banana chocolate latte.

1742
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,964
THE CURIOUS BLOND MEERKAT

1743
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,733
This is to celebrate
your first place on the Billboard chart.

1744
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,301
Look at this!

1745
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,237
CONGRATULATIONS

1746
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,040
-His performance.
-Jong-won does this.

1747
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,342
NERVOUS

1748
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,812
Ho-young,
why didn't you prepare any candles?

1749
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,248
All right. Even celebrating with them.

1750
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,984
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations!

1751
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,285
-Okay.
-Two, three.

1752
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,386
BLOWING OUT WITH GRATITUDE

1753
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,791
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST PLACE
ON THE BILLBOARD CHART

1754
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:44,060
-That sauce was unexpected.
-It looks good.

1755
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,429
-I thought the sauce was for the crêpe.
-Right?

1756
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,497
NOT A PAUSED SCREEN

1757
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,066
-We didn't know.
-No.

1758
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,834
-MARK.
-Yes?

1759
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,203
How can he not share
when you look at him like that?

1760
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,173
-MARK, he can't ignore you now.
-How did I look?

1761
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,507
I was just focused.

1762
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,943
PUTTING MARK'S ENVY BEHIND
AND TAKING THE FIRST BITE

1763
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,012
-I think it'll be delicious.
-You keep looking at them like this.

1764
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,413
JEALOUS

1765
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,684
DROPPING THE FORK AND KNIFE?

1766
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,685
All right.

1767
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,787
-He dropped them.
-Why?

1768
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,256
Why? What is it?

1769
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,058
-What is it?
-Do you need help?

1770
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,593
HE CAN'T SPEAK

1771
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,429
-Was it sour? It wasn't sour before.
-What's wrong?

1772
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,431
How do I put this?

1773
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:23,432
AN INEXPLICABLE TASTE?

1774
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,767
-He's feeling it.
-It has to be good.

1775
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,169
He's unable to say anything.

1776
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:31,006
It melts away
the moment it goes into the mouth,

1777
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,043
and it enters saying, "Hey, I'm banana."

1778
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,878
-Banana.
-I see.

1779
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,980
And I can feel another texture.

1780
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,448
What did you put inside?

1781
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,918
-A mix of walnuts and chocolate.
-Chocolate.

1782
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,387
Everything goes so well together.

1783
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,622
-Goodness.
-I see.

1784
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,224
I can't speak in this sugar high.

1785
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,695
-It needs to be sweet.
-It should be.

1786
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,765
-He takes another bite.
-It looks good.

1787
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,935
-Something is up with Felix.
-Felix.

1788
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,804
He seems restless.

1789
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,939
Why can't he control himself?

1790
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,875
Chocolate,

1791
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,576
banana, and cream.

1792
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:10,646
Everything's perfect.

1793
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:11,714
It's perfect.

1794
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,850
When I want to get some rest
and relieve stress

1795
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,418
after a tough day of work,

1796
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,955
I'd feel great right away
as soon as I have a bite

1797
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,957
of this dessert.

1798
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,959
It's really soft,

1799
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:25,394
as if I'm lying in bed.

1800
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:28,697
-I see.
-This is almost therapeutic.

1801
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,171
If I were to say that in Korean,
it would be perfection.

1802
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,706
-Perfection.
-It's perfect.

1803
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:41,176
I also love the taste of bananas,

1804
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,579
and my great-grandmother
often made banana shake for me

1805
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,447
back in Australia.

1806
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,883
-She made it often.
-When you were in Australia?

1807
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,084
Yes, when I was still a kid.

1808
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,786
When your great-grandmother
was still here?

1809
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,988
-Well, she's still here.
-I see.

1810
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,225
-Your great-grandmother is still alive?
-Yes, she's still with us.

1811
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,928
I'm suddenly thinking of home.

1812
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:02,431
I see. He was reminded
of his great-grandmother this time.

1813
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,867
-And the drink was great too.
-Tell us about the drink too.

1814
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,536
It's been sitting out here
for a while, right?

1815
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:11,907
So the sweetness could've been diluted
when the ice melted.

1816
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:14,310
What was the chocolate you gave us?

1817
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,079
I mixed cocoa powder, sugar,

1818
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:20,216
and the same amount of water
to make a thick hot chocolate.

1819
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,952
It melts well
when you pour it while it's hot.

1820
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,521
When he added the sauce,

1821
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,957
I knew I could have this for a long time.

1822
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:31,026
-There are bits of chocolate too.
-You can chew on them, right?

1823
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,362
-I liked the texture.
-Excuse me.

1824
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,399
-Why don't you let them try some?
-Yes, these two.

1825
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:38,767
You should have some, right?

1826
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,136
-I'll accept it with gratitude.
-With gratitude.

1827
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,571
He'll accept it with gratitude.

1828
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,573
-I want to try some.
-Thank you.

1829
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,975
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD

1830
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,443
I thought they didn't eat much.

1831
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,678
That was what we heard,
but they both eat well.

1832
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,648
These two had a big appetite.

1833
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,483
-It looks delicious.
-Yes.

1834
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,185
Look at MARK.

1835
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,054
Nothing can stop MARK now.

1836
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,857
I understood what he meant.

1837
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,727
-Nothing is wrong with this.
-No problems at all?

1838
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,362
-Really.
-There's nothing lacking?

1839
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,397
It's really good.

1840
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:09,765
BOWING

1841
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:13,235
They finished everything quickly.
Look at how many dishes there are.

1842
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,137
You might end up visiting next week too.

1843
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:17,239
Wasn't I?

1844
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,875
Really? We're open if you want to come.

1845
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,845
The first one had a subtle and mild taste,

1846
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,781
-but this one had a huge impact.
-A big impact.

1847
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:27,583
It definitely was impactful.

1848
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,685
It's time to decide the winner.

1849
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,754
Press one for Son Jong-won

1850
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,889
and two for Jung Ho-young.

1851
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,893
-This is way too hard.
-Is it?

1852
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,864
Well, you each get to make a choice.

1853
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,432
-Did you pick?
-I did.

1854
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,668
Now…

1855
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,469
I decided. I made my choice.

1856
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,405
Yong-bok made his choice.

1857
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,339
All right, now.

1858
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,940
ARE THEY ON THE SAME PAGE?

1859
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,510
Their choices are…

1860
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:56,979
different.

1861
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,983
SO INTENSE

1862
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,886
-It ended up like this.
-Yes.

1863
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,688
-Please have a discussion.
-Yes.

1864
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:06,889
Feel free to talk.

1865
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:08,490
You know how they feel, right?

1866
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,826
-I feel more relaxed now.
-You do?

1867
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,828
You had to discuss twice last week.

1868
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,597
-They're having a serious discussion.
-Yes.

1869
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,366
SERIOUS KIDS

1870
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:21,370
Chef Hyun-suk is
doing his best to read their lips.

1871
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,972
LIPREADING

1872
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,275
-Can you read lips?
-Right?

1873
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,609
-Are you done?
-Yup!

1874
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,547
Then let's find out Stray Kids' choice.
Show us!

1875
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:33,916
This was a dessert round.

1876
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,286
Which dessert
did members of Stray Kids choose?

1877
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,688
Lee Know and Felix,

1878
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,056
which one is it?

1879
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,491
What's your final decision?

1880
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,294
Who is it?

1881
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,762
EYES WIDENED

1882
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,297
Who is it?

1883
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,099
SON JONG-WON WINS

1884
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,334
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S
YONG-BOK'S BANANA CRÊPE, LEE KNOW? WINS

1885
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,403
Son Jong-won wins!

1886
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,705
Son Jong-won is the winner!

1887
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:58,307
Jong-won wins!

1888
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:01,310
YOU DID IT, JONG-WON

1889
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,012
It was so hard to choose.
I had to keep thinking about it.

1890
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,914
For the first one,

1891
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:09,118
I could taste fruit
and many different flavors,

1892
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,320
so I thought the mix was perfect.

1893
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,622
So do I want a bit of everything?

1894
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:17,693
Or do I want something with a big impact,
something that focuses on a single flavor?

1895
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,364
I personally thought
the latter moved my heart much more.

1896
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,934
You managed to take down Ho-young
from his five straight wins.

1897
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,238
I actually thought
his dessert came out better.

1898
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,106
I wanted to make it pretty

1899
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,175
like a whole cake
and give it to you as a present,

1900
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,843
but it didn't go as planned.

1901
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,679
-So I feel kind of bad.
-I see.

1902
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,115
-It was great.
-He wanted to celebrate.

1903
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,083
It was because

1904
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,586
the texture didn't come out right
for Chef Jong-won.

1905
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,156
He's always good
at finding the balance in flavor,

1906
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,892
so he already had
a good balance of sweetness.

1907
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,093
It was just the texture that was off.

1908
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,495
Even after winning a star,
top chefs aren't happy…

1909
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,831
-That's not what's important.
-…if it doesn't turn out

1910
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:58,133
-the way he wants it to.
-I should learn from him.

1911
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,234
He's different from us.

1912
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,570
-Winning a star is the best!
-Exactly.

1913
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,806
-That's the point!
-Yes, right?

1914
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,774
I don't even remember what I made.

1915
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,210
-My gosh.
-I can't remember.

1916
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,580
-All you have to do is win.
-Tell me about it.

1917
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,916
Sadly for Ho-young,
you lost your winning streak.

1918
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:15,751
It's okay

1919
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,687
because it was such an honor
to dance with them.

1920
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:21,356
-His focus is on dancing.
-That's a big deal.

1921
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,391
He just needs to dance.

1922
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,160
-Today was…
-Did you hit yourself too hard like this?

1923
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,931
-You should get a CT scan.
-He really knuckled himself.

1924
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,166
I think he hurt himself.

1925
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,636
-Please put a star on Chef Jong-won.
-Excellent job.

1926
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,506
Jong-won returns with a victory!

1927
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,974
He takes another win!

1928
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,143
STAY TUNED FOR JO WOO-JIN
AND PARK JI-HWAN'S PREVIEW

1929
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,779
THE BOSSES HAVE VISITED THE SHOW

1930
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,113
It wasn't me.

1931
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,148
He's scary.

1932
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,349
Cut this one off.

1933
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,550
Whoa. Hey.

1934
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,219
PASSIONATE PERFORMANCE

1935
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,955
FAILING TO STAY FOCUSED

1936
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:54,490
FRIDGE OWNERS: JO WOO-JIN & PARK JI-HWAN

1937
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:56,158
I hear you're such a romanticist.

1938
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,193
He calls his wife "my lady."

1939
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,261
-My lady?
-My lady.

1940
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,029
When she says, "Come here, Woo-jin,"

1941
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,898
I go, "Yes, my lady."

1942
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:03,932
SUMMONING HER SERVANT

1943
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,468
I wanted to cook for my lady.

1944
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,836
-It's not easy.
-That's so cool.

1945
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,205
A dish for his beloved lady.

1946
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:11,807
A thin layer of radish.

1947
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,041
I see. Just like that?

1948
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,110
THE CHEFS CAPTURE THE ROMANTICIST'S HEART

1949
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,846
THE DANCING FAIRY'S INDOCTRINATION

1950
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,449
My heart also fluttered a little
when he used his teeth.

1951
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,784
What do you think, honey? Isn't this cool?

1952
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:23,752
SHOW MY FIERY LOVE

1953
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,287
I can do this at home, right?

1954
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,488
You can do this, you can.

1955
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:27,990
Just get some food delivered.

1956
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,658
These are dishes for his lady.

1957
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:32,394
My wife would make this face
when she has a bite of this.

1958
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:33,529
You're crazy!

1959
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,667
Are you craving this?

1960
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,469
It's driving me crazy.

1961
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:56,718
