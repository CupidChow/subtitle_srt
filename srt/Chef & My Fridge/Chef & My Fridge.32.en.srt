1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,583
You're watching <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

2
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,352
Previously, Jin of BTS

3
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:23,289
finished shooting his episode
and had to leave for another appointment.

4
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,460
He couldn't spare any time,
but he managed to find some for us.

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:33,466
Thank you very much for welcoming me
back on the show after eight years.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:38,004
I'll try to convince my members
to come and visit the show in the future.

7
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,205
Thank you.

8
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,375
I hope both BTS and the show
continue to thrive.

9
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,309
Thank you!

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,814
I'd like to ask the viewers
and Sae-ho for your understanding.

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,684
So now, we're here with Cho Sae-ho,
our only guest for the episode.

12
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,919
Thank you.

13
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,354
The only guest.

14
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,824
People who tuned in only this week
might be a bit surprised,

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,659
but there was a bit of a situation,

16
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,227
so I got to sit here alone today.

17
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,397
-This is the first time in our history.
-It's never happened before.

18
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,434
I know Sae-ho pretty well,
and he looks very anxious right now.

19
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,738
I have to get my mouth in shape
and be ready to talk.

20
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,174
-You must have a lot on your mind.
-I feel rushed.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,878
If you give me enough time,
I can continue to talk until his flight.

22
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,413
STARING
OKAY?

23
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,387
I add a bit of exaggeration, okay?

24
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:34,661
Sae-ho has returned
to <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> after eight years.

25
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,897
Many things have changed in that time.

26
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,601
Especially that you now share your fridge
with someone.

27
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,604
Let me ask you point-blank.
What's married life like?

28
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,072
HEHE

29
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,774
-I'm happy.
-Of course.

30
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,377
I have no way of explaining
how happy I am in words.

31
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,713
-He already looks happy.
-He does.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,582
When you find a very good restaurant,

33
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,686
you think to yourself, "If I had known,
I could've enjoyed this place sooner."

34
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,188
Just like that, I wonder

35
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,993
what my last ten years would've been like
if I had known her sooner.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,462
However, life can't be 100% satisfactory.

37
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,264
-Right.
-After getting married,

38
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,266
-was there a tiny negative change?
-Really?

39
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,235
Just a bit of inconvenience?

40
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,706
It may sound juvenile,
but I used to love to splurge.

41
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,376
Now, I find myself hesitating
whenever I want to buy something.

42
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,811
What did you not get recently?

43
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,880
The weather was great,

44
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:31,484
so I wanted to get
a tiny little new bag for the season,

45
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,720
-but I've been holding myself back.
-A bag.

46
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,488
-I see.
-You're saying

47
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,291
that's a negative
and inconvenient part of marriage, right?

48
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,727
Did I say it like that?

49
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,296
Why do you take it that way?

50
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,732
It's a change from my previous life.

51
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,268
But my life is full of happiness now,

52
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,271
so I really had to fish
for anything negative.

53
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,774
-You went to Italy for your honeymoon.
-We did.

54
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,912
You filmed a short-form content there,
and it received lots of attention.

55
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,480
Why don't we take a look?

56
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,348
This is a photo
from his honeymoon in Italy.

57
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,884
-We're seeing it on this huge screen?
-Of course.

58
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,153
TA-DA

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,788
He filmed this content.

60
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,391
I can tell how beautiful she is
just by the silhouette.

61
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,960
THE TWO ARE SO MUCH IN LOVE

62
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,862
Why am I so jealous?

63
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,565
Why is this so funny to watch?

64
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,133
CONTENT

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,202
-Look how happy Sae-ho is.
-Gosh.

66
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,070
EMBARRASSED

67
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,506
-That was great.
-I feel shy.

68
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,210
-What's wrong?
-Do you feel shy? What's up?

69
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,478
-Is he going to cry?
-I do feel a bit shy

70
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,014
because it was shown
on such a huge screen.

71
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,351
<i>-Many people loved the video.</i>
<i>-They did.</i>

72
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,386
<i>Was there any comment that was memorable?</i>

73
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,390
"That reminds me of a mom
taking her son home after kindergarten."

74
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,459
-Going home?
-Kindergarten.

75
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,696
-Since she's a bit taller than me.
-You're right.

76
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,931
She's rather tall, right?

77
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,133
We began to talk about height,
so she asked me.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,503
-I told her I was 170 cm.
-I see.

79
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,173
After some time,
I had to get a physical checkup

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,176
for a part of a show I was in.

81
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,945
-Something's about to come out.
-It's already funny.

82
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,380
It was a spot I had to do.

83
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,715
When I got my height measured,

84
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,584
it said I was 166.9 cm.

85
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,620
My wife saw that and said,

86
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,589
"Sae-ho, are you 166.9 cm tall?"

87
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,757
THE MISSING 3.1 CM

88
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,891
You lied a bit too much.

89
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,760
I should've been more humorous,

90
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,096
but I just said, "Hey, it's funny.'

91
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,430
FORCING HER TO LAUGH

92
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,698
I was so flustered.

93
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,734
It felt like showing my report card
to my parents.

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,168
FAITH AND FUN
WERE BOTH LOST

95
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,238
Sae-ho is someone
who's adored by many people,

96
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,142
-not just by those in the show business.
-Definitely.

97
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,644
<i>When he got married last year,</i>

98
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,813
<i>he ended up welcoming over 900 guests.</i>

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,750
Nine hundred people?

100
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,919
And the guests who came
made it seem like an awards show.

101
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,622
<i>G-Dragon, Taeyang,</i>

102
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,091
<i>Yu Jae-seok, and Lee Dong-wook.</i>

103
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,493
<i>I was grateful for that.</i>

104
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,763
For our wedding's grand finale,

105
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,065
Nam Chang-hee was the host of the wedding,

106
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,168
and the wedding guests were
made perfect after this person came.

107
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,570
He said,
"Mr. Ahn Jae-wook, please stand up."

108
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,774
<i>-Jae-wook came. Yes, I heard.</i>
<i>-The first time</i>

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,710
I was made known through a meme
when someone asked…

110
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,479
-"I don't know him."
-…why I didn't go to Jae-wook's wedding.

111
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,448
<i>I said, "I don't know him.</i>
<i>How can I go there?"</i>

112
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,750
That was such a huge meme.

113
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,988
So on that day, many people
shared an applause to thank him.

114
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,157
Jae-wook is such a big man.

115
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,160
He had so many people
who came to celebrate his wedding because…

116
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,961
-He keeps good connections.
-He does.

117
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,196
How do you do that?

118
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,599
-I think I learned a lot from Jung-hwan.
-Me?

119
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,735
-From Jung-hwan?
-I mean it.

120
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,806
We once went overseas together
to do a shoot,

121
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,308
and Jung-hwan sat next to me
on the flight.

122
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,010
I looked through the duty-free brochure,

123
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,446
and my eyes landed on a bottle of whiskey.

124
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,115
I looked at it for a while,
closed the brochure, and went to sleep.

125
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,750
When I woke up,

126
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,418
right under my feet

127
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,955
was the bottle of whiskey all bagged up.

128
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,157
I wondered why it was there,

129
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,460
and Jung-hwan had bought it for me
while I was asleep.

130
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,528
-He's like Santa.
-True story.

131
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,064
How fixated were you on that bottle?

132
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,966
He's really good at doing this.

133
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,268
When we shot this fishing show,

134
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,437
I saw that he came with a cute suitcase.

135
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,806
So Byung-jae and I said, "Cute suitcase."

136
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,675
And the next shoot,
he got the same one for us.

137
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,679
-You have to get this story on air.
-Please do.

138
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,950
We're here today
with our only guest, Cho Sae-ho.

139
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,184
It's not easy to be the only guest

140
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,019
-for the first time in a while.
-It's not.

141
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,788
We usually go back and forth
between two people.

142
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,456
You have to bring up old stories too.

143
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,959
If any of my friends are free,
I want to call one of them.

144
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,761
You have great connections,
so you can do that.

145
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,562
I can call someone and check.

146
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,297
-Really?
-That'd be great for us.

147
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,866
-You'll find 1 among 900.
-A good friend.

148
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,401
There has to be someone among 900.

149
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,103
Everyone lives a busy life.

150
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,272
-But Wooyoung… Yes.
-Jang Wooyoung?

151
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,475
I thought it'd be nice if he could come.

152
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,944
-We do have an open seat right now.
-We do.

153
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,579
-Ask him to come and eat.
-That'd be nice.

154
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,849
We have the best chefs in Korea
waiting to cook for him.

155
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,352
DIALING…

156
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,355
IT SEEMS THAT…

157
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,490
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>
<i>Please leave…</i>

158
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,025
TOTAL FAILURE

159
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,693
-He must be busy.
-He must be in a shoot.

160
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,728
-He must be.
-Yes.

161
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,163
He fails to get Wooyoung here.

162
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,699
-You can find someone among 900.
-At least 1.

163
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,768
Let me move on to the next person.

164
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,303
-Right away?
-Yes.

165
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,205
He has so many connections, 900 of them.

166
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,841
How does Sae-ho treat others
to keep such great connections?

167
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,078
Sae-ho's really nice.
And he's good to his elders.

168
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,781
RINGING

169
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,550
Who are you calling?

170
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,318
-Nam Chang-hee.
-Chang-hee?

171
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,488
-If he doesn't pick up…
-This is…

172
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,823
I doubt he's in a shoot.

173
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,526
He's been playing tennis recently.

174
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,296
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>
<i>Please leave…</i>

175
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,198
TO VOICEMAIL AGAIN

176
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,633
At this rate, I'll end up calling my wife.

177
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:54,207
I'll put it here in case they call back
to pick it up right away.

178
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,709
-That'd make you too nervous to talk.
-It's fine.

179
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,544
Please let me know when it rings.

180
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,712
TOSSING HIS JOB

181
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,646
MISSION RECEIVED

182
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,281
Let him know when someone calls.

183
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,516
STARE…

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,185
Will Sae-ho find a friend
to eat with today?

185
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,756
Sae-ho returns today after eight years
as the most romantic guy in the world.

186
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,994
I wonder how his fridge changed
compared to back then.

187
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,864
This is Sae-ho's fridge,
my dear Sae-ho's fridge.

188
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,433
From what I remember, eight years ago,

189
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,536
you intentionally kept
lots of ingredients to show off.

190
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,372
-I had staged some things.
-You had lots of fancy ingredients.

191
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,107
I found a bottle of wine.

192
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,876
I probably have three open bottles.

193
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,245
-This is…
-That's foie gras.

194
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,314
Honestly speaking, they're decorations.
They're just there for show.

195
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,883
He may have lived alone,

196
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:41,254
but he was full of pretentiousness
back in the day.

197
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,956
I wonder what it's like
now that he's a newlywed.

198
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,460
-We present Sae-ho's newlywed fridge!
-Fridge!

199
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,463
It looks organized.

200
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,299
It does seem quite organized.

201
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,535
I must be seeing your wife's work here.

202
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,137
First, the top shelf.
<i>Miyeok-guk</i>, seaweed soup.

203
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,140
These are ready-made pouches
available at convenience stores.

204
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,378
When we have to eat lunch
or breakfast in a hurry, we eat that.

205
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,281
Do you not cook often at home?

206
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,683
At the moment, I've been busy,

207
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,719
so when I have time, there are
so many places I want to go with her.

208
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:14,854
-You must eat out often.
-Yes.

209
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,324
I try to make one or two reservations
at a nice restaurant per week.

210
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,960
-So we eat out pretty often.
-He's so sweet.

211
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,628
I'm so jealous.

212
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,796
You're jealous?

213
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,097
Oh, no.

214
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:29,402
I found some fresh cream.
What's this? Mozzarella.

215
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,637
How do you use these?

216
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,808
I top tortilla with mozzarella

217
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,012
and turn it into easy pizza
by toasting it in a pan.

218
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,549
And we use fresh cream
to make cream pasta.

219
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,817
Do you have pasta too?

220
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,586
Yes, you'll find them over there.

221
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,788
-I found them.
-They're kept at room temperature.

222
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,990
-I see.
-He has two packs.

223
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,795
Was there a dish you made
that your wife really enjoyed?

224
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,798
I once made carbonara for her,

225
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,967
and she said it felt like
we were eating out.

226
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,703
-Really?
-So she said that once.

227
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,038
What was something she made
which you liked the most?

228
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,175
There's this adorable story about her.

229
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,846
She once made rigatoni
with a one pan recipe.

230
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,816
After she got a taste,
she banned me from the kitchen

231
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,818
when I tried to take a bite.

232
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,187
The rigatoni pieces were undercooked,

233
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,022
but it was still delicious.

234
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,191
-That's the flavor of love.
-It was love.

235
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,159
That's the fun when you're a newlywed.

236
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,495
He would've loved it
even if you chipped a tooth.

237
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,398
Who cares about my teeth?
We can get implants these days.

238
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,900
-Implants are even better than teeth.
-They last forever.

239
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,369
Let's check the vegetables.

240
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,204
You have quite a variety.

241
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,439
PAPRIKA, CABBAGE
TOMATO, ARUGULA

242
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,142
Is this cilantro? Do you like herbs?

243
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,646
Both my wife and I love cilantro.

244
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,180
And shiitakes.

245
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,050
-Those are button mushrooms.
-Button mushrooms. Are these shiitakes?

246
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,853
-Pine mushrooms.
-Those are pine mushrooms.

247
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,422
Gosh, once again,

248
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,158
I see some bottles of wine.

249
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,060
Look. This is a nice bottle, right?

250
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,629
-It's a Pérignon.
-Right?

251
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,366
Did you bring it to show it off?
Or do you plan to pop a bottle here?

252
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,635
Well, it was to show
that we had a bottle at home,

253
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,003
so it'll go home with me.

254
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,806
But what if you're feeling good?

255
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,675
Well, sure, if I'm feeling good

256
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,077
and if we have a reason to pop it.

257
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,515
If any of you have a reason
to celebrate with a drink, sure.

258
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,750
-It was his birthday.
-It was Kyun's birthday.

259
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,851
-When was it?
-Really?

260
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,886
In two days.

261
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,254
Two days are a bit of a stretch.

262
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,491
BOO-HOO

263
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,794
-It's not today.
-It had to be today.

264
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,128
But it's in two days.

265
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,963
HE HAS A STRICT GUIDELINE

266
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,867
I'm sorry. Today's okay.
But later than today…

267
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,537
-The way he said it, though.
-I'm sorry.

268
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,705
SAYING SORRY WITH HIS FACE

269
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,974
-Two days are too far away.
-We must celebrate on the day.

270
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,310
Does anyone have anything to celebrate?

271
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,446
-Anything?
-What about your birthday, Hyun-suk?

272
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,081
Mine is four days after Kyun's.

273
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,716
-Oh, no.
-It's in six days?

274
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,884
Six days are way too far away.

275
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,386
BOO-HOO SEASON 2

276
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,322
I quit my job yesterday.

277
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,391
QUITTING HER JOB
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE

278
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,660
We should've opened it yesterday, then.

279
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,765
-We can't do that today. Gosh.
-She quit yesterday, so she's free today.

280
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,634
-We have nothing to celebrate.
-We should celebrate today.

281
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,503
Chef Edward won a star.

282
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,438
His first star.

283
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,806
HE GOT HIS FIRST STAR FROM JIN

284
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,408
Thank you. I enjoyed it.

285
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,043
His first star.

286
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,778
But it wasn't from me.

287
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,749
-I didn't give it to you.
-It wasn't him.

288
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,084
There's no way we can open the bottle.

289
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,486
Anyone? Anything?

290
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,021
Sae-ho, who did you share
the whiskey I gave you with?

291
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,658
I probably had it
with Chang-hee and a few other friends.

292
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,927
I got you that bottle,
so can you open it for me?

293
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,629
That was whiskey.

294
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,932
THAT WAS WHISKEY
THIS IS CHAMPAGNE

295
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,203
-I would've opened it if it were whiskey.
-He avoids everything.

296
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,239
He dodges everything smoothly.

297
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,640
Does anybody not drink?

298
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,509
-No one.
-Is that so?

299
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,511
-Ten glasses.
-I can't have enough of it.

300
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,548
It's great to return here
after such a long time,

301
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,386
and champagne may go well
when I eat the food they make, right?

302
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,890
So if I find a chance
to enjoy the drink with everyone,

303
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,858
I'll look into it.

304
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,728
-He'll look into it.
-We can't just open it now.

305
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,398
I hope the chefs give him
a reason to open the bottle.

306
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,568
Let's look through the freezer.

307
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,536
Are these blue crabs?

308
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,371
-I have blue crabs there.
-Crabs. Shrimps.

309
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,807
-I also like shrimp.
-These are huge.

310
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,576
-Look at this.
-Hey.

311
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,977
Are these snow crabs?

312
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,880
-Snow crabs.
-Whoa, snow crabs?

313
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,849
-He has snow crabs.
-Do you like these?

314
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,285
I really love shellfish.

315
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,253
I don't eat them often, but I love them.

316
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,225
I also have a friend who runs
a wholesale business in seafood,

317
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,894
so I get those to eat with my wife.

318
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,296
These look cooked.

319
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,463
These are pre-steamed.

320
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,867
-Did you freeze them after?
-I asked him to send them cooked.

321
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,436
-I see some beef and pork.
-Yes.

322
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,372
You said something like this
eight years ago.

323
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,076
-"I feel good when I see good marbling."
-I do.

324
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,778
Do you still love to eat meat?

325
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,581
Even now,
when I go to a department store to shop,

326
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:12,351
I'd go to the produce section
to look at beef with good marbling.

327
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,620
I just enjoy looking at them.

328
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,656
-They have good marbling…
-Just looking at them?

329
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,325
-I don't have to buy.
-Window shopping?

330
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,196
When you put your arm against the glass,
you can feel the chill. I love that too.

331
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,066
-It may seem odd, but…
-I totally get it.

332
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,835
If you keep staring at it,

333
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:34,373
it feels like you're looking
into the universe. It feels great.

334
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,342
-He loves meat that much.
-That's a lot of love.

335
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,277
I've never heard of anyone
who window shops for meat.

336
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,779
-Please use the ingredients wisely.
-Do you get it?

337
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,680
He has lots of meat.

338
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,749
What's this?

339
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,052
-Those are tortillas.
-Tortillas.

340
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,756
It's easy to whip up simple meals
when you keep tortillas at home.

341
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,926
I even like to just cut it up
and dip it in sauce.

342
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,394
I make good use of those.

343
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,929
Have you been into these lately?

344
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,065
I've been hooked on tacos.

345
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,368
-My wife and I've been enjoying those.
-Mexican food.

346
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,469
SALIVATES

347
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,370
All right.

348
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,273
That's all for Sae-ho,
the romantic guy's fridge.

349
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,209
THE END OF THE TOUR
INSIDE SAE-HO, THE ROMANTIC GUY'S FRIDGE

350
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:14,847
Now, let's find out
the kind of food he asked for today.

351
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,848
Please show us.

352
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,182
It's time to see his orders.

353
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,019
-By any chance, are we in Mexico?
-Are we in Mexico?

354
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,722
-Tacos?
-As I mentioned just now,

355
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,158
I've been hooked on tacos lately.

356
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,962
-I see.
-I wanted to visit Cancún, Mexico.

357
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,866
I've never been to the beach there,

358
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,502
but I wanted to get the feel
of a dish I can eat…

359
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,505
-The taste of Mexico.
-Yes, I want a taste of Mexico.

360
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,840
-I haven't been to Mexico yet.
-Is that so?

361
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,976
Let's find out what his second order is.

362
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,712
-Enjoying snow crabs?
-Snow crabs?

363
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,947
An order for a snow crab dish.

364
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,815
The only way I eat snow crabs

365
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,185
tend to be just steaming them.

366
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,956
So I wanted to eat something
really delicious today.

367
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,025
-Enjoying snow crabs?
-Something delicious with snow crabs.

368
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,694
These are his orders.

369
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,131
Sam Kim, Kim Poong,
Lim Tae-hun, and Park Eun-yeong remain.

370
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,436
In that case, let's give a chance
to a chef who's having a rough time.

371
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:15,240
-Chef Sam, please. He's not feeling great.
-Not these days.

372
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,443
I always got tacos for dinner

373
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,412
whenever I got off work
while living in America for 12 years.

374
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,181
-There was this food truck.
-I see.

375
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,217
I'll go with "Are we in Mexico?"

376
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,986
He's going to make tacos.

377
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,722
Wouldn't Poong do a great job
at making Mexican food?

378
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,056
-You're right.
-Poong.

379
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:31,991
-Poong?
-Will you do it?

380
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,227
-You had the right idea.
-What right idea?

381
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,530
The most unforgettable dish
I had on this show

382
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,432
was cooked by Poong back then.

383
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,901
-I still dream about it now.
-What was it?

384
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,336
He made this soup

385
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,505
with one strand of noodle.

386
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,941
It was so shocking.

387
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,911
I have a feeling
Sae-ho will get only one bite of noodles.

388
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,446
That's not enough.

389
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,215
Please don't take this the wrong way.

390
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:01,920
It feels like I'm eating <i>jjamppong</i>
left behind by my neighbor.

391
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,323
-Today--
-That was shocking for me too.

392
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,792
-He remembers it like it was yesterday.
-Yes.

393
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,661
-It must've had a huge impact.
-Exactly.

394
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:14,233
I wanted to provide extra customer service
for my previous dish today.

395
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,368
Also, Sam was the first one

396
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,270
to suffer from Poongphobia.

397
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:22,775
-Poongphobia.
-I plan to put him back in bed.

398
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,943
Stop harassing Sam, will you?

399
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,247
-I'll make Mexican food.
-He goes for, "Are we in Mexico?"

400
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,316
All right. In that case, automatically,

401
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,052
-it's Eun-yeong versus Tae-hun.
-Okay.

402
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,687
You two will be using snow crabs.
Is that okay with you?

403
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,222
-It sounds great.
-It's fine.

404
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,957
How these things turn out.

405
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,227
I also love crab dishes

406
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,762
-in Chinese cuisine.
-I see.

407
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,098
There's a Chinese dish called
egg white with crab.

408
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,335
It's made with velveted egg whites
and other vegetables.

409
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,770
I really love that dish.

410
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,038
Chinese cuisine goes well

411
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,973
-with champagne.
-Right.

412
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,542
Don't Chinese dishes

413
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,510
go well with Chinese liquor?

414
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,546
It goes well with champagne?

415
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,714
Mexican dishes
also go well with champagne.

416
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,451
That's right. Let's see what happens.

417
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:10,689
Let us begin the first round
between Chef Sam and Webtoon Artist Poong!

418
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,862
<i>This is the first cook-off</i>
<i>with ingredients from Sae-ho's fridge.</i>

419
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,264
The man who's been shaking things up,

420
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:23,368
the very source of Poongphobia,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong

421
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,804
is up against Chef Sam Kim,

422
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,007
who's been suffering
from Poongphobia for ten years now.

423
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:33,579
We're seeing many more patients
of Poongphobia as the season continues.

424
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,883
-Chef Jong-won is shaking his head.
-He is.

425
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,987
To be exact, Sam was the first one
to suffer from Poongphobia.

426
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,356
When the show first started,

427
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,526
Poong won his first star
when he fought against Sam.

428
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,495
<i>-That's right.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

429
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,963
ILL-FATED SINCE 10 YEARS AGO

430
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,666
According to sources,
as soon as the opponents were decided,

431
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,468
Sam let out a big scream.

432
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,669
-Did he?
-Yes.

433
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,172
-What's wrong?
-He never gets that loud.

434
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,540
I don't know.

435
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,576
First thing that came
to my mind was, "Really? Him?"

436
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,378
And "why did it have to be now?"

437
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,548
-Are you recording four losses now?
-Four losses in a row, yes.

438
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,651
-It's time for Sam to show what he can do.
-He needs to.

439
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,554
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
OREGANO POWDER, STRIPLOIN, TORTILLA

440
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,623
LEMON JUICE, ROMAINE
TOMATOES, SCALLOPS, CORIANDER, FRESH CREAM

441
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,992
What are you making, Chef Sam?

442
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,727
The dish I prepared is called

443
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,030
Want a Star With This Taco.

444
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,899
Want a Star With This Taco.

445
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,535
-Want a Star With This Taco.
-I like the name.

446
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,669
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

447
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,072
He must want it badly
if he put it in his dish name.

448
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,607
I'm going to make something

449
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,477
crucial in South American dishes, ceviche.

450
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,579
-What? Ceviche?
-Ceviche.

451
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,448
I'm going to make it very quickly.

452
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,917
As for the tacos,

453
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,253
I'll season striploin and grill it,

454
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,022
and then serve it with delicious sauces

455
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,492
and make it taste
as close to the local food as possible.

456
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,460
READING THE ROOM

457
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,329
He's going to bring Cancún here.

458
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,264
-I've been to Cancún.
-I see.

459
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,335
He's been there instead of me,
so he'll give me that authentic taste.

460
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,070
Of course. He knows what it's like.

461
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,139
-He's had it there.
-Yes.

462
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,042
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
FRESH MOZZARELLA, PAPRIKA, OREGANO POWDER

463
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,077
LEMON JUICE, SRIRACHA, FRESH CREAM,
PORK BELLY, CABBAGE, TOMATO, AND MORE

464
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,747
It's all in Webtoon Artist Poong's hands.
What's he going to make today?

465
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,683
The dish I'm making is called

466
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,619
Que-Star-Dilla.

467
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,989
-Que-Star-Dilla?
-Que-Star-Dilla.

468
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,325
-Tortilla.
-Tortilla, Star-Dilla.

469
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,227
A close friend of tacos,

470
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,562
-I'm making quesadilla.
-Quesadilla.

471
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,965
-Quesadilla.
-I haven't had it in a while.

472
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,102
I'll use pork and shrimp
to make the filling.

473
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,974
Also, sour cream is very important
when you serve Mexican food.

474
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,576
I'll whip up some sour cream

475
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,312
by using fresh cream.

476
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,049
I've never been to Mexico,
so I don't know what it's like.

477
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,052
But I've been to many places
in the Hongdae area

478
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,522
that claim to have recreated
that authentic local taste.

479
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,492
I'll try to recreate that
as much as possible.

480
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,595
Well, people who haven't been there
may have a better connection.

481
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,497
I'm looking forward to this.

482
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,633
Who's going to become the winner?

483
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,834
And now,

484
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,272
let us begin
Sae-ho's Mexican cuisine round.

485
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:17,409
He's here to put Sam back in bed,
suffering from Poongphobia again.

486
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,145
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong,
the Sam Kim sniper, is up.

487
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,148
But Sam refuses
to be played by Poong anymore.

488
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,852
The Canine Villain, Chef Sam is also up.

489
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,453
The Canine Villain?

490
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,291
Which one of them will
give Sae-ho a taste of Mexico?

491
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,160
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

492
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,929
Let's go!

493
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,031
Begin!

494
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,432
REAL MEXICO VS HONGDAE'S MEXICO(?)

495
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,401
THEY BOTH BEGIN WITH ONION

496
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,369
Let's go to Mexico.

497
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,838
-They're doing the same thing.
-Onions.

498
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,140
They both begin with an onion.

499
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,741
I really love onions.

500
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,411
They're using the same method
with totally different skills.

501
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,612
Really?

502
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,282
They're chopping it the same way,
but their skill levels are different.

503
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,319
Aren't those pieces
big enough to make <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

504
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,955
-They're like radish kimchi pieces.
-They're for <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

505
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,591
Poong puts the onion into water.

506
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,759
Is he making it less spicy?

507
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,361
I'm making it less spicy.

508
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,197
-But Mexican cuisine is a bit spicy.
-It has that flavor.

509
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,333
But it's not the spiciness of onion.

510
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,935
-Whoa.
-What did he pour into that?

511
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:17,869
Sugar?

512
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,571
Really? That's new.

513
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,574
I'm making it less spicy
and seasoning it at the same time.

514
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,610
He should've mixed sugar and vinegar
before putting the onion in.

515
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,112
A TOUCHING CONTRARIAN MOVE

516
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,282
He's throwing in condiment
after putting the onion in water.

517
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,983
Reversed pickle.

518
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,686
-Reversed marinade.
-Reversed?

519
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,221
He's working hard on the onion.

520
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,690
THE TIP IS STILL INTACT

521
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,093
Are you leaving the tip in?

522
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,561
-What?
-The onion tip.

523
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,162
-The tip?
-You're leaving it in?

524
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,500
HE PULLS IT APART WITH HIS HANDS

525
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,537
SAM DIVIDES THE ONION HE CHOPPED
WITH HIS TEXTBOOK SKILLS

526
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,040
GRABS A TOMATO

527
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,509
Sam uses a tomato.

528
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,611
Onions and tomatoes are a must.

529
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,648
-Sam prepares everything so neatly.
-Very organized.

530
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,650
There will be a difference when they chop.

531
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,319
He's been cooking all his life.

532
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,954
So there's a difference.

533
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,789
They all look so neat.

534
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,958
ADDING LEMON JUICE

535
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,627
I sometimes mix lemon juice
with hard liquor on ice,

536
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,729
but it's nice to see it used
directly for a dish.

537
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,399
I see. He gets extra points.

538
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,000
POONG USES TOMATO TOO

539
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,668
Of course, tomato is a must.

540
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,670
Poong also grabs a tomato.

541
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,106
-They're doing similar things.
-What's he going to do?

542
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,941
He's doing what Sam's doing.

543
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,644
I've never seen anyone
dice a tomato like that.

544
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,313
-He's dicing a tomato like that?
-Like he's chopping an onion.

545
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,649
It probably won't work on a tomato.

546
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,384
-It's not like an onion.
-You don't do this?

547
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,254
It gets mushy. Chefs don't do that.

548
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,323
I've never seen anyone
dice a tomato like an onion.

549
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,893
And he's using a Chinese kitchen knife.

550
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,061
I can't add anything to that.

551
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,763
I lost to him three times in a row.

552
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,099
You can't be freed from Poongphobia.

553
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,134
Do you know how scary that is?

554
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,036
It seems extremely lethal.

555
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,273
They both can't back out of this battle.

556
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,443
AN UNAVOIDABLE BATTLE
TO ESCAPE FROM POONGPHOBIA

557
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,279
Who'll recreate
the authentic taste of Mexico?

558
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,014
2. MIX CHOPPED ONION, GREEN ONION, GARLIC,
AND OTHER CONDIMENTS

559
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,816
Cilantro.

560
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,152
He likes it. Sae-ho loves cilantro.

561
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,954
ADDING LOTS OF CORIANDER

562
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,223
THE MEAT MARINADE IS READY

563
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,524
What kind of meat is that?

564
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,792
This is striploin.

565
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:25,497
Chef Sam is marinating the beef with sauce
made with soy sauce and red pepper powder.

566
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,265
Whoa. What's he doing?

567
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,901
-Is he mixing it with the marinade?
-Yes.

568
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,471
I hope it gets seasoned in time.

569
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,240
POONG MIXES TOMATO WITH ONION

570
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,609
Poong's using lots of veggies.

571
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,712
-Paprika.
-Paprika. Jeez.

572
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,682
-Do you like paprika?
-Not very much.

573
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,716
STOPS

574
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:45,851
Damn it.

575
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,187
Why didn't you say so before?

576
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,891
That's something my wife likes.

577
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:57,796
But a bit of paprika adds
that key Mexican cuisine flavor.

578
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,132
Sae-ho loves cilantro very much.

579
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,934
LARGE PIECES OF PORK BELLY

580
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,403
-Is that pork?
-Yes.

581
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,806
They weren't cut into pieces.

582
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,541
CHUCKLING…

583
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,610
You have 11 minutes left.

584
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,577
Eleven minutes?

585
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,545
WHERE IS HE GOING?

586
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,248
He's cutting it with scissors.

587
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,883
Poong begins to use scissors.

588
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,686
-I guess he heard what Chef Hyun-suk said.
-Yup.

589
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,722
He cuts the uncut parts with scissors.

590
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,123
ADDING CURRY POWDER

591
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,157
Curry? Is that curry?

592
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,225
-Yes.
-It's curry.

593
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,195
1. MIX RED PEPPER POWDER, OREGANO POWDER,
CHICKEN STOCK, SHRIMP

594
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,098
SRIRACHA, AND MINCED GARLIC
INTO THE INGREDIENTS IN THE PAN

595
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,268
He's supposed to make Mexican food,

596
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,304
but wouldn't it become stew
if you add water into Poong's pan?

597
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,372
Wait, what?

598
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,073
He added curry powder,

599
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,142
-so with some water, it'll become curry.
-Right?

600
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,077
I added only a bit of curry.

601
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,948
Look at what he's doing now.

602
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,051
HE ADDS SMOKY FLAVOR TO THE CURRY(?)

603
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,920
You're nearing ten minutes now.

604
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,988
Sam's making tacos right now.

605
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,458
And to be exact,
Poong is making quesadilla.

606
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:04,296
Tacos are a fresh dish
made with sour cream, veggies, and meat.

607
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,098
Sometimes it can have fried fish fillet.

608
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,268
Quesadillas are a warm flatbread dish
that is folded with cheesy filling.

609
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,171
-I see.
-A cold dish versus a hot dish.

610
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,776
SAM SEPARATES EGG YOLKS

611
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,781
I think Chef Sam is making aioli.

612
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,951
-He's mixing olive oil with egg yolks.
-I see.

613
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,589
MAKING MAYO FROM SCRATCH WITH EGG YOLKS

614
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,059
-Wait, he's not making aioli.
-What's that?

615
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,329
He's using eggs, oil, and fresh cream.

616
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,464
Are you making a sauce?

617
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,567
Yes, instead of sour cream,
I wanted to make sour sauce

618
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,737
with a hint of egg and lemon.

619
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,006
-He's using that instead of sour cream.
-I see.

620
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,241
BLENDING SAUCE AND CORIANDER

621
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,411
-What's that? Cilantro?
-Yes, he's using cilantro.

622
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,880
He's blending the sauce with cilantro.

623
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,516
-I'm dying to try that sauce.
-Right?

624
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,052
That might be the decisive move.

625
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,656
He blended the sauce with cilantro,
and it changed colors.

626
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,996
4. MIX CHOPPED CORIANDER AND BLACK PEPPER
INTO THE DICED ONION AND TOMATO MIX

627
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,331
SALSA, DONE

628
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,201
2. MELT FRESH MOZZARELLA IN A POT

629
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,569
It's fresh mozzarella.

630
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,771
I usually cut up fresh mozzarella

631
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,140
and add it to salad.

632
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,109
But it seems fine to use it like that.

633
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,845
There's a lot of moisture.
It contains lots of water.

634
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,880
Is he trying to dry the cheese?

635
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,449
POONG FINISHES MAKING HIS SALSA TOO

636
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,386
3. MIX CHOPPED ONION, DICED TOMATO,
VINEGAR, LEMON JUICE, AND SUGAR

637
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,755
As we speak, he's using cilantro too.

638
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,861
THE GOOD VIBES(?) PERFORMANCE

639
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,867
JONG-WON'S BEST MOVE,
THE CHOPPING PERFORMANCE

640
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,902
He holds just the tip of the knife!

641
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:51,903
He's dancing on the board.

642
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,338
MOVED

643
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:59,477
HE STEALS JONG-WON'S BEST MOVE

644
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,682
HE ENDS UP DOING THE DANCE ON THE BOARD

645
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:04,683
With his entire body.

646
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,053
BUT THE LEAVES WEREN'T CHOPPED

647
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,221
ADDING SALT TO FINISH THE SALSA

648
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,524
Done, done, and done. Okay.

649
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,992
Butter.

650
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,393
Butter? Butter.

651
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,728
Butter.

652
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,297
POONG TOASTS THE TORTILLA IN BUTTER

653
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,000
SAM TOASTS IT STRAIGHT ON THE PAN

654
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,935
HE BEGINS TO MAKE CEVICHE

655
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,670
PREPPING SCALLOPS

656
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,571
Hey, scallops.

657
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,440
He's using scallops.

658
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,675
The friend I mentioned before
sent me those scallops.

659
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,714
5. CLEAN SCALLOPS,
LEAVE THE MEAT IN ICED WATER, THEN DRY

660
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,115
GLANCES

661
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,351
Chef Sam takes a peek at the clock.

662
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,789
6. SLICE DRIED SCALLOPS INTO THIN PIECES
AND SPRINKLE LEMON JUICE

663
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,691
CHILL IN THE FRIDGE

664
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,761
You have about five minutes.
Five minutes and six, five seconds.

665
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,330
-Sung-ju, please go out and report.
-Yes.

666
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,498
Let me get out there.

667
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,235
-I hope it smells like Mexico over there.
-I'm getting excited. It looks good.

668
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,604
-Will Sae-ho get a taste of Cancún?
-All right.

669
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,239
I'm now in the kitchen.

670
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,274
His salsa is finished.

671
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,176
-The salsa.
-Yes.

672
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,112
-Try the salsa.
-Let me try the salsa.

673
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,880
I hope it tastes like Mexico.

674
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,648
That looks good.

675
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:16,121
Does it taste like
Sam will relapse into Poongphobia?

676
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,290
-It's sour.
-Will it cause Poongphobia?

677
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,359
-It's a bit sweet.
-Is it?

678
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,361
-Is it too sweet?
-Yes, make it more tangy.

679
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,930
It's not so bad. It's just a bit sweet.

680
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,366
We're near the coast of Mexico.

681
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,535
-We're near the coast of Mexico.
-Okay.

682
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,436
It's not so bad. It's just a bit sweet.

683
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,105
CHEF SAM ABOUT TO GRILL
THE MARINATED MEAT

684
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,374
We're near the coast of Mexico.

685
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,811
SAM GETS BUSY AFTER HEARING
POONG'S POSITIVE REPORT

686
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,081
You're right. It's another kind of salsa.

687
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,250
-You should try it too.
-This is Sam's.

688
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,252
SPILL

689
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,355
It's the same sauce made by Sam.

690
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,857
It's the same sauce made by Sam.

691
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,325
Salsa versus salsa.

692
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,561
Salsa is a must for Mexican food.

693
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,899
Will his tacos give him a star?

694
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,334
Can you make it a little sweeter?

695
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,236
Mix the two.

696
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,337
PERFECT IF COMBINED

697
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,807
-Salsa shouldn't be…
-This is too sweet, and this is too sour.

698
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,409
-It can't be sweet. People will get mad.
-No?

699
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,044
Damn it. I…

700
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,646
I had sweet salsa in Hongdae!

701
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,485
-Mexican food in Hongdae tastes sweet.
-It was sweet in Hongdae!

702
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,053
He's been to Cancún.

703
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,855
Look at this meat.

704
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,723
-Gosh.
-That looks so good.

705
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,258
This meat looks so good.

706
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,560
I'm getting curious.

707
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,727
IT MAKES YOUR MOUTH WATER

708
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,932
TIME TO SAVE HIS OVERLY SWEET SALSA

709
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,102
He's using a new skill.

710
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,737
The stolen skill!

711
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,840
-What are you doing? The stolen skill?
-The stolen skill.

712
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,875
-Sam did this last time.
-It's getting burnt.

713
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,244
-The smokiness.
-He's adding smokiness.

714
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,747
-That's a good idea.
-He's broiling cabbage and peas.

715
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,883
The stolen skill!

716
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,485
-Sam did this last time.
-It's getting burnt.

717
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,487
He received a lot of points
for doing this.

718
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,190
-But in the end, he lost.
-Wait.

719
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,825
A SKILL WITH 0% WIN RATE

720
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,427
Wait a minute.

721
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,995
HE STOPS STEALING THE SKILL

722
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,565
INSTEAD OF USING THE SKILL,
HE GRABS THE MELTED CHEESE

723
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,434
TOPPING TORTILLA WITH CHEESE

724
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,205
SPREADING EVERYTHING WITHOUT A GAP

725
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,307
ADDING LOTS OF FILLING

726
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,376
Did Poong make stir-fried kimchi?

727
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,878
Stir-fried kimchi?

728
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,946
No, kimchi crêpe, <i>jeonbyeong</i>.

729
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,148
-This is the quesadilla filling.
-Quesadilla.

730
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,919
Sam's meat is sizzling.

731
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,188
Let me try just the marinade.

732
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,956
I'll try just the marinade.

733
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:36,060
Will Sam be freed of Poongphobia?

734
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,831
Will Sam be freed of Poongphobia?

735
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,734
He will be free.

736
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,602
GLARING

737
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,705
It's game over.

738
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,908
-You did it, Sam.
-He won't try that.

739
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,311
-He refused to try Poong's food.
-It's salty and tasty.

740
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,246
-Try this.
-What?

741
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,447
-Try what?
-This one.

742
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,516
-It's the quesadilla filling.
-Quesadilla.

743
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,652
Will Poong win a star?

744
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,288
Will Poong win a star?

745
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,189
WHAT'S THE STIR-FRIED KIMCHI(?) LIKE?

746
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,592
Hey, this is good! It's good!

747
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,360
-Hey, this is good!
-Is it?

748
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,728
-Oh, no!
-It's good!

749
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,230
This is bad news.

750
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:16,534
This is really good.
It'll taste good with rice too.

751
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,568
Okay, good.

752
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,905
-It's perfect. It's seasoned well.
-Okay.

753
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,175
Poong may have a good chance
if this is his main dish.

754
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,145
SAM GETS THE STRIPLOIN OUT

755
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,781
The meat looks so good.

756
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,817
My gosh. That looks delicious.

757
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,656
POONGPHOBIA, SAM HAD BEEN DOING WELL

758
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,428
-Hey, this is good! It's good!
-Oh, no.

759
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,862
POONGPHOBIA

760
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,931
This is really good.
It'll taste good with rice too.

761
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,467
POONGPHOBIA SYMPTOMS: HEAVY BREATHING

762
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,703
Something more…

763
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,505
HE SERVES THE SAUCE
AND THE STRIPLOIN FIRST

764
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,774
CHECKS ON THE TORTILLA

765
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,943
CUTS INTO QUARTERS

766
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,013
READY TO SERVE

767
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,750
-Okay. All right.
-This is good.

768
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,251
Right! I forgot. Damn it.

769
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,954
-Sour cream. Dang it.
-The sour cream?

770
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,622
-Right now?
-He's making sour cream.

771
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,825
-Poong finally makes sour cream.
-You have a minute.

772
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,159
He doesn't have much time.

773
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,929
He has no time.

774
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,865
-He can't do that.
-He doesn't have much time.

775
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,301
Wait, the process will speed up
if he adds acidity.

776
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,137
Poong makes sour cream
with 1 minute and 25 seconds left.

777
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,438
He's making sour cream.

778
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,008
-The bowl is spinning too.
-It's also spinning.

779
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,411
SPINNING AND SPINNING

780
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,681
Shouldn't the bowl stay still
when you whisk the cream?

781
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,750
He's making sour cream on the spot.

782
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,951
Will it harden?

783
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,753
He has a minute left.

784
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,722
Don't you think you're making this
with way too little time?

785
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,091
-I am.
-You should help him.

786
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,260
-Wait a minute.
-Sam, can he do that?

787
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,562
-Wait.
-Ask Sam if that's okay.

788
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,132
Tae-hun is whisking the cream for Poong.

789
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,666
-Uh-oh.
-Is it… Uh-oh.

790
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,902
-Hey, hey.
-He sounds so poised.

791
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,937
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, hey.

792
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,040
You have a minute left.
Poong gets a warning for now.

793
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,574
Wait a minute.

794
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,710
CHECKING THE QUESADILLA

795
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,446
GOLDEN BROWN

796
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,014
TAE-HUN WHISKS IN THAT WHILE

797
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,250
That's enough. Okay.

798
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,985
Hey, hey.

799
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,187
You have a minute left.
Poong gets a warning for now.

800
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,321
Fifty-five seconds.

801
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,258
SAM GRABS THE SCALLOPS

802
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,260
7. SEASON, TOP WITH CHILI AND CILANTRO

803
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,262
Thirty-five seconds.

804
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,797
Shouldn't you start serving?

805
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,366
-You don't have much time left.
-Extra virgin olive oil.

806
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,469
-Olive oil.
-Put it on top.

807
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,404
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE

808
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,806
You have 30 seconds left.

809
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,474
You need to start serving now.

810
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,743
Poong doesn't know what to do.

811
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,179
Poong, the sour cream.

812
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,347
He made it happen.

813
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,415
How's the sour cream?

814
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,151
It should've been separated
when he added acidity.

815
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,821
It's really weird.
He does it with his dark energy.

816
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,590
Thirty-five seconds.

817
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,992
Shouldn't you start serving?
Thirty seconds.

818
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,329
-You don't have much time. Wrap it up.
-Put it over there.

819
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,231
-Put it on top.
-Put it there.

820
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,534
-Fifteen seconds. Finish up, Sam.
-Put this there too.

821
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,903
You don't have much time. Wrap it up.

822
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,605
He's now serving. Fifteen seconds.

823
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,241
Fifteen seconds. Finish up, Sam.

824
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,610
The countdown begins! Nine.

825
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,146
COUNTDOWN BEGINS

826
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,415
HURRY HURRY

827
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,783
-Six.
-Six.

828
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,785
QUESADILLA IS OUT

829
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,987
RUSHING OUT THE REST
OF THE INGREDIENTS

830
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,022
-Oh, no.
-Three. Two.

831
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,191
-Three. Two.
-All done.

832
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,060
One. Ring the bell!

833
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,728
-I'm done!
-Poong finishes first.

834
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,897
Poong finishes first. Yes.

835
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,600
SAM KIM ALSO FINISHES UP

836
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,202
Sam finishes up too.

837
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,371
SAM'S WANT A STAR
WITH THIS TACO COMPLETE

838
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,106
Please don't leave anything out.

839
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,374
Be careful.

840
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,443
A TABLE FULL OF HEARTY MEXICAN DISHES

841
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,111
THE SAM-POONG DERBY ENDS

842
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,913
-Good job.
-These look good.

843
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,549
-Gosh.
-These look insane.

844
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:55,553
Both Mexican dishes were finished
just for Sae-ho.

845
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,155
This is wonderful.

846
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,824
-It seriously smells so good.
-Are you happy with these?

847
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,160
-It smells so good.
-Does it?

848
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:06,597
First of all, their dishes exceeded
my greatest expectations.

849
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,666
I look forward to trying these.

850
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,636
Poong even finished first,

851
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:15,506
so please try his dish first,
named Que-Star-Dilla.

852
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,707
QUESADILLA IN MEXICAN STYLE

853
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,843
SERVED WITH 3 DIFFERENT SAUCES

854
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,212
SOUR CREAM, SRIRACHA, SALSA

855
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,983
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S QUE-STAR-DILLA

856
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,419
It already looks different
from eight years ago, right?

857
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,321
He's improved a lot since then.

858
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,857
-The improvement is fascinating.
-Right?

859
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,325
-Thank you.
-Have a seat.

860
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,795
-Que-Star-Dilla.
-Just one thing before you try it.

861
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,830
Put some salsa

862
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,800
-in the quesadilla. It'll be even better.
-Okay.

863
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,869
Okay. Before I try this,
may I try the salsa first?

864
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:45,770
Of course.

865
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,538
-Before I put this in here.
-Okay.

866
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,642
-You can go back to your spot, Poong.
-Shall I?

867
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,577
So?

868
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,080
-Please be honest.
-Yes. Honestly,

869
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,150
it has a bit of sweetness,

870
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,387
but it feels like
the delicious sweetness from the onion.

871
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,989
-I like it.
-I see.

872
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,358
He poured a lot of sugar in there.

873
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,894
-He's never been to Mexico.
-It was just the marinade.

874
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,696
-I discarded everything.
-Did you?

875
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,099
-I'll put some in there.
-Quesadilla.

876
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,635
-Do I put a lot in here?
-Yes.

877
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:22,473
From here, it looks like something
a Mexican person would've made.

878
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,310
-Rodriguez?
-This seems like such a hearty meal.

879
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,412
It's the shape of a beach in Cancún!

880
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,748
-Cancún!
-The taste of the beach.

881
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:34,018
It's as if I'm on a white sandy beach.

882
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,287
-Waves of sour cream.
-And some sour cream?

883
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,989
-You can spread it a little on top
-The waves.

884
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,724
or even dip it as you like.

885
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,360
CAN YOU HEAR THE WAVES OF CANCÚN?

886
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,328
MOVED

887
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,666
-These are waves of Cancún.
-The waves.

888
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,768
-Once again, what now? Cancún!
-Cancún!

889
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,972
-Cancún! There are so many flavors.
-I see.

890
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,309
-But what's important is how it tastes.
-Yes.

891
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,780
He cuts it up nicely. The taste of Mexico
unfolds before his eyes.

892
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,883
He grabs a piece with his hands,
and lots of fillings fall out.

893
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,418
A BIG BITE

894
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,054
-We eat like that by the beach, right?
-Sure.

895
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,589
HE MAKES IT LOOK SO GOOD

896
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,891
-I want some too.
-It looks good.

897
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,727
It's been a while
since he's eaten something like this.

898
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,231
-He reminds me of Sung-hoon.
-Yes, he's like a beast.

899
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,667
-He's practically growling.
-Sure, he is.

900
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,002
-So are you in Cancún?
-Are you?

901
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,438
-Oh, Cancún.
-Oh, Cancún.

902
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,807
Oh, Cancún.

903
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,042
NOM

904
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,244
He eats like a lion.

905
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,979
He's in a good mood now.

906
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,548
-But…
-But?

907
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,485
-I'm in Cancún, but…
-But?

908
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:46,324
I'm not exactly in Mexico.

909
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,660
-You got off the plane but?
-I did.

910
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,030
Yes, I'm on the beach.
I thought it was Cancún,

911
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:56,834
but I think it might be
a beach in America.

912
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,237
It also feels like this.
I want to enjoy all of Cancún,

913
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,640
but a close friend of mine
who came with me

914
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,542
began to crave Korean food.

915
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,044
-In LA?
-So he wants to eat Korean food.

916
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,080
Did you get off the plane
to be on Jumunjin Beach?

917
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,916
-The hot sauce, yes.
-He's on the eastern coast of Korea.

918
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,150
What's that?

919
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,220
-What's that sauce? Sriracha?
-It's sriracha.

920
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,090
He got off the plane
thinking he was in Cancún.

921
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,693
He takes another bite.
"Am I in the wrong place?"

922
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,729
"Which beach am I on?"

923
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,965
"Is this Cancún, America, or Korea?"

924
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,467
Where are you exactly?

925
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,736
The filling reminds me

926
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,872
of a festival in Mexico.

927
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,809
It's full of different flavors
from pork, shrimp, and more.

928
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,644
-I see.
-What I love the most is

929
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:45,583
how it fills up my mouth
with all kinds of flavors.

930
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,551
It feels very filling.

931
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,553
DREAD-METER RISING

932
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,456
It's good.
The sour cream was made in a short while,

933
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:58,462
but the sourness was
perfect and delicious. It's good.

934
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,166
Next, please try
Sam's Want a Star With This Taco.

935
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,802
DIFFERENT SAUCES TO GO WITH TACOS

936
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,640
SEASONED STRIPLOIN AND SCALLOP CEVICHE,
FULL OF MEXICAN FLAVORS

937
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,145
CHEF SAM KIM'S WANT A STAR WITH THIS TACO

938
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,446
How shall I approach this?

939
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:20,217
-First, try the ceviche with lemon juice.
-Ceviche.

940
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,854
Try it with a bit of the green sauce.

941
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,823
-This one?
-Yes, just a little.

942
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,824
LICK

943
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,526
-Gosh.
-He tried a bit of the sauce.

944
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,028
-It's good.
-Is it?

945
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,964
-This sauce. Just a little?
-Just a little.

946
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,101
-And just like that? Just like that.
-Yes, that's it.

947
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,869
It's like an appetizer.

948
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,439
What happened?

949
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,909
It must be delicious.

950
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,011
-It's good.
-Is it?

951
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,181
-It's this sauce.
-Yes?

952
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,917
-What is this sauce?
-It must be the sauce.

953
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,754
-You mixed cilantro and eggs.
-Cilantro and egg yolks.

954
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,557
-He put a lot of work into it.
-He did.

955
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:04,261
When you eat scallops raw,
it's sometimes a bit too fishy.

956
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,264
But the sauce covers up
all of the smell. I love it.

957
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:11,502
It feels like
I'm swimming pleasantly in the sea.

958
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,304
It tastes so fresh.

959
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,773
I love it. I think I can use
more of the sauce, Chef Sam.

960
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,241
LOVING THE CILANTRO SAUCE

961
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,512
He's off to a great start.

962
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,380
Off to a great start.

963
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,716
Try just the salsa for that dish too.

964
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,952
Time to compare the salsa.

965
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,753
Which one do you like better?

966
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,654
NERVOUS

967
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:31,755
I see.

968
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,123
Yes?

969
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,294
At this point in time,
Poong's salsa humors my palate more.

970
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,630
-I see.
-Oh, no!

971
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,099
-No!
-I knew you two would have a connection.

972
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,236
They're both delicious,
but this one tastes a bit more sour.

973
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,304
-Right.
-I doubt it's meant to be eaten like this.

974
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,640
-He must have a reason for this.
-Yes.

975
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,308
-Should I put everything in?
-Yes.

976
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,943
Grab a piece of tortilla

977
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,712
and top it with romaine.

978
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,814
Romaine. Okay.

979
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,116
-I love romaine.
-Those tacos look so good.

980
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,184
Please mix it up.

981
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,153
-May I try a piece of meat first?
-Yes, of course.

982
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,489
Just the meat.
Check and see if it's seasoned well.

983
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,024
Is it seasoned adequately?

984
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,292
NOM

985
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,627
You used striploin, right?

986
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,295
CURIOUS

987
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,330
I'm in Cancún!

988
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,265
CAN! CÚN!

989
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,334
HE ARRIVED ON THE CANCÚN BEACH

990
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,736
RELIEVED

991
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,605
-Isn't it good? It was good.
-Whoa.

992
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,173
-Whoa.
-Cancún!

993
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,409
The seasoning is fantastic.

994
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,645
Try it with the tortilla.

995
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,547
Top it with some meat

996
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,283
-and some salsa too.
-Salsa. Okay.

997
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,119
I'm sure he has a reason
for making the salsa sour.

998
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:40,591
Lastly, top it with the cream sauce
and some cilantro as well.

999
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,127
-The cilantro in the meat? What's this?
-Yes.

1000
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,563
-Is this more of the meat marinade?
-Yes.

1001
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,898
You can spread some more on top.

1002
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,635
Doesn't he look like a businessman
who works in Mexico?

1003
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,804
-It's so good.
-This is nice. All right. Here we go.

1004
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,607
He's eating it in one bite.

1005
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,908
He has a huge mouth.

1006
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,810
It fills up his mouth.

1007
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,213
So, are you in Mexico?

1008
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,349
-Where is he now?
-He eats so deliciously.

1009
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,850
He makes it look so good.

1010
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,586
-So?
-So?

1011
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,087
Gosh.

1012
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,856
-Will you sing "La Cucaracha"?
-Will you?

1013
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,726
La cucaracha!

1014
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,963
-That's not it.
-That's not the song.

1015
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,531
I know it should be sung,

1016
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,934
but for now,
it felt more like, "La cucaracha!"

1017
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,402
A big tasty bite-cha!

1018
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,804
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

1019
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,973
-Now, so?
-Well.

1020
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,210
I traveled in a frenzy
and arrived somewhere I don't know.

1021
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,513
I got something to eat
as soon as I got off, so I had it,

1022
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,849
and it turned out to be Cancún.

1023
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,352
This time, you didn't know where it was.

1024
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,420
Poong's dish had

1025
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,755
a familiar flavor,

1026
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,359
as if I were getting
the Mexico experience somewhere else.

1027
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,227
The Mexico experience?

1028
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,128
But this dish

1029
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,398
makes me feel like I'm in another country.

1030
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,435
It tastes like a dish from a country
I've never been to.

1031
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,703
This is good.

1032
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,405
-So good.
-Try some more.

1033
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,074
I can make it look delicious too.

1034
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,478
I can see why his salsa had to have

1035
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:11,048
-a bit more sourness to it.
-I see.

1036
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,184
The balance must be great.

1037
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,554
-And he's our only guest today.
-Our only guest.

1038
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,089
Only guest!

1039
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,860
-Our only guest in Cancún!
-Only guest!

1040
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,996
I've come to a decision in my heart.

1041
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,698
Decided!

1042
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:32,403
-I decided on someone.
-You made your decision?

1043
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,937
He made his decision.

1044
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,473
-It's because…
-If you think about it,

1045
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,809
their names both have two syllables.
Sam Kim!

1046
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,244
-Kim Poong!
-Poong!

1047
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,447
Cancún!

1048
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,984
Please try
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong's Que-Star-Dilla.

1049
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,119
What?

1050
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,623
The two chefs are trying Poong's dish.

1051
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,691
WHAT DO OTHER CHEFS THINK?

1052
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:57,061
-This is…
-It's good.

1053
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,196
I thought
it wouldn't taste like Mexican food.

1054
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,598
Chef Jong-won also thought
it'd taste more like pizza.

1055
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,934
-But it was Mexican food.
-It was.

1056
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,336
-Quesadilla.
-Also, if he topped the tortilla

1057
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,239
with fresh mozzarella out of the bag,
it would've been soggy.

1058
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,407
He made a smart move.

1059
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:14,978
He boiled it in another pan, removed
the water, and only used the solids.

1060
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,681
Next dish,
Sam Kim's Want a Star With This Taco.

1061
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,886
Chef Nam-no takes

1062
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,155
a bite of Chef Sam's dish.

1063
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,290
Whoa.

1064
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,826
-It's good.
-What do you think?

1065
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,127
What do you think, Edward?

1066
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,895
Four phrases. Cancún.

1067
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,197
Beach.

1068
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,264
Restaurant.

1069
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,265
The local cook.

1070
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,568
THE TASTE OF A LOCAL COOK

1071
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,003
The taste of a local cook
on the beach in Cancún.

1072
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,038
-The local taste.
-Yes.

1073
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,408
-It is. It's authentic.
-Is it?

1074
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,177
Poong considered the Korean palate
when he cooked,

1075
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,748
but Sam focused on the authentic flavor.

1076
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,883
-This isn't easy.
-I'm sure.

1077
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,285
-This is the toughest moment.
-It is.

1078
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,287
You'll have to choose one of the two.

1079
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,257
Press one for Sam Kim,

1080
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,760
and press two for Kim Poong.

1081
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:03,994
Did you press it?

1082
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,529
Decided.

1083
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,164
-I've decided.
-He's decided.

1084
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,000
He made his decision.

1085
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:14,004
Let's find out who the winner is.
Please show us!

1086
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,874
Are we in Mexico?

1087
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,710
Will Sam be freed of Poongphobia

1088
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,112
and overcome his opponent today?

1089
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:27,584
Or will Poong win against him
and take another step forward?

1090
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,355
Which Mexican dish did Sae-ho like better?

1091
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,692
Which dish did he choose?

1092
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,261
It was Sam Kim!

1093
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,896
CHEF SAM KIM'S
WANT A STAR WITH THIS TACO WINS

1094
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,465
It was Sam Kim!

1095
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,033
Great work.

1096
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,868
-Cancún!
-Sam Kim!

1097
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,537
-Cancún!
-Sam Kim!

1098
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,739
SHOUT-OUT FOR MASTER SAM KIM!

1099
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,676
As soon as I tried Chef Sam's meat,

1100
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:56,013
I could literally feel the scorching sun.

1101
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,782
It left a big impression in my mouth.

1102
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,651
The two had similar flavors,

1103
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,821
but I think that meat meant the dish
was more on the mark.

1104
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,991
Sam finally broke
his losing streak record of four.

1105
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,160
He finally breaks the streak.

1106
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,695
It had been tough for him.

1107
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:16,233
I have two bottles of champagne,
and he just broke the losing streak,

1108
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,902
-so I decided to open one.
-Have you decided?

1109
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,504
-Yes, I'll open one for sure.
-You will?

1110
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,440
The fridge owner just made a pledge
to open a bottle of champagne

1111
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:28,912
to celebrate
Sam's escape from the losing streak.

1112
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,115
-Cancún!
-Sam Kim!

1113
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,151
Please put the star on him.

1114
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,853
One champagne, confirmed.

1115
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,221
Congratulations.

1116
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,224
-He breaks his losing streak.
-Congratulations.

1117
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,592
Congratulations!

1118
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,827
Congratulations.

1119
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:48,265
<i>This is the second round of the cook-off</i>
<i>with Sae-ho's ingredients.</i>

1120
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,902
This round is between
the two cheeky Chinese chefs,

1121
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,773
Lim Tae-hun versus Park Eun-yeong.

1122
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,342
It's their first fight.

1123
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:03,113
On this show, Chef Ji-sun has become
the best in the world of Chinese cuisine.

1124
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,748
<i>-She brings discipline.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1125
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,050
-She's not here at the moment.
-No.

1126
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,319
As they say,
"When the cat's away, the mice will play."

1127
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,390
Chef Tae-hun announced
he'll take over and discipline Eun-yeong.

1128
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,759
-What?
-He apparently said that. Is this true?

1129
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,160
I don't have a star yet,

1130
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,595
but take a look right here.

1131
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,231
-I have this.
-The Chinese kitchen knife.

1132
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:25,168
Chef Ji-sun gave this knife to me
as a present.

1133
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,803
-That knife?
-Yes.

1134
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,707
She gave me this and told me
to restore order with Chef Eun-yeong.

1135
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,610
-He received a mission.
-He's on a mission.

1136
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,713
So are you here today
to discipline Chef Eun-yeong?

1137
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,751
-I should establish order, shouldn't I?
-Is that why you're here?

1138
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,719
I have a question.
Who has more experience?

1139
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,421
-How many years?
-This is my 13th year.

1140
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,323
-I've done it for much longer.
-Yes.

1141
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,959
-At least he has more experience.
-Yes, he does.

1142
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,296
But Chef Eun-yeong already has four stars,
so she isn't someone to be disciplined.

1143
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,564
It's about time
you won a star too, Chef Tae-hun.

1144
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,567
-That's happening today.
-It's today. I see.

1145
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,070
People are going crazy
in the comment section,

1146
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:04,574
saying Chef Tae-hun looks like
that actor, Wi Ha-jun.

1147
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,177
-People are going crazy.
-I see.

1148
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,712
-I can see it.
-Right?

1149
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,380
I get what people mean.

1150
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,316
It's not too big a stretch, is it?

1151
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,052
I'd like to save my comment now.

1152
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,221
Ha-jun has his fans too,
so that's all from me.

1153
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,658
I pulled out a few of the top comments.

1154
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,360
"He's not exactly Wi Ha-jun,

1155
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,396
so let's call him Wee Ha-jun."

1156
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,933
"He's not Wi Ha-jun,
so let's call him Whee Ha-jun.'

1157
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,868
"No, not Whee Ha-jun, but Woo-Hoo Ha-jun."

1158
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,440
Have you heard this before, Eun-yeong?

1159
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,942
Yes, I've heard it, and some even say

1160
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,545
he's the wrinkly version of Ha-jun.

1161
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,981
Wrinkly Ha-jun?

1162
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,050
-Come on. That's harsh.
-That's what I heard.

1163
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,653
-The war of nerves is strong.
-That was harsh.

1164
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,989
CHEF TAE-HUN'S INGREDIENTS:

1165
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,658
PEPERONCINO, SHRIMPS, BUTTON MUSHROOMS,
SNOW CRAB, CARROTS

1166
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,661
My dish is called…

1167
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,763
Who Ordered Snow Crab?

1168
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,933
Who Ordered Snow Crab?

1169
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,035
-Who Ordered Snow Crab?
-Who Ordered Snow Crab?

1170
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,204
I'm going to make a dish

1171
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,974
that looks like a sandwich
by using shiitake,

1172
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,845
stuffed with minced shrimp or crab meat
and deep-fried.

1173
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,282
It would've been great
if Sae-ho had shiitake,

1174
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,119
but all I saw were button mushrooms.

1175
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:26,923
I'll use those instead,
as well as crab and shrimp meat

1176
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,859
and serve that dish.

1177
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,894
-I see.
-It's probably smaller in size.

1178
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,529
-Bite-sized.
-That's right.

1179
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,765
It also comes with sweet and spicy sauce,

1180
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:37,567
so I'll make use of that recipe as well.

1181
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,836
-That sounds good.
-Sweet and spicy sauce.

1182
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,841
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS: LEMON JUICE,
BREAD, FRESH CREAM, SNOW CRAB, CILANTRO

1183
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,977
I'm going to make a dish called

1184
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,178
Freeze, Crab!

1185
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,881
-Freeze, Crab?
-Freeze, Crab.

1186
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,816
Freeze, Crab. Will you freeze the crab?

1187
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,019
Sae-ho said he liked egg white with crab,

1188
00:50:56,086 --> 00:51:00,524
so I'm going to improve on it
and reinterpret it in my style.

1189
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,928
I'll also serve it
with some cilantro salad.

1190
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,065
I also named it Freeze, Crab

1191
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,368
because I believe Chef Tae-hun
doesn't have a star yet.

1192
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,404
So I wanted him to stay there frozen.

1193
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,076
-That was unexpected. It had a meaning.
-Freeze.

1194
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,578
Just stay there, frozen.

1195
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,681
Freeze right there with zero stars.

1196
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,883
-How frightening.
-She's tough.

1197
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:31,321
I'm going to make a very delicious dish,
so don't worry about me.

1198
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,622
-I see.
-That's great.

1199
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:37,127
And now, let us begin
the snow crab round for Sae-ho.

1200
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,062
Tae-hun says,

1201
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,598
"I'm older
and I have more experience than you."

1202
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,335
The Wi Ha-jun of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
Chef Lim Tae-hun is up.

1203
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,838
He looks much more like him
when the lights went down.

1204
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,307
But she doesn't think
there's hierarchy in cooking.

1205
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:54,678
The toughest young Chinese chef,
Chef Park Eun-yeong is also up.

1206
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:58,415
Who's going to be the winner
between the two cheeky Chinese chefs?

1207
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,184
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1208
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,788
FACE-OFF

1209
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,725
Chef Eun-yeong begins with the snow crab.

1210
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,193
CRACK!

1211
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,597
That's a good-looking snow crab.

1212
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,465
It looks hearty and delicious.

1213
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:20,370
-She'll need to get just the meat.
-She'll do that to make it easier to eat.

1214
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,239
It takes a lot of work to prepare crabs.

1215
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,208
Tae-hun also cuts off the legs.

1216
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,144
Both of them.

1217
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,280
Tae-hun moves a little faster.

1218
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,816
He's moving a little faster.

1219
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:33,783
Goodness.

1220
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,385
A NEW PAIR OF SCISSORS

1221
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,121
SHE GRABS REGULAR SCISSORS

1222
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,190
They'll lose all their time
trying to prepare those.

1223
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,125
They're cutting off all its legs.

1224
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,695
She's trying to make small cuts
to pull the meat out.

1225
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,298
That way, it's easier to remove

1226
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,901
the white sinew behind.

1227
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,637
-That was easy.
-She only needs the meat.

1228
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,572
She pulls it out like that.

1229
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,575
She's using just the meat.
Those things are full of meat.

1230
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,677
-It's stuffed.
-It was cooked deliciously.

1231
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,546
I think he's using the crab mustard too.

1232
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,915
It takes a lot of work to prepare crabs.

1233
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,184
Yes, it's tough to prepare them.

1234
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,020
Did I order a dish
that takes too much work?

1235
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,521
IS IT MY FAULT?

1236
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,724
Their time will end
after preparing the crabs.

1237
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,359
It'll end after they finish preparing.

1238
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,228
I want to give them a hand.

1239
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,796
It'll end when they finish preparing.

1240
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,097
He's using the mustard.

1241
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,300
They spent three minutes
preparing the crabs.

1242
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,969
You're right.
It's been 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1243
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,605
-The crab mustard.
-They're both using the mustard.

1244
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,208
-They're both using mustard.
-She doesn't throw away the mustard.

1245
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:32,676
Do you like it?

1246
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,411
I eat all kinds of innards.

1247
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,446
He eats all kinds of innards.

1248
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,515
I even love fish innards.

1249
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,251
I even like that musty smell.

1250
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,919
I see. You shouldn't throw that out.

1251
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,154
You should use the mustard.

1252
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,056
MUSTARD, SECURED

1253
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,659
I wonder which one of the two
can cook faster.

1254
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,495
They lost quite a lot of time
while doing this.

1255
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,498
EUN-YEONG FINISHES PREPARING!

1256
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,436
THEY BEGIN TO COOK!

1257
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,770
ONION

1258
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,074
Tae-hun makes green onion oil first.

1259
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,742
-He's making chili oil.
-Chili oil.

1260
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,912
-It must be for the sweet and spicy sauce.
-Chili oil.

1261
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,413
SHRIMP

1262
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,148
He's slamming on shrimps.

1263
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,851
HE MINCES THE SHRIMP MEAT IN NO TIME

1264
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,687
He's mixing shrimp and crab meat.

1265
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:22,259
These crabs belong to the fridge owner,
so they make use of everything

1266
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,961
without leaving a piece of meat behind.

1267
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:26,896
EUN-YEONG BEGINS TO COOK TOO

1268
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:31,301
Eun-yeong is using just the egg whites.

1269
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,435
What's she going to do?

1270
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,838
-Fresh cream?
-She's trying to make meringue.

1271
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,006
Are you?

1272
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,276
-I'm making a Chinese omelet.
-Chinese omelet.

1273
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,545
-It's the white foamy egg, right?
-You're right.

1274
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,880
-You like that, right?
-I do.

1275
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,782
-Like clouds.
-Yes, I love that dish.

1276
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,050
Gosh.

1277
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,052
MIXING WELL

1278
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,087
AND INTO THE OIL!

1279
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,723
1. MAKE FLUFFY EGG OMELET
BY FRYING EGG WHITES AND FRESH CREAM

1280
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,893
-That thing is delicious.
-It turned out well.

1281
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,795
They look like lilies,
like pretty flowers.

1282
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,096
Yes, this is the Chinese omelet.

1283
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,965
It looks pretty.

1284
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,301
It'll be much softer with cream
compared to just eggs.

1285
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,337
If you use just the eggs,
it'll feel a bit tough.

1286
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,707
-I'm in awe to see it become that shape.
-Yes, that takes skills.

1287
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,610
-This is technical.
-She's amazing.

1288
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,146
Eun-yeong, is that how it's done?

1289
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,882
It's a different method
I learned from Chef Lu Chinglai.

1290
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,851
She learned this technique
from Chef Lu Chinglai.

1291
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:25,922
Let's see what Chef Tae-hun learned
from Chef Chinglai.

1292
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,158
He said he learned to cook with his book.

1293
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,192
You're right.

1294
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,093
He's the book division.

1295
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,394
ANNOYED

1296
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,164
Isn't he one of his students if he
taught himself with Chef Chinglai's book?

1297
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,533
Yes, it's important to learn from a book.

1298
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,335
He sounds a little sad.

1299
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,837
He looks a little sulky.

1300
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,405
You can't say it like that.

1301
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,107
CHUCKLE

1302
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,210
-He worked hard to teach himself.
-Yes, he taught himself.

1303
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,447
-He got the button mushrooms.
-The button mushrooms.

1304
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,115
I feel bad for shiitake,

1305
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,451
but I love button mushrooms
much more than those.

1306
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,852
-What a relief.
-Yes.

1307
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,287
-So…
-Then he should use those.

1308
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,089
He'll top button mushrooms

1309
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,091
with minced crab and shrimp,
and then deep-fry it.

1310
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,361
Yes, I'm making
this crab taste crabby-good.

1311
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,463
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

1312
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,164
-It sounds good.
-Yes.

1313
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:12,235
-It'll come with sweet and spicy sauce.
-That sounds amazing.

1314
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,072
GREEN ONION

1315
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,875
Time is flying.

1316
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,543
She's stir-frying crab meat.

1317
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,912
-That looks good too.
-This looks great.

1318
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:24,814
SHE SPOTS THE WHITE SINEW

1319
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,183
She should pull out the white part.

1320
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,152
Pull out the sinew.
Don't leave anything in.

1321
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,621
-Sae-ho won't feel too pleased
-I keep finding more.

1322
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,323
if he spots one as he eats that.

1323
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,891
-It'll be si-new kind of horrible.
-Yes.

1324
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,793
IT TOOK SOME TIME

1325
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,194
TRIED NOT TO LAUGH, FAILED

1326
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,731
I learned another thing today.
I love Jung-hwan's sense of humor.

1327
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,200
-It's hilarious after a second.
-It wasn't so bad.

1328
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,870
I believe it's a comedy
with a great foundation. I love it.

1329
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,772
He said
she shouldn't leave sinew in and said,

1330
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,540
"It'll be si-new kind of horrible."

1331
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,075
It's a si-new kind of inconvenience.

1332
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,310
FRESH CREAM

1333
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,713
-Whoa. Cream.
-She's using cream.

1334
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,814
3. ADD CREAM, SALT, STARCH WATER TO CRAB

1335
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,216
-Is that starch?
-It is.

1336
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:01,951
STARCH WATER

1337
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,653
There's high tension in the studio.

1338
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,457
They attacked each other
before they started cooking,

1339
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,125
but they're both silent now.

1340
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,728
-Chef Tae-hun, what are you making?
-Batter.

1341
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,531
Batter? For what?

1342
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,132
He's making the fry batter.

1343
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,301
The fry batter.

1344
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,303
Tae-hun begins to deep-fry the mushroom.

1345
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,606
They're getting deep-fried deliciously.

1346
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,876
They differ greatly
according to their characters.

1347
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:31,181
Chef Tae-hun's dish
comes with an intense type of texture,

1348
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,984
-but Chef Eun-yeong's dish is very soft.
-It looks soft.

1349
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,487
It'll be easier for you to chow down.

1350
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,522
This is going to be hard.

1351
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,524
That looks so soft.

1352
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,260
-Chef Eun-yeong's dish looks so soft.
-It does.

1353
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,896
They're both using crabs,
but in two different styles.

1354
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,232
Yes, I love it.

1355
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,469
She's putting the cooked crab meat
back into its shell.

1356
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,038
1ST FLOOR, CRAB MUSTARD,
2ND FLOOR, EGG WHITE AND CRAB MEAT

1357
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,574
-Are you serving it already, Eun-yeong?
-Yes.

1358
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,242
-Already?
-Gosh, that looks so good.

1359
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,643
-What happened?
-Eun-yeong moves fast.

1360
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,912
It almost looks like gratin.

1361
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,416
She tops crab mustard
with egg white and crab meat.

1362
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,517
Egg white and crab.

1363
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,419
It looks like gratin.

1364
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,322
You have six minutes left.
Under six minutes.

1365
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,924
A LADLE FULL OF VINEGAR

1366
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,962
He's using a ladle
as big as that tiny little pot

1367
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:20,864
to measure his stuff.

1368
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,732
Chinese food measures everything

1369
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,367
with this ladle.

1370
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,769
Yes, that's true.
Everything goes in there.

1371
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,972
Only Chinese food uses the ladle recipe.

1372
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,842
I guess Chinese cuisine really uses
that ladle to measure everything.

1373
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,945
They use it for everything,
so they already know.

1374
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,048
THE INGREDIENTS
FOR THE SWEET AND SPICY SAUCE

1375
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,050
ONION

1376
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,353
He's definitely very fast.

1377
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,021
It smells so good.

1378
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:49,225
6. CHOP ONION, CARROT, GARLIC,
AND GREEN ONION FINELY

1379
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,760
IS EUN-YEONG USING BREAD?

1380
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,061
Bread.

1381
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,330
Is she making a toast?

1382
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,698
REMOVING THE EDGES

1383
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:56,966
Breadcrumbs.

1384
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,968
Is she going to top it with breadcrumbs?

1385
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,869
Will you grind that?

1386
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,805
-She must be making breadcrumbs.
-Breadcrumbs.

1387
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,741
-Without water…
-Five minutes.

1388
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,809
Five minutes, Jung-hwan!

1389
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,545
Please report from the kitchen.

1390
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,381
Will they make Sae-ho open the champagne?

1391
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,049
I hope it got ground up. Did it?

1392
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,083
Yes, it did.

1393
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,121
Will you top this crab meat
with breadcrumbs and fry it again?

1394
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,122
I'll do that.

1395
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,524
-Whoa.
-She's going to deep-fry it again.

1396
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,327
Chef Edward just gave her a nod.

1397
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,264
My eyes just met with Chef Edward's eyes,

1398
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,768
and we were wondering
if she'd deep-fry those. Gosh.

1399
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,072
Chef Chinglai's egg white with crab
has a very soft texture.

1400
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:39,576
Her recipe improved on that one.

1401
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,045
She puts egg yolks on the crab.

1402
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,413
Gosh, I'm losing time.

1403
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:47,584
Jung-hwan, if you can find
any leftover egg white and crab, try that.

1404
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,118
-May I try this?
-You may.

1405
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,453
-This one.
-Yes.

1406
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,056
-Egg whites and crab.
-That looks so good.

1407
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,491
-That looks really good.
-It does.

1408
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,927
It'll be crunchy outside and soft inside.

1409
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:01,197
-It feels soft as I scoop it up.
-I see.

1410
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,465
It already feels soft.

1411
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,334
It must be so good
if it's a familiar taste.

1412
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,169
It smells mild too.

1413
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,072
What's the egg white and crab like?

1414
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,609
Is it really good? Or is it not?

1415
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:16,079
Is it still hot? It must be hot.

1416
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,480
It's really good!

1417
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,849
-It's really good!
-It's really good?

1418
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,019
-It's a flavor you'll love, Sae-ho.
-It is?

1419
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,222
-Is it soft?
-It's so soft.

1420
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,858
She's doing that with the breadcrumbs?

1421
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,560
-She's frying it again.
-Pouring oil on top.

1422
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,130
-She's frying the crab.
-Showering it with oil.

1423
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:37,533
-It'll make the top crunchy.
-Exactly.

1424
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,436
8. DEEP-FRY THE CRAB SHELL IN OIL

1425
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,574
TAE-HUN CHECKS HIS MUSHROOM FRIES TOO!

1426
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,777
ADDING COLD AIR TO MAKE IT CRISPIER

1427
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:50,246
-Are these doing okay?
-They're doing fine.

1428
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,781
Are you done with the chili oil?

1429
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:53,082
-Chef Tae-hun?
-I am.

1430
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,452
Is Chef Tae-hun finished
with the sweet and spicy sauce?

1431
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,888
-Is this the sweet and spicy sauce?
-The sauce.

1432
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:01,391
-These fried mushrooms look good.
-I see.

1433
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:04,460
-What about the sweet and spicy sauce?
-The chili oil…

1434
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,396
He doesn't have
the sweet and spicy sauce yet.

1435
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,131
-Is this it?
-Can you try it?

1436
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,166
Okay, I… That scorching hot thing?

1437
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,203
Well, you went out there
to give it a taste.

1438
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,538
"That scorching hot thing?"

1439
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,840
-You have 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
-I'll try it, I guess.

1440
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,810
Tae-hun's sweet and spicy sauce.

1441
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,745
It obviously looks like it'll burn.

1442
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,081
The sweet and spicy sauce.

1443
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,483
He'll try just the sweet and spicy sauce.

1444
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,420
Tae-hun's sweet and spicy sauce.

1445
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:33,222
Does it turn him into Wi Ha-jun
or just Wee Ha-jun?

1446
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,324
WI? WEE?

1447
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,696
Does it turn him into Wi Ha-jun
or just Wee Ha-jun?

1448
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,998
I hope it's sweet and spicy.

1449
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:45,134
At this point in time,
he's somewhere in-between.

1450
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,971
It needs the spiciness,
but I couldn't taste that.

1451
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,208
It only tastes sweet and sour.

1452
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,877
-I see. What a shame.
-It should taste spicy.

1453
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:59,015
A SHOWY PERFORMANCE ON THE WOK!

1454
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,017
He's dying to win today!

1455
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,418
Toss the pan around!

1456
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,353
You have 1 minute and 40 seconds.

1457
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,123
He hadn't added the chili oil.

1458
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,524
He didn't add the chili oil.

1459
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:10,727
-He didn't add the chili oil.
-No.

1460
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,930
We're seeing him toss his wok
for the first time in a while.

1461
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,667
You have 1 minute and 40 seconds.

1462
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,968
THE EGG WHITE AND CRAB SHELL
HAS BEEN DEEP-FRIED!

1463
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,236
This fried crab looks so good.

1464
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,038
MAKING DRESSING WITH LEMON JUICE

1465
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,573
LEMON JUICE

1466
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:29,178
9. MIX LEMON JUICE, OLIVE OIL, SOY SAUCE,
SUGAR, AND MINCED GARLIC TO MAKE DRESSING

1467
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,647
-One minute!
-You have one minute left.

1468
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,283
-One minute.
-Sesame oil.

1469
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:38,254
10. CHOP A HANDFUL OF CILANTRO
AND MIX WITH THE LEMON DRESSING

1470
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,990
CILANTRO SALAD, FINISHED

1471
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,458
He's adding the chili oil.

1472
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,127
-He finally added the oil.
-Yes.

1473
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,329
We're about to see him toss the wok again.

1474
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:50,099
-He's mixing the two!
-There they are!

1475
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,434
ON FIRE

1476
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:56,239
CHINESE FOOD IS
ALL ABOUT THAT SMOKY FLAVOR!

1477
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,807
-All right!
-That's it!

1478
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,542
TOTALLY PLEASED

1479
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,244
Wi Ha-jun!

1480
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,847
Tae-hun grabs everyone's attention.

1481
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:05,982
He's so good.

1482
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,383
He adds more chili oil!

1483
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,185
Set it on fire!

1484
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:12,255
Sweet and spicy sauce!

1485
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,390
He makes it look so delicious!

1486
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,225
HIS PERFORMANCE MAKES IT LOOK DELICIOUS!

1487
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,227
-He's so good at this.
-Of course, he is.

1488
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,664
Sweet and spicy sauce!

1489
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,033
Keep tossing!

1490
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,303
Adding sesame oil.

1491
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,505
Tae-hun is getting ahead of the game.

1492
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,543
He begins to serve his dish.
Fifty seconds.

1493
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,212
-Fifty seconds.
-He also uses the shell for presentation.

1494
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:38,714
It'd be advantageous
to ring the bell first.

1495
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,984
Chef Eun-yeong is using lots of cilantro.

1496
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,153
Sae-ho loves cilantro.

1497
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,822
Forty seconds!

1498
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,724
-Is he done? Tae-hun is done.
-Tae-hun finishes first.

1499
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,961
-Gosh.
-Tae-hun finishes first.

1500
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,896
Thirty seconds.

1501
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,433
Eun-yeong is done too.

1502
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,802
THE CHINESE SNOW CRAB MATCH ENDS!

1503
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,304
That was insane.

1504
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,739
-That was fire.
-Wow. They look good.

1505
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:08,344
It smelled amazing
when I went to the kitchen.

1506
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,848
Look at these.

1507
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,716
-I love this…
-The smell?

1508
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,118
-For both of them.
-For both?

1509
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,990
And now, the chefs made
two snow crab dishes for Sae-ho.

1510
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,491
I love them so much

1511
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,260
that I don't know what to do.

1512
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,597
-If it's all right,
-Yes?

1513
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:31,167
as I mentioned before…

1514
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,170
I don't think
I can eat these just like this.

1515
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,439
-May I pop a bottle?
-You've decided?

1516
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,774
-Decided!
-Decided.

1517
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,409
-All right!
-I knew it.

1518
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:44,146
-It's all thanks to Chef Sam.
-Thank you.

1519
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:49,452
And we can also celebrate
Chef Edward's first star from last week.

1520
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,153
-It's the bottle of Dom.
-You're opening that?

1521
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,489
-I'll open this. Yes.
-Really?

1522
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,426
It's almost their birthdays,
and I've returned after a while.

1523
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:58,995
Chef Sam, congratulations.

1524
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,164
I'll open this with a delightful heart.

1525
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,065
Flexing.

1526
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,568
Ah, yes. He's now…

1527
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,171
SOUNDS NICE!

1528
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,208
-It sounded like, "Star!"
-Star!

1529
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,810
-The eldest one.
-The birthday man.

1530
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,046
4 DAYS OLDER THAN CHEF HYUN-SUK

1531
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,649
-A glass for you.
-For Kyun.

1532
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:20,816
A little more?

1533
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,419
-A bit more?
-A present from the fridge owner.

1534
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:27,290
Stop that.
He just lifted the bottom of the bottle.

1535
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:30,426
-Chef Hyun-suk, happy birthday.
-It's been a while.

1536
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,395
-Congratulations.
-Sam breaks his losing streak.

1537
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,164
It must've been so stressful.

1538
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,301
-And even the chefs who cooked.
-He's so nice.

1539
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,335
Great work.

1540
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,171
Sae-ho is someone
who always loves to share.

1541
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,806
There were two bottles,

1542
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,141
and he opened the good one.

1543
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:48,344
He opened the expensive one? I knew it.

1544
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,747
Why don't you make a toast?

1545
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,149
So…

1546
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,851
Can you do an acrostic poem
with S and C of snow crab?

1547
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:59,188
-He can do that.
-We can't just let this chance go.

1548
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,258
An acrostic poem
with S and C of snow crab.

1549
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:05,561
-I'm only asking because it's Sae-ho.
-He can do it.

1550
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,231
He's our only guest today.

1551
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,135
-His mind must be full of thoughts.
-He can do this.

1552
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:14,303
I feel so uneasy right now.

1553
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,540
I feel so uneasy.

1554
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,376
-We need that from our only guest.
-You're our only guest.

1555
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,179
I'd like to share

1556
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,580
how I feel right now.

1557
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,717
-And with my wish.
-With your wish?

1558
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:31,954
He's going to make a toast
with a wish from his heart.

1559
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,723
Let's call it out for him.
One, two, three.

1560
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,157
-S.
-S.

1561
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,459
Start in Daegu!

1562
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:38,661
-Start in Daegu?
-Start in Daegu.

1563
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,931
-Start in Daegu? Really?
-Do you want to reconsider?

1564
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,200
-Why? I have one more left.
-I'm not so sure.

1565
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,369
-You can try it for now.
-Start in Daegu.

1566
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,104
-One, two, three. C.
-C.

1567
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,406
How am I going to go on in this situation?

1568
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,009
-Let me try again.
-Okay. Again.

1569
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,946
I was going to go,
Start in Daegu, chance upon Kaesong.

1570
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,748
-Daegu to Kaesong?
-But I'll forget that.

1571
01:06:58,814 --> 01:06:59,915
That wasn't too funny.

1572
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,417
I'm glad you didn't do it.

1573
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,085
You have to start smoothly.

1574
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,756
-Wait a second. I need to sit.
-Or you can use English.

1575
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,191
You suddenly made me do this…

1576
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:11,627
Allow me to have just three minutes.

1577
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,728
-That's too long.
-Three?

1578
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,263
No, just two.

1579
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,599
You let them cook for 15,
so spare 2 for me.

1580
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:21,670
Why don't you try it first
and do it later?

1581
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:25,341
The first dish you'll try is called
Who Ordered Snow Crab?

1582
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,243
FRIED CRAB MEAT AND BUTTON MUSHROOMS

1583
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,277
AND CRAB MUSTARD

1584
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,178
AND SHRIMP

1585
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,350
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S WHO ORDERED SNOW CRAB?

1586
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:39,889
Made by Chef Tae-hun,
Who Ordered Snow Crab?

1587
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:43,426
-The sweet and spicy sauce.
-It has to be delicious.

1588
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:46,295
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

1589
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,033
Goodness gracious.

1590
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,469
HE IMMEDIATELY SHOWS A PASSIONATE RESPONSE

1591
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,005
It tastes so…

1592
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,575
The inside is very fluffy
while the outside is crunchy.

1593
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:04,113
Everything goes well together,
including the button mushroom.

1594
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,450
I couldn't see any snow crab
when I look at it like this.

1595
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:10,252
Imagine you just knocked on
the snow crab's house,

1596
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,588
and you couldn't see it anywhere.

1597
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,925
You wonder where it is,
but it's been sleeping in the bedroom.

1598
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,228
It finally came out to see me.

1599
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,063
It's so good.

1600
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,898
TAKING ANOTHER BITE

1601
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:26,068
-He must feel anxious.
-The poem is making him anxious.

1602
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,304
It's because of the acrostic poem.

1603
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,539
He can't taste anything.

1604
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,742
You can relax and eat.

1605
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,845
-How's the sauce?
-First of all,

1606
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:40,449
it tastes sweet at first,
then the spiciness keeps hitting you.

1607
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,319
It helps the dish feel less greasy

1608
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,020
and lets me keep eating it.

1609
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:49,358
I thought the smell of button mushrooms
would cover up the crab meat flavor,

1610
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,360
but they work well together.

1611
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,729
I also love
the taste of mustard here and there.

1612
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,065
I see. Yes.

1613
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,302
-Let me try again.
-Yes?

1614
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,804
-He thought of one.
-Really?

1615
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,073
He thought about it in that while.

1616
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,174
-Can we go?
-Yes.

1617
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,109
Here comes his toast. One, two, three.

1618
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,010
-S!
-S!

1619
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,846
Simply the best show in Korea,
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

1620
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,081
One, two, three.

1621
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,117
-C!
-Continue forever! Let's go!

1622
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,119
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1623
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,855
It has to continue.

1624
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,857
This is the right one.

1625
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:22,791
Continue forever.

1626
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,628
THE STUDIO SUDDENLY TURNS INTO A PARTY

1627
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,431
-Excellent job.
-That was great.

1628
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,300
I can finally evaluate these in peace.

1629
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,803
-He can now try it in peace.
-He can finally digest the food.

1630
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,238
YUM

1631
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:40,276
-His mouth looks adorable.
-He makes it look good.

1632
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:45,014
-How did he make the batter so chewy?
-Is it? Did you like the batter?

1633
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,949
I love it.

1634
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,818
And there's a seafood party
dropping in my mouth.

1635
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:53,889
Shrimp and crab meat are
completely mingling with each other

1636
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,758
and dancing together.

1637
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:59,061
-It's a lot of fun in my mouth.
-I see.

1638
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:01,597
Also, personally speaking,

1639
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,434
if it had been spicier,
I wouldn't have tasted the crab.

1640
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,802
-I see.
-Was that better?

1641
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,704
The amount of spiciness now

1642
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:12,875
helps the crab flavor
spread out all over my mouth.

1643
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,476
I see.

1644
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,379
You have no trouble talking
after that acrostic poem.

1645
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,114
-He can keep commenting.
-I love his comments.

1646
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,016
I know I'll sleep well tonight.

1647
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:25,054
Next, please try
Chef Eun-yeong's Freeze, Crab.

1648
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:29,024
EGG WHITE AND CRAB MEAT
STUFFED INTO THE SHELL

1649
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,662
FRAGRANT CILANTRO SALAD
AND CRUNCHY BREADCRUMBS

1650
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,833
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S FREEZE, CRAB

1651
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,102
How should he eat from the shell?

1652
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,937
You'll find crab mustard
at the very bottom,

1653
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:45,908
so scoop everything until the bottom,
just like how you'd eat tiramisu.

1654
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:46,976
Just like tiramisu.

1655
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:52,214
First of all, I love
how the breadcrumbs were fried nicely.

1656
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,352
It looks soft.
I thought it'd be crunchier.

1657
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,855
You'll find egg whites and crab
under the breadcrumbs.

1658
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:00,789
Scoop it up from the bottom.

1659
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:03,659
My gosh.
It looks like it's made of cheese.

1660
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,628
-I got the mustard too.
-Yes.

1661
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:08,197
Sae-ho already loves egg white and crab.

1662
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,098
Let me try this.

1663
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,900
WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE?

1664
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,741
NERVOUS

1665
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,578
IS HE FROWNING BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD?

1666
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,913
He's showing a serious frown.

1667
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,749
Okay, then. S?

1668
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,917
Super. This is super.

1669
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,522
All of you, do you know what…

1670
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,858
-C!
-Crabs taste like?

1671
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,560
SAE-HO DID IT AGAIN!

1672
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,996
-That was fire.
-He did it.

1673
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,165
I knew it, Sae-ho.

1674
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,968
Do you know what crabs taste like?
This is so good.

1675
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,406
-You're something.
-This is just fantastic.

1676
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,341
-He's just…
-It feels like

1677
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,476
crabs are having a parade in my mouth.

1678
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,813
-It must be full of flavor.
-Like a king's parade.

1679
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,415
My gosh.

1680
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,983
So fantastic. The snow crab.

1681
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,387
-So fantastic. The snow crab.
-"So fantastic"?

1682
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,222
Why are you suddenly speaking in English?

1683
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,626
-He's all over the place right now.
-My gosh.

1684
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,062
-Was it fantastic?
-It must've been amazing.

1685
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:16,465
-This is a clash of the titans.
-A clash of the titans.

1686
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,034
What's he going to do?

1687
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,938
You're trying
Chef Tae-hun's Who Ordered Snow Crab?

1688
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,444
Is it because of the sauce?

1689
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,813
The texture reminds me of <i>takoyaki</i>.

1690
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:34,049
<i>It's chewy on the outside,</i>
<i>but soft on the inside.</i>

1691
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,785
-This is just crazy.
-Is it?

1692
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,721
-It's so good.
-It's so good?

1693
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,656
This is a good dish.

1694
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,991
-These mushrooms are better than shiitake
-It's softer.

1695
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,460
because these are much softer.

1696
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,295
-You're right.
-When you eat shiitake,

1697
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,131
it sometimes feels detached
or doesn't feel like part of the whole.

1698
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,968
But the button mushrooms
kept everything together as one.

1699
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,105
I was a bit worried
because button mushrooms are watery,

1700
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,140
so I thought they'd dilute the flavor.

1701
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,176
But he changed my mind.
Button mushrooms are better for this dish.

1702
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,079
Shiitake has a strong smell,

1703
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:07,015
-so it went so well with button mushrooms.
-Did it?

1704
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,984
I like the flavor when you chew into it.

1705
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,287
Next, Freeze, Crab by Chef Eun-yeong.

1706
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,890
It goes very well with the champagne.

1707
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:19,261
This is the hardest match yet.

1708
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:24,533
It didn't taste like I expected.

1709
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,571
I thought it'd taste just like gratin,

1710
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,174
but it tastes much more rich and creamy.

1711
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,842
Also, the breadcrumbs add more volume,

1712
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,979
and it makes it even better
with the champagne.

1713
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,581
It must be tough for you to decide.

1714
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:42,718
-It is.
-It's soft, rich, and creamy.

1715
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:46,088
<i>I especially loved how the breadcrumbs</i>
<i>were fried for a long time.</i>

1716
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,757
It popped in my mouth
and made it very delicious.

1717
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,027
She must've taken that into account.

1718
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,963
It's time to make your choice.

1719
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,099
-We gave you enough time.
-It's harder than I thought.

1720
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:00,469
-Yes, all right.
-It's very difficult.

1721
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,571
<i>Press one to vote for Park Eun-yeong,</i>

1722
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,273
<i>and press two for Lim Tae-hun.</i>

1723
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:08,243
Please make your decision
and press the button.

1724
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,946
-It was fun while you ate, wasn't it?
-He had lots of fun.

1725
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:14,016
-You had an amazing time, didn't you?
-You had fun.

1726
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,922
What is he supposed to do?

1727
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,157
No one will criticize you for this.

1728
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,559
Make your choice.

1729
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,260
-Okay.
-Did you? Good.

1730
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:27,830
Sae-ho finally made his choice.

1731
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:31,500
Who'll rise as the winner?

1732
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:34,570
Let's find out his choice. Show us!

1733
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,006
This was a snow crab round

1734
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:39,942
between the two cheeky Chinese chefs.

1735
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:43,679
Will Tae-hun take his first star?

1736
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:48,083
Or will Eun-yeong prove her position
as the Goddess of Chinese Cuisine?

1737
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:52,488
Which crab dish did Sae-ho like better?

1738
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,390
Who'll take the star?

1739
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,458
The winner is…

1740
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,994
-The crab round!
-Who is it?

1741
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,029
LIM TAE-HUN WINS

1742
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,632
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
WHO ORDERED SNOW CRAB? WINS

1743
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,400
It's Tae-hun!

1744
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:09,171
-You picked Tae-hun?
-Let me tell you why.

1745
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,006
I think it was the order.

1746
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:15,277
If I tried Freeze, Crab
before Chef Tae-hun's dish,

1747
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:19,314
I might have chosen this
as an overwhelming win.

1748
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:22,651
But I had to eat that mild dish
after his intense dish,

1749
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,120
so I began to crave the first one again.

1750
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:27,222
The order is important.

1751
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:32,427
And now, Sae-ho will put a star
on Chef Tae-hun.

1752
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,731
-This is his first star.
-It's his first one.

1753
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,232
-What?
-Where is he going?

1754
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:38,767
WHAT ABOUT MY STAR?

1755
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:42,037
-Should I go there?
-I loved the inexplicable harmony

1756
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:46,108
<i>between Chef Eun-yeong's dish</i>
<i>with the champagne,</i>

1757
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:49,244
so I'd like to give
the other bottle of champagne

1758
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,712
to Chef Eun-yeong.

1759
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:51,980
A PRESENT FOR EUN-YEONG

1760
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,215
It's a bottle I like.

1761
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,451
Please open the bottle
when you have something to celebrate.

1762
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:57,486
Thank you.

1763
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,621
Please put the star on him!

1764
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,958
Chef Tae-hun takes his first victory!

1765
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,127
Congratulations on your first star!

1766
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:06,662
-All right.
-It was delicious.

1767
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,264
Sae-ho must've felt bad.

1768
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,232
Thank you!

1769
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,600
STAY TUNED FOR THE PREVIEW

1770
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,504
Please welcome today's fridge owners,
Lim Yoona and Ahn Bo-hyun!

1771
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,306
Hello, I'm Lim Yoona.

1772
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,807
I was Yoona's fan.

1773
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,442
I was a fan of Girls' Generation.

1774
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,977
-I know all their birthdays.
-Really?

1775
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,478
When's your mother's birthday?

1776
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,013
She celebrates on the lunar calendar.

1777
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,348
A CHEF AND A BAD SON

1778
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,116
What do you think makes a good "center"?

1779
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,384
In my opinion,

1780
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,520
it's all about
your performance and attitude.

1781
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:35,023
Who's the key member of <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

1782
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,426
<i>Which chef will please Yoona the most?</i>

1783
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:40,195
<i>Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!</i>

1784
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,664
<i>-I'm getting my dance moves back.</i>
<i>-Hyoyeon of the show.</i>

1785
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,733
<i>Hard work can't beat talent.</i>

1786
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,235
<i>The center is someone</i>
<i>we absolutely need on the show.</i>

1787
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,270
<i>Cut it!</i>

1788
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:49,638
<i>Ho-young is focused.</i>

1789
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:50,839
This is amazing.

1790
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:53,609
THE CHEFS BECAME BLINDED
BY THE DESIRE TO WIN

1791
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,177
<i>That looks like another loach.</i>

1792
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,244
<i>We'll have to flush again.</i>

1793
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,380
<i>Poong is making something odd again.</i>

1794
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,615
<i>You're running late.</i>

1795
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:00,582
<i>You have a minute left!</i>

1796
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,985
-Oh, no.
-Oh, gosh.

1797
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,457
-They're like twins.
-You're dazzling.

1798
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:09,725
I feel humiliated.

1799
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,893
FINALLY REVEALING NAPOLI MANIAC(?)
