1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,618
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,255
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,357
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,994
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,397
-Welcome back.
-It's great to see you.

6
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,731
TO BE REVEALED SOON

7
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,901
-My gosh.
-Anyway, what's happening today?

8
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,504
Are we here with a new chef?

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,407
-Are they twins?
-You're glowing.

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,409
<i>During their last cook-off…</i>

11
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,977
-What about their hairstyle?
-I'm in.

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,612
-You'll do this hair?
-Sure.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,947
CHEF YOON NAM-NO SAVES HIS HAIR

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,749
Nam-no wins!

15
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,484
SUNG-JUN GETS TO BLEACH HIS HAIR

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>Sung-jun had lost,</i>

17
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,623
so he had to copy Nam-no's hairstyle.

18
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,324
-He's my younger brother.
-He is.

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,427
You two look so similar
with his hair like this.

20
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,528
It's humiliating.

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,398
The way it shines…

22
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,299
is so annoying.

23
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,701
-You two look really similar.
-Jeez.

24
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,171
Their only difference was their hairstyle.

25
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,606
You're right. They have similar features.

26
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,609
-They're basically the same type.
-Right.

27
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,646
-His hairstyle changed him completely.
-They look the same.

28
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,881
-But it suits him.
-It does.

29
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,184
-Honestly, it's better than his old hair.
-Is it?

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,986
-What did you think before?
-He had a hard part.

31
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,088
Is that a wig or your hair?

32
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,689
-It's a wig.
-It is?

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,057
-You're wearing a wig?
-A wig?

34
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,026
I was going to bleach my hair,

35
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,529
but I dye my gray hair every month,
so it was impossible.

36
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,064
They still had a bet, right?

37
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,933
I think he's

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,234
cheating his way out.

39
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,203
You're right about that.

40
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,106
Why don't you fight
against Nam-no next time

41
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,741
and really bleach your hair?

42
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,277
-I can't do that, even if I want to.
-Why not?

43
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,413
I need to lose first to do that.

44
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,682
I'll dye my hair red for him.

45
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,484
It might happen in the next season.

46
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,220
-And…
-By then, you'd have natural gray hair.

47
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,555
Will that happen with his age?

48
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,091
-Enough is enough.
-Fine.

49
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,261
I came determined today
because I'll keep this hair

50
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,797
-if I win with this today.
-What?

51
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,866
-If you do, it'll be your good luck charm.
-Yes.

52
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,101
-My new good luck.
-You put that on anyway.

53
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,136
HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?

54
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,639
Stay tuned
and continue to witness the chemistry

55
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,142
between Cooking Maniac and Napoli Maniac.

56
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,479
Our guests on this episode are
also two people who show off

57
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,516
the greatest chemistry.

58
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:34,187
We present today's fridge owners.
Please come on out!

59
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,956
The two fridge owners.

60
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,791
BIG SMILES

61
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,562
Welcome to the show.

62
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,399
Today's fridge owners are
the queen and king of romantic comedy,

63
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,434
Lim Yoona and Ahn Bo-hyun!

64
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,702
Hello.

65
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,305
As dazzling as she always is,

66
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,941
please welcome actor Lim Yoona!

67
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,276
-Hello.
-Hello.

68
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,877
WELCOME

69
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,379
An actor with a wide variety of sides

70
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,047
who's well-known
for playing romantic boyfriends.

71
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,983
Bo-hyun is my only boo!

72
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,554
-Please welcome actor Ahn Bo-hyun.
-Ahn Bo-hyun!

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,055
Hello. Welcome to the show.

74
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,757
It's great to have you here.

75
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,626
It feels as if there's a halo around them.

76
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,631
There's a special reason
why they visited us here today.

77
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:23,036
We starred in a film
titled <i>Pretty Crazy</i> together,

78
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,737
and it'll premiere on August 13th.

79
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,838
I SEE

80
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:26,973
You must be busy.

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,176
I got to work with the director
and the production crew

82
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,011
of <i>Exit</i> once again.

83
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:36,015
<i>I play a woman</i>
<i>who works at a bakery by day.</i>

84
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,083
Do I look like the devil?

85
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,719
<i>But I turn into a devil every night.</i>

86
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,588
<i>I'm an unemployed bum who lives upstairs.</i>

87
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,590
<i>It's way more than I can handle.</i>

88
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,759
<i>He keeps looking after me</i>
<i>in the dead of night.</i>

89
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,194
-My character is named Seon-ji.
-Seon-ji.

90
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,662
I'm either Day Seon-ji or…

91
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,464
It sounds like the word
for solidified blood.

92
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,000
So I'm either Day Seon-ji
or Night Seon-ji.

93
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,535
-Night Seon-ji.
-Night Seon-ji.

94
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,104
We'll look forward to the film.

95
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,741
I hear the chefs were very excited
in the green room when they heard

96
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,744
Yoona, the queen of romantic comedy,
would be here today.

97
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,514
It was especially the case
for Chef Jong-won,

98
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,952
because he even confessed
that he was a true Girls' Generation stan.

99
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,423
I did my mandatory military service
back in 2007,

100
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,259
-when she debuted.
-You're right.

101
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,395
And in the quarters,
we'd fight for our favorite girl group.

102
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,530
You fought for your favorite girl group?

103
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,865
-It's a must.
-How?

104
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,801
-I always sided with Girls' Generation.
-The soldiers?

105
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,004
-Thank you.
-He was on Team Girls' Generation.

106
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,674
-It's the first time he said he was a fan.
-It is.

107
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,976
Other than Jong-won,

108
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,981
there's another person here
who was a serious fanatic.

109
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,419
Not a lot of people
stan a group as seriously as this guy.

110
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,154
Who is it?

111
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,556
IT'S ME

112
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,392
Do you know him?

113
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,593
Yes, of course.

114
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,328
-Napoli Matfia.
-Thank you.

115
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,963
Call him Napoli Maniac now.

116
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,531
-Napoli Maniac?
-There's a story.

117
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,999
-Your hair's…
-Starting today.

118
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,934
I feel a bit embarrassed today.

119
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,969
He lost against Nam-no.

120
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,438
I feel like I'm in outer space.

121
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,073
This is very humiliating for me

122
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,444
to sit here looking like this
in front of my favorite girl group member.

123
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,814
Anyway, when she debuted in 2007,
I was in 7th grade.

124
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,152
Back then, I was well-known
as a Girls' Generation fan.

125
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,054
I was also on HwaSuEunWa,
their online fan site.

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,488
Wait, really?

127
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,458
The viewers will be the judge of this.

128
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,593
He says that about every single celebrity.

129
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,396
-He is my favorite TV personality.
-Thank you.

130
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,232
I keep these macho celebrities
as my role model.

131
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,967
I got to meet my role model today.

132
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,202
-He does?
-He says he's a fan

133
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,271
-He's done it a lot.
-and they're his role model.

134
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,373
-This time, I'm serious.
-Really?

135
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,775
-You can feel free to check.
-Sure.

136
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,011
Is there proof that you're a serious fan?

137
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,146
I even memorized all their birthdays.

138
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,048
-Everyone?
-Yes, everyone.

139
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:49,949
Really?

140
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,985
-Taeyeon was born on March 9, 1989.
-Okay.

141
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,321
-Sunny was born on May 15.
-I see.

142
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,723
Tiffany, August 1.

143
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,491
-Hyoyeon, September 22.
-Okay.

144
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,027
And Yuri, December 5.

145
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,462
Now, we move on to 1990.

146
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,897
Sooyoung was born on February 10.

147
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,900
And the lady of the day, Yoona,
was born on May 30.

148
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,637
Lastly, Seohyun is the youngest
and was born on June 28, 1991.

149
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,207
You're right.

150
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,342
-He is a fan.
-That's scary.

151
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,378
-When's your mother's birthday?
-He got them all.

152
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,114
-His mother's birthday?
-When is your mother's birthday?

153
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,282
-She celebrates on the lunar calendar.
-The lunar calendar?

154
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,485
CRACKING UP

155
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,919
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW

156
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,421
It changes every year.

157
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,756
Did he get everything right?

158
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,291
He really did. But you know,

159
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,560
did you have to test him like that?

160
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,697
-We have to check thoroughly.
-Can't we just believe him?

161
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,399
CHEF & MY FRIDGE
IS A TRULY SCARY PLACE

162
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,967
You're all going after him.

163
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,103
-Please be good to your mother.
-I will.

164
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,472
-He should be.
-Be a good son.

165
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,508
She raised him to this day,
but he doesn't know her birthday.

166
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,411
What do you think makes a true key member?

167
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,480
-I think it's all about harmony.
-Harmony.

168
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,684
It's someone who has the energy

169
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,487
to balance both sides in good harmony.

170
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,722
I SEE

171
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,792
So Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany,
Hyoyeon, and Yuri

172
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,026
can't bring harmony.

173
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,695
-No, no.
-All right then.

174
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,165
-That's so evil.
-That's not us.

175
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,833
-He's the devil.
-It doesn't matter

176
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,037
who stands in the center,
because we always keep a great balance.

177
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,372
Let's turn the question around.

178
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,842
Who do you think can be
the "center" of <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

179
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,344
Let's say we have to do a photo shoot.

180
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,047
Who are we going to put in the center?

181
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,884
-Look at all of them.
-We can try it out.

182
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,221
-We're like, "I'm better than that guy."
-Hyun-suk and Jong-won look hopeful.

183
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,957
-We do that for the poster.
-Who should be in the center?

184
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,226
HOPEFUL EXPRESSION

185
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
In my opinion,

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,963
someone who can bring the best harmony is

187
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,332
-probably Chef Hyun-suk.
-Yes, right.

188
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,536
-Because in my opinion,
-Open your eyes, will you?

189
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,804
-He's asleep.
-I thought

190
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,241
he was the one who had
the proper performance and attitude.

191
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,745
I think he's good on the show
when it comes to those aspects.

192
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,882
What do you think
about her opinion, Jong-won?

193
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,852
Of course, Chef Hyun-suk
would look great in the center.

194
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,054
But I personally think it's Poong.

195
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,655
-Poong is the center of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>?
-Me?

196
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,657
-Why?
-Because the center

197
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,494
is someone we absolutely need on the show.

198
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,896
THAT MEANS…

199
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,198
We don't need Chef Hyun-suk.

200
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,902
We don't need Hyun-suk, but we need Poong?

201
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,671
I see. And we don't need Sam, either.

202
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,106
I think…

203
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,841
I'll just disappear, then.

204
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,345
I was going to have Jong-won on my right.

205
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,082
-That was disappointing.
-He's disappointed. I see.

206
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,852
Yoona is a huge fan of the show,

207
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,221
and she's highly interested in cooking.

208
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,724
Is this true? Do you like to cook?

209
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,294
I always loved watching cooking shows
since I was younger.

210
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,629
SHE WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED

211
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,631
I tried cooking by myself
little by little,

212
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,766
and I made a hobby of it now.

213
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,768
What's the best dish you can make?

214
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,106
<i>-Yukgaejang</i>, spicy beef soup.
-<i>Yukgaejang?</i>

215
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,241
-That's not easy to make.
-It takes a lot of work.

216
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,943
-It's hard.
-I tried making it,

217
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,212
and it tasted good.

218
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,181
-It even tasted good?
-I thought, "Why is this so good?"

219
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,818
I'm also in a drama production,

220
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,922
and I have to play a character
who's a chef.

221
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,292
It wasn't easy
to give a dish a good presentation.

222
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,893
THAT'S TOUGH

223
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,095
So when I watch shows like this one,

224
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,131
I also do it as a part of my research

225
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,833
to see what chefs do when they cook.

226
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,202
I see. It's now time to find out

227
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,706
the ingredients Yoona has in her fridge
as someone who's interested in cooking.

228
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,341
I'm sure it's dazzling.

229
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,642
She's serious about cooking too.

230
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,813
Let us present Yoona's fridge,
someone who's serious about cooking!

231
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,016
IT'S THE FRIDGE PARTY TIME

232
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,785
-Whoa.
-That's a lot.

233
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,557
-It's quite full.
-So this is your fridge.

234
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,459
Let's begin here.

235
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:57,363
-The top shelf has lots of side dishes.
-Side dishes.

236
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,167
What's your favorite among these?

237
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,436
I like that cold jellyfish salad.

238
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,037
-This one?
-Yes.

239
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,440
She must like it if she bought that.

240
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,644
-I like the sweet and sour flavor.
-Sweet and sour.

241
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,180
-What's this? Chili peppers.
-Pickled chili peppers.

242
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,481
Do you like spicy food?

243
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,883
I crave it,

244
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,886
but it feels like
it'll make my stomach hurt.

245
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,722
-Your stomach is too weak, then.
-Yes.

246
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,490
Do you eat <i>malatang</i>?

247
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,492
-I love it.
-I see.

248
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,227
-You do?
-Isn't <i>malatang</i> spicy?

249
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,196
There are some that are not spicy.

250
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,998
I keep it to stage one.

251
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,501
The least spicy flavor.
Always the least spicy level.

252
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,305
If I have some side dishes
to balance out the spiciness, I can do it,

253
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,075
so I order fried buns with condensed milk
or tomato and egg stir-fry.

254
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,611
-So you can take basic spiciness.
-I can.

255
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,748
The second shelf is full of tofu.

256
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,717
Morning Tofu. Soft Tofu Meal.

257
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,021
-I also found soft tofu tortillas.
-Yes.

258
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,989
-Soft tofu tortilla?
-Do you like tofu?

259
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,190
-First time seeing that.
-I do.

260
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,393
And of course, some eggs.

261
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,795
The colors look different.

262
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,330
-Blue eggs?
-Blue eggs.

263
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,232
Was it Byung-eun last time?

264
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,500
Egg code one.

265
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,770
Egg code one.
The eggs were from free-range chickens.

266
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,605
<i>-These are all coded one.</i>
<i>-I see one here.</i>

267
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,374
Those taste much lighter and savory.

268
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:19,612
I also heard
blue eggs are higher in protein.

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,646
Is there a difference?

270
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,884
Yes, they taste more savory
when I boil them.

271
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,018
Vegetables.

272
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,789
-I found napa cabbage and cabbage.
-Cabbage.

273
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,025
-Are these oyster mushrooms? Enoki.
-Mushrooms. Enoki.

274
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,927
She has lots of fruits too.

275
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,029
-I love fruit.
-You do?

276
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,565
Fruits always depend on the season.

277
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,369
-Yes, we have no other choice.
-I prefer watermelon in summer, right now.

278
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,706
There are lots of sauces in this door bin.

279
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,974
What's your favorite sauce?

280
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,278
-I like ponzu.
-I see.

281
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,381
I often use ponzu or <i>tsuyu</i>.

282
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,485
-You basically like sweet and sour sauce.
-I do.

283
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,921
That galbi sauce is from an acquaintance.

284
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,189
-This one?
-Yes.

285
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,891
-This looks homemade.
-It was homemade.

286
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,960
That person runs
a Korean restaurant in Saipan,

287
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,997
and they always make the sauce
and send it to me by mail.

288
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,100
-I see.
-From Saipan?

289
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,102
-From Saipan?
-Galbi sauce from Saipan?

290
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,939
I marinate meat with that sauce on my own.

291
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,174
-So you must like this flavor.
-I do.

292
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,810
I like things on the sweeter side.

293
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,513
The bin above this one has lots of cheese.

294
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,481
You must like it.

295
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,017
-I really love Brie.
-Brie.

296
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,019
I often cut it into small pieces

297
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,821
-and eat it as is.
-You like Brie.

298
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,956
Brie's great.

299
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,424
I see lots of butter too.

300
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,727
I was a part of the baking club
back in school.

301
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,828
-What?
-I see.

302
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,397
-We had that extracurricular period.
-The extracurricular.

303
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,668
I'd look up recipes
I could try out at home

304
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,239
<i>and taught myself.</i>
<i>So I use lots of unsalted butter.</i>

305
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,740
You end up using a lot.

306
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,742
On to the freezer.

307
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,345
I found shrimp.

308
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,413
What's this?

309
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,816
-That's whelk.
-Whelk?

310
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,950
-They're raw.
-Raw whelk.

311
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,452
Raw whelk?

312
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,154
-I see.
-I tend to like

313
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,523
-whelks and conches.
-The chewy texture.

314
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,793
Wait, that was why you had
all these canned whelks.

315
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,029
-The canned ones.
-I like the canned ones too.

316
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,866
-Yoona's favorite seafood is whelk.
-Whelk.

317
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,002
I'm seeing some meat down here.

318
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,304
-Meat.
-I think that's beef.

319
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,640
-Duck.
-This must be duck.

320
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,241
-And pork.
-And she has pork.

321
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,012
-Chicken breast.
-She has a lot of chicken breasts.

322
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,513
Do you stay on a strict diet?

323
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,716
I often eat that when I have to.

324
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,252
But my favorite chicken cut is

325
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,321
already the breast.

326
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,623
-Do you like that dry meat?
-I do.

327
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,525
-Really?
-Yes, that's me.

328
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,661
-You like dry meat? Why?
-Yes.

329
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,095
-It's good.
-Why?

330
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,231
-You enjoy the dry cut?
-It's good.

331
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,666
I like chicken breast too.

332
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,369
Sung-ju and I never have to bicker
because he likes that too.

333
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,973
-I can't eat dry meat, but he loves it.
-I love it.

334
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,641
-Wings and drumsticks for me.
-Don't you get thirsty?

335
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,443
It's hard to eat.

336
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,245
I always give out the drumsticks.

337
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,280
-Me too.
-I give out the wings and drumsticks

338
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,015
and take the breast meat instead.

339
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,450
You're a born K-pop star.

340
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,487
I hate that mushy meat.

341
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,256
-Right?
-Wait.

342
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,159
We call that chewy, not mushy.

343
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,560
-Do you call it chewy?
-Yes.

344
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,164
Some people even eat just the skin.

345
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,900
-It's the best.
-That's the best part.

346
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,703
-Chicken skin is the best.
-Isn't it?

347
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,539
I also rarely eat the skin.

348
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,242
-Just the breast meat.
-She doesn't eat what makes you fat.

349
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,878
So when I have to drop some weight,

350
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,113
-I just enjoy it deliciously.
-Really?

351
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,381
She can lose weight deliciously.

352
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,483
I also like Vietnamese spring rolls too.

353
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,318
-Spring rolls?
-Yes.

354
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,588
She doesn't eat the kind of food
that makes you put on weight.

355
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,991
Everything she likes is
already quite healthy.

356
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,860
-Yes, I guess I prefer the kind of food
-I'm jealous.

357
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,563
that doesn't carry lots of calories.

358
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,932
It must be a little easier
for you to stay fit.

359
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,968
That was all for Yoona's fridge.

360
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,504
She has lots of stuff.

361
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,409
Now, what kind orders
did Yoona bring for the chefs today?

362
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,379
Let's find out what her orders are.

363
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,416
Sunny day: heavenly visuals.

364
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,920
-Deep night: evil temptation.
-Evil temptation.

365
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,889
There's a difference
between night and day.

366
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,892
By day, I want to eat something

367
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,095
that'll please my palate perfectly,

368
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,299
as well as something that looks pretty.

369
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,435
-I've been studying presentation, so…
-Right.

370
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:41,307
I want to taste something
that's pleasing to my eyes and mouth,

371
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,576
something that I'll absolutely love.

372
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,278
What's the second order?

373
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,948
The second one is for the night.

374
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,416
It's the opposite of the day.

375
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,285
I want something very strong,
unlike my usual preference.

376
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:58,557
I wanted to try something very evil.

377
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,192
I'm thinking of someone.

378
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,428
-The evil one…
-The strong flavor.

379
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:07,166
Something that overlaps
with how you are in the film, right?

380
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,069
I want to try something that's very evil.

381
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,037
-He's already the devil.
-Already?

382
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,572
I see. All right.

383
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,308
I think Poong's fate is already sealed.

384
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,476
…is already sealed.

385
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,912
WE ALL KNOW WHERE HE'LL GO

386
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,448
My name's already up there. Okay.

387
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,283
You were going to do it anyway.

388
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,519
-You're right. Man.
-This is the spot, right?

389
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,821
I can sense the darkness already.

390
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,223
-Isn't making evil dishes his thing?
-Yes.

391
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,758
That's his way of cooking.

392
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,993
I've been very curious.

393
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,162
Chef Jong-won, fight the devil today.

394
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,098
A return match.

395
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,102
-A return match.
-I don't think I'm ready for it yet.

396
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,304
-He was badly hurt.
-You said you were Yoona's fan too.

397
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,873
I'll go for the sunny day.

398
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,775
-That suits him.
-Yes, it does.

399
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,778
-The sunny day suits him better.
-Yes.

400
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,782
I was the most famous as a fan of
Girls' Generation in Eulji Middle School,

401
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,485
-so that's my attitude.
-Not the evil dish?

402
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,652
That's where he belongs.

403
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,056
-I should fight someone similar to me.
-Similar?

404
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,324
Napoli Maniac.

405
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,893
-He takes the day.
-Napoli Maniac takes the day.

406
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,295
Who'll join the deep night?

407
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,297
It should be someone who's a fan.

408
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,066
-Ho-young.
-Hey, Ho-young.

409
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,803
I've been fighting
the evil temptation every single night.

410
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,940
So I think I know what she's looking for.

411
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,811
It's about time I teach Poong
another lesson and put him in his place.

412
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,047
All right. The first order to fill

413
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,782
is "Sunny day: heavenly visuals."

414
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,251
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

415
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:39,258
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Yoona's fridge.</i>

416
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:44,329
She wants something for a sunny day,
something with heavenly visuals.

417
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,867
The best-looking chef on the show,
Son Jong-won is

418
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,270
up against the chef with shocking looks,

419
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,606
-Kwon Sung-jun.
-Shocking?

420
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,175
Isn't that Chef Nam-no?

421
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,976
-It's Sung-jun.
-Is it?

422
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:58,911
It's Chef Sung-jun.

423
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,313
It's even funnier from this angle.

424
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,683
-He's not Yoon Nam-no. Is he Kwon Nam-no?
-Is he Kwon Nam-no?

425
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,185
It's confusing.

426
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,987
-But we found something suspicious.
-Yes?

427
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,790
-So we did some digging on Sung-jun.
-Did we?

428
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,326
-He was a Girls' Generation fan, but…
-But?

429
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,628
-But his bias was
-What?

430
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,031
-Sooyoung.
-Oh, no.

431
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,066
-Come on.
-I spotted this.

432
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,869
Sung-jun's nickname on the fan site was

433
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,004
-Sooyoung's Hubby.
-Sooyoung's Hubby?

434
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,072
Sooyoung's Hubby.

435
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,376
-I found this. I found it.
-That's crazy.

436
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,979
-He wasn't Yoona's Hubby, but Sooyoung.
-Sooyoung's Hubby?

437
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,481
-Gosh.
-In middle school?

438
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:40,219
-That's amazing. He was a real fan.
-His nickname was Sooyoung's Hubby.

439
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,920
Some explanation is due.

440
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,456
First of all, it's true.

441
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,559
While I was an active member
of a fan site named HwaSuEunWa,

442
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,561
I was nicknamed Sooyoung's Hubby.

443
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,896
HE'S A REAL FAN

444
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,398
But Yoona is my bias now.

445
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,467
-Come on.
-Don't say that.

446
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,569
-They're a family.
-You're everyone's fan.

447
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,873
Chef Jong-won, who was your bias?

448
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,242
I only had my eyes on Yoona.

449
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,445
He lost.

450
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,347
THAT'S NOT GOOD

451
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,782
-Thank you.
-Are you sure about this?

452
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,252
Jong-won has a new apron today.

453
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,989
-He always had the pretty colored one.
-He did.

454
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,090
The mint one, right?

455
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,758
Was there a change of heart?

456
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,027
You probably find this apron familiar.

457
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,831
I've been on a losing streak,

458
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,300
and I thought
this was the source of his victory.

459
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,302
I wanted to get some of his energy.

460
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,071
-It's to get his energy?
-So I borrowed it from him.

461
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,974
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS: LEMON JUICE,
SOFT TOFU TORTILLA, MINI PICKLES, CELERY

462
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,076
CANNED WHELK, CABBAGE, SRIRACHA, ARUGULA,
SWEET PUMPKIN, PEACHES, BRIE, AND MORE

463
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,513
The name of the dish I'll make today is

464
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,081
Son-phrodite.

465
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,983
-Son-phrodite?
-What?

466
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,489
I see. People who love Yoona
must be familiar with that nickname.

467
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,992
After the contenders were decided,

468
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,961
Chef Jong-won didn't even have lunch

469
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,430
and went somewhere else

470
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,366
to prepare his secret weapon,
according to our sources.

471
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,936
-I actually went out to buy flowers.
-I see.

472
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,904
-You got flowers?
-Yes, I went to get flowers.

473
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,208
<i>It's not food,</i>
<i>but there was a flower shop nearby.</i>

474
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,444
<i>So I ran over and got some flowers.</i>

475
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,313
I got some chrysanthemums.

476
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,783
Its flower language means
bright and noble.

477
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,752
I thought it suits Yoona very well.

478
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,554
-I see.
-He's good.

479
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,892
I got flowers because my dish will
look like a flower bouquet.

480
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,993
Like a flower bouquet?

481
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,996
I'll use the soft tofu tortillas
she had in the fridge

482
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,234
to make a dish
that looks like a bouquet of flowers.

483
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,902
Are you confident about the presentation?

484
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,938
I always do my best
to prepare beautiful dishes,

485
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,075
so I guess I've been doing that
to prepare for this day.

486
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,110
OH, MY

487
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,144
He's taking this very far.

488
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,648
-He's improved with this.
-He's improved a lot.

489
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,352
-He got better after losing three times.
-It happens.

490
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,120
He took it way too far.

491
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,655
It might be the apron.

492
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,658
Is there a tongue on the apron?

493
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,927
Is there a tongue on that thing?

494
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,062
You aren't talking as much, Hyun-suk.

495
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,999
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: RICE PAPER,
ORANGE, SPAGHETTI, ARUGULA, WHELK, OLIVES

496
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,067
NAPA CABBAGE, COLD JELLYFISH SALAD, SQUID,
BERRIES, SHRIMP, PONZU, BROTH TABLET

497
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,770
The dish I prepared is…

498
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,871
HIGH EXPECTATIONS

499
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,873
What are you making today?

500
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,942
Girls' Generation's fan club
is named S♡NE,

501
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,878
and I'm a member of S♡NE.

502
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,115
So the theme is pasta made by S♡NE.

503
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:27,919
I'm going to make cold pasta
because it's summer.

504
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,656
Yoona said she liked
sweet and sour flavors,

505
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,192
so I'll make a dressing with orange

506
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,094
and use whelk as the highlight.

507
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,196
And what's important is
that I prepared flowers too.

508
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,299
-Really?
-As someone who loves flowers,

509
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,200
I'll make edible flowers,

510
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,303
not the kind you buy with money.

511
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,973
I'll prepare a flower you can't buy
and put it on top of the dish.

512
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,942
-I hope he doesn't say it's him.
-No.

513
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,512
-He wouldn't do that.
-Don't you dare.

514
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,516
All right. Which one of the two
will melt Yoona's heart today?

515
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:58,417
And now,

516
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,454
let us begin the round titled,
"Sunny day: heavenly visuals."

517
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,822
Whoa.

518
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,391
He's going to cook for his bias, Yoona.

519
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,528
The heavenly looks of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
Son Jong-won, is up.

520
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,030
-His bias may be Sooyoung,
-Gosh.

521
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,167
but he's going to cook
only for Yoona today.

522
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,438
The shocking looks of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
Kwon Sung-jun, is up as well.

523
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:24,109
Which one of them will satisfy Yoona,
the looks and the frontwoman of her group?

524
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,679
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

525
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,716
-Let's go!
-Yes!

526
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,218
Begin!

527
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,354
-You got this, Nam-no!
-Yes!

528
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,723
FLATTENING THE TORTILLA!

529
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,324
-The tortilla.
-Yes.

530
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,460
-He's using the tortilla.
-Yes.

531
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,429
-Was that a tofu tortilla? Right?
-It was.

532
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,698
Yoona seems to love tofu very much.

533
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,868
-He's flattening it as much as possible.
-Yes.

534
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,704
-But it's already flat.
-It is already flat.

535
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,040
-How much thinner does it have to be?
-He wants it very thin.

536
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,575
Is he going to make tuile?

537
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,378
-He's cutting it.
-He's cutting it now.

538
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,413
And he cuts it again.

539
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,614
In quarters.

540
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,950
FLATTENING IT ONCE AGAIN!

541
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,785
-And again.
-Is he making petals?

542
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,820
He must have a reason
for flattening it even more.

543
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,423
-What's that?
-He called it a bouquet.

544
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,792
-They must be petals.
-They must be.

545
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,093
Raspberries?

546
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,597
SUNG-JUN BLENDS
TRIPLE BERRIES IN A BLENDER!

547
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,033
He blended raspberries
and put them on heat.

548
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,538
Sung-jun also did a lot,

549
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,040
but we were looking at Jong-won,
so we don't know what he did.

550
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,709
Let's take a look at Sung-jun.

551
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,110
SPOTLIGHT ON

552
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,379
He starts off a little differently.

553
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,814
He's using shrimp.

554
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,049
He's using seafood. Shrimp.

555
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,986
-And squid.
-He added some squid too.

556
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,355
Are those olives, Sung-jun?

557
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,689
Yes, they are.

558
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,425
How are you going to use those?

559
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,492
They're for the pasta.

560
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,195
HE TALKS JUST LIKE NAM-NO

561
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,431
He's become Napoli Maniac today.

562
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,466
The olives… You're boiling the olives?

563
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,168
I plan to parboil them.

564
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,602
Is it to get rid of the saltiness?

565
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,704
What did you just scoop out?

566
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,040
I parboiled whelk, shrimp, and olives.

567
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,577
He parboiled everything
and put everything in iced water.

568
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,511
All right.

569
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,915
I think he's intentionally cooking pasta
in the water he cooked seafood with.

570
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,050
-You're right.
-Is it to add more flavor?

571
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,420
-It'll add a savory flavor to the pasta.
-It's to add more flavor.

572
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,823
WHAT'S CHEF JONG-WON UP TO?

573
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,091
What are you spreading?

574
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,093
-Butter.
-It's butter.

575
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,831
-Just like that.
-He'll roll it up and put it inside.

576
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:30,302
I think it's because
that's too thick to turn into tuile.

577
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,205
He's trying to cut back on time
by flattening it.

578
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,808
I think he'll make cone-shaped tuiles.

579
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,278
He put one inside and topped it
with another cone to keep it flat.

580
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:44,950
The tortilla was too thick,
but tuiles are supposed to break easily.

581
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,018
He won't have enough time
to make it too crunchy.

582
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,420
It'll take a least 20 minutes

583
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,222
-to make cone-shaped tuiles.
-Really?

584
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,023
Wait a second.

585
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,926
Did you put those in the oven?
But is it turned on?

586
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,996
-The oven. Turn it on.
-Is it turned on?

587
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,166
It wasn't on, right? Goodness.

588
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,835
-I just saved you.
-That was awesome.

589
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,304
You put that in there,
but nothing was going on.

590
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,807
-Is it turned on?
-The oven.

591
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,842
Sung-jun had missed something too.

592
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,310
I just saved you.

593
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,745
SUNG-JU SAVED MANY

594
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,948
Jong-won works with cabbage.

595
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,217
1. PREPARE CABBAGE
AND PARBOIL IN BOILING WATER

596
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,685
CELERY

597
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,420
Is that celery? What is it?

598
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,955
It's a piece of celery.

599
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,458
That's right.

600
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,628
2. CHOP CELERY AND PARBOIL IN A STRAINER

601
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,796
He's using napa cabbage too.

602
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,066
Sung-jun isn't putting on
a huge show today.

603
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,904
-You're right.
-He calmly focuses on this round.

604
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,572
He's going to beat Jong-won today.

605
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,607
CABBAGE VS NAPA CABBAGE

606
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,776
Napa cabbage versus cabbage.

607
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,480
Into the iced water.

608
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,282
Everyone's so quick with their hands.

609
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,550
An orange.

610
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,386
I wonder
how he'll use the orange for pasta.

611
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,187
I'll use it for the dressing.

612
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,089
-For the dressing.
-As the sauce?

613
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,527
2. PEEL AN ORANGE AND CUT IT INTO PIECES

614
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,064
Anyway, the point of this order is
that your food be like a sunny day.

615
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,267
-They both move so quickly.
-Do they?

616
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,835
QUICKLY DICING A PICKLE

617
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,438
They have to move quickly
to finish cooking in 15 minutes.

618
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,440
What's that, Chef Jong-won?

619
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,842
-It's a pickle.
-A pickle.

620
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,379
That sauce looks good.

621
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,883
I'm making dressing similar to rémoulade
by using sriracha.

622
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,551
It's originally made with cayenne pepper.

623
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,354
It's like the French version
of spicy mayonnaise.

624
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,022
-I see.
-That has to be delicious.

625
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,058
-Is that whelk?
-It is.

626
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,460
ADDING CHEWINESS

627
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,432
That's cabbage, and…
He parboiled most of the veggies.

628
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,466
And celery.

629
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,335
It's like mayonnaise.

630
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,372
Sung-jun's instant rice is ready.

631
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,240
-Why does he need rice for pasta?
-Yes, right?

632
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,809
-What?
-Why do you need rice for pasta?

633
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,180
-What's the red thing?
-Raspberries.

634
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,582
What? Raspberry rice?

635
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,384
-What's that?
-Raspberry rice?

636
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,952
Drool. It looks good.

637
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,955
It looks like fresh blood.

638
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,457
-It must be.
-Is that blood?

639
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,892
-He should've made an evil dish.
-It looks like clotted blood.

640
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,361
Shouldn't you have made an evil dish?

641
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,731
-It's like the blood pudding <i>sundae</i>.
-Blood pudding!

642
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,532
It reminds me of a blood pudding <i>sundae</i>.

643
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,101
Why did he add rice there?

644
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,736
-There's a reason.
-I see.

645
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,371
What's he doing?

646
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,439
You're about halfway through.

647
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,808
-You're about halfway through.
-Already?

648
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,277
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds left
in your 15 minutes.

649
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,813
GOOD VIBES TURN

650
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,882
FLUTTERING LIKE A FEATHER

651
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,785
He's pulling out the tortilla.

652
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,388
Already? I thought it took 20 minutes.
Is that okay?

653
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,123
It can't be ready…

654
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,190
It's not ready yet!

655
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,394
It's far from ready.
The color still looks the same.

656
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,430
You should raise the temperature.

657
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,266
HE CALMLY GOES BACK TO WHAT HE WAS DOING

658
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,635
What's he trying to make? I have no idea.

659
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,405
It's because he's yet to make
the main dish.

660
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,206
Things don't seem to be going smoothly.

661
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,909
Is he using the microwave option?

662
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,878
Cut it out. Stop bothering me.

663
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,980
HE THINKS EVERYTHING POONG SAYS IS A JOKE

664
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,848
Why am I seeing flashes in there?

665
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,985
-You're right.
-Right?

666
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:11,089
-I told you it was the microwave!
-He's using the microwave.

667
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,158
-Is he using the microwave option?
-He is.

668
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,361
He put metal objects
and used the microwave option.

669
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,897
Those metal cones will blow up!

670
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,765
You suddenly sound like Park Young-kyu.

671
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,600
"The metal's going to blow up!"

672
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,235
HE'S GOOD AT IMPERSONATIONS TOO

673
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,471
What's he making right now?

674
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,341
It's hard to tell what to expect
from his dish right now.

675
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,443
A BALL WITH THE RÉMOULADE

676
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,645
SWEET PUMPKIN

677
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,814
Jong-won uses cheese.

678
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,483
That's the cheese Yoona loves.

679
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,118
Cheese and sweet pumpkin?

680
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,287
3. MIX PUMPKIN, BRIE,
LEMON JUICE, OLIVE OIL, GREEK YOGURT

681
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,289
MIXING

682
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,858
6. PUT PUMPKIN BRIE ON PLASTIC WRAP
SMEARED WITH OLIVE OIL

683
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,060
-That looks really good.
-It does.

684
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,297
MAKING THE SECOND BALL
WITH THE SECOND FILLING

685
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,399
He's on a roll.

686
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,900
TURNING IT INTO A BALL

687
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,801
It looks nice.

688
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,739
It looks like he's paying
lots of attention on the presentation.

689
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,241
Chef Sung-jun isn't here
to make us laugh today.

690
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,375
You have 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

691
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,177
POURING TRIPLE BERRY JUICE ON A TRAY!

692
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,446
What's he doing?

693
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,583
What's that?

694
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,753
What's he doing?

695
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,721
He's cutting up rice paper.

696
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,091
Will he make a flower with that?

697
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,659
What's he going to do?

698
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,695
Will he deep-fry that?

699
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,298
It's a creative recipe,
something I've never seen before.

700
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,770
What's that? What's he making?
They're both focused on

701
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,873
crafting something instead of cooking.

702
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,742
-He's putting something on the paper.
-The raspberry rice.

703
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,344
HE FINALLY USES THE BLOOD RICE(?)

704
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,312
If you deep-fry that,

705
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,348
it'll blow up like this.

706
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,083
Will it look like a flower?

707
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,652
-Really? I see.
-I see.

708
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,655
Sung-ju, we're at five minutes.
Please report from the kitchen.

709
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,657
-Only five minutes?
-Let me report over there.

710
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,460
This is a round
between two true Girls' Generation fans.

711
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,229
GETTING READY TO MAKE THE FLOWER

712
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,532
INTO THE OIL!

713
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,134
FULL BLOOM

714
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,035
It looks pretty!

715
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,672
-It looks pretty.
-Hey, it looks pretty!

716
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,074
This was what he wanted to do.

717
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,510
You wanted to make this shape.

718
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,546
-You had a plan all along.
-I did.

719
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,548
100 POINTS FOR CREATIVITY

720
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,518
-That's new.
-It looks like a piece of art.

721
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,887
-So that happens with rice paper?
-Yes.

722
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,557
-The oil should've been hotter.
-He says it should've been hotter.

723
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,159
-Yes, I'll fry it again.
-Will you double fry it?

724
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,494
That was a test.

725
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,896
Let's see. What's Jong-won doing?

726
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,897
HE USES A PEACH

727
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,833
He's scooping the peach out.

728
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,868
Will he pull it out with his hands?

729
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,269
CHECK THE CONES AFTER 10 MINUTES!

730
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,305
-It must be hot.
-Isn't it hot?

731
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,073
THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT

732
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,041
ARE THESE READY?

733
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,210
Did the colors change?

734
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,744
-Is it ready?
-Is it ready, Jong-won?

735
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,913
It has to be ready by now.

736
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,049
-It looks so hot.
-It must be hot.

737
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,417
-That gets hot.
-He pulls it out.

738
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,385
It must've been heated up.

739
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,620
BARE HANDS ON HEATED METAL

740
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,589
He got two.

741
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,425
No, he has three. Three cones.

742
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,794
The cones must be the support.

743
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,865
HE PEELS THE PEACH
AND CUTS IT IN A HALF CIRCLE

744
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,634
He scooped it out with a teaspoon.

745
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,536
He's using all these.

746
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,638
He begins to dice the peach.

747
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,473
Let's see.

748
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,742
Is this tartar sauce?

749
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,777
What are you using this for?

750
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,981
-I'll fill it in the cone.
-It's the cone filling?

751
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,449
What's in here?

752
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,318
-I don't remember.
-You don't? Okay.

753
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,020
-Cucumber, celery…
-What's that?

754
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,756
Is that feta?

755
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:36,394
7. MIX ORANGE JUICE, FETA,
OLIVE OIL, AND CHOPPED ARUGULA

756
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,096
THE THIRD FILLING IS READY

757
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,566
This will be used as the flower filling.

758
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,769
Does it live up to its name, Son-phrodite?

759
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,505
Does it live up to its name, Son-phrodite?

760
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,973
TELL US YOUR THOUGHTS

761
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,209
-It does.
-Hey!

762
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,310
It does.

763
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,511
THE FLAVOR STANDS OUT TOO

764
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,713
-It's good.
-Is it good?

765
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,049
Something is chewy.

766
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,817
-It's whelk.
-Whelk.

767
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,319
-Whelk.
-Whelk.

768
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,955
I know Yoona will love this.

769
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,990
This was very delicious.

770
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,525
2ND TRY WITH THE FLOWER

771
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,527
Sung-jun is about to fry the flower again.

772
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,597
-That looks pretty!
-You did a great job.

773
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,767
-The flower looks great!
-It looks better than before.

774
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,736
It looks pretty.
The flower petals are bigger.

775
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,505
The flower blew up again.

776
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,440
Try that thing. The rice.

777
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,108
Yes, the rice.

778
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,344
-The rice.
-It's only for the presentation, though.

779
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,079
-Yes?
-I wonder if it tastes like anything.

780
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,415
Let me try this.

781
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,116
The blood pudding <i>sundae</i>.

782
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,253
Will it make S♡NE's wish come true?

783
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,190
-No, it won't.
-It won't?

784
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,458
It just tastes like rice.

785
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,027
-The raspberry didn't do much.
-Just rice.

786
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,229
It just tastes like rice.

787
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,598
-Are you squeezing something?
-I am.

788
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,301
-He squeezes an orange.
-An orange.

789
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,639
3. MIX ORANGE JUICE, BLACK PEPPER, SALT,
OLIVE OIL, AND BROTH TO MAKE DRESSING

790
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,342
Isn't that the cold jellyfish salad?

791
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,676
Cold jellyfish salad?

792
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,145
He's using all kinds of ingredients.

793
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,648
Sung-jun is using lots of whelk.

794
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,516
Whelk and olive oil.

795
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,420
They have 1 minute and 40 seconds left,
so we should start seeing stuff.

796
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,255
You have to speed it up.

797
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,423
TURNING

798
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,725
HE'S CALM EVEN WHEN HE'S BUSY

799
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,293
DRIED BEANS

800
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,363
That's how he's presenting the cones.

801
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,033
He's serving three different cones.

802
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,502
Cones in three different shapes

803
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,570
-and flavors.
-Three flavors.

804
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,141
-But they don't look like flowers.
-Whoa!

805
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,909
It just fell over!

806
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,246
It's falling over.
He dropped it on the beans.

807
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,882
Jong-won drops the filling.

808
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,585
-He just roared.
-I didn't do anything.

809
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,186
Why are you roaring at me?

810
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,955
You have under a minute left.

811
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,924
Cones in three different shapes
and flavors.

812
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,961
Three flavors.
He made three flavors for Yoona.

813
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,496
You have a minute left!

814
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,698
-Oh, no. Come on.
-One minute!

815
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,666
You have under a minute left.

816
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,237
Sung-jun fishes out the pasta.

817
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:02,707
He won't have enough time
to cool it and season it.

818
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,543
I agree. You have 45 seconds.

819
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,646
He said he'll make cold pasta,
so he has to serve it cold.

820
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,881
<i>Mantecare!</i>

821
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,316
Everything is splattering.

822
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,153
-You're doing it like this? What is this?
-Look at this.

823
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,754
Turn off the heat on the water.

824
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,156
Thirty seconds.

825
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,292
-What about this? Should I turn it off?
-Turn it off.

826
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,227
You don't have much time.

827
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,662
You must finish up quickly.

828
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,065
PONZU

829
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,200
You must hurry up.

830
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,736
He's topping those with something.

831
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,772
PUMPKIN AND BRIE, PEACH,
CABBAGE AND RÉMOULADE

832
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,941
-Jong-won's hands are trembling.
-He's in trouble.

833
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,143
Is he going to use flowers now?

834
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,912
What are these?

835
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,981
-I need to arrange the flowers.
-You don't have much time.

836
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,117
-Twenty seconds!
-Twenty seconds!

837
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,986
-Oh, no. This is crazy.
-No!

838
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,721
You must hurry. You don't have much time!

839
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,989
QUICKLY ADDING ORANGE ZEST

840
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,025
You must hurry. You don't have much time!

841
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,728
-They don't have much time.
-That's his presentation.

842
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,465
He's paying lots of attention
on how it looks.

843
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,867
-It looks sunny.
-That's pretty.

844
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,669
-You have eleven seconds!
-Ten!

845
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:08,106
-Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.
-Nine. Eight. Seven.

846
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,575
-Ten. Nine. Eight.
-Nine. Eight.

847
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,410
-Seven.
-Seven.

848
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,479
-You have eleven seconds!
-Ten!

849
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,547
-Nine. Eight.
-Nine. Eight.

850
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,616
-Seven. Six.
-Seven. Six.

851
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,052
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

852
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,221
-Three.
-I'm done.

853
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,491
-Three. Two. One.
-Three. Two. One.

854
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:30,027
-Time's up! Jong-won finishes first.
-Jong-won finishes first.

855
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,329
Can you grab it?

856
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,965
-Sung-jun finishes too.
-It's pretty.

857
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,868
THE PRESENTATION BATTLE WAS FIERCE

858
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,002
These look amazing.

859
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,737
ARE THESE FLOWERS OR FOOD?

860
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,007
THEY SERVE DISHES
WITH PERFECT PRESENTATION

861
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,276
Look at these.

862
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,745
Please push the table carefully.

863
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,047
Flower versus flower.

864
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,682
Real flower versus handmade flower.

865
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,885
-Yes.
-My gosh.

866
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,620
Goodness.

867
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,421
They did this in 15 minutes.

868
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,958
Now I understand
why people show such responses.

869
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,461
I saw many of them go, "Oh, my gosh!"

870
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:07,498
"That's so cool!
You really did this in 15 minutes!"

871
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,367
I finally get it.

872
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:14,639
Both dishes were finished just for Yoona.

873
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:18,142
-Does it feel sunny?
-Very much. I love it.

874
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,311
-They do look pretty.
-They do.

875
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:24,348
I hope they're as delicious as they look.

876
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,619
First, please try
Chef Jong-won's Son-phrodite.

877
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,221
AMONG CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN FULL BLOOM

878
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:36,594
SIT THREE DIFFERENT TORTILLA CONES

879
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,698
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S SON-PHRODITE

880
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,135
Gosh, this feels really nice.

881
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,071
This dish was made just for her.

882
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,040
He made a trip to the flower shop too.

883
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:52,243
It also looks like
a flower painting made by an artist.

884
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,411
"SON-PHRODITE" BY SON JONG-WON

885
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,745
How should she eat this?

886
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,215
You'll probably see a yellowish cone.

887
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,850
It's a mix of sweet pumpkin and Brie.

888
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,186
Please think of that as an appetizer.

889
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,421
There's a main dish here?

890
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,422
There is.

891
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,724
There's a certain main dish
among the three cones.

892
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,792
This is the appetizer.

893
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,461
Pick it up like an ice cream cone.

894
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,863
-Right.
-I see. Like an ice cream cone.

895
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,566
She pulled it out.

896
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,068
Like this.

897
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,137
-She takes a bite.
-That looks about right.

898
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,272
CRUNCHY

899
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,140
-It sounds crunchy.
-It's crunchy.

900
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,509
-It sounds crunchy.
-She eats it in a bite.

901
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,279
She raises her appetite with that.

902
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,915
She's slowly showing a smile.

903
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,417
Wouldn't it feel like
dining on a flower bed?

904
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,919
-I think I get it.
-My mouth was

905
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,722
filled with the taste of Brie.

906
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,158
The mild taste filled up my mouth.

907
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,361
<i>It tastes so mild and savory.</i>

908
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,596
I've never had these two together,

909
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,831
but it's really good.

910
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,499
The appetizer was a success.

911
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,701
-What's the main cone?
-The main cone was made

912
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,770
by parboiling cabbage.

913
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,107
<i>-I also chopped some whelk into it too.</i>
<i>-The one I tried before.</i>

914
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,809
Yes, I mixed it with rémoulade.

915
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,411
-Is this it?
-Yes.

916
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,314
This is it. This is the main dish.

917
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,850
-It's like ice cream.
-It looks intentionally melted.

918
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,585
-Ice cream.
-Like melted gelato.

919
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,188
It looks like an ice cream cone,
but it's not ice cream.

920
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:15,359
He used whelk
as the key seafood for this one.

921
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,095
Was that the texture you wanted?

922
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,965
The whelk is chewy and soft.

923
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,702
<i>And the sauce he made</i>
<i>with mayonnaise and sriracha is</i>

924
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:28,039
also had the perfect amount of spiciness.

925
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,075
He must've taken
the spiciness into consideration.

926
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,244
Another aspect also feels intentional.

927
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,179
<i>She has to lower her face into the bowl</i>

928
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,947
<i>to pull out the cone.</i>

929
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:41,852
So I think he wanted her
to smell the flowers as she enjoyed those.

930
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,354
-Those real flowers.
-Yes.

931
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,091
-It's like finding treasure in a garden.
-Something like that.

932
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,292
He had a reason.

933
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,629
-What if he hid a ring inside?
-That'd be rad.

934
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,365
You're right.
Wait, rad? No one says that now.

935
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,069
What about it?
Rad means that it's awesome.

936
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,637
-Well, it's true.
-Yes.

937
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,174
The last cone was made
with peach and feta.

938
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,509
A CONE MADE WITH PEACH AND FETA

939
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:09,380
-Is that like dessert?
-Not really, but a refreshment.

940
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,582
-This one.
-She'll try the last one.

941
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,617
That one looks so cute.

942
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,652
HOW CUTE

943
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,188
-This will be the most decisive.
-Yes.

944
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,190
The sizes were perfect.

945
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,425
Lastly, the refreshment.

946
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,993
WHAT'S THE LAST CONE LIKE?

947
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,396
-Mmm.
-Mmm?

948
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,597
GASP!

949
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:31,068
-Was the last one quite different?
-Did it pop in your mouth?

950
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,471
-The fillings were all different.
-Yes.

951
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,973
<i>-I dressed the peach with orange juice</i>
<i>-In the cone…</i>

952
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,541
<i>and gave it a twist.</i>

953
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,544
It's definitely refreshing.

954
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:44,148
It clears my palate
with a mix of cheese and fruit.

955
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,483
RELIEVED

956
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,752
Have you found a ring?

957
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,590
No.

958
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,791
No.

959
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,461
-I was hoping to see a three-carat ring.
-Right.

960
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,897
It would've been awesome
even if he threw in a fake one.

961
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,833
SHE'S STILL AMAZED

962
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,835
-Was it well-balanced?
-Yes.

963
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,873
It felt like I had a course meal.

964
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,442
-He made a three-course meal like that?
-Right?

965
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,710
Let's continue.

966

<i>Pasta by S♡NE</i>

SERVED WITH REFRESHING COLD SEAFOOD PASTA

969
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,858
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S PASTA BY S♡NE

970
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,261
-Please allow me to set it up.
-Sung-jun walks over.

971
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,563
-He made that flower.
-He did.

972
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,597
Sooyoung's Hubby.

973
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,534
Sooyoung's Hubby.

974
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,803
-All right.
-What do you have to do?

975
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,971
What? Jeez.

976
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:45,309
I served it on a mirror-shaped tray.

977
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,345
-Are you using a mirror as a tray?
-I am.

978
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,850
I wondered what I should serve it on
to give it heavenly visuals,

979
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:53,918
and concluded

980
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,988
that Yoona's face in the mirror
as she eats was the answer.

981
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,891
Nothing would be more beautiful.

982
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,860
I agree.

983
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,763
I couldn't find anything else
other than a mirror.

984
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,266
-That was a cliché, yet it was moving.
-You can't win against him.

985
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,370
HERE'S THE HEAVENLY VISUALS

986
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:17,374
-Also, it's the Girls' Generation color.
-It's pink.

987
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,845
-So I wondered if that was the case.
-You're right.

988
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:25,749
-I didn't think he'd be so detailed.
-He adds great details.

989
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,852
I'm not like that fake fan.

990
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,386
PROUD AS THE ORIGINAL STAN

991
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,823
Break the flower and have it
with pasta, sauce, and seafood.

992
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,192
-She has to break the flower?
-I have to break this too?

993
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,561
-What a shame. It looks so pretty.
-What a shame.

994
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:41,365
Please break the flower
and have it with the pasta.

995
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,702
THE FLOWER BREAKS EASILY

996
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,271
-And the pasta.
-The cold pasta.

997
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,906
It's made with whelk and shrimp.

998
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,007
-Whelk and shrimp?
-And squid.

999
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,408
-And squid, right?
-And squid.

1000
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,945
-A piece of whelk.
-She grabbed a whelk.

1001
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,081
Let me try it now.

1002
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,148
All right. Please try it.

<i>Pasta by S♡NE</i>

1005
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,955
It looked pretty.

1006
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,991
I made it taste refreshing.

1007
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,126
She doesn't like spicy food.

1008
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,263
It's the kind of sauce I love.

1009
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,198
-I see.
-It's refreshing,

1010
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,367
and it goes well with seafood.

1011
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,770
The orange sauce
also adds to that fresh taste.

1012
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,338
PHEW

1013
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,775
And this crunchy flower is
a nice part of the dish.

1014
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,443
-So it plays a part?
-Yes.

1015
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,711
A NEW, CRUNCHY TEXTURE

1016
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,347
It may not have been seasoned properly.

1017
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,085
-It must taste refreshing with orange.
-Yes.

1018
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,222
It's very delicious.

always guaranteed.

Napoli Yoon Nam-no?

1021
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,396
It doesn't taste too bland.

1022
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,731
I think it's perfectly fitting.

1023
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,533
BOTH DISHES LOOKED AND TASTED GREAT

1024
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,601
That's Sung-jun.

1025
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:55,339
Sung-jun's wig became crooked
after cooking for a while,

1026
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,808
so he looks like a reenactment actor.

1027
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,444
Like Surprise Mystery TV on the M network.

1028
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,279
You're right. He was too into it.

1029
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,114
He's like Tony from <i>Surprise Mystery TV.</i>

1030
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,117
Can you fix his wig?

1031
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,486
He's having a rough day.

1032
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,956
It's time for you to make your choice.

1033
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,792
Yoona is the only one who can do that.

1034
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,294
Which one of them had a sunnier taste?

1035
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,897
-Press one for Son Jong-won.
-One for Jong-won.

1036
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,799
-This is so hard.
-Right?

1037
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,634
Press two for Kwon Sung-jun.

1038
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:29,106
Jong-won began to like Girls' Generation
when he served in the military in 2007.

1039
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:34,311
Sung-jun was a huge fan of theirs
even before the fan site opened.

1040
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,246
Although he was nicknamed
Sooyoung's Hubby,

1041
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,848
but he got to meet Yoona today

1042
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,185
and had such a blessed time
to cook just for her.

1043
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,252
So?

1044
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,557
Yoona is still torn. She doesn't know.

1045
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,691
She feels bad.

1046
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,426
-Did you press one?
-Did you?

1047
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,828
-It's just me, right?
-Of course.

1048
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:54,698
Who else is going to do that?
Those dishes weren't for us.

1049
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,634
-Okay.
-Did you press one?

1050
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,502
-Yes.
-She did.

1051
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,604
-It must've been hard.
-She pressed one.

1052
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,240
Let's find out the result.

1053
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,176
Sunny day: heavenly visuals.

1054
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:11,048
Chef Sung-jun had to change his hairstyle
after losing against Nam-no.

1055
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,550
Chef Jong-won has already lost
three times in a row.

1056
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,686
He's dying to seize a victory.

1057
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:19,823
Which one of them did Yoona choose?

1058
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,925
Who'll get the star?

1059
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,729
-To whom did Yoona give her star?
-The star!

1060
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,099
Who's the winner?

1061
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,934
SON JONG-WON WINS

1062
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,370
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S SON-PHRODITE WINS

1063
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,140
Chef Jong-won wins!

1064
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,741
JONG-WON TAKES VICTORY

1065
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,078
Jong-won wins.

1066
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,214
He finally breaks his losing streak.

1067
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,484
Yoona is now staring into the mirror.

1068
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,888
She feels bad and looks at Sung-jun.

1069
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:54,291
This mirror was
such a witty addition for me.

1070
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,527
-Did it make you feel good?
-It really did.

1071
00:44:56,593 --> 00:45:00,297
But Chef Jong-won's dish
made me feel like I had a course meal,

1072
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,902
so it felt like I was gifted
with both great presentation and flavor.

1073
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,039
-That's why. Gosh.
-Gosh.

1074
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,608
-You could only choose one.
-Yes.

1075
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,278
Jong-won must be glad
that he made the flower run.

1076
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,746
Let's hear a word from him.

1077
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,384
First of all, I know Sung-jun is
a huge fan, so I felt a little bad.

1078
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,619
But a true Girls' Generation fan

1079
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,822
would be happy to have cooked for Yoona.

1080
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,527
Listen to his words.
The apron must've come with a tongue.

1081
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,897
-Thanks for the apron.
-The apron must've played a part.

1082
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,365
There must be something to it.

1083
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,167
Did you hear that?

1084
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,170
I'll always remain
a Girls' Generation fan,

1085
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,106
especially as Sooyoung's Hubby.

1086
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,807
HE'LL RETURN AS SOOYOUNG'S HUBBY

1087
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:48,112
-I'll continue to keep that nickname.
-That's cold.

1088
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,747
-He's cold.
-I'm sorry.

1089
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,783
Everything is a business to him.

1090
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,452
Please put a star on Chef Jong-won.

1091
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,020
-Sure.
-Yoona's star.

1092
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,689
JONG-WON WINS A STAR

1093
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,694
-He gets a star from Yoona. Congrats!
-Congratulations!

1094
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,629
Congratulations!

1095
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,266
Look at Sung-jun. What a shame.

1096
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:13,604
<i>This is the second round of cook-off</i>
<i>with ingredients from Yoona's fridge.</i>

1097
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,574
Her order is titled,
"Deep night: evil temptation."

1098
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,110
The moves from the darkness,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong,

1099
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:24,214
is up against the wicked dance moves,
Chef Jung Ho-young.

1100
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,616
THE BATTLE OF THE DEVILS(?)

1101
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,385
Not only that, they also want to decide

1102
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,155
which one of them is
the best dancer of the show.

1103
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,322
THE BEST DANCER

1104
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,357
They announced it.

1105
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:37,694
That's right. Chef Ho-young was
the original dancer of the show,

1106
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:41,732
but he always gets nervous
whenever he's up against Poong.

1107
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,135
When Mimi was on the show,

1108
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,838
<i>not only was it sad</i>
<i>that I lost the cook-off,</i>

1109
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,740
<i>but he even danced better than I did.</i>

1110
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,442
I can't even dance better.

1111
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,680
I've even wondered
if I should continue to be on the show.

1112
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,248
It was a huge blow.

1113
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,217
You can lose in the cook-off,

1114
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,386
but you can't lose the dance-off?

1115
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,521
Why are you on the show?

1116
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,889
HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT HIS CHARACTER

1117
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:10,928
Yoona and Bo-hyun are wondering
how often they must've danced

1118
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,030
for everyone to talk so much about this.

1119
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:17,734
Who's going to be
the main dancer of the show?

1120
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,671
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS: GRANA PADANO,
SQUID, SRIRACHA, PORK BELLY, MANCHEGO

1121
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,739
STRIP LOIN, WHELK, ARUGULA, SPAGHETTI,
SHRIMP, BRIE, GALBI MARINADE, AND MORE

1122
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,875
What are you making today?

1123
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,543
My dish is called…

1124
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,847
<i>Poong? Gee, Gee, Gee, Gee, Baby, Baby</i>

1125
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,748
<i>Gee, Gee, Gee, Gee, Baby, Baby</i>

1126
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,350
SO EMBARRASSING

1127
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,652
<i>Gee, Gee, Gee, Gee, Baby, Baby</i>

1128
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,988
<i>Gee, Gee, Gee, Gee, Baby, Baby</i>

1129
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,757
Wait, did you spit something on the floor?

1130
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,292
-Did you spit?
-"Gee"?

1131
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,795
-Are you rubbing something?
-"Baby, baby."

1132
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,064
DEEPLY MOVED

1133
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,901
Poong's dish makes you say, "Gee,"
in a bad way, so don't eat it.

1134
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:54,705
I also wanted to show that
I'll win and make him go, "Gee."

1135
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,406
That's why I named it like this.

1136
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,208
My dish is

1137
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:02,980
<i>Naporitan</i> pasta,
a pasta dish made with ketchup.

1138
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,581
It's a familiar taste

1139
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,651
yet it's very strong,
so I'll make that pasta.

1140
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,588
I'll also use strip loin and pork belly
to make hamburger steak.

1141
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,891
She said she liked Brie,

1142
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,227
so I'll deep-fry Brie
and serve it between the patties

1143
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,896
and make the richest dish

1144
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:24,234
-she won't be able to stop eating.
-I see.

1145
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,170
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
RICE PAPER, MILK, GALBI MARINADE, TSUYU

1146
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,239
WATERMELON, LEMON JUICE,
OYSTER SAUCE, SHRIMP, PORK BELLY

1147
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,842
What are you making, Webtoon Artist Poong?

1148
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,980
-Today, my dish
-Look at that.

1149
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,949
-is titled…
-Is titled?

1150
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,022
IN SHOCK

1151
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,090
BUT HE TURNED IT DARK AND EVIL

1152
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,959
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG:
KILLING YOU, BABY

1153
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,227
I LOST…

1154
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,962
Killing you? Not kissing you?

1155
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,097
-Yes.
-That was feisty.

1156
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,365
Doesn't he make you feel dizzy?

1157
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,134
-My gosh.
-What's it like?

1158
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,836
"Kissing You" is such a classic.

1159
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,371
-It's a classic of its time.
-It's great.

1160
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,306
Well today,

1161
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:06,510
I'm going to make a lollipop.

1162
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,378
-A lollipop?
-A lollipop?

1163
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,814
-You'll make a lollipop?
-Yes, the shape.

1164
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,050
I'll make the lollipop look like

1165
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,619
-the shape of tripe.
-Dang it. Come on.

1166
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:16,920
WHAT?

1167
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:21,358
-It's similar to tripe, actually.
-The shape of tripe?

1168
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,161
-Like this.
-I'll spin it around like a tripe dish.

1169
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,163
She also said she liked seasonal fruit,

1170
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,465
so I'll make watermelon soup
as the appetizer.

1171
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,801
Watermelon soup? Will it be served hot?

1172
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:34,037
-Yes, it'll be served warm.
-Watermelon soup?

1173
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,806
It's the worst.

1174
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,908
I think it'll be another good one.

1175
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,710
So what's your dish called?

1176
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,882
What a disciplined dancer.

1177
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,052
-Look at how sharp his moves are.
-Of course.

1178
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,521
Would you like another chance, Ho-young?

1179
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,790
HIS WINNING MOVE, THE CRAB DANCE!

1180
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,692
ABSORBS HIS DANCE MOVES RIGHT AWAY

1181
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,696
-He lost again.
-He's good.

1182
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,234
I apologize for asking,
but which one of them was a bit better?

1183
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,437
I think the one who had
sharper and more accurate moves was

1184
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,073
-probably Poong.
-Right?

1185
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,110
But Ho-young's dance keeps growing on me.

1186
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,345
-You feel a little bad.
-Yes.

1187
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,115
-I want to keep rooting for him.
-I see.

1188
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,118
Bo-hyun. You didn't expect this, did you?

1189
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:25,389
-No, I didn't expect I'd cry.
-You were crying.

1190
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,958
-It was shocking.
-Our chefs are very talented.

1191
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,094
I need another stove,
so may I use one of Poong's?

1192
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,064
-What?
-You two have to talk first.

1193
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,799
You didn't even ask for my permission.

1194
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,403
-You won the dance, so let me have this.
-All right.

1195
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:44,341
It's time to fill Yoona's order,
"Deep night: evil temptation."

1196
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,543
He's here to put Poong back to his place

1197
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:51,248
and make him go, "Gee, gee, gee gee"
as Hyoyeon of the show.

1198
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,383
Chef Jung Ho-young is up for the cook-off.

1199
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,887
But his opponent is ready
to bring him down into the pit of evil.

1200
00:50:56,953 --> 00:51:00,791
The devil of the show,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong is up.

1201
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:05,629
Which one of them will successfully
tempt Yoona with the evil dish?

1202
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:10,834
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1203
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,938
-Begin!
-All right!

1204
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,174
The talent from the darkness.

1205
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,276
It's now the evil generation.

1206
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,079
-Please wipe your tears off.
-Thank you.

1207
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:25,348
This is Ho-young and Poong's battle.

1208
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,750
All right.

1209
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:31,088
Poong will need some fillings
to make something shaped like tripe.

1210
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,356
Hey, he's not making chili oil today.

1211
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,293
-That's always the first thing he makes.
-You're right.

1212
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,361
He always begins by making chili oil.

1213
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,563
He's making some seasoning.

1214
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,231
He's using pork belly.

1215
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,567
What? What's he doing?

1216
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,235
He's removing the fat.

1217
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,771
So is it just meat now?

1218
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,606
-Are you using just the fat?
-Yes.

1219
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,442
JUST THE FAT?

1220
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,944
-He's using just the fat.
-He's evil.

1221
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,679
Yoona was startled.

1222
00:51:55,745 --> 00:52:00,650
The good ones use the meat,
but the evil ones use only the fat.

1223
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,087
The good ones use the meat,
but the evil ones use only the fat.

1224
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:08,058
He's mixing shrimp and pork fat to make
something similar to dumpling filling.

1225
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,926
If you blend shrimp with pork fat,

1226
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,762
it'll turn into chewy
and firm shrimp balls.

1227
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,197
Galbi marinade.

1228
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,832
Galbi marinade from Saipan.

1229
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,902
Yes, the one she got
from an acquaintance in Saipan.

1230
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,438
-Smells like Saipan.
-The galbi marinade.

1231
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,906
Oyster sauce?

1232
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,175
He just added a spoonful of evil sauce.

1233
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,513
This must be the filling for his tripe.

1234
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,781
We were just reached out
by the production crew.

1235
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:35,452
Many viewers in grade school are
flocking in front of TV right now.

1236
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,222
Kids love this battle.

1237
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,258
He's using pasta.

1238
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,193
ONION

1239
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,428
HE ALSO STARTS WITH A BLENDER

1240
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,230
What are you grinding, Ho-young?

1241
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,600
I'm mixing strip loin, pork belly,
and one blue egg.

1242
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,935
The hamburger steak.

1243
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,105
2. MAKE HAMBURGER STEAK PATTY

1244
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,440
-Are you grinding those?
-Yes, to make the hamburger patty.

1245
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,975
He has to make the patty.

1246
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,913
He's already cooking the hamburger steak.

1247
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,247
He's moving so quickly.

1248
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,248
IN 1 MINUTE AND A HALF!

1249
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,119
Chef Ho-young's recipe looks
rather more gentle than I expected.

1250
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,055
He does things the textbook way.
The textbook recipe.

1251
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,324
SHRIMP

1252
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,492
WHELK

1253
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,060
Ho-young uses squid too.

1254
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,729
Yes, squid, shrimp, and whelk.

1255
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,498
-He's making cuts.
-He's very fast.

1256
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,934
-Ho-young makes cuts.
-Yes.

1257
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,371
Ho-young is using five stoves,
and Poong needs only three.

1258
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,473
STIR-FRIED SEAFOOD,
HAMBURGER STEAK, SPAGHETTI

1259
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,243
POONG HAD BEEN GRINDING
PORK FAT AND SHRIMP

1260
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,312
Don't you need to add starch?

1261
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,480
-Did he eat that raw?
-He's evil.

1262
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,782
He just tasted the mix.

1263
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,084
POONG THE DEVIL ENJOYS RAW FOOD

1264
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:45,355
He's like Choi Min-sik in <i>I Saw the Devil.</i>

1265
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,489
Ugh!

1266
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,326
He was like Choi Min-sik in the film.

1267
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,493
That's it.

1268
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,628
2. FILL A PIPING BAG WITH THE FILLING

1269
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,330
He just ground everything.

1270
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,498
Poong is really good when he's up there.

1271
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,534
RUSTLING

1272
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,337
What's that?

1273
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,939
-He's washing something.
-Washing what?

1274
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,041
WHAT'S THAT LAUNDRY?

1275
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,177
-What's that, Poong?
-Waxed paper.

1276
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,079
-What paper?
-Waxed paper.

1277
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,080
Can you eat that?

1278
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,082
Can you eat waxed paper?

1279
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,149
Are you making tripe?

1280
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,284
-You can't.
-You can't, right?

1281
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,619
-No, right?
-It's paper.

1282
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,655
How is he going to make tripe?

1283
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,058
I think Poong is up to no good.

1284
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,461
-Is that rice paper?
-It is.

1285
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,264
-What will he do with that?
-What's he going to do?

1286
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,866
-It's hard to tell what the devil makes.
-Right?

1287
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,501
-The devil?
-Yes.

1288
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:36,373
He even reminds me
of Gargamel in <i>The Smurfs.</i>

1289
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,540
You're right,

1290
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,579
BUTTER

1291
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,382
Chef Ho-young is making roux.

1292
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,716
Roux?

1293
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,551
-Are you making roux, Ho-young?
-Yes.

1294
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,621
-Or is that béchamel?
-Béchamel.

1295
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,492
-He's adding cheese.
-Cheese.

1296
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,027
Ho-young adds lots of cheese.

1297
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:01,431
Béchamel mixed with cheese
makes something called Mornay sauce.

1298
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,734
I think that's the sauce
for hamburger steak.

1299
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,470
-Gosh.
-It sounds good.

1300
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,674
-Chef Ho-young uses a lot of cheese.
-Cheese.

1301
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,009
Isn't that too much?

1302
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,111
-That's a lot.
-And onion.

1303
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,547
-He's that spiteful.
-Yes.

1304
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,083
-Lots of cheese can make a dish evil.
-Yes.

1305
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,120
A WICKED SAUCE!

1306
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,488
WHAT ABOUT THE HAMBURGER STEAK?

1307
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:26,589
The hamburger steak.

1308
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,391
IT LOOKS WICKEDLY GOOD!

1309
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,226
The <i>Naporitan</i> pasta.

1310
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:32,796
SRIRACHA

1311
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,365
Ho-young made something
that looks really red.

1312
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,367
This means…

1313
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,670
-Yoona said she couldn't eat spicy food.
-No.

1314
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,672
PIPING BAG

1315
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,275
PORK FAT AND SHRIMP MIX GOES INTO THE BAG

1316
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,710
SNIP

1317
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,012
-Poong's doing something now.
-He's doing it.

1318
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,781
-He begins to squeeze out the filling.
-The tripe filling.

1319
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,320
I already have a bad feeling about this.

1320
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,589
TEARS OF JOY

1321
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,157
WE'VE SEEN THIS DISH BEFORE!

1322
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,159
It feels like another loach dish.

1323
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,595
-This was how he made the loaches.
-I saw that.

1324
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,497
-You did?
-Yes.

1325
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,399
Goodness. What is this?

1326
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,568
-We'll have to flush it down.
-We do.

1327
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,470
It got stuck!

1328
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,338
-It's stuck!
-Everything's stuck!

1329
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,907
-Do I have to eat that with paper?
-This is bad.

1330
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,242
Will you roll it with the paper?

1331
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,277
Just like that. He just folded it in half.

1332
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,379
Will it work?

1333
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,116
-Whoa, it did.
-It worked!

1334
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,951
-It worked.
-It worked?

1335
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,285
OH!

1336
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,154
-It turned out well.
-Jeez.

1337
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,489
He got what he needed.

1338
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,990
He puts lots of work into tripe.

1339
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,293
Please.

1340
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,695
Wait a second.

1341
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,498
Yoona just turned her head away.

1342
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,032
She can't watch this anymore.

1343
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,335
THE MAJESTIC MOMENT OF ITS BIRTH

1344
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,504
He grabs it and pulls it up!

1345
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,339
She can't watch this.

1346
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,740
THE MYSTERY OF LIFE
UNFOLDS BEFORE EVERYONE'S EYES

1347
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:51,808
IN AWE

1348
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,510
He grabs it and pulls it up!

1349
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,345
Wait a moment, Poong.

1350
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,715
-I can't watch this.
-This is just… No, right?

1351
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,884
-Don't let it fall apart.
-It's…

1352
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,153
WATCHING THE HISTORIC MOMENT IN SILENCE

1353
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,121
He begins to roll it up.

1354
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,389
It's the lollipop.

1355
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,359
-How is that a lollipop?
-That's not a lollipop.

1356
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,062
-<i>Du-du-ru du-du-du</i>
-Is that the lollipop?

1357
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,565
<i>Du-du-ru du-du-du</i>
<i>Kissing you, baby</i>

1358
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,233
Is that the lollipop?

1359
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,837
-<i>Du-du-ru du-du-du</i>
-Wait a second. Is it just… It's…

1360
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,672
4. CAST A DARK SPELL AND SUMMON A LOLLIPOP

1361
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,308
I think he'll roast it in a pan.

1362
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:29,446
Yes, it does look like tripe.
It has that shape.

1363
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,048
-That's what you get at a tripe place.
-Yes.

1364
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,318
-It looks like tripe.
-He's stealing the oil.

1365
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,386
Jeez.

1366
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,321
5. ROAST THE LOLLIPOP TRIPE IN A PAN

1367
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,923
It looks a little…

1368
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,358
He put it in a pan.

1369
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:46,563
What's Chef Ho-young doing now?

1370
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,664
Is that a stew?

1371
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,665
Spicy stir-fried pork.

1372
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,634
-Pasta.
-Is that pasta? The pasta sauce?

1373
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,070
-He used ketchup.
-He did, didn't he?

1374
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,606
-He said he'd use ketchup.
-Ketchup and tomato sauce.

1375
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,641
And some ground black pepper.

1376
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,577
NAPORITAN PASTA SAUCE

1377
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,346
Hamburger steak and pasta.

1378
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,616
Ho-young's dish looks really good.

1379
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,320
INTO THE CAST IRON PAN

1380
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,222
Ho-young is using five stoves.

1381
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,457
Poong begins to work with watermelon.

1382
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:17,293
He's going to make watermelon soup.

1383
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,596
Are you going to blend that
and just boil it?

1384
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,698
I'll make roux and boil it with that.

1385
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:24,067
-You'll make roux?
-Roux and watermelon?

1386
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,035
You're mixing roux and watermelon?

1387
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,337
It sounds weird.

1388
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:28,938
HORRIFIED

1389
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,574
Is he… Is that butter?

1390
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,209
-Is that butter?
-It is.

1391
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,044
-He's making roux.
-It's for the roux.

1392
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,580
-Is it different from Ho-young's sauce?
-It's the same.

1393
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:41,351
-The difference is cheese or watermelon.
-Cheese or watermelon.

1394
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,121
You have about six minutes left.

1395
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,156
Let's check on the tripe.

1396
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,791
-Check on the tripe?
-The tripe?

1397
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,061
You'll have to eat that, Yoona.

1398
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,931
-You have to try it. Hey.
-Whoa.

1399
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,566
It looks good after you flipped it.

1400
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,167
-It's golden brown.
-Yes.

1401
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,037
-It looks like grilled tripe.
-Grilled tripe.

1402
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:05,275
Poong is yet on another journey.

1403
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,744
-No!
-Look at the presentation.

1404
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,313
8. STRAIN WATERMELON JUICE
AND BOIL WITH ROUX

1405
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,616
He's mixing roux and watermelon juice.

1406
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,753
-That's insane.
-He's serving this warm?

1407
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:20,890
This is a kind of recipe
that chefs would never use.

1408
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:24,561
-Why did you use the strainer?
-Why did you need that?

1409
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,797
-I tested it out first.
-Why did you need the strainer?

1410
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:29,232
He tried to get the seeds out.

1411
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,468
-Because of the seeds.
-The seeds.

1412
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,337
SUCH A WICKED COLOR…

1413
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,538
What's that color?

1414
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,440
WILL THIS SOUP TURN OUT OKAY?
ADDING SUGAR

1415
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,474
Sugar?

1416
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,077
TAPPING

1417
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,946
7. MAKE FRIED EGGS WITH BLUE EGGS

1418
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,615
Ho-young's hamburger steak.

1419
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:49,586
His food also shows very strong colors.

1420
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,321
-It's red.
-Yes.

1421
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,956
RED AND BLACK, LIKE THE DEVIL…

1422
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,023
Okay.

1423
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,160
Poong looks very confident.

1424
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,829
-The oil is splattering.
-Gosh.

1425
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,831
Are you steaming it or frying it?

1426
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,166
I'm pan-frying it.

1427
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,902
-Pan-frying.
-Pan-frying.

1428
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,438
<i>Like pan-frying, baby baby</i>

1429
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,907
<i>Like pan-frying, baby baby</i>

1430
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,309
You have five minutes left.

1431
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,779
Jung-hwan, please go out.
You were too into this.

1432
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:19,949
-Please check on their progress.
-I had fallen into these evil dishes.

1433
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,351
I was too captivated.

1434
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,354
-You have a lot of things to try.
-Yes.

1435
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,890
-Jung-hwan, do you see that pot?
-Which one?

1436
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,393
-That one.
-Where's the…

1437
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,096
-What's this?
-The frying batter for Brie.

1438
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,765
He's deep-frying a thick slice of Brie.

1439
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,233
-A thick slice of Brie.
-A whole slice.

1440
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,936
-It'll taste wickedly good.
-Yes.

1441
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,638
How about Poong's watermelon soup?

1442
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,240
-He's blending it right now.
-The watermelon soup.

1443
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,209
THE TASTE IS UNIMAGINABLE!

1444
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,045
Try the watermelon soup. So?

1445
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:50,546
CHUCKLING

1446
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,882
So?

1447
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,717
Why did you make this
and make my life so hard?

1448
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,420
It's my first time trying watermelon soup.

1449
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,024
I've never had watermelon soup,
but let me try this one.

1450
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,960
-He'll serve it warm.
-It's still warm.

1451
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:07,063
So? What's watermelon soup like?

1452
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,032
Do you want to sing, "Kissing you, baby"?

1453
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,801
Or is it, "Killing you, baby"?
What's it like?

1454
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,774
-It's good!
-What?

1455
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,876
At first, I didn't realize it,

1456
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,512
-but I can taste the watermelon later.
-Really?

1457
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,414
It's kind of sweet.

1458
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,016
It's good. It's not that bad.

1459
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,185
-I personally want him to boil it down.
-I will.

1460
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,187
-It's not so bad.
-I can't believe it.

1461
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,223
-It's similar to sweet pumpkin soup.
-Really?

1462
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,458
I can kind of taste it.

1463
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,294
-Aren't you curious, viewers?
-That's impossible.

1464
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,630
-That's such a wonder.
-I'm curious.

1465
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,465
He's such a genius.

1466
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,935
That's something chefs can
never come up with.

1467
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,207
HE'S DONE FRYING A WHOLE SLICE OF BRIE

1468
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,644
A BURNING HOT CAST IRON PAN

1469
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,512
NAPORITAN PASTA GOES UP!

1470
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,580
Gosh.

1471
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,915
The <i>Naporitan</i> pasta…

1472
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,551
LOTS OF SAUCE

1473
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,553
ARUGULA

1474
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,023
-He already finished making pasta.
-He did.

1475
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,727
-Where's the hamburger steak?
-Do you see what he's stirring?

1476
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,228
He threw lots of cheese in here.

1477
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,831
Check and see how much cheese
he used for this sauce.

1478
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,366
This is going to clog up my veins.

1479
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,802
This is Ho-young's evil temptation.

1480
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:23,539
He put in way too much cheese,
much more than needed.

1481
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,175
AND HE POURS IT!

1482
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,245
Try some sauce.

1483
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,314
And he's serving
hamburger steak on the sauce!

1484
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,950
SUCH AN EVIL COMBINATION!

1485
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,985
-My gosh.
-That's a lot of sauce.

1486
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,287
-I wanted something like this.
-The fried cheese.

1487
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,824
STAY STRONG! CHEESE IS HERE

1488
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,192
The fried cheese.

1489
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,560
One more patty!

1490
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,262
THE SECOND HAMBURGER STEAK

1491
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,165
He's using patties as buns.

1492
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,702
He put a fried cheese slice
between two patties.

1493
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:58,007
-This looks so wicked. How can this be?
-That's a lot.

1494
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,811
-It looks so crazy.
-Poong is falling behind a little.

1495
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,980
He's adding more cheese.

1496
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,348
GRANA PADANO

1497
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,617
-This is crazy.
-It is.

1498
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,786
Ho-young looks focused.

1499
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,622
It looks like he threw away
his ethics as a chef.

1500
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,257
-He just got something out.
-The tripe!

1501
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,492
-He took it off the heat.
-It's been cooked well.

1502
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,061
-All done.
-He just mumbled that it's done.

1503
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,396
Is that a ribbon?

1504
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,298
What's your plan?

1505
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,666
He has a ribbon.

1506
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,668
You're adding a fried egg on top of that?

1507
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:28,104
Ho-young tops the dish with a fried egg.

1508
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,974
-The egg yolk drizzles as we speak!
-Look at that thing!

1509
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,543
-It was intentional.
-It was intentional!

1510
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,012
EVERYTHING IS GOING AS PLANNED!

1511
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,247
Are you doing okay?
Ho-young finishes as I speak!

1512
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,383
Ho-young finishes
with 1 minute and 25 seconds left.

1513
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,952
-Forty-two seconds.
-What's your plan now?

1514
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:46,022
What's this?
He's putting a ribbon on the chopsticks.

1515
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,857
-What's this?
-He'll stick it on that thing.

1516
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,625
I see. Like a lollipop!

1517
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,161
What's this? Will you stick it in?

1518
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,497
-I see. Like a lollipop!
-Look at that!

1519
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,998
Like a lollipop!

1520
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:59,468
He's turning it into a lollipop!

1521
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:02,972
-The lollipop.
-Sixteen seconds!

1522
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,441
-Twenty seconds.
-Twenty seconds.

1523
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,844
-Twenty seconds.
-The soup.

1524
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,378
That's pretty.

1525
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,380
Are you going to serve it like this?

1526
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,783
FINISHES SERVING THE WATERMELON SOUP

1527
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,519
Is that all? Seven. Six.

1528
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,155
-Five. Four. Three.
<i>-Tsuyu.</i>

1529
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,790
<i>-Tsuyu.</i>
<i>-Tsuyu.</i>

1530
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,159
<i>-Tsuyu.</i>
-Shucks. Whatever. Just serve it.

1531
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,760
-Dang it.
-Ring the bell.

1532
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,530
What about the <i>tsuyu?</i> You can use it.

1533
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:28,464
Do you need it?

1534
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,899
No, I won't use it.

1535
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,634
-Why not?
-I think that'll be better.

1536
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,302
-You're right.
-Did you decide on that now?

1537
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,971
-Yes.
-It's better without it.

1538
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,240
So he won't use <i>tsuyu</i>.

1539
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,209
-He already used the galbi marinade.
-Their dishes are both finished.

1540
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,479
Isn't it shaped like a vampire's coffin?

1541
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,015
Whoa, really. My gosh.

1542
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,685
These are both for you.

1543
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,921
I'm not sure if it's for her sake.

1544
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,324
<i>Please try Chef Ho-young's dish first.</i>

1545
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,960
HAMBURGER STEAK
SERVED WITH A SLICE OF DEEP-FRIED BRIE

1546
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:02,832
NAPORITAN PASTA
MADE WITH WHELK, SHRIMP, AND SQUID

1547
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,402
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
POONG? GEE, GEE, GEE, GEE, BABY, BABY

1548
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,039
He presented so much food.

1549
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,808
She ordered something
that was evil and tempting.

1550
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,043
deep in the night.

1551
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,912
When do you change into the devil?

1552
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,180
-It's 2 A.M.
-2 A.M.

1553
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,416
It's now 2 A.M.

1554
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:23,819
The Night Seon-ji is
about to take a bite into her dish.

1555
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,488
It's now 2 A.M.

1556
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,657
Should I eat everything here?

1557
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,959
-It must be high in calories.
-Gosh.

1558
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:33,963
The patties were used as buns,
and the cheese…

1559
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,233
Look at the cheese oozing out.

1560
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,902
That's a thick slice of cheese.

1561
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,938
A CASCADE OF CHEESE

1562
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,642
-That's mine.
-That's yours?

1563
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:50,479
Why are you calling dibs? Okay.

1564
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:53,716
-It's a lot of food, so it's inevitable.
-My gosh.

1565
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,418
YOU CAN'T SAY NO TO THIS DISH

1566
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:56,919
Look at the amount of cheese.

1567
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,854
I already feel full just by seeing that.

1568
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:02,291
What are you talking about?
You have to eat it to feel full.

1569
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:07,763
She's going to give it a try.
It's Ho-young's dish.

1570
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,664
My mouth is watering.

1571
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,867
-Gosh.
-Gosh, look at that.

1572
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,602
-It's probably worth a bowl of rice.
-It must be

1573
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:16,539
very high in calories,
but it also looks delicious.

1574
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,709
SHE FINALLY TAKES A BITE

1575
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,143
She had a fat slice of cheese.

1576
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,645
HIGH EXPECTATION

1577
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,847
-There's no way it's not good.
-It has to be.

1578
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,783
Please share your thoughts
like you're Night Seon-ji now.

1579
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,020
GULP

1580
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,021
Man.

1581
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,023
-She's having trouble breathing.
-I am.

1582
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,093
-It is. It tastes breathtaking.
-It's breathtaking?

1583
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,596
She can probably feel
her veins clogging up.

1584
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,298
Forget about the balance.

1585
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,000
This is what the taste of evil
tastes like.

1586
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:50,339
It tastes like
a huge bomb of calories thrown at me.

1587
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,508
-You can use it to bulk up.
-It's something

1588
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,511
that'll make you bigger
after just one bite.

1589
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,747
The roux is under that, right?

1590
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:01,117
<i>I made the roux and grated cheese into it</i>

1591
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,386
-for her to use it as a dip.
-Can she use it as a dip?

1592
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,920
That's the dipping sauce.

1593
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,023
-It's like fondue.
-Yes.

1594
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,691
She takes another bite.

1595
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,794
SHE TAKES ANOTHER BIG BITE

1596
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,063
Mmm.

1597
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,500
If you eat that in the North Pole,
you could probably last for a month.

1598
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,368
It does feel like that.

1599
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,138
-Is it too salty with that much cheese?
-Not at all.

1600
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,407
It only tastes rich and creamy.

1601
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,742
Everything goes well

1602
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,579
with these patties as if they're one.

1603
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:31,814
And the pasta.

1604
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,018
I made it with all your favorite seafood,
whelk, shrimp, and squid.

1605
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,020
You can have everything together.

1606
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:39,155
Yoona will try a bite.

1607
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,090
EYES LOCKED ON THE FOOD

1608
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,392
She rarely eats something
that can make you gain weight.

1609
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,495
But she takes courage and tries some.
What's the pasta like?

1610
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,632
It looks very red.

1611
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,637
Wait, she's smiling.

1612
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,038
And she's coughing.

1613
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,540
Is it spicy?

1614
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,608
Wasn't it made with just ketchup?

1615
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:02,411
I added a dash of sriracha. Just a little.

1616
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,915
It mainly tastes like tomato sauce,

1617
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,351
but I could taste
a bit of sriracha at the end.

1618
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,521
It doesn't taste spicy,
but it still carries that spiciness.

1619
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,958
It's a good amount of spiciness.

1620
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:19,662
So if I have a bite of this
after the hamburger steak,

1621
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,597
it cleans out my palate.

1622
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:25,267
-It must be a good combination.
-It's a place to fall back on.

1623
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:27,470
<i>-A place to fall back on.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1624
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,538
<i>-When it feels spicy, you go back.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1625
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,907
All right, then.

1626
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,876
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong's dish.

1627
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,846
This is Poong's Killing Me, Baby.

1628
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,982
THE FIRST IN THE WORLD(?)
WARM WATERMELON SOUP

1629
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,420
SERVED WITH TRIPE-SHAPED LOLLIPOP

1630
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:48,791
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
KILLING YOU, BABY

1631
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:52,061
It does look like a decent lollipop.

1632
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:54,396
-It does. Yes.
-It looks fine.

1633
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,900
She'll still take a photo of this.

1634
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,903
He pan-fried that tripe shape,

1635
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,838
made to look like a lollipop.

1636
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:07,910
We performed "Kissing You"
with a lollipop in our hands.

1637
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,747
Younger people loved that.

1638
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,416
How is she supposed to eat this?

1639
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,852
Well, you know.

1640
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:19,488
You can just eat it off the stick
when others aren't around,

1641
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,991
but you can feel free
to cut it with a knife.

1642
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:25,561
You can also eat it
with that watermelon soup

1643
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,263
on the side.

1644
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,498
-It wasn't the sauce.
-So this is served without sauce?

1645
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,000
You can dip it in the soup too.

1646
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,635
That's how I eat it.

1647
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:36,405
This was the first time
you made this thing.

1648
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:37,840
You should've served it with <i>tsuyu</i>.

1649
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,542
-No.
-No?

1650
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,610
-It's seasoned perfectly.
-What about ketchup?

1651
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,145
No, it's perfect.

1652
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,949
-I wonder what it's like.
-I'm curious.

1653
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,452
-The texture is probably nice.
-Right.

1654
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,722
It was fun to watch his recipe.

1655
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,858
What did you make the tripe with?

1656
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,526
That? Rice paper.

1657
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:58,827
Rice paper?

1658
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:02,164
-I made a long piece and rolled it up.
-The meat?

1659
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:04,300
You're something.

1660
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:07,770
This one also looks very high in calories.

1661
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,471
I wonder.

1662
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,208
A BIG BITE

1663
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,344
It's not the kind of dish
she usually enjoys.

1664
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:17,646
TASTING IN A DAZE

1665
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,615
CHUCKLE(?)

1666
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:22,618
She doesn't know where to look.

1667
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,087
Her eyes are quite shaken.

1668
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,123
Let me try the filling again.

1669
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,626
<i>It's made with shrimp and pork fat.</i>

1670
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:34,163
<i>-He ground it with the shrimp.</i>
<i>-He put those together.</i>

1671
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,232
There's a Thai shrimp patty dish
called <i>tod mun goong,</i>

1672
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,201
made with shrimp and pork fat.

1673
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,071
I changed the flavor just a little.

1674
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:43,806
SHE TAKES ANOTHER BITE
AFTER HIS EXPLANATION

1675
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,342
It might be a bit too greasy.

1676
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,544
Mmm.

1677
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,346
I think he used garlic.

1678
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,448
-Garlic.
-You're right. I did.

1679
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:56,552
When it gets a little too greasy,
garlic pops in and helps.

1680
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,655
It helps with the greasiness.

1681
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:03,425
The filling reminds me of dumplings.

1682
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,228
-I would think so.
-Like meat dumpling fillings.

1683
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:09,632
It's also very chewy,
thanks to the rice paper.

1684
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,101
The watermelon soup.

1685
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,902
She checks if she can fall back on it.

1686
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,504
I've never seen that before.

1687
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,572
SNIFF

1688
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,073
HMM?

1689
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,377
She smells it first and gets suspicious,
but it's only natural.

1690
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,879
The watermelon soup was served warm.

1691
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,549
Watermelon is usually eaten cold,
but that soup is warm.

1692
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,818
WHAT IS IT LIKE?

1693
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,755
Wait, when I tried it…

1694
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:37,593
Yoona is the type who speaks with caution.

1695
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,927
-Is it good?
-She's wondering.

1696
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,629
-Is she flustered?
-She's looking for words.

1697
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,666
-Why are you hesitating?
-Is it good?

1698
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,634
Whenever I watched the show,

1699
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:49,371
people who try Poong's dish would go…

1700
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,541
-He's looking for the loaches.
-Yes.

1701
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:55,010
EVERYONE SHOWS THE SAME RESPONSE

1702
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,246
<i>They have a tough time talking</i>

1703
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,081
<i>and sit in wonder.</i>

1704
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,183
<i>I've always been curious as to why.</i>

1705
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,986
But that's the genuine response.

1706
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,622
This is simply inexplicable.

1707
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:07,723
It's new.

1708
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,125
-Is it uncanny?
-Yes, it tastes uncanny.

1709
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,161
But on a positive note?

1710
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,564
I can't tell if I feel
positive or negative about this.

1711
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,434
She can't even tell if she feels
positive or negative about it.

1712
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,535
It's a wonder.

1713
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,805
It feels like I'm eating bread.

1714
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,940
-What now? Eating bread?
-Is it the roux?

1715
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,775
I used roux as the base.

1716
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:31,947
It feels like I'm eating blended bread
smeared with sweet jam.

1717
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:34,750
-Blended bread?
-Yes.

1718
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,319
But I keep going back for more.

1719
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,954
-You keep going back for more.
-Yes.

1720
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,556
-Do you keep falling back on it?
-Yes.

1721
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,624
-I really do.
-I see.

1722
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,961
She keeps going back to the soup
after the tripe.

1723
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,630
Why don't you try it, Bo-hyun?

1724
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:55,104
Please try Chef Ho-young's
Poong? Gee, Gee, Gee, Gee, Baby, Baby.

1725
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,440
I like the combination.

1726
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,976
SLURP

1727
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,811
I can't get paid after eating this.

1728
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,546
I haven't been paid since last week.

1729
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:07,483
It was just as Yoona said.

1730
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,752
It tastes rich and creamy, not too salty.

1731
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:13,655
I love the rich flavor of the steak
and how juicy it is.

1732
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:17,059
The moment I took a bite,
I felt like I should go work out.

1733
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,195
-Taking you straight to the gym.
-To the gym.

1734
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:23,532
I think Italians would love this too.

1735
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,134
-Even Italians?
-Yes.

1736
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,769
I came back from Italy yesterday,

1737
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,837
and they'd like this.

1738
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,306
-Even Italians would love the pasta.
-Yes.

1739
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,876
Let's try Poong's dish too.

1740
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:37,146
-Try some.
-It's like pumpkin soup.

1741
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:39,314
It tastes like pumpkin soup.

1742
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,418
-Why does watermelon taste like pumpkin?
-Right?

1743
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,486
But I get how you keep going back for it.

1744
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,523
It must be the sweet and sour flavor.

1745
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,626
Bo-hyun tries a piece of the tripe.

1746
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:53,061
He seems very cautious.

1747
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:54,997
Can he really eat that?

1748
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,765
Can I call this slightly burnt?

1749
01:13:56,832 --> 01:14:01,270
This mix of crunchiness and chewiness
goes very well together.

1750
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,605
I think I just chewed on pork fat,

1751
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,907
but I love it.

1752
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,642
It's not bad. I like the balance.

1753
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,310
THE TRIPE LOLLIPOP HAS A GOOD BALANCE

1754
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,380
The choice is up to Yoona now.

1755
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:15,617
The order was titled,
"Deep night: evil temptation."

1756
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:17,920
It's good.

1757
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,388
-Did you try it, Nam-no?
-Yes.

1758
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,490
Do you know the kind of dumplings

1759
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,293
made with potatoes?
Potato starch dumplings.

1760
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,462
-The potato dumpling?
-The chewy ones.

1761
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,765
This is really good.
It's the kind of food I love.

1762
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,267
-Really? I see.
-It's good.

1763
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,536
Why won't you believe me?
It's really good.

1764
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:35,504
It is.

1765
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:38,273
It's your turn to make the choice.

1766
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,642
<i>Press one for Ho-young</i>

1767
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,744
<i>and two for Poong.</i>

1768
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,746
Who will you choose? Make your choice

1769
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,682
and press the button!

1770
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,018
Press one for Ho-young and two for Poong.

1771
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,055
WHICH DISH TEMPTED HER
WITH ITS EVIL TASTE?

1772
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,257
-Did you pick one? She did.
-Yes.

1773
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,125
Yoona made her choice.

1774
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,928
Let's find out the result. Show us!

1775
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:03,131
Deep night: evil temptation.

1776
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,300
Poong has won six times so far,

1777
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:06,869
and Ho-young, five times.

1778
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,440
Will Poong's wicked talent
bring him yet another star?

1779
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:16,845
Or will Ho-young win
and go up in a tie with Poong?

1780
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:20,048
Who did you choose, Yoona?

1781
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,417
The evil temptation!

1782
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,453
JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1783
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:26,722
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1784
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:30,225
Ho-young wins!

1785
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,362
Gosh, Ho-young.

1786
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,697
Why did you choose him?

1787
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,399
As soon as I saw it,

1788
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:43,105
it felt like a huge meal
full of evil temptations.

1789
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,074
<i>The flowing cheese</i>

1790
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:50,646
made me think it was really wicked.

1791
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:54,383
Then please put a star on Chef Ho-young.

1792
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,852
Ho-young takes his sixth victory.

1793
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,587
-That's amazing.
-The same as Poong.

1794
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,789
-They're in a tie.
-Congratulations!

1795
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,659
-His talent from the darkness.
-Ho-young wins!

1796
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,860
Congratulations.

1797
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,330
Bo-hyun was a former boxer.

1798
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,399
-I've won a gold medal.
-Oh, my.

1799
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,134
You must have a strong punch.

1800
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,235
Do you want to be beaten?

1801
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,369
-No.
-Should I punch you?

1802
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,039
Let us begin the punch king competition.

1803
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,374
A SUPER PUNCH BY A FORMER BOXER

1804
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,409
-Whoa!
-That was strong.

1805
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,376
May I defeat him?

1806
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:25,147
THE CHEFS OF THE SHOW FIGHT BACK

1807
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:26,048
I can't believe it.

1808
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:27,549
He's our center.

1809
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,586
<i>Look at how powerful Nam-no is.</i>
<i>He rips it apart.</i>

1810
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,588
<i>I may have four stars, but I'm different.</i>

1811
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,522
She's a tough girl.

1812
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,557
It's burnt!

1813
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,526
-It's quite burnt.
-It's an emergency.

1814
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,627
It's true.

1815
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:39,828
Oh, no.

1816
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,430
The legendary rivals are back.

1817
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,799
It feels like a camping ground
with the smoke and all.

1818
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,300
He's sprinkling salt again!

1819
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,269
Hyun-suk!

1820
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,837
I keep the angle at 45 degrees.

1821
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,272
Show us your canine teeth.

1822
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,573
I can't stand this.

1823
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,108
Will that give him a star?

1824
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,810
I want to give him a star!

1825
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,278
WHICH CHEF WILL END UP WITH A STAR?

1826
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,584
You can't smell it yet. Wait.

1827
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:17,899
