00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,449
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,452
Please welcome Kim Nam-il
and Lee Dong-gook!

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,921
-Hello, my name is Joseph.
-Welcome.

4
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,423
Welcome to the show.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,925
I thought we'd have the same characters.

6
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,829
You were nicknamed the vacuum cleaner
while you played.

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,731
EUN-YEONG AND HYUN-SUK'S
COOK-OFF!

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,299
SLURP

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,834
The hot soup.

10
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,504
HYUN-SUK WINS DESPITE HIS INJURY

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,838
He finally collapses.

12
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,442
We're here to bring you
the Again 2002 round.

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,977
The Gentleman Sucks.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,545
Can he suck on that?

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,648
Can the vacuum cleaner
suck the noodles out?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,383
Hey, it's rising up!

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,286
It's rising up! Poong-dink's uppercut!

18
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,188
NEXT, FABRI'S CHILLED-BONARA

19
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,689
He's been trained well. He sucks well.

20
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,626
Kim Nam-il the vacuum cleaner!

21
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,761
NAM-IL CHOOSES FABRI,
AND HE WINS

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,397
-Italy wins.
-He takes the second win.

23
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,366
Congratulations.

24
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,503
You're watching <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
with Kim Nam-il and Lee Dong-gook.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,141
Everyone,
Dong-gook currently has five children.

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,278
-That's crazy. How does he manage?
-It's amazing.

27
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,246
-You have four daughters.
-Yes.

28
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,382
And your youngest, Si-an, is the son.

29
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:26,119
-Si-an began to play soccer.
-I see.

30
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,321
-It's been a year and a half.
-A year and a half.

31
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,589
<i>Is he that good now?</i>

32
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,957
<i>He's getting the elite player training.</i>

33
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,393
<i>His uniform number is 20 at school.</i>

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,562
A STRIKER WITH THE SAME
UNIFORM NUMBER AS HIS DAD!

35
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,466
He has a long way to go in my eyes.

36
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,800
-He's still young.
-In his dad's eyes.

37
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,036
Yes, but I can see some potentials,

38
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,704
so I'm showing him support as a parent.

39
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,772
-I see.
-You should.

40
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,474
You two have sons too, right?

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,245
Yes, I could've given him support
if he wanted to play.

42
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,549
I once saw him playing soccer
with his friends in elementary school,

43
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,018
-so I watched him for half an hour.
-You watched him.

44
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,187
-With your coach's eyes.
-Yes.

45
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,523
<i>-I kept a sharp eye on him.</i>
<i>-Yes, on your son.</i>

46
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,759
-He never got the ball for half an hour.
-Oh, no.

47
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,229
-He never even touched it?
-No.

48
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,331
Then he should focus on his schoolwork.

49
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,299
So I asked Seo-u,

50
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,536
"You could've kicked the ball
or even tussled for it."

51
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,004
"Why didn't you do that?"

52
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,774
He was much bigger than his peers then,

53
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,812
so he said he couldn't tussle
because his friends could get hurt.

54
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,648
-He's a pacifist.
-That's his character.

55
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,283
He's not too intense.

56
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,785
-He's completely different from his dad.
-He is.

57
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>-The intense guy.</i>
<i>-How did you have a son like him?</i>

58
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,425
He kicked more people on the field
compared to the actual ball.

59
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,427
DO NOT STAND IN FRONT OF HIM

60
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,596
-That was all I could do.
-Anyhow.

61
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,498
He hits people first
and doesn't even apologize.

62
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,601
<i>He gets mad at the victim first.</i>

63
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,337
-After kicking them?
-After kicking them first.

64
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:55,575
-At times, I tussle with an opponent.
-Of course.

65
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,312
-But Jung-hwan is always far away.
-I see.

66
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,382
<i>You had to handle</i>
<i>all those international players alone.</i>

67
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,817
-I see.
-Let me explain.

68
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,052
Let's hear from him.

69
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,887
When a fight breaks out on our side,

70
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,889
the situation is already over

71
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,692
by the time I get there
because I'm a striker.

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,761
You can't say it like that.

73
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,828
-What do you mean?
-You can…

74
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,830
You should've at least pretended
like you'd come.

75
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,265
-He didn't even do that?
-He's right.

76
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,433
-You handled it.
-Let me add to that.

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,502
I was also a striker, so I know.

78
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,972
-It's better to sip water in that while.
-I see.

79
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,841
-For strikers?
-Because we have a set of rules anyway.

80
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,410
They don't get into a brawl.

81
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,547
-You're the same.
-That's why I get what he's saying.

82
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,615
Look.

83
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,517
At the very least,
I didn't sip water like him.

84
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,187
-I just helped you!
-He just stood back there.

85
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,122
-No, not like that.
-He didn't drink any water.

86
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,158
This is what he's like. I try to help him.

87
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,394
He's right.
It ends by the time we're there.

88
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,929
But I don't sip on water.

89
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,197
-Right.
-Jeez.

90
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,435
So Dong-gook has
seven people in his family.

91
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,337
You must spend a lot on food.

92
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,641
You can check how much you spent in a year
on delivery food with the app.

93
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,443
We spent

94
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,211
about 17 million won
just on delivery food.

95
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,747
-Really?
-You spent 17 million on delivery food?

96
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,882
AFTER ALL, HE HAS A BIG FAMILY

97
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,718
You probably need to work very hard.

98
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,254
And that's just on the delivery food app,
not eating out and groceries.

99
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,123
-That's another category.
-Just on the delivery food.

100
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,525
When you order delivery food,
I'm sure all seven people have

101
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,695
<i>-different kinds of appetites.</i>
<i>-They're all different.</i>

102
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,364
First of all,

103
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,667
I don't get a say.

104
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,070
When my wife makes snacks,
her priority is our children.

105
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,805
Let's say we're ordering fried chicken.

106
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,441
-There's the sweet one with seasoning.
-There are those kinds.

107
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,610
We'd usually order something like that,

108
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,712
but I don't really like sweet food.

109
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,848
But if we want to order two chickens,

110
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:46,986
they could make one of them
something I like, plain fried chicken.

111
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,856
-But that never happens.
-So you have zero say?

112
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:55,028
-When I played, it was centered around me.
-You were the priority.

113
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,830
<i>But my kids have become athletes,</i>

114
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,567
so our diet usually revolves around them.

115
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,270
That's kind of disappointing for you.

116
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,239
On a special day like my birthday,

117
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,242
-I can ask for something I like, right?
-On your birthday?

118
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,943
You don't have a say
even on your birthday?

119
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,245
-Even on your birthday?
-That's awful.

120
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,648
Let's say I want to eat something healthy
like eels or <i>baeksuk</i>, whole chicken soup.

121
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,818
It's nice to go somewhere out in nature
where they serve that kind of food.

122
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,156
-But they aren't into that vibe, period.
-Right.

123
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,059
-Kids don't like it.
-They don't.

124
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,062
I see.
He always eats out before he goes home.

125
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,866
Jung-hwan treats me often
when we're out together.

126
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,437
Dads have a say
after the family pet, right?

127
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,871
We say that as a joke.

128
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,707
-I can relate to that.
-Right.

129
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:45,712
So, he may not get
a lot of say in ordering delivery food,

130
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:49,849
but I hear he's serious
about leaving reviews.

131
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,385
-Do you leave reviews?
-The reviews?

132
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,121
-He's into it.
-He is?

133
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,256
Tell us what your nickname is.

134
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,625
-I had been curious about it.
-I get too lazy.

135
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,694
But there are those who do that.

136
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,630
Toward the end of my career
as a soccer player,

137
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,000
my family was still in Songdo
while I lived in Jeonju.

138
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,505
There are days when I order food
before I arrive at my place.

139
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,006
So when I eat alone,

140
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,110
I want to talk to someone
but didn't have anyone to talk to.

141
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,712
IT'S ME, DONG-GOOK,
AND I FEEL LONELY

142
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,549
-That was…
-You were just bored? Really?

143
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,452
-The owners leave replies to reviews.
-They'd reply back.

144
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,554
I had lots of free time after training,

145
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,623
so I'd eat my food alone

146
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,026
and write down my reviews,
sharing my take on the flavor.

147
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:37,864
-We brought a few of those.
-Really?

148
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,332
-Let me show you what he wrote.
-I want to see.

149
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,669
-These are Dong-gook's reviews.
-He left those.

150
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,405
There's the food he ordered.

151
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,472
"It was delicious."

152
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,076
"I thought the mayo sauce was
something special and got it for 500 won,

153
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,044
but it was just mayo."

154
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,749
"I thought it would've been nice
if you gave a few on the house."

155
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,086
"But the fried chicken
and shrimp toast were delicious."

156
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,555
-He has good manners, though.
-He does.

157
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,625
Instead of mayo, it said "mayo sauce."

158
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,294
So I thought it might be different,

159
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,229
but it was just the same old mayo.

160
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,898
-It just came in a container.
-Yes.

161
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,599
-It should've been different.
-Yes.

162
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,902
You were disappointed
only because of 500 won.

163
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,271
They'd offer free beverages
if you promise to leave a review.

164
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,673
-You're right. The review event.
-That's it.

165
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,676
-That's very important.
-You promise to leave a review.

166
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,078
-Were you that lonely?
-It's a promise.

167
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,346
I was.

168
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,616
If you did this with your reviews,
you must've chatted all night with Siri.

169
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,054
"It was a bit bland, but it must've been
because it was the mild flavor."

170
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,824
"I'll order
the medium hot flavor next time."

171
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,159
-"I enjoyed it a lot."
-Hey, but you know…

172
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,463
"A bit bland, mild flavor."

173
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,065
-Those are hints.
-"Medium hot." Do you have a keen taste?

174
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,435
I don't like food that's too bland.

175
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,304
I'm originally from Pohang,

176
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,738
-so I take my food a bit saltier.
-Saltier food.

177
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,774
Food is a bit saltier in Pohang.

178
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,144
We eat lots of salted seafood and all,
and I've had such food since childhood.

179
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,745
You should keep that in your mind.

180
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,615
And now, it's time to look through
Dong-gook's fridge,

181
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,052
the Ahn Sung-jae
of food delivery app reviews.

182
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,055
It's the first time in our new season

183
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,624
we invited a guest
who had seven family members.

184
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,192
-I look forward to it.
-I'm so curious

185
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,927
to see the fridge for a family of seven.

186
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,531
How much say did you have
in the ingredients you have here?

187
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,100
I never get to go into the kitchen.

188
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,768
Do they not let you in?

189
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,304
-I was banned from the kitchen.
-Why?

190
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,373
-Do you leave reviews?
-I'm not…

191
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,674
In case he writes reviews?

192
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,244
In case he goes, "It was a bit bland"?

193
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,812
"I wanted something richer."

194
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,946
"It's rather mild."

195
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,049
Our diet
mostly revolves around our children,

196
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,318
so I have no idea what's in the fridge.

197
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,755
-There is one thing I must have, though.
-Is there?

198
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,291
What kind of ingredients do they keep?

199
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,728
We present Dong-gook's fridge.

200
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,763
Dong-gook's fridge.

201
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,165
EVERYONE IS IN SHOCK

202
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,469
PRESENTING
LEE DONG-GOOK'S FRIDGE

203
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,405
Everything is organized neatly in rows.

204
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,207
Everything looks neat… What?

205
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,744
Everyone, did you notice
something extraordinary?

206
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,946
They buy their food in huge portions.

207
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,049
-Right? Look at these.
-Of course.

208
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,218
-The kind of ingredients.
-There's lots of protein.

209
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,419
It's tofu hell.

210
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,589
There are huge portions of ingredients.

211
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,392
You must've ordered lots of delivery food.

212
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,595
Pickled radish packs.
One, two, three, four, five of them.

213
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,130
-Five packs of pickled radish.
-Yes.

214
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,767
-We eat fried chicken once every two days.
-Really?

215
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,870
-Do they like it?
-We eat it as a late-night snack.

216
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,406
-Your kids must get hungry.
-Yes, they go and work out.

217
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,374
And look at these.

218
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,678
They are four cartons of eggs.

219
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,513
It may seem a lot,

220
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,382
-but they only last two days.
-Two days?

221
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,185
Si-an eats up to seven or eight a day.

222
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,887
Just eggs?

223
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,789
When we have four eggs left,

224
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,591
they start feeling each other out.

225
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,359
Yes, of course.

226
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,860
-Who's going to eat that?
-Who will it be?

227
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,896
They all must want it.

228
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,933
-Do you like dishes made with eggs?
-I do like eggs.

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,902
I once made doenjang stew

230
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,905
and tried throwing eggs in it.

231
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,640
-Eggs in doenjang stew?
-In doenjang stew?

232
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,109
You've made doenjang stew with eggs?

233
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,745
I thought it was fine, but since then,

234
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,614
I was banned from the kitchen.

235
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,050
-That was why you were banned.
-They thought you were fooling around.

236
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,385
But you know,

237
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,588
if you think about it,
it's probably not that bad. So why…

238
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,990
-I should try it.
-You're right.

239
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,359
Four packs of soft tofu.

240
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,728
Six packs of firm tofu for stew.

241
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,664
It's like a school cafeteria.

242
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,868
You probably use two packs per meal
for seven people.

243
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,303
They probably need more.

244
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,604
You must like tofu too.

245
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,140
Yes, I love eggs and tofu.

246
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,943
Those are staples for me,

247
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,513
but everything else is
mostly meant for my kids.

248
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,383
-How many packs of strawberries are these?
-Strawberries.

249
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,019
There are four packs in this size.

250
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,021
-Do you need so many strawberries?
-Well,

251
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,556
they'll eat one pack per person
after dinner.

252
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,891
And that's it.

253
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,326
They eat one pack per person?

254
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,362
-One box per person.
-One box per person.

255
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,732
-They must like strawberries.
-He really needs to work hard.

256
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,903
When we order a box of tangerines
from Jeju Island,

257
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,639
my kids can finish the box in one hour
while watching TV.

258
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,175
-An entire box?
-Yes, a box in an hour.

259
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,011
-They pop it in like popcorn.
-If there are 50 in a box,

260
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,547
-it'd be over if they eat ten each.
-Yes.

261
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,716
-This family eats a lot.
-Really.

262
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,352
Look how big the milk cartons are.

263
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,354
-Look at the milk.
-Do you run out quickly?

264
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,589
-It's for restaurants.
-That's about 3 liters.

265
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,925
Yes, over here.

266
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,860
I found lots of side dishes.

267
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,929
I think these are for the parents.

268
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,397
This must be kimchi.

269
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,533
Quail eggs in soy sauce.
Green onion kimchi.

270
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,169
-And some pickled veggies.
-My parents

271
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,173
who are still in Pohang
make those and send those to us.

272
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,010
We like to eat different kinds
of side dishes when we eat.

273
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,013
Does this mean you like side dishes
you get from Pohang?

274
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,848
Yes, I like how it's seasoned well.

275
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,584
-I like how it's not bland.
-It can't be bland.

276
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,886
-He likes rich and salty food.
-Rich flavors.

277
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,988
Dong-gook likes rich flavors.

278
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,256
What's this?

279
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,559
Powder? What is this?

280
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,061
-Vegetables.
-Minced vegetables.

281
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,364
Si-an and everyone
don't like to eat veggies in big pieces.

282
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,432
Kids don't.

283
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,701
But if we make it hard for them to see,
they can eat it.

284
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,836
They're still young.

285
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,904
They can eat it in small pieces.

286
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,207
It's probably used to make fried rice.

287
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,009
We have to have those ready
to whip up something

288
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,712
as soon as they get hungry,
so my wife keeps those chopped.

289
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,648
These are for the kids.
It's not Dong-gook's food.

290
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,916
-She has to whip it up.
-Yes.

291
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,420
I see some extracts,
black goat and deer antlers.

292
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,224
I'm seeing lots of juices and extracts.
Are these for dad's health?

293
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,126
-Those are for Si-an.
-Si-an.

294
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,361
-I see.
-It's just like the red ginseng.

295
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,463
Those used to be mine
while I still played.

296
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,034
But the food I need
never make it into the fridge.

297
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,203
-This is so sad.
-It is.

298
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,738
That's what our dads do.

299
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,974
So these are your son's juices.

300
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,309
Look at these. What are these?

301
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,679
-My gosh, abalones.
-Look at the abalones.

302
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,982
He's got great ingredients at home.

303
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,550
That's amazing.

304
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,787
-It's over when we eat three per person.
-You're right.

305
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,989
You eat three per person?

306
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,091
-So this is one meal for you.
-Yes, pretty much.

307
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,159
Three per person.

308
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,094
-They must spend a lot on food.
-It won't be easy.

309
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:19,331
I'm seeing some meat,
and these are like books.

310
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,399
This must be beef.

311
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,669
-It's not just beef, but he has pork too.
-Some pork. Pork belly.

312
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,906
I've never seen a family
that keeps so much steak at home.

313
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,674
There are so many kinds.

314
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,609
He has to keep big portions.

315
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,312
But this isn't just for my family.

316
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,348
-If the kids each bring one friend over…
-You're right.

317
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,151
-we'd be out in just a few hours.
-That's easily ten people.

318
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,653
-That's ten people already.
-Right.

319
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,087
What's that on the top shelf?

320
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,223
-It's round steak.
-Round steak.

321
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,159
I heard that was
a nutritious portion for children.

322
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,260
There are for kids too.

323
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,629
Stop picking out kids' food.

324
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,299
-Everything is for his kids.
-Not many of these are his.

325
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,768
-I found some fish buns.
-He has fish buns.

326
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,736
-And rice cake.
-Those are probably for kids.

327
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,371
None of these are what I like.

328
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,675
I even leave out rice cakes
when I eat rice cake soup with dumplings.

329
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,009
-You don't like it?
-You leave it out.

330
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,779
I like to eat quickly and rest,
but rice cakes are too chewy.

331
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,950
I prefer things I can eat quickly
and digest quickly.

332
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,086
-Should I make liquid food?
-Liquid food?

333
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,055
-Come on, liquified food?
-Not many of these are his.

334
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,224
This is such a sad fridge.

335
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,226
-It's sad.
-It's a sad fridge.

336
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,295
Hey, what are these?

337
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,734
-I found some eels.
-Eels.

338
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,736
-I found freshwater eels.
-Hey.

339
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,105
-What about the eels?
-Right?

340
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,107
Only those are mine.

341
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,675
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

342
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,011
It's something I usually can't eat.

343
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,413
I had to buy it in a hurry
and stash it into the fridge.

344
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,017
-You wanted something you like today.
-Yes.

345
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,485
All my diet revolves around my kids.

346
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:51,423
-So I slipped in something that's for me.
-I see.

347
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,961
I want to ask you
to make something only for me.

348
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,197
-I'll enjoy it very much.
-I completely understand.

349
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,431
These look great.

350
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,167
Only Chef Joseph looks concerned.

351
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,037
-He ran into these eels here.
-He did.

352
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,172
Do you remember
the nightmare from that day?

353
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,574
SIGH

354
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,010
Let me do a review of that match.

355
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,846
<i>Nam-no used sharp-toothed eels</i>
<i>in huge pieces.</i>

356
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>But Joseph halved those.</i>

357
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,353
-When it came out, it was this small.
-Like anchovies.

358
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,821
-Like anchovies.
-Anchovies.

359
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,190
<i>So it took way too long to evaluate.</i>

360
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,327
<i>The White Spoons were like,</i>
<i>"What's taking so long?"</i>

361
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,897
It was because
they couldn't find the eels Joseph made.

362
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,832
Were they that tiny?

363
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,768
Anyway, we're okay with you getting these.

364
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,436
Thank you for accepting it.

365
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,939
Without that, he would've had to eat
only eggs and tofu.

366
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,241
Right? I understand why you bought those.

367
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,943
-He had to get them.
-He did.

368
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,111
That was Dong-gook's fridge.

369
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,348
I don't even take up 10% of the fridge.

370
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,383
We just looked through Dong-gook's fridge.

371
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,120
I think we already know
what one of the orders is.

372
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,623
-I felt so bad for him after seeing this.
-Right?

373
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,059
I should treat him to meals more often.

374
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,294
What are Dong-gook's orders?

375
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,796
Let's find out.

376
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,032
-No kids allowed, eel dish.
-No kids allowed, eel dish.

377
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,500
FLOP, HEHE

378
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,635
AUTOMATIC REACTION TO EELS

379
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,136
What was that?

380
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,705
I want something made for me.

381
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,274
-Just for you.
-Something made only for me.

382
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,476
I usually just grill it and eat it,

383
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,511
so I was wondering
if you could make anything new.

384
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,281
-We have to do it.
-Yes, please move his heart.

385
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,483
-A new kind of eel dish.
-I look forward to this.

386
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,385
Let's find out the second order.

387
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,787
-No kids allowed, richest dish.
-Richest dish.

388
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,589
This is another way he'll vent.

389
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,857
Both of them are "No kids allowed."

390
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,058
-No kids for both.
-I must

391
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,928
always eat the blandest food.

392
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,898
But what I want today is
something thick and rich.

393
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,468
It'd be nice to eat something like that.

394
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,504
Four chefs who didn't compete last week
can feel free to jump in.

395
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,773
Let's give the first chance to Joseph.

396
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,542
-Why don't we do that?
-There's no pressure.

397
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,544
Let me challenge myself once again.

398
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,580
-Really?
-Whoa, really?

399
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,515
-I'll use the eels.
-Are you up for it?

400
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,450
-Really?
-Are you sure?

401
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,185
He's saying, "Come at me, Nam-no."

402
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,587
Are you sure?

403
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,821
Of course.

404
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,524
You won't be able to sleep
if you lose twice.

405
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,928
-I'll take the eel.
-The eel!

406
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,564
-It's a match!
-It's a return match.

407
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,734
Then the richest dish round

408
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,537
automatically goes
to Gyeong-jun and Sung-jun.

409
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,506
I didn't like him from the start.

410
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,641
Me?

411
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,779
We can't have more good-looking people
here on the show.

412
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,781
-I should teach him a lesson.
-I see.

413
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,817
-I feel confident.
-That's a relief.

414
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,753
Let the first cook-off begin!

415
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,424
THE FIRST COOK-OFF BEGINS NOW!

416
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,128
This is the first round
with Dong-gook's ingredients.

417
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,198
This is yet another return match.

418
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,168
Cooking Maniac, Black Spoon, Yoon Nam-no

419
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:54,907
versus a two-star Michelin chef,
White Spoon, Joseph.

420
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,943
We didn't stage this in particular,

421
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,547
but Dong-gook had eels in his fridge,

422
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,516
<i>turning this return match into reality.</i>

423
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,018
<i>-It's the same ingredient.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

424
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,486
If Chef Joseph loses,

425
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,756
this could take a toll on your reputation.

426
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,724
-I can't lose.
-You can't.

427
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,194
-My wife called just before.
-Yes?

428
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,428
She said,

429
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,498
"If you lose again,
don't even think about coming home."

430
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,534
-He can't go home.
-That's a tough one.

431
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,736
"Don't even think about coming home!"

432
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,840
Actually, I wanted to win again today,
take him to a sauna, and sleep there.

433
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,476
He wants to win and take him to a sauna?

434
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,945
Because he'll get kicked out
from his house?

435
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,582
He called me and said
he'd be on <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>

436
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,585
and he said he didn't know what to do.

437
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,487
Did you give him tips on how to win stars?

438
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,790
I told him not to get ambitious
and just cook for the guest.

439
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,925
-He can just use his skills.
-I told him to relax.

440
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,127
"Just do it."

441
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,562
-Just do it.
-"Don't think too much, and just do it."

442
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,297
Did the call help?

443
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,732
It wasn't

444
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,234
as helpful as I thought.

445
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,538
-How is that going to be helpful?
-Exactly.

446
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:04,443
But the thing is,
Chef Nam-no keeps losing against Poong.

447
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,012
Your record isn't too promising.

448
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,714
I want to root for Nam-no.

449
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,782
I'm stronger against the strong.

450
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,950
My dear Seph-Seph

451
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:16,455
<i>mostly makes very delicate dishes</i>
<i>in his fine dining restaurant.</i>

452
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,159
<i>-He recently won two Michelin stars.</i>
<i>-Yes, it's a big deal.</i>

453
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,995
I'll win today and take his star.

454
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,197
He'll take that star today.

455
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,598
I love that competitive spirit.

456
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,433
-He wants to take away his star.
-Yes.

457
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,469
This is Joseph's first time on the show,

458
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,937
so he gets a perk.

459
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,340
-Right.
-Which one of the three do you want?

460
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,609
-UNICHEF.
-UNICHEF.

461
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,911
UNICHEF for a minute.

462
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,179
Which chef do you want as your help?

463
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,648
Do I have to tell you now?

464
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,550
Do you want to do it later?

465
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,151
It'll be more fun that way.

466
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,255
-He wants to make it more fun.
-Then we should all stay alert.

467
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,192
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS: EEL, TSUYU,
PICKLED ARTICHOKE, TERIYAKI SAUCE, BEER

468
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,260
LIQUID SEASONING, PICKLED PERILLA LEAF,
PICKLED GREEN PLUM, ENOKI, AND MORE

469
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,830
Chef Nam-no, what are you making?

470
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,499
My dish is called

471
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,401
Pot-riker.

472
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,102
-Pot-riker?
-Pot-riker.

473
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,104
Not a striker, but…

474
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,940
-Pot and a striker.
-Pot-riker.

475
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:11,176
Dong-gook was a striker.

476
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,681
-Are you using a pot?
-Yes, I plan to make hot pot rice.

477
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,717
When rice is cooked in hot pots,
we usually eat it with side dishes.

478
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,019
He had many delicious side dishes,

479
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,055
so I want to use those
and make rice with them.

480
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,424
-I see.
-I'll also make fritters for adults.

481
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,259
-You've only had grilled eels…
-Yes.

482
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,794
…and it probably felt too ordinary.

483
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,531
So I plan to make
beer-battered fried eels.

484
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,032
-Also…
-Beer?

485
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,468
…I have two stars right now.
so I want to win against Seph-Seph today,

486
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,570
get another star, and score a hat-trick.

487
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,740
I see. Three goals.

488
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,141
-A hat-trick.
-Yes.

489
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,078
CHEF JOSEPH'S INGREDIENTS: EEL, POTATO,
QUAIL EGGS IN SOY SAUCE, EMMENTALER, MILK

490
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,146
CHOGOCHUJANG, GREEN PLUM EXTRACT, BEER,
DRIED LAVER, PORK BELLY, PERILLA LEAF

491
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,983
And Joseph, what's your dish?

492
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,918
The dish I prepared is called

493
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,120
Leedong-guk.

494
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,589
-Sorry?
-What? Leedong-guk?

495
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,857
-Leedong-guk?
-What's this dish?

496
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,492
It's a soup dish.

497
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,227
-I get it.
-Yes, it's a soup dish.

498
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,795
Correct. Yes.

499
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,364
-You're right.
-An eel soup?

500
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,666
-So this is eel soup?
-Yes.

501
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,702
I want to combine two things.
It's called soup,

502
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,237
but overseas, it's called chowder

503
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,905
when it's creamy.

504
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,241
-Eel chowder?
-Eel chowder?

505
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,778
Also, the eel in the center
will taste very rich.

506
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,848
I want to make a recipe
he'll be able to use in the future.

507
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:23,915
I see.

508
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:28,787
Then let us begin the eel round
only for Dong-gook.

509
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,323
He's here to take Yoon Nam-no down

510
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,759
and take Fabri's position on the show.

511
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,295
A mercenary with two Michelin stars,
Joseph.

512
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,231
This man wants to achieve a hat trick

513
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,067
with his Pot-riker today.

514
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,437
The man with two <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> stars,
Yoon Nam-no.

515
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,406
The eel match returns.

516
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,808
Which one of them will become the winner?

517
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,978
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

518
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,781
SALUTE

519
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,818
-He looks serious.
-Move it, Joseph!

520
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,921
This is a return match
between two who have fought before.

521
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,724
-And they're using eels again.
-They are.

522
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,259
He must be making the rice right away.

523
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,894
Are you making the hot pot rice now?

524
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,961
Will he have enough time?

525
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,496
Why is he using two pots?

526
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,631
Why are you making two pots?

527
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,467
-In case one of them burns.
-Yes, right.

528
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,469
That's a great idea.

529
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,105
Nam-no is quite meticulous.

530
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,774
You should've told Joseph
something like that.

531
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,943
HOW ABOUT JOSEPH
AS A FIRST-TIME CONTESTANT?

532
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,144
What's that, Joseph?

533
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,979
-Kiwi?
-Kiwi.

534
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,048
-Kiwi? Potato.
-Potato.

535
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,617
I guess he's using a potato.

536
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,319
He looks very serious

537
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,189
-as soon as he's focused.
-He does.

538
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,292
He doesn't seem like a first-timer.
He's very focused.

539
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,229
SLICING THE POTATO

540
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,198
He has quick hands too.

541
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,900
He's good.
He's really good with his knife.

542
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,304
Are you using the potato for the soup?

543
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,472
Come again?

544
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,475
Are you using the potato for the soup?

545
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,776
I didn't get that.

546
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,844
UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE

547
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,979
I'm sorry. I'm trying to focus.

548
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,616
-He can't multitask right now.
-So I can go home.

549
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,051
It's his first time on the show.

550
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,454
1. SLICE ONION AND GARLIC CLOVES

551
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,457
Look how passionate he is.

552
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,293
A RACEHORSE FOCUSED
ONLY ON HIS DISH

553
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,764
HE'S EXTRA-CALM TODAY

554
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,899
What are you
putting into the hot pot rice?

555
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,534
I think he added some <i>tsuyu</i>.

556
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,102
Did you just add <i>tsuyu</i> into the rice?

557
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,370
-Yes.
-I see.

558
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:26,938
FIRE

559
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,941
He's not afraid to use fire.

560
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,845
You'll wet your bed tonight.

561
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,082
-Enoki?
-Enoki.

562
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,651
ADD CHOPPED ENOKI AND SHIITAKE
INTO THE HOT POT RICE

563
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,521
-He added enoki and shiitake.
-Yes.

564
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,557
Chef Nam-no, what's that?

565
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,925
These are the pickled side dishes.

566
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,961
Green plum, artichoke,
perilla leaf, and mustard leaf.

567
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,532
He must be making
the side dishes he mentioned.

568
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:58,103
He means the Japanese kind,
pickled or salted vegetables.

569
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,739
We can think of it
as Japanese-style side dishes.

570
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,408
He keeps adding more stuff to the rice.

571
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,745
And he has to make two pots as plan B
in case one of them burns.

572
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,879
Yes.

573
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,515
If both turn out well,
we'll take one of them.

574
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,185
JOSEPH PULLS OUT PORK
BELLY INSTEAD OF EELS

575
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,486
He just got pork belly.

576
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,587
Pork belly.

577
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,223
He's using pork belly first
instead of eels.

578
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,791
Joseph uses pork belly.

579
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,829
WHEN IT'S GOLDEN BROWN,

580
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,667
HE STRAINS EVERYTHING
AND USES THE LARD

581
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,073
If he starts cooking that now,
will the potato turn soft in ten minutes?

582
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,810
You have 10 minutes and 20 seconds now.

583
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,380
Joseph has a carton of milk out.
He takes a look at the timer.

584
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,190
He begins to boil milk.

585
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,258
HAVING TROUBLE

586
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,630
HE FINALLY MANAGES
TO LIGHT IT UP

587
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,833
He begins to boil milk.

588
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,502
Joseph, you can light up
the fire in the middle.

589
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,403
-Which one?
-You can light up the fire in the middle.

590
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,072
-I see.
-You have ten minutes.

591
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,707
-Okay.
-Thank you.

592
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,275
He just raised the heat.

593
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,345
I may not seem like much of a help,
but I've been helping him.

594
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,247
A DASH OF PATRONIZING

595
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,516
But right now,
I haven't seen any of them use the eel.

596
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,718
-I'm not seeing the eel.
-We don't see the eel.

597
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,255
-He got it. There's the eel.
-He has it.

598
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,558
4. PARBOIL EELS IN BOILING WATER,
AND THEN COOL IN ICED WATER

599
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,959
He just parboiled those.

600
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,162
-He did, and then put them in iced water.
-In iced water?

601
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,698
I want to get rid of the sap.

602
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,267
-To get rid of the sap.
-The sap.

603
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,137
Can you see the milky white
plastic-like thing on the top?

604
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:43,842
We either peel off the skin
or boil it lightly to get rid of it.

605
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,277
I SEE

606
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,511
You can get rid of it after you boil it.

607
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,480
JOSEPH GRABS THE EEL TOO

608
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,915
Joseph just grabbed the eel too.

609
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,783
Joseph grabbed the eel.

610
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,618
Make big pieces, please.

611
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,021
Big pieces. Big ones.

612
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,123
It was too tiny on <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

613
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,092
-He cut them into bigger pieces today.
-He did.

614
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,094
I think he wants to steam it.

615
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,530
He poured beer into the pot.

616
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,365
Is he going to use beer to make the soup?

617
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,570
He's steaming the eel over beer.

618
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,905
-Really?
-He's steaming it over beer?

619
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,473
-He's steaming it?
-Over there.

620
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,143
-What's the difference?
-I wonder how it'll turn out.

621
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,048
Chef Nam-no boiled the eels,
cooled them in iced water,

622
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,316
and then pulled them out again.

623
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,485
I've never seen
that method of cooking eels.

624
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:31,389
Nam-no, are you
scraping something off the eels?

625
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,325
Yes, I scraped off the mucous membrane.

626
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,794
Where's my knife?

627
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,995
LOOKING AROUND

628
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,331
-What are you looking for?
-A long knife.

629
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,565
-Your knife?
-What?

630
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,168
-The time is ticking.
-What?

631
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,236
-Right here.
-Yes.

632
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,206
It was right in front of you.
Where were you looking?

633
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,808
He became shortsighted.

634
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,676
-He's in a rush.
-Yes, he became shortsighted.

635
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,011
IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOCCER COACHES' REVIEW

636
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,079
I couldn't see it.

637
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,981
It means he's that nervous.

638
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,583
Q. ARE YOU NERVOUS RIGHT NOW?

639
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,987
NO

640
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,023
He's cutting off the small bones.

641
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,125
He's chopping the bones off.

642
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,827
He's not cutting it.

643
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,199
HE'S DONE MAKING CUTS
INTO THE WHOLE EEL

644
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,734
He's crazy with the knife.

645
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,203
Nam-no, why are you making cuts
into the eels?

646
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,872
I'm removing the bones
just in case they're still left in.

647
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,841
-I see.
-There may be some small bones.

648
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,576
So they disappear with those few cuts?

649
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,846
He's an expert at working with eels.

650
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,581
He's very delicate.

651
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,416
And he just cut them in half.

652
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,487
Why is Joseph
trying to grind dried laver in a blender?

653
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,389
I think he's making
either laver purée or laver oil.

654
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,124
He's adding cooking oil into it.

655
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,659
-That's how you do it.
-Okay.

656
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,695
He's now blending
dried laver and cooking oil.

657
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,430
-He's making laver oil.
-Laver oil?

658
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,632
I've never heard of laver oil.

659
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,300
You have seven minutes.

660
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,705
He just boiled milk and…

661
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,308
Chowder is a kind of soup
people often make with milk.

662
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,111
HE SWITCHES TO A BIGGER POT

663
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,515
Joseph is looking busy.

664
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,950
-He's fast.
-Joseph is everywhere.

665
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,752
THE COOKING RACEHORSE
GETS BUSIER AND BUSIER

666
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:16,628
-Who do you want as your help?
-Who will it be?

667
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,763
Choi Hyun-suk. I knew it!

668
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,399
-Choi Hyun-suk. But his back hurts.
-Will you be okay?

669
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,701
Help!

670
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,436
Help!

671
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,872
-But his back hurts.
-It'll take a minute for him to get there.

672
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,709
-Help!
-Why did it have to be him?

673
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,910
What do you need help with?

674
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,945
HE CAN FINALLY HELP HIM
THE RIGHT WAY

675
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,349
-All four of these.
-These are a lot. All of these?

676
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,884
Yes, dice everything.

677
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,820
He just asked Hyun-suk to dice those.

678
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,655
He's chopping perilla leaves.

679
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,325
-Chef Nam-no, will you fry the eels?
-Yes.

680
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,260
Beer goes in!

681
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,029
He's making the batter.

682
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,466
HE MOVES QUICKLY
WHEN THE UNICHEF PERK BEGINS

683
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,501
EELS INTO THE BATTER

684
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,438
Hyun-suk has 25 seconds left.

685
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,140
Chef Hyun-suk, 20 seconds.

686
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,641
Don't get these mixed.

687
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,010
-These can't get mixed?
-Just these.

688
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,412
HE'S NOT MUCH OF A HELP NOW,
EITHER…

689
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,714
Nam-no!

690
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,050
HE HASN'T CHOPPED
THE QUAIL EGGS YET…

691
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,384
Hyun-suk, you're done.

692
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,053
-Gosh.
-No!

693
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,622
-Hyun-suk, you need to stop.
-Come back.

694
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,690
Thank you!

695
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,158
HE LIMPS AS HE WALKS AWAY

696
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,193
NAM-NO FINALLY BEGINS
TO FRY THE EELS

697
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,897
Gosh, the eels are
getting fried deliciously.

698
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,100
HOWEVER…

699
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,802
No, the heat is too high.

700
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,572
THE BATTER
IS SPLASHING EVERYWHERE

701
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,274
-Isn't it burnt?
-It's burnt.

702
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,676
The oil was too hot.

703
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,212
HE TRIES TO COOL IT DOWN
WITH THE BATTER

704
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,515
The oil is too hot right now.

705
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,085
-It's too hot. It's not working.
-Nam-no is in trouble.

706
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,553
The oil is too hot.

707
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,155
Pour more oil in.

708
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,790
HE QUICKLY ADDS MORE OIL

709
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,592
The oil is flying everywhere.

710
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,797
It's going to burn.

711
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,534
HE TRIES TO FRY IT AGAIN
AFTER PUTTING MORE OIL IN

712
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,769
Whoa, it's overflowing.

713
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,039
Can you turn the blender off?
Hasn't it been too long?

714
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,241
No, I have to mix it for a long time,

715
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
until it reaches 80 degrees.

716
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:15,246
When you mix it in a blender,
the temperature goes up,

717
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,248
and it adds more fragrance into the oil.

718
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,383
He's doing it intentionally?

719
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,919
That's why he has to keep it on.

720
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,488
Really? He had a reason
for keeping it on for too long.

721
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,857
Sung-ju, please report on
the current situation.

722
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,593
You have 4 minutes and 43 seconds left!

723
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,128
Hey, wait.

724
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,196
Are they going to finish?

725
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,297
-I don't see anything yet.
-Right?

726
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,632
You have 4 minutes and 43 seconds left!

727
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,267
Let me go out into the field.

728
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,336
-Joseph, let me see.
-No! I'm not ready yet.

729
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,104
QUICKLY ADDING MORE SALT

730
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,373
Isn't this going on for too long?

731
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,575
You're right.

732
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,277
It's perfect. Man.

733
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,213
He says it's perfect.

734
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,181
The soup. What's it like?

735
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,218
That must be the soup for Leedong-guk.

736
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,285
It's good.

737
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,521
Did you say it was good?

738
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,157
-You made it and said it was good?
-It's hot, so be careful.

739
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,525
Can you taste that?

740
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,759
Let me try the soup.

741
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,494
IS IT GOOD,
JUST AS JOSEPH CLAIMED?

742
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,431
Can he get his revenge
and turn the match around?

743
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,834
Can he get his revenge
and turn the match around?

744
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,506
It's too bland.

745
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,008
It's too bland?

746
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,276
Was this intentional?

747
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,011
Yes, I haven't put cheese in.

748
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:23,448
-He'll use cheese later.
-I see. He made it bland on purpose.

749
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,649
He's using only one hand.

750
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,519
PHEW

751
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,922
-You have 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
-You have 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

752
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,291
-Yes?
-It's too bland?

753
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,460
You've been frying the eels for a while.

754
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,128
-Yes.
-He's been frying it for a while.

755
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,796
What's this?

756
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,632
He pulls the eels out.

757
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,601
The fried eels.
These look thick and delicious.

758
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,738
THE FRIED EELS LOOK GREAT

759
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,607
It's been fried deliciously.

760
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,175
-He has three pieces.
-Nice color.

761
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,044
These look quite thick.

762
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,679
They look great.

763
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,916
-They look like fish and chips.
-Yes, like fish and chips.

764
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,019
-The first piece didn't go well.
-No.

765
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,354
The first piece of fried eel
didn't go well.

766
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,423
Do you want to try that ruined eel?

767
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,026
-The ruined eel…
-No, please don't.

768
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,961
He told me not to try it.

769
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,197
-He told me not to try it.
-You can't have that.

770
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,200
I think he's making the sauce.

771
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,269
-It can be too salty.
-Yes.

772
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,472
So I added some ginger and green onion
to neutralize the flavor.

773
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,041
And you made it less salty.

774
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,043
Three minutes left!

775
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,110
TIME TO THINK

776
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,612
Dried laver.

777
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,952
7. CHOP DRIED LAVER

778
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,055
IT'S JOSEPH'S TURN
TO PULL OUT THE EEL

779
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,091
He just grabbed the steamed eel.

780
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,726
SCRAPING THE MUCOUS OFF

781
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,294
He's scraping it off.

782
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,097
-Eels must be tough to work with.
-Yes.

783
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,598
Two minutes!

784
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,800
You have two minutes.

785
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,435
-Is it big enough?
-Yes.

786
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,904
-It's quite big.
-He's now…

787
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,706
What's that?

788
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,908
Green plum soy sauce.

789
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,111
He didn't make cuts into the fish,
but he tops it with soy sauce.

790
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,114
He's going to broil it with a torch.

791
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,987
It's not lighting up.

792
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,324
It's not lighting up.

793
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,827
Whoa, a fire show.

794
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,164
He's broiling the eel right now
and adding the smoky flavor.

795
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,866
You have enough time, so move slowly.

796
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,502
He's pouring soy sauce
as he broils the fish.

797
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,938
My gosh. That's right over the fire.

798
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,407
Yes, right now…

799
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,809
He's now broiling the fish.

800
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,778
Eels taste good
when it's cooked directly over fire.

801
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,880
-My gosh.
-Does it look okay?

802
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,749
-Joseph.
-Richer.

803
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,218
It looks hot, Joseph. It's hot.

804
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,487
Are you okay?

805
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,322
HE'S LIKE A MAIN CHARACTER
OF A SUPERHERO MOVIE

806
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,524
Are you okay?

807
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,027
What's he saying?

808
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,461
HE NEEDS A TRANSLATOR

809
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,863
It's an English slang.

810
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,165
Just do it.

811
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,402
I don't get what he's saying,
but he lights the stove again.

812
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,670
-You have 30 seconds left!
-You have 30 seconds.

813
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,706
You only have 30 seconds left.

814
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,307
CHECKING THE HOT POT RICE
WITH 30 SECONDS LEFT

815
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,375
You have 30 seconds.

816
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,412
WHICH ONE OF THE TWO POTS
SURVIVED?

817
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,479
The pots of rice are done.

818
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,149
TAKING A BITE OF THIS FIRST

819
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,086
-This one is better. It turned out better.
-Which one was better?

820
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,154
-Which one?
-This one.

821
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,989
This one? It looks great.

822
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,125
He doesn't need his plan B.

823
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,061
You have 17 seconds left.

824
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,829
-The whole thing?
-Just like that?

825
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,297
IT LOOKS FANTASTIC

826
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,766
ANXIOUS…

827
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,135
THE RACEHORSE
SPRINTS TOWARD THE END

828
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,071
8. MAKE THE SAUCE
BY MIXING PORK BELLY,

829
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,572
PERILLA LEAF AND QUAIL EGGS
IN SOY SAUCE

830
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,142
Joseph makes the sauce,
and it looks like a side dish.

831
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,846
HE BEGINS TO SERVE THE DISH

832
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,914
And he puts it onto a plate.

833
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,150
You have 17 seconds left.

834
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,518
9. PUT SAUCE ON THE PLATE
AND TOP IT WITH EEL

835
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,121
Your time's almost up. Ten seconds!

836
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,623
The soup!

837
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,691
Seven. Six.

838
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,395
-Five. Four. Three.
-Five. Four. Three.

839
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,730
-Four. Three.
-Four. Three.

840
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,699
-Two. One.
-Two. One.

841
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,501
-It's over. Ring it!
-Ring the bell!

842
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,571
Joseph finishes first. And then,

843
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,738
Nam-no is done too.

844
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,842
-They did it.
-Gosh.

845
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,845
You spent a while on the laver oil.
Did you put it in?

846
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,881
-The laver oil.
-May I pour it on the dish?

847
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,117
-No.
-You can't do it right now.

848
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,619
-You can't do it.
-Push the table.

849
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,489
-Push the table.
-Yes, send it away first.

850
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,558
-Push it first, and then figure it out.
-Yes.

851
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,194
Can you put this over there?

852
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:34,265
The eel dishes for Dong-gook are
both finished.

853
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,367
Great job, both of you.

854
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,905
-Look at Joseph's hair.
-He's a mess.

855
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,406
I thought you just woke up.

856
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,576
But now,

857
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,545
before Dong-gook gets to try it,

858
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,515
there are two things we must discuss.

859
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,519
Chef Joseph worked hard on the laver oil,

860
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,622
but he forgot to use it
and left it in the blender.

861
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:01,092
Chef Nam-no made his soy sauce,

862
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,694
but he brought it out
after he rang the bell.

863
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,397
If you two come to a term,

864
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,066
you may use
both the laver oil and the soy sauce.

865
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,134
What do you say?

866
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,603
I'm fine with it.

867
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,172
I won't negotiate.

868
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,640
Whoa, he's cold.

869
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:19,610
-I won't negotiate.
-Why not?

870
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,381
-What are you talking about?
-He's fine without it.

871
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,882
-That's a surprise.
-That's it.

872
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,950
He doesn't need the soy sauce.

873
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,253
-The laver oil is a bigger deal.
-Yes, the laver oil.

874
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,454
No.

875
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,791
I have a feeling
that the laver oil adds flavor,

876
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,693
but the soy sauce adds
to the level of seasoning.

877
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,995
-If they leave both out,
-He's at a disadvantage.

878
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,931
it's definitely worse for Nam-no.

879
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,233
Isn't Dong-gook
in the worst situation, then?

880
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,235
I want to enjoy a delicious meal.

881
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,572
Because he bought those eels
and left them in the fridge.

882
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,909
-He's been waiting for today.
-It's a special occasion.

883
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,978
You both left something out,

884
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,948
-so will you come to a term?
-Yes, we will. We'll use both.

885
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,150
-That's good.
-You'll both use the seasoning.

886
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,586
I almost had plain rice
without any soy sauce.

887
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,856
NO KIDS ALLOWED!
AN EEL DISH JUST FOR DONG-GOOK

888
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:11,095
STEAMED AND TORCHED EEL

889
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:16,167
CHEF JOSEPH'S LEEDONG-GUK

890
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,837
-Joseph, you may put the laver oil on.
-Put it on.

891
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,573
This could've been bad news for him.

892
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,544
But above all, they came to a term
because of Dong-gook.

893
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,514
Lee Dong-gook will
have a bite of Leedong-guk.

894
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,017
Isn't this way too special for me?

895
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,218
Don't say that.

896
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,687
-Today is your day.
-You couldn't have it at home.

897
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,690
-You had to follow your kids' diet.
-That's right.

898
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:44,161
You can scoop out
the eel and the sauce at the bottom.

899
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,230
There's something under the soup.

900
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,466
<i>-The pork.</i>
<i>-Pork belly and perilla leaf.</i>

901
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,602
<i>-Yes, the pork.</i>
<i>-I love pork too.</i>

902
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:54,171
It tasted bland when I had just the soup.

903
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,740
Something was underneath.

904
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,541
There's something red. And the eel…

905
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,910
He was going to put that in.

906
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm very satisfied with how it looks.

907
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,347
He broiled it.

908
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,484
-He could never have eels at home.
-No.

909
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,152
-It's been so long.
-Enjoy it as much as you want today.

910
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,221
-It's a dish just for him.
-It's been so long.

911
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,324
Lee Dong-gook tries Leedong-guk.

912
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,226
-His eyes.
-Yes, his eyes.

913
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,562
I can sense the eel's presence.

914
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,930
-The eel?
-Yes.

915
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,133
-It's almost bouncy.
-The texture must be nice.

916
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,001
You steamed the eel, right?

917
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,271
-He steamed it first.
-He did, then he broiled it with a torch.

918
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,074
He broiled it with some soy sauce.

919
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,443
I've never had anything like this before.

920
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,779
But it's something I'll grow to like.

921
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,014
I see. You like it.

922
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,417
And the spicy sauce here

923
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,987
adds some refreshing spiciness
after the initial creamy soup.

924
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,388
-It adds a new flavor.
-Yes.

925
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,490
He tries it with the soup.

926
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,328
-It'll taste great with bread.
-Will Dong-gook like it?

927
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,732
It's made perfectly for my appetite.
It's very smooth too.

928
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,402
If someone sold this at a restaurant,
I'd go over and eat it.

929
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,705
A GREAT COMPLIMENT

930
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,673
He poured some laver oil at the end,

931
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,743
-so did that do something?
-Yes, I want to know that too.

932
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,712
It looked pretty.

933
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,280
-When he added the oil?
-Yes.

934
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,684
I'm not so good at expressing
what my food tastes like.

935
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,687
But I'm starting to find words
as I continue to eat it.

936
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,689
-It gave you words.
-Yes, it gave me new words.

937
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,391
It was a taste that gave him new words.

938
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,095
A HOT POT RICE THAT'LL SCORE
INTO DONG-GOOK'S APPETITE

939
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:30,301
THE FRIED EEL
AWAITS THE HAT TRICK

940
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,172
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S POT-RIKER

941
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:40,511
-It looks great.
-Two eels can get me going until tomorrow.

942
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,913
May I serve it for you?

943
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,882
-Come on over.
-Right, you have to cut it.

944
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,884
He's cutting it into pieces.

945
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,353
I get why you didn't ring the bell first.

946
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,756
-He had to let it sit.
-Because he made rice in a pot.

947
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,091
-And it can get scorched too.
-Yes, right.

948
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,095
HE DIGS UP SCORCHED RICE

949
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,231
He may not have caught it
if he had it alone.

950
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,932
-It looks good.
-What about the eel?

951
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,335
-The soy sauce.
-You would've been in trouble without it.

952
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,737
No, I already seasoned the rice.

953
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,140
-Yes, he seasoned it already.
-Right. He did that.

954
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,374
He used tsuyu.

955
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,178
Wrap the piece of eel with laver
as your first bite.

956
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,181
The best striker Korea has seen.

957
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,317
The striker eats Pot-riker.

958
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,053
I wonder what it's like.

959
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,922
I'll try it.

960
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:25,990
A BITE OF THE EEL IN DRIED LAVER

961
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,794
I wonder what it's like.

962
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,129
The striker eats the pot-riker.

963
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,398
The rice

964
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,501
-turned out very nicely.
-Was it perfect?

965
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,771
It's a wonder that he did this
in such a short while.

966
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,574
And the fried eel?

967
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,142
I love it. I love the texture.

968
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,645
-You love the texture.
-Texture is important for eels.

969
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,980
That's why I like eels.
I love the texture.

970
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,715
It was the texture.

971
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,217
How is it seasoned?

972
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,153
-It's seasoned a bit…
-A bit?

973
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,355
-A bit…
-There's his review.

974
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:59,890
The Ahn Sung-jae of food reviews.

975
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,859
If he had to review this,
he'd go, "A bit…"

976
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,995
It would've been a bit bland
without the soy sauce.

977
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,700
-The soy sauce played a big role.
-He would've been in trouble without it.

978
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,835
It would've been bad without it.

979
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,437
-He likes his food a bit saltier.
-Yes.

980
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,872
-With the rice.
-A big bite.

981
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,273
He takes a big scoop out.

982
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,212
Dong-gook always keeps the chopsticks
between his fingers when he eats.

983
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,314
-Like that?
-At the same time?

984
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,748
Don't you all eat like this?

985
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,651
Your kids steal your food often
when you eat at home, right?

986
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,920
That's why you want to eat quickly.

987
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,589
His chopsticks are ready to go.

988
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,290
He tries a bite.

989
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,926
Dong-gook doesn't drop his chopsticks.

990
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,695
YOU POOR THING…

991
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,363
Wait, what's…

992
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,165
You put in lots of veggies too, right?

993
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,201
I added four types of pickled veggies.

994
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,037
-I wanted to make the rice taste good.
-Yes, he put something in.

995
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,707
He topped the rice
with pickled vegetables.

996
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,176
-Is it good with the veggies?
-Yes, it's great.

997
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,711
Let's try their dishes too.

998
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,548
First, Joseph's Leedong-guk.

999
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,149
The laver oil smells strong.

1000
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:03,587
It would've been too greasy
without the gochujang sauce.

1001
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,091
The quail eggs add such a twist
when I suddenly chew a piece.

1002
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:11,362
I believe the texture is
the most important when it comes to eels.

1003
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,098
He steamed it briefly

1004
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,967
-and brought out its bouncy texture.
-He did.

1005
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,769
How was it, Fabri?

1006
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,039
I thought it was good,

1007
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,909
but the eel should've taken
the main stage.

1008
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,879
The flavor wasn't too strong
for this dish.

1009
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,483
Do you think he's saying that

1010
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,085
because the two have similar characters?

1011
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,054
What?

1012
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,558
-So we don't need two international chefs?
-Only one will survive.

1013
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:44,461
-No, you all…
-He's keeping him in check.

1014
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,464
We've been friends for a long time.
What's with you?

1015
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,766
It was good.

1016
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,269
-It's too late.
-It's too late. What's with you?

1017
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,038
Please don't take me the wrong way.

1018
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,474
Gosh, what is this flavor?

1019
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,910
A FLAVOR
THAT MAKES HIM EAT IT UP

1020
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,278
You finished it.

1021
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,915
I thought it would've been delicious
with a piece of bread.

1022
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,252
It would've been great
when you dip it with some bread.

1023
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,420
Yes, really.

1024
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:10,854
But he didn't serve it with bread

1025
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,189
or bring out the eel flavor?

1026
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,259
AVOIDING THE QUESTION

1027
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,627
He's holding him in check.

1028
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,864
-And next, Pot-riker.
-The fried eel.

1029
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,268
SAVORING

1030
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:28,238
Nam-il is eating this up.

1031
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:32,610
The vacuum cleaner is on yet again!

1032
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,246
His training from last week is

1033
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,382
-paying off.
-It's Poong's training.

1034
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,151
My training is finally paying off.

1035
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,988
HE NOW BECAME A DISHWASHER
INSTEAD OF A VACUUM CLEANER

1036
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,489
He's a vacuum cleaner.

1037
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,658
-I tasted some pickled veggies at the end.
-Yes.

1038
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,961
-The savory flavor makes it even better.
-It does.

1039
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:54,031
The fried eel seemed greasy,
but the veggies helped.

1040
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,567
-It holds the flavor together.
-It does.

1041
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,737
Not only was the rice good,
but it also smelled great.

1042
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,539
The fragrance of the mushroom
and pickled veggies

1043
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,009
-all mixed in nicely inside.
-Yes, it was nice.

1044
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,276
How was it, Fabri?

1045
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,514
The fried eel was quite appealing
with its crunchy texture.

1046
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,883
The rice and the pickled veggies

1047
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,554
came together in perfect harmony.

1048
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,490
-He's too biased.
-He is.

1049
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,125
-He's biased.
-Any downsides?

1050
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,127
Did he forget to emphasize the eel flavor?

1051
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,396
-The eel…
-How was the eel?

1052
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,463
What about the eel?

1053
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,399
I could taste the eel in this dish.

1054
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,001
-He could taste it.
-He could.

1055
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,536
He's too biased.

1056
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,106
-Nam-no would've won if Fabri picked.
-Exactly.

1057
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,109
-Don't take me the wrong way.
-We aren't.

1058
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,711
We're just suspicious.

1059
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:44,982
Which one of the two
will the fridge owner choose?

1060
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,284
Press one for Yoon Nam-no.

1061
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,119
Press two for Joseph.

1062
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,055
This is a return match
after <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

1063
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,357
-It's so hard to choose.
-I see.

1064
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,760
You can pick whichever one
you liked better.

1065
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,930
-I pressed one.
-You did?

1066
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,498
OH, GOSH

1067
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,967
THEIR HEARTS ARE POUNDING

1068
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,870
They're in a frenzy right now.

1069
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,507
Which one of them was chosen by Dong-gook?

1070
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,076
Let's find out. Show us!

1071
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,912
No kids allowed, eel dish.

1072
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,881
Will Joseph get his

1073
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:21,685
after his loss during the eel round
in <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>?

1074
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:26,724
Or once again, will Nam-no
win against Joseph when it comes to eel?

1075
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,393
Will he seize the victory both times?

1076
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,464
Show us Dong-gook's choice!

1077
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,965
Show us!

1078
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,468
Who won the eel round?

1079
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,638
JOSEPH WINS

1080
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,707
CHEF JOSEPH'S LEEDONG-GUK WINS

1081
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,277
It's Joseph?

1082
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,153
FABRI RUNS OUT AS SOON
AS HE SEES JOSEPH'S VICTORY

1083
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,589
Sung-ju, you need to see this.

1084
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,024
I'M CELEBRATING WITH HIM

1085
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,260
Fabri, stop putting on an act.

1086
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,830
A year! That took me a year!

1087
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,533
Joseph gets his revenge.

1088
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,503
After a year and three months,

1089
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,440
Joseph finally gets
his revenge on Nam-no by using eels.

1090
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,209
-But this was very delicious too.
-Yes?

1091
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,545
-Chef Nam-no's dish?
-Yes, it was very delicious.

1092
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,983
But I personally prefer steamed dishes

1093
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,753
-compared to deep-fried dishes.
-That was his preference.

1094
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,823
Above all, this was named

1095
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,858
-Leedong-guk.
-Leedong-guk.

1096
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,528
He couldn't turn down Leedong-guk.

1097
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,897
The vacuum cleaner is in shock.

1098
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,367
I personally liked this eel dish.

1099
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,835
-I see.
-That's what you like.

1100
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:46,737
I'm just saying.

1101
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,372
THE VACUUM CLEANER IS ON

1102
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,706
Why should he choose this for you?

1103
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,608
Don't bother asking my opinion, then.

1104
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,044
He thought
Dong-gook would pick the same one.

1105
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,847
Joseph, you got your revenge.

1106
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,248
How do you feel?

1107
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,252
I finally won, so this is great.

1108
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,689
-The score is one to one.
-It's one to one, so next time,

1109
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,425
-we'll have to do one final match.
-Yes.

1110
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,127
Fabri picked the wrong dish.

1111
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,429
No, I'm very happy.

1112
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,164
HE SOUNDS SO SINCERE

1113
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,066
Why are you so good at lying?

1114
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,935
I'm very happy for him.

1115
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,873
-Our viewers will be the judge.
-They'll be the judge.

1116
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,942
Please put a star on Joseph.

1117
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,878
-This was his first day here.
-Yet he takes his first victory.

1118
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,947
-Congratulations.
-He takes his first star!

1119
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,049
You can go home, Joseph.

1120
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,017
He gets his revenge.

1121
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,485
This is his first victory.

1122
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,687
Bravo.

1123
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:43,327
This is the second round
with Dong-gook's ingredients.

1124
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,028
Make a dish only of Dong-gook,

1125
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,697
only according to Dong-gook

1126
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,332
and only for Dong-gook

1127
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,435
which tastes the richest.

1128
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:55,272
We need someone older
to meet his appetite as an older guy,

1129
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,608
-but those two are our youngest.
-You're right.

1130
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,142
Can they satisfy this older man?

1131
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,512
-Chef Gyeong-jun was born in July 1994.
-July 1994.

1132
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,682
-Sung-jun, in January 1995.
-He's younger.

1133
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,652
What do they know
about a middle-aged man's appetite?

1134
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,421
-They should be sucking on popsicles.
-Popsicles?

1135
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,690
Sung-jun was born early in 1995.

1136
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,793
You probably went to school
with friends born in 1994.

1137
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,395
Well, I don't have friends.

1138
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,266
-What was that?
-He has no friends?

1139
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,968
To put it simply,
I'm the cutest and youngest of the show.

1140
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,838
-Please remember that.
-I see.

1141
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,206
Can you call Gyeong-jun <i>hyung</i>?

1142
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,307
What? Gyeong-jun <i>hyung</i>?

1143
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:31,575
This is too weird.

1144
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,678
This is awkward.

1145
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,048
Well, he took down the big fish before,

1146
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,883
-and he's Little Hyun-suk.
-That's right.

1147
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,486
-He should be easy to deal with.
-Yes.

1148
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:43,954
He got the original one,

1149
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,722
so the little one must be too easy.

1150
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:46,790
-Right?
-That's why

1151
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,559
I feel less nervous today.

1152
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,062
He's less nervous today.

1153
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:57,200
However, Chef Gyeong-jun said
this order was made for him.

1154
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,735
He stated very confidently.

1155
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,238
My family is all from Gyeongsang Province.

1156
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,341
-So, I love that kind of spicy flavor.
-Spicy flavor.

1157
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,442
Spicy flavor.

1158
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,511
What was that word he used?
Was it a dialect?

1159
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,578
Is that a new word?

1160
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,681
He was using a dialect. Right.

1161
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,149
Did you understand that?

1162
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,117
I'm pretty much in Seoul now.

1163
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,787
Hey, he's pretty much a Seoulite.

1164
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,322
He's a Seoulite.

1165
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,923
The spicy flavor.

1166
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,093
It's not just spicy.
It's almost refreshing.

1167
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,361
It's a bit spicy,

1168
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,331
but it adds that bit of refreshing note.

1169
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,900
-It adds some savory taste.
-Yes.

1170
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,601
Even this morning,

1171
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,603
I had the beef and radish soup
cooked in Gyeongsang Province style.

1172
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,639
-I had that this morning.
-The spicy and refreshing version.

1173
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:40,510
Our production crew
overheard Sung-jun and Nam-no

1174
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,713
-chatting discreetly in the green room.
-What did they say?

1175
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,414
That Gyeong-jun didn't have

1176
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:45,849
the good vibes.

1177
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,085
THE ANTI-GOOD VIBES
CAME TOGETHER

1178
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,554
They agree with Jong-won, though.

1179
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,622
-They drew a line.
-What's their difference?

1180
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,259
I can tell as the president
of the Anti-Good Vibes Association

1181
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,463
-that he doesn't have the good vibes look.
-No?

1182
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,732
Someone with good vibes is
like Chef Jong-won,

1183
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,134
-someone who comes with elegance.
-I see.

1184
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,838
-<i>Grace, style, and experience.</i>
-<i>He has no grace or style?</i>

1185
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:09,439
We need to see some elegance,

1186
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,109
but my dear Gyeong-jun here

1187
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,978
has that farmhand kind of vibe.

1188
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,713
He's more "farmhand" than good vibes.

1189
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,816
But if he wins today,
let's say he has good vibes too.

1190
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,386
I'll win today
and be one of the good vibes.

1191
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,388
-Let's do that.
-Let's get it settled.

1192
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,390
He'll win and join the good vibes.

1193
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,493
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: BONE BROTH,
LIQUID SEASONING, BULGOGI SAUCE, SHIITAKE

1194
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,728
PORK CUTLET SAUCE, TENDERLOIN, SOFT TOFU,
CHEDDAR, PORK BELLY, CABBAGE, AND MORE

1195
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,530
My dish is called

1196
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,699
Self-Inflicted Tofu Hell.

1197
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,834
-Self-Inflicted Tofu Hell?
-Self-Inflicted Tofu Hell?

1198
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,870
Isn't that something
from <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>?

1199
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,371
-Is this the sequel?
-The tofu hell?

1200
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,473
We had a mission called the tofu hell.

1201
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,276
<i>We had to use only tofu to cook.</i>

1202
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,146
Sadly, I was so good
at the previous mission,

1203
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,983
-<i>so I didn't get to do it.</i>
-<i>He didn't do it.</i>

1204
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,153
-He got the free pass.
-He just passed.

1205
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,588
I was too good
and couldn't do it back then.

1206
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:03,427
When we took a look at his fridge,
I saw many packs of tofu.

1207
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,029
So I wanted
to put myself into that tofu hell

1208
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,931
and make something
that older men would like

1209
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:11,334
-to lead him into tofu paradise.
-I see.

1210
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,071
-I'll make three kinds of tofu dishes.
-Three?

1211
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,338
-Three dishes?
-For real?

1212
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,874
The first one is rich and spicy…

1213
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,276
And what else? Re…

1214
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,744
-Refreshing?
-Refreshingly spicy.

1215
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,380
I'll make refreshingly spicy tofu hot pot

1216
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,549
with some dumplings.

1217
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,484
-Dumplings.
-Those are all my favorites.

1218
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,687
I'll also make
braised soft tofu with perilla.

1219
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,888
Braised soft tofu with perilla?

1220
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,525
Lastly, I want to make something
that'll taste salty and sweet,

1221
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,060
so I'll make tofu steak too.

1222
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,196
-That sounds good.
-All three sounds great.

1223
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,698
CHEF GYEONG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS:
DOENJANG WITH MANILA CLAM, LEMON

1224
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,366
PICKLED PERILLA LEAF, ABALONE, SHIITAKE,
TOFU, MANILA CLAM MEAT, NAPA CABBAGE

1225
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,302
The dish I'll make is

1226
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,370
Abalone-ing Matfia Down.

1227
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,739
-Abalone-ing Matfia Down?
-Abalone-ing Matfia Down?

1228
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,975
He'll put Matfia down with abalone.

1229
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,377
He wants to flick him out of the show.

1230
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,947
-He's very tough today.
-He'll turn him upside down.

1231
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,582
I'm going to make braised abalones.

1232
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,383
I also plan to fry some tofu

1233
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,187
-and use <i>doenjang</i> with Manila clams.
-I see.

1234
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,891
It'll taste rich and thick
like seasoned <i>doenjang</i> sauce.

1235
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:12,462
<i>It'll be a mix of seasoned doenjang sauce</i>
<i>and XO sauce from Hong Kong.</i>

1236
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,297
-It'll be thick.
-Yes.

1237
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,666
-I look forward to both.
-It's a highly anticipated round.

1238
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,770
And now, let us begin their cook-off.

1239
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,740
He'll take down
both show-off chefs of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>

1240
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,777
and rise up as the king of the show,
Chef Bae Gyeong-jun.

1241
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:31,214
But he's here to be the king of this show
and not just <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>,

1242
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:35,886
the youngest yet strongest of the show,
Chef Kwon Sung-jun.

1243
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:39,122
Who'll be the king of this round?

1244
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,691
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1245
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,198
They get to it right away.

1246
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,766
THERMOMETER

1247
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,402
It's 170 degrees. Perfect.

1248
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:55,405
Gyeong-jun checks the temperature
as soon as we begin.

1249
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,641
-It was kind of cool.
-He showed his expertise.

1250
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,276
Sung-jun, why won't you
check the temperature?

1251
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,611
-I can still win without doing that.
-You can win without that?

1252
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,746
COMPLETELY SHOWING OFF

1253
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,048
He doesn't need to do that.

1254
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,218
-I see. Is that pork belly?
-It's pork belly.

1255
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,520
-He's using tenderloin and pork belly.
-And tenderloin.

1256
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,455
He's not only using tofu.

1257
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,025
Sung-jun gets some meat ready.

1258
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,627
Chef Gyeong-jun has very long fingers.

1259
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,363
Right? Even his fingers are good-looking.

1260
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,466
Even his fingers are good-looking?

1261
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,503
His fingers are quite long.

1262
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,171
Yes, you're right.

1263
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,607
-He has pretty hands.
-I'm jealous.

1264
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:31,875
I'LL SHOW MY HANDS TOO

1265
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,543
1. BOIL GREEN ONION IN OIL
TO MAKE GREEN ONION OIL

1266
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,679
Can he make three dishes?

1267
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,814
DON'T LET IT BOIL OVER

1268
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,416
It's perfect.

1269
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,652
-Is he making green onion oil?
-He is.

1270
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,721
The green onion… That's a lot of oil.

1271
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,289
Isn't that too much oil?

1272
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,391
He's chopping green onion for now.

1273
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,026
ATTENTION, EVERYONE!

1274
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,628
He's like, "Eyes on me."

1275
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:55,031
-That's his hustle play.
-Yes.

1276
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:59,035
From here, I can see that the part
in his hair is almost too meticulous.

1277
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,372
Even a truck can drive on that.

1278
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,007
He might even have a rest area.

1279
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,108
Like on the highway?

1280
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,077
He'll have to set up a toll gate.

1281
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,781
Why would a truck drive by?

1282
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,617
2. ADD PORK BELLY
CHOPPED ONION, GARLIC,

1283
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:14,684
AND SESAME OIL INTO A HOT POT

1284
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,920
Minced garlic and meat, pork belly.

1285
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,723
-And sesame oil too.
-Sesame oil.

1286
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,891
GYEONG-JUN CONTINUES
TO CHECK THE TEMPERATURE

1287
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,260
He's measuring the temperature again.

1288
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,462
-The temperature must be important.
-Chef Gyeong-jun!

1289
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,163
Is the temperature important?

1290
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,632
Is the temperature important?

1291
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,667
-I didn't want it to burn.
-He doesn't want it to burn.

1292
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,504
It's better to check
than to burn something.

1293
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,373
-That's his personality.
-He likes to check.

1294
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,308
Otherwise, he could fail.

1295
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,545
HE DICES TOFU
INTO PERFECT PIECES

1296
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:44,814
AND THE ABALONE

1297
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:45,882
He gets the abalone.

1298
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,551
He gets the abalone
of Abalone-ing Matfia Down.

1299
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,322
-Are you using the innards?
-I'm not.

1300
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,891
What if he hurts his hand?
Watch your hand.

1301
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,161
We use a spoon in case we get hurt,
but he uses a knife.

1302
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,796
No, that's a spatula.

1303
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:00,830
CHUCKLES

1304
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,198
It is?

1305
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:06,136
-Poong thought it was a knife, but no.
-It's because he uses a spoon.

1306
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:10,106
Don't we all use spoons to get abalone?
It's much safer.

1307
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,109
HE PUTS THE ABALONES
INTO A PLASTIC BAG

1308
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,779
He begins to beat the abalones.

1309
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,747
He's beating up the abalones.

1310
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,317
-Why is he doing that?
-To do what?

1311
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,018
-He's tenderizing them.
-To make them softer.

1312
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:25,488
We can do that with octopuses
to make them tender too.

1313
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,123
I think that's what he's doing.

1314
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,459
But instead of using a hammer,

1315
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,295
he's just lightly banging on it.

1316
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,697
I WON'T LOSE AGAINST HIM!

1317
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,465
HE PEELS A PIECE OF RADISH

1318
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,167
AND BEGINS TO CHOP IT

1319
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,268
Look at him chopping.

1320
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,772
I think Sung-jun is the king
among the show-off chefs.

1321
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,240
I see. When it comes to chopping?

1322
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:47,143
No, I think he shows off more than I do.

1323
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,380
He'll turn into a horrendous person
once he settles into a position.

1324
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,283
Sung-jun chopped up some green onion too.

1325
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,421
HE POURS BONE BROTH
INTO THE HOT POT

1326
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:02,525
HALF OF THE ENOKI MUSHROOMS

1327
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,363
He put gochujang into the bone broth.

1328
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,631
He's using bone broth?

1329
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,505
GYEONG-JUN FINISHES MAKING
THE GREEN ONION OIL

1330
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,774
TOFU GOES IN!

1331
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,211
-Whoa.
-It looks too hot.

1332
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,380
HELLO

1333
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,782
-Did he throw it into the oil?
-Was it the abalones?

1334
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,818
-It was tofu.
-Are you deep-frying tofu?

1335
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,920
It looks too hot.

1336
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,856
He checks the temperature once again.

1337
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,190
-Is it okay?
-It's fine.

1338
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:37,727
The temperature is fine.
Gyeong-jun is very meticulous.

1339
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,096
I thought it might catch a fire.

1340
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,431
GOING INTO HIS POCKET

1341
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:44,567
It looks like Gyeong-jun is moving faster.

1342
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,803
He begins to beat the abalone again.

1343
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,706
-Why won't he use a hammer?
-Why not?

1344
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,009
-You have ten minutes.
-The tofu.

1345
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,911
-You have under ten minutes.
-What's that?

1346
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,013
Already?

1347
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,415
What are you doing, Sung-jun?

1348
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,850
-Perilla.
-He's adding powdered perilla seeds.

1349
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,286
-Is that powdered perilla seeds?
-He said he'd braise it.

1350
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,388
That and crushed soft tofu?

1351
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,857
He said he'd braise soft tofu.

1352
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,261
That'll taste totally Korean.

1353
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,999
THE SECOND PACK OF TOFU IS UP

1354
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,537
Sung-jun makes tofu hot pot.

1355
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,574
WHAT'S THE THIRD TOFU HELL?

1356
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,877
It looks like he'll grind some pork.

1357
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,579
He added starch to the beef.

1358
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,080
He added starch to the beef?

1359
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,282
Did you add medicine?

1360
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,617
-It's bulgogi sauce.
-Bulgogi sauce?

1361
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,619
-And an egg.
-Egg yolk.

1362
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,422
AND TOFU!

1363
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,759
8. BLEND PORK BELLY,
TENDERLOIN, STARCH,

1364
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,093
BULGOGI SAUCE,
EGG YOLK, AND TOFU

1365
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,328
He's blending everything.

1366
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,232
He added beef inside too.

1367
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,301
-He threw in an egg yolk too.
-Yes.

1368
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:56,606
Wait, Chef Gyeong-jun
just put abalone between cabbage leaves.

1369
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,175
It's napa cabbage,
perilla leaf, and then abalone.

1370
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,511
-Napa cabbage, perilla leaf, and abalone?
-Yes.

1371
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,046
-And lemon.
-And lemon.

1372
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,815
-I think he'll steam that.
-He'll steam that?

1373
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,484
-Where's that going?
-Where?

1374
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,820
-Into a steamer.
-To a steamer.

1375
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,489
Will something change when you steam it?

1376
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,757
-It'll smell good.
-It'll smell good.

1377
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,993
Will you use just the abalones?

1378
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,229
MANILA CLAM MEAT AND GARLIC

1379
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,030
Will you use just the abalones
after steaming them?

1380
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,167
-I'll use that, cabbage, and the perilla.
-Everything?

1381
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,802
So I get to eat everything?

1382
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,306
He threw in Manila clam meat
into the green onion oil.

1383
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,774
Manila clam meat into the oil?

1384
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,444
He chopped it finely before he put it in.

1385
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,313
He threw in the clam meat and garlic.

1386
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,084
ADDING SPICINESS
WITH CHEONGYANG PEPPER

1387
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,889
HE CHOPS THE PEPPER
INTO FINE PIECES

1388
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,957
Seven minutes.

1389
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,126
-Okay.
-Seven minutes left.

1390
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,898
-Sung-jun has to make three dishes.
-Yes.

1391
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,767
-It's almost like sausage.
-He's making three dishes.

1392
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,302
He blended everything together.

1393
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,370
Did he add tofu?

1394
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:01,971
-He did.
-He'll have to shape that now.

1395
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,941
That's why it was colored like that.

1396
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,209
It's tofu steak.

1397
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,379
7. GRILL THE BATTER IN A PAN
TO MAKE TOFU STEAK

1398
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,948
It looks like that pink fish meat sausage.

1399
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,017
-It's been blended finely.
-Yes.

1400
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,286
He's making three tofu dishes.

1401
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,755
Sung-jun passed the tofu mission

1402
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,157
on <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>
without actually doing it.

1403
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,727
GYEONG-JUN PULLS OUT
GREEN ONION AGAIN

1404
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:25,995
GENTLY

1405
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,698
Is he using one layer of green onion?

1406
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,834
Green onions have a thin layer of film.

1407
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,337
He's removing that
to chop it as thinly as possible.

1408
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,438
The thin film layer?

1409
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,540
That's what we usually do
to make chopped green onion.

1410
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,576
We cut out just the white part
and chop it into thin pieces.

1411
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,011
There's not much time.
When will you finish?

1412
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,013
You're making it look too nice.

1413
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,784
Does that do something?

1414
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,753
He's adding those detailed touches.
It goes into iced water.

1415
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,555
-The detailed touch.
-It's the garnish.

1416
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:53,623
-The garnish?
-Yes.

1417
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,292
Gyeong-jun is spending lots of time
trying to make it look good.

1418
00:59:56,859 --> 01:00:00,129
7. ADD FRIED GREEN ONION AND TOFU
INTO THE MANILA CLAM SAUCE

1419
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,566
His soup dish is almost done.

1420
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,769
-One's red, the other is…
-Made with powdered perilla seeds.

1421
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,439
PUTTING IN INSTANT RICE

1422
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,375
One hot pot, one braised dish,
and one tofu steak.

1423
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,477
A fried egg.

1424
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,146
Sung-jun is making tofu steak.

1425
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,982
We should probably taste that.

1426
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,284
-Jung-hwan, please go out.
-Yes?

1427
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,552
You surprised me.

1428
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,287
He moves automatically.

1429
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,623
Gyeong-jun needs to win today
to become one of the good vibes.

1430
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,158
REMOVING THE STALK

1431
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,728
This is getting boiled down
like seasoned <i>doenjang</i> sauce.

1432
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,297
-This one.
-The <i>doenjang</i> stew?

1433
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,999
He's now roasting mushrooms.

1434
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:39,435
He's frying an egg here,
and this is becoming spicier.

1435
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,738
Can you taste the soup?

1436
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,740
-I'll try the spicy one first.
-Sure.

1437
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,708
All right. It's boiling hot.

1438
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,277
-It's boiling hot.
-The soup is pretty thick.

1439
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,947
Now, it's the tofu hell dish.

1440
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:54,417
Does it taste like paradise or hell?

1441
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,254
It's not spicy or bland. It's in-between.

1442
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,355
It's uncertain.

1443
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,557
-It needs to boil down some more.
-It does?

1444
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,860
You're too young to understand
the rich flavor.

1445
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,295
Is it not rich?

1446
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,931
-He likes that rich flavor.
-The rich flavor.

1447
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,199
He added more red pepper powder.

1448
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,601
-Four minutes.
-Four minutes.

1449
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,236
It's hot.

1450
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,437
CHECKING

1451
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,239
He gets it out of the steamer.

1452
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:20,543
-The steamer and the abalone.
-The abalone.

1453
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,879
He pulled out
both napa cabbage and the abalones.

1454
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,580
Cabbage, abalone,
and is this perilla leaf?

1455
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,884
He put abalone
between cabbage and perilla leaf,

1456
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,018
-And steamed them.
-and steamed them.

1457
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,622
-He's using the cabbage and perilla leaf.
-He is.

1458
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,091
These abalones turned tiny
after he steamed them.

1459
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,860
-They turned smaller, right?
-They did.

1460
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,264
-Jung-hwan.
-Yes?

1461
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,033
Can you taste Chef Gyeong-jun's sauce?

1462
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,002
-The seasoned doenjang-esque sauce?
-Yes.

1463
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,237
I'll do that. Let me get a taste.

1464
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,841
10. STEAM ROASTED SHIITAKE

1465
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:52,909
He keeps steaming stuff.

1466
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:57,213
-That has to taste rich.
-It almost feels like mapo tofu.

1467
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,116
-Will he take Matfia down?
-Can he really take him down?

1468
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,417
BLOWING

1469
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,586
-All right.
-It's too hot.

1470
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,521
It's too hot, hot, hot.

1471
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,057
Will he put him down or not?

1472
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,859
WILL MATFIA'S ABALONE
STRATEGY WORK?

1473
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,528
CURIOUS

1474
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:16,132
He will!

1475
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,334
THE INTENSE XO SAUCE CAN
TURN MATFIA UPSIDE DOWN

1476
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,837
-It tastes very rich.
-It does?

1477
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,505
But I would've preferred it to be

1478
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,640
-a bit saltier.
-I see.

1479
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,877
Personally speaking, it's not as salty
as seasoned doenjang sauce.

1480
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,545
Why aren't they making it as salty?

1481
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,848
You both taste the food
a few minutes before we're done.

1482
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,984
-It'll taste saltier as they cook.
-It will.

1483
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,588
-Is that the tofu steak?
-Yes.

1484
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,156
FRIED EGG COMES OUT

1485
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,726
8. BOIL DOWN TOFU STEAK

1486
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:47,597
WITH EGG SAUCE,
PORK CUTLET SAUCE, AND SUGAR

1487
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,166
ADD MORE SOY SAUCE INTO A BOWL

1488
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,002
9. MAKE SEASONING BY MIXING
SOY SAUCE, RED PEPPER POWDER,

1489
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,438
SESAME OIL, EGG SAUCE,
AND PICKLED MUSTARD LEAF

1490
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,407
HE FINISHES THE PICKLED
MUSTARD LEAF SEASONING

1491
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,244
WHAT DID HE PUT IN THE OVEN?

1492
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,446
HE WARMED UP HIS PLATE

1493
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,148
Gyeong-jun begins to serve his dish.

1494
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:09,218
-A minute and 40 seconds.
-He's already serving.

1495
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,087
This was a bit bland.

1496
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,290
-It'll get saltier as they cook.
-It can be saltier.

1497
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,758
Why is he spinning the knife around?

1498
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,394
-He's making waves.
-I see.

1499
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,463
-He's adding waves.
-It's tiered.

1500
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,599
HE MAKES WAVY CUTS

1501
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,736
He's making wavy cuts into the abalone.

1502
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,071
I thought you used a wavy knife.

1503
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:33,342
He put so much work into the green onion.
I wonder how he'll use these.

1504
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,844
Will you throw them on?
Or will you fry them?

1505
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,313
-They'll be topped raw.
-Raw?

1506
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,949
He's not going, "Rawr."

1507
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,018
He's not going, "Rawr,"
but he uses raw green onion.

1508
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,020
He didn't even rawr.

1509
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,022
HE LOVES THIS WORDPLAY

1510
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,056
The tofu steak.

1511
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:48,891
-It looks good.
-The tofu steak.

1512
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:49,992
Here comes the cheese.

1513
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,361
-You have a minute left!
-One minute!

1514
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,066
TOPPING TOFU STEAK WITH CHEESE

1515
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:00,136
-Are you using only one patty?
-Yes.

1516
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:03,105
And an egg. Dong-gook loves eggs.

1517
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,207
Yes.

1518
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,676
-He's done with one.
-The tofu steak is done.

1519
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,511
-He's done.
-You have 40 seconds.

1520
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,047
They're both moving busily.

1521
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,682
Gyeong-jun versus Sung-jun.

1522
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,286
He's using XO sauce.

1523
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,856
TOP NAPA CABBAGE
AND PICKLED PERILLA LEAF

1524
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,691
WITH ABALONE, SHIITAKE
AND XO SAUCE

1525
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,527
I don't think Sung-jun likes his hot pot.

1526
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,296
-When I tried it, it wasn't as rich.
-30 seconds!

1527
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,799
-He keeps tasting it.
-He must have a reason.

1528
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,034
-The hot pot needs to be good.
-It's not as rich, right?

1529
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,103
-No.
-Is it okay now?

1530
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,839
-You have about 20 seconds.
-A little more seasoning.

1531
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,741
I'm glad you're using
ready-made seasoning.

1532
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:39,942
You have 30 seconds.

1533
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,711
THE GREEN ONION
HE HAD KEPT IN ICED WATER

1534
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,247
-You have 22 seconds.
-Just 22 seconds?

1535
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,515
-You have 20 seconds.
-You got this!

1536
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:47,950
RAW GREEN ONION AS GARNISH

1537
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,353
-Fifteen seconds. Should I taste it again?
-Go ahead.

1538
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,356
-Jung-hwan, hurry up.
-Yes, I'll hurry.

1539
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,025
-Fifteen seconds!
-Lemon zest.

1540
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,728
You need to move quickly!

1541
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:01,163
Ten. Nine. Hey.

1542
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,498
Gyeong-jun is done.

1543
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,868
Five seconds. Is it complete? Three.

1544
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,770
-It's almost done.
-Two.

1545
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,840
-One. It's over.
-It's over.

1546
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,609
He surely is Little Hyun-suk.

1547
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,311
He pointed at the food
and told me to try it.

1548
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,446
<i>-He picked that up already?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1549
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,582
Can someone take it from him?

1550
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,018
-It's too hot for us to carry.
-No, we can't hold that.

1551
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,720
-It looks good.
-He made three dishes in that short while.

1552
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:28,891
Sung-jun made three dishes
while Gyeong-jun made one.

1553
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,960
This looks like a huge meal.

1554
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,395
The fight is one to three.

1555
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,597
They have completely different styles.

1556
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,465
-They're totally different.
-Totally.

1557
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:41,470
And now, the richest dishes were made
just for Dong-gook.

1558
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,605
But the thing is,

1559
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,307
Chef Sung-jun

1560
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,344
-forgot about rice.
-What?

1561
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,379
What? He should've served rice.

1562
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,580
That's really important.

1563
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,883
-What?
-What's wrong?

1564
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,785
-Did you forget something?
-I even warmed up the rice.

1565
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,755
I had been anxious about this
the whole time.

1566
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,624
Gyeong-jun, are you missing anything?

1567
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,826
-No, not me.
-You served everything.

1568
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,028
-This is huge trouble.
-It's…

1569
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,064
Beg him just this once.

1570
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,733
-How? Do you want anything?
-Grovel between his legs.

1571
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,903
-Is there anything you want?
-What I want?

1572
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,640
I'll pour a drop of lemon juice.

1573
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,542
-Lemon juice is important.
-Lemon juice.

1574
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,811
Good-looking guys
tend to be more generous too.

1575
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:26,148
All right. They made a fair deal
and decided to add one each.

1576
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,150
-That would've been bad.
-You're right.

1577
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,785
He served his rice too.

1578
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,922
And now, he'll try
Chef Gyeong-jun's dish first.

1579
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,725
BRAISED ABALONE, SHIITAKE,
AND NAPA CABBAGE

1580
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:39,628
WITH TOFU COVERED
IN RICH MANILA CLAM SAUCE

1581
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,467
CHEF BAE GYEONG-JUN'S
ABALONE-ING MATFIA DOWN

1582
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,670
The way he chopped the green onion shows

1583
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,940
how pretty and classy he made the dish.

1584
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,709
It feels like it was made only for me.

1585
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:57,113
He didn't have to do that,
but he put in the extra work.

1586
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,215
-Yes.
-A hundred people may eat that,

1587
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,884
but all I need is one person to notice.

1588
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,252
That's why I do that.

1589
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,487
You do it for that one person.

1590
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,355
-That was another great quote.
-Yes.

1591
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,524
You'll find abalone at the bottom.

1592
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,394
First, try the napa cabbage
and the abalone with the sauce.

1593
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,964
Then you can try it with the shiitake.

1594
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,901
-The abalone.
-The abalone, cabbage, and the sauce.

1595
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,202
-And tofu.
-Cabbage and…

1596
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,005
-First of all, it smells great.
-It does?

1597
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,473
It has that savory scent.

1598
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,676
This is something you can't eat at home.

1599
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:31,313
-I hope it tastes really rich.
-Yes, it has to be the richest.

1600
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,615
What's it like?

1601
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,550
It's a dish just for Dong-gook.

1602
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,385
It's definitely rich.

1603
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:39,655
-And my kids won't be able to eat this.
-They can't.

1604
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,291
This is a flavor only I can have.

1605
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,094
That's it. That was what you wanted.

1606
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:46,262
You succeeded.

1607
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,963
The abalones were cooked perfectly.

1608
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,332
He measured the temperature
when he cooked, right?

1609
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,302
And the temperature it's at now
is perfect for me to taste.

1610
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:54,970
FEELING PROUD

1611
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,906
-Is it seasoned well?
-It's perfect for me.

1612
01:07:56,972 --> 01:08:00,876
I'll try some of the sauce with my spoon.

1613
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:04,880
Shiitake, abalone, and the sauce.

1614
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,482
He scoops out a big portion.

1615
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:11,587
The lion eats the abalone.

1616
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,923
CHEWING

1617
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,592
-This is a strange taste.
-It is?

1618
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,227
Is it not Korean?

1619
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,196
-Is it Western?
-Or Hong Kong?

1620
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:24,467
It's spicy,
and there's an addictive quality to it.

1621
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,835
When I tried it,

1622
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:29,472
it was somewhere between
mapo tofu and seasoned doenjang sauce.

1623
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:33,342
The tofu and the sauce give off
a very strong smell.

1624
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,677
So your kids can't eat this?

1625
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:38,047
-No, not at all.
-Your kids can't eat that.

1626
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,350
And next, Chef Sung-jun's dish.

1627
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:45,521
RICH BRAISED SOFT TOFU AND
PERILLA SEEDS, SPICY TOFU HOT POT,

1628
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:51,360
AND TOFU STEAK
TOPPED WITH A FRIED EGG

1629
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:56,265
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
SELF-INFLICTED TOFU HELL

1630
01:08:57,032 --> 01:09:00,336
All right. That looks good.

1631
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,637
After all, it's tofu hell.

1632
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:06,642
Nam-il is very keen on that hot pot,
so leave some for him.

1633
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,745
-All right.
-Try the soft tofu, and then move on.

1634
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,915
-Please try it.
-Soft tofu and perilla seeds.

1635
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,651
Will it taste like something he wanted?
It has to taste rich and strong.

1636
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:19,522
Dong-gook.

1637
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,857
-Yes.
-He nods right away.

1638
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,492
A THUMBS-UP

1639
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,494
-He nods.
-He responds right away.

1640
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:28,097
-He must like it.
-It's a flavor he knows.

1641
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:31,400
Yes, it is.
And I love tofu and its nutty flavor,

1642
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:34,870
so I sometimes eat tofu instead of rice.

1643
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:39,608
You made a wise choice
to work with something I liked.

1644
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,011
It would've been great
with a bottle of <i>makgeolli</i>.

1645
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,979
THE EXPAT WHO UNDERSTANDS
THE TASTE OF MAKGEOLLI

1646
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,314
Does it taste nutty?

1647
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,384
It is, but…

1648
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,853
It's almost too rich

1649
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,756
-to eat it without rice.
-It's not just bland.

1650
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,457
-Yes, it's meant to be served with rice.
-I see.

1651
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,626
It'd be perfect with rice.

1652
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,696
-You're a kind-hearted reviewer.
-He is.

1653
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:03,299
"I'll order it again next time."

1654
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,167
The kind-hearted Dong-gook.

1655
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,970
-The stew. It's the hot pot.
-Try the hot pot.

1656
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,238
The tofu hot pot.

1657
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:12,775
-I think you'll love this too.
-Yes, I'm craving it a lot.

1658
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,144
-A sip.
-He put in dumplings too.

1659
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,912
Did you use frozen dumplings?

1660
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,281
Yes, I added dumplings and pork belly too.

1661
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,318
-What's it like?
-The hot pot.

1662
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,287
Jung-hwan went over and said
it was a bit bland,

1663
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,723
-but it's perfect to my taste.
-Right now?

1664
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,226
I had it when it began to boil,
but it boiled down by now.

1665
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,962
It'll boil a bit more in the hot pot,
so it'll taste stronger.

1666
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,563
It's really good.

1667
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,535
Is this also something
your kids can't eat?

1668
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:42,438
-This is my kind of flavor.
-They can't have it.

1669
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:46,041
Your kids like bland food.
They can't have this.

1670
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:49,111
I think it'd taste delicious
if you mix it with some rice.

1671
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:52,214
-I'm starting to sweat.
-He broke out in a sweat.

1672
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,451
-The Lion King is sweating.
-I know that taste, so my mouth waters.

1673
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:56,885
Right?

1674
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,988
You didn't use any kimchi, right?

1675
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,190
No, I put in cabbage and radish.

1676
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:06,195
-It's almost sweet like kimchi jjigae.
-Does it taste like it?

1677
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,031
-It must have that subtle sweetness.
-Cabbage does that.

1678
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,035
It has a bit of sweetness
thanks to the radish.

1679
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,903
Does it go well with rice?

1680
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,006
I have to eat it with rice.

1681
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:18,807
It would've been bad
if he couldn't serve it.

1682
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,843
How's the tofu steak?
I'm dying to find out.

1683
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,279
-Your children would love this.
-I think they would.

1684
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,547
It's been seasoned quite salty.

1685
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,950
-Try it with the egg and cheese.
-Your kids would love that.

1686
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,186
-Everyone loves hamburger steak.
-Yes.

1687
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,389
CURIOUS

1688
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,726
I can see that you made it quite salty.

1689
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,096
But it was perfect
when I had it with the egg.

1690
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,132
That's what hamburger steak is like.

1691
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,136
-Gyeong-jun's Abalone-ing Matfia Down.
-Abalone-ing Matfia Down.

1692
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,537
Let's try this first.

1693
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,839
I hope his attack works.

1694
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:53,275
AND THE VACUUM CLEANER
OF CHEF & MY FRIDGE

1695
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,112
It tastes like XO sauce.

1696
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,948
It's spicy, but it has a nice texture too.

1697
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,850
It tastes like Chinese cuisine.

1698
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:05,020
It's like Chinese fine dining.

1699
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:08,023
It felt almost like that pasta sauce.

1700
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,125
-Ragu?
-Ragu.

1701
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,261
-It tasted like that.
-I can see why.

1702
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,431
When you make chili oil

1703
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,800
to make a braised tofu dish,

1704
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:21,303
it almost tastes like this fried tofu.

1705
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,806
So I could taste a bit of that

1706
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:27,343
<i>with the mix</i>
<i>of steamed abalone and veggies.</i>

1707
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:31,213
So the dish tastes fresh and new.

1708
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,917
It tastes like the noodle sauce
of a Sichuan restaurant in Hong Kong.

1709
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,719
Right? It'd be like that with noodles.

1710
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:40,889
I didn't think Chef Gyeong-jun would've
made Hong Kong or Chinese cuisine,

1711
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:43,692
so I was pleasantly surprised.

1712
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:46,695
And topping it off with lemon juice was

1713
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,930
the cherry on top.

1714
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,766
-I get it. That was the flavor.
-Is that so?

1715
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,936
-Did it balance it out?
-It kept the dish in balance.

1716
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,771
He had a reason.

1717
01:12:55,838 --> 01:13:00,509
This time, Chef Sung-jun's
Self-Inflicted Tofu Hell.

1718
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,244
I get what he meant.

1719
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,312
It's strong. Isn't it?

1720
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,646
VACUUM CLEANER MODE: ON

1721
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,215
He really likes the tofu steak.

1722
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:08,083
He likes rice.

1723
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,487
-Nam-il keeps eating so well.
-Gosh.

1724
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,656
-The training is paying off.
-It is.

1725
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:15,724
It's good.

1726
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,025
He's binge-eating right now.

1727
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,928
His mouth turned into a straw.

1728
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,698
Hey, let me try the tofu steak.

1729
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,867
-Let me try the tofu steak.
-No.

1730
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,069
Fine.

1731
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,505
He gave these a strong flavor.

1732
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,140
Look at Nam-il.

1733
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,976
TOUCHED, GLARING

1734
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,280
The vacuum cleaner is on again.

1735
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:41,850
What are you eating?
He just sucked in the hot pot.

1736
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,552
I knew he'd like this.

1737
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,889
Poong-dink trained him way too hard.

1738
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:50,759
-It's coming through after a week.
-It's showing now.

1739
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,761
I made him like that.

1740
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:55,697
I had the tofu steak and rice first,

1741
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,466
and then the hot pot.

1742
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,334
Then it wasn't too spicy. It was perfect.

1743
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,069
-Was it perfect?
-Was this too spicy?

1744
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,872
It has that spiciness at the end.

1745
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:08,143
My mom would make gochujang stew,
and it tasted just like this one.

1746
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,746
It's that strong and intense flavor.

1747
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:14,516
It feels like a dish from a restaurant
on the foot of Mount Bukhan

1748
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,251
if I had some acorn jelly and makgeolli.

1749
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:19,087
It was just as you said.
I craved a glass of <i>makgeolli</i> so badly.

1750
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,256
-<i>Makgeolli</i>.
-Yes.

1751
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,158
These guys are pretty much Korean now.

1752
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,129
He successfully
established himself as Korean.

1753
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,698
Your kids couldn't eat this,
but only you could.

1754
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:33,302
You must choose one of the two dishes
that felt like it was just for you.

1755
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,604
Press one for Bae Gyeong-jun.

1756
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,373
Press two for Kwon Sung-jun.

1757
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,410
Make your decision.

1758
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,811
And press the button.

1759
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,814
TROUBLED

1760
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,749
-This isn't easy.
-It's not.

1761
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,186
It was one against three,
but it's not easy.

1762
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:55,057
It's not for children!
He wanted the richest taste.

1763
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:56,291
It's your call.

1764
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,527
-I made my choice.
-You did?

1765
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,929
Which one of the two captured

1766
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,665
his craving for intense flavors?

1767
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,567
Let's find out who won.

1768
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,803
This is Dong-gook's choice.

1769
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,906
Kwon Sung-jun,
the winner of <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>

1770
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,276
was up against Bae Gyeong-jun,
who had won against Hyun-suk.

1771
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,646
A rich and flavorful dish
just for Lee Dong-gook!

1772
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:20,015
Who's the winner?

1773
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:23,485
Which one of them won?

1774
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,420
Who's the winner?

1775
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,991
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
SELF-INFLICTED TOFU HELL WINS

1776
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:32,728
It was Sung-jun. Yes.

1777
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:38,367
You gave a star to the chef who managed
to make three dishes in that short while.

1778
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,103
Chef Gyeong-jun's dish was delicious,

1779
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,672
but I've never had
anything similar even in Hong Kong.

1780
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,741
-But they both had a strong taste.
-Yes.

1781
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:49,344
Chef Sung-jun made
many different dishes in a short while,

1782
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:54,983
and it felt like I had
a filling full-course meal.

1783
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:58,921
Also, as I watched Nam-il devour the food,

1784
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:02,291
I couldn't help but choose him.
He enjoyed it so much.

1785
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,693
That was the last dish you had,
and you ate everything.

1786
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,996
I don't think
I'll ever have another day like this.

1787
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,665
-It was great.
-That's a great compliment.

1788
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,767
-He almost chewed on the dishes.
-Right?

1789
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:15,837
He'll put a star on Chef Sung-jun,
the winner of this round.

1790
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,341
-It's his fourth star.
-It was delicious.

1791
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,276
Sung-jun takes his fourth win!

1792
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,145
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations, Sung-jun!

1793
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,613
STAY TUNED
FOR NEXT WEEK'S FRIDGE OWNERS,

1794
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,814
KIM JAE-JOONG AND CHOO SUNG-HOON

1795
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,283
Please welcome the chefs!

1796
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,451
THE BEST CHEFS IN ASIA ARE HERE

1797
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:33,722
Please welcome Chef Han Li Guang,
the 37th place!

1798
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:37,392
-One Michelin-star chef in Hong Kong.
-Please welcome Chef Antimo.

1799
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:41,163
<i>A two-star Michelin chef in Osaka,</i>
<i>8th in the 50 best restaurants in Asia,</i>

1800
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,764
please welcome Chef Takada Yusuke!

1801
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,132
I never expected to see him here.

1802
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:46,101
I'm just happy to sit here with him.

1803
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:48,403
What about the ranking? Don't be scared.

1804
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,505
Mr. Good Vibes.

1805
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:54,109
Please welcome the superstars of Asia,
Kim Jae-joong and Choo Sung-hoon!

1806
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:56,144
Wait, why is he here?

1807
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,646
Did you get the wrong casting call?

1808
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,314
I thought I probably had a chance.

1809
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,116
Let us begin this big match!

1810
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,151
-Whoa.
-He's showing what he can do.

1811
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,187
-He's good.
-He's scary.

1812
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,755
BUT KIM POONG THE KNOCKOFF CHEF
ISN'T AN EASY FIGHT

1813
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,525
What's he going to do?
That's a new challenge.

1814
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,228
-That looks good.
-Whoa!

1815
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,897
Who's the winner of this huge Asian match?

1816
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,069
It's so good.

1817
