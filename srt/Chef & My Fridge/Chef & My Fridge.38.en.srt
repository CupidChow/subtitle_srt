1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,448
You're watching <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,118
with Lee Young-ae and Kim Young-kwang.

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,688
Young-kwang visited our show
ten years ago,

4
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,324
so he's practically family.

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,328
Back then, he was still
an up-and-coming young man,

6
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,997
<i>and the way he enjoyed the dishes</i>
<i>was endearing.</i>

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,833
SO LOVELY EVEN WHEN HE EATS

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,837
But now, we should say
he looks dashing and suave.

9
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,205
He's so charismatic.

10
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,109
-I'm serious. Just look at his profile.
-He looks cool.

11
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,179
I hear Hyun-suk became sentimental
after hearing Young-kwang would return

12
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,647
after ten years. Why is that?

13
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,616
-Why, Hyun-suk?
-Is there bad blood?

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,352
I looked up some photos.

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,020
-Of you two together?
-Yes.

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,688
And he became much more dashing

17
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,358
-after these ten years.
-Right.

18
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,261
But I've plummeted, so…

19
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,297
-So you realized time had passed?
-Yes, I realized how long it had been.

20
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,800
-After seeing that photo, right?
-It shows in pictures.

21
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,635
Do we have the photo
from ten years ago here?

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,573
You two took this photo in the corridor.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,841
Hyun-suk looks…

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,444
I thought only I gained weight,
but you've changed a lot too.

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,445
He has.

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,713
-Look at him.
-You were in great shape back then.

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,917
Back then, I'd throw on any T-shirt
and would look good.

28
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,085
Look at Young-kwang too.

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,153
That's how life is for men over 190 cm.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,722
We look stunning in everything.

31
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,891
-He's so annoying.
-All right.

32
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,159
"That's life for tall kings."

33
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,096
This was your turn to chime in.

34
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,864
"Mind your own business."

35
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,734
All right.

36
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,403
We saw the photo from ten years ago,

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,172
-so you two can take a new one now.
-That's a good idea.

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,574
-It may resurface in ten years.
-Yes.

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,509
-It was meant to be.
-Yes, it was.

40
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,878
-My gosh.
-You don't look so bad.

41
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,847
-Stand here.
-They look great.

42
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,949
-Okay.
-I think he shrunk a bit.

43
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,450
It's the aging curve.

44
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,252
-It's the aging curve?
-It is.

45
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,822
He doesn't look real.
It's as if he's been expanded vertically.

46
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,125
You look way too happy right now.

47
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,294
-Hyun-suk became rather bloated.
-Right.

48
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,130
And Young-kwang looks…

49
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,532
-His cheeks are more defined.
-He lost some fat there.

50
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,934
The camera will take the picture for you.

51
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,703
-All right.
-My face.

52
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,873
-Show a smile just like that one.
-Just like that.

53
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,442
They were reunited after ten years.

54
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,676
It's the same pose.

55
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,879
One, two, three. Say cheese!

56
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,714
ANOTHER MEMORABLE SHOT

57
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,317
LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING AGAIN IN 10 YEARS

58
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,719
HOW HEARTWARMING

59
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,020
They're different breeds.

60
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,123
They look great,
but Hyun-suk did gain some weight.

61
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,225
-But I like him better now.
-I do too.

62
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,693
It's been ten years already.

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,029
He looked too menacing ten years ago,

64
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,532
and all of that's gone now.

65
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,034
I love how gentle he looks now.

66
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,303
Also, Young-kwang is an actor

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,973
who can handle all genres,
from romantic comedy to action.

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,776
I told you that
our show is on Netflix, remember?

69
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,813
I was about to watch that
when I came across him on the app.

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,482
That show?

71
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,150
I was happy to see him and tuned in

72
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,286
around three o'clock in the afternoon,

73
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,654
and I turned it off at 3 a.m.

74
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,423
I watched all ten episodes in one sitting.

75
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,226
That's why I'm kind of into him right now.

76
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,128
I want to talk to him about it…

77
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,397
-Don't! I'm going to watch it.
-…but I don't want to spoil it.

78
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,898
How are you so good at acting?

79
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,700
-Gosh, thank you.
-Sure.

80
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,036
-I hear you're introverted.
-I am.

81
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,939
That's so uncanny.
Yet you perform like you aren't.

82
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,440
But you're introverted?

83
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,375
They're both quite shy.

84
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,944
I hear many actors are introverted.

85
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,378
Do you understand how he feels?

86
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,279
Completely.

87
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:38,384
I could talk more at ease like this
only after I got married and had children.

88
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,586
I understand completely.

89
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,754
You were once dropped from a show

90
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,824
-because of how shy you were?
-Really?

91
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,959
Someone sacked Young-ae?

92
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,393
But she's the definition of charm.

93
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,430
It's half and half. I was dismissed,
but I also said I couldn't do it.

94
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,165
I once got the offer

95
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,768
-to host a talk show with another network.
-I see. Right.

96
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,572
-I did the pilot with my name in it,
-It suits you so well, though.

97
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,775
but it was way too hard for me.
So I'm amazed

98
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,178
by how you two host the show like this.

99
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,013
I can act when I'm in character,

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,848
but when I had to host a show

101
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,783
as Lee Young-ae, it was too hard.

102
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,619
It wasn't a job for anyone.

103
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,255
We'll help you relax throughout the shoot,

104
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,090
so please enjoy your food

105
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,525
while you're with us today. Wait a moment.

106
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,061
How am I going to help him enjoy this?

107
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,163
BUT IN A MOMENT,
THE INTROVERTED YOUNG-KWANG…

108
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,935
CLANK

109
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,804
He looks excited.

110
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,673
…BECOMES MORE EXPRESSIVE THAN ANYONE

111
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,242
And now, it's time to find out

112
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,745
how his fridge has changed
over the last ten years.

113
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,246
-Do you live alone?
-Yes.

114
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,814
He lives alone.

115
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,449
You must work out a lot.

116
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,286
I wouldn't say a lot,
but I work out from time to time.

117
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,822
How do you stay in such great shape
without working out often?

118
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,291
He's really ripped.

119
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,127
I think it's mainly my diet.

120
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,895
I try not to eat a lot.

121
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,766
I don't know for sure yet, but I'm sure
we'll find his secret in the fridge.

122
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,502
Young-kwang has returned after ten years

123
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,203
with his fridge.

124
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,272
Let us present it right now!

125
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,409
-He has lots of stuff.
-This is Young-kwang's fridge!

126
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,711
This is Young-kwang's fridge!

127
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,880
Gosh, it's loaded.

128
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,282
-It's full.
-It's rather filled.

129
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,285
This is great.
They can surely work with this.

130
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,487
First of all, the top shelf.

131
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,956
That's something
he reaches for the most often.

132
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,391
He must like beer.

133
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,927
I don't think I go a day
without having a drink.

134
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,296
It must be your joy.

135
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,932
I end the day with a can of beer

136
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,236
and whatever I can put on TV,
have the drink, and then go to sleep.

137
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,105
That's how you loosen up, right?

138
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,575
It would've been great if he said
he puts on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> with the beer.

139
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,177
-Should we do that again?
-Yes.

140
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,778
-Cue.
-Action!

141
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,046
At the end of the day,

142
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,681
I take a can of beer,

143
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,318
-turn on Chef & My Fridge, and…
-I knew it.

144
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,753
I knew he'd say that.

145
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,188
-That's Young-kwang.
-He's family.

146
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,622
He's our family!

147
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,525
-He's our little bro.
-He is.

148
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,060
They seem happy.

149
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,161
Do you eat any snacks?

150
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,663
Beef jerky,

151
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,998
dried anchovies, dried squid,
and such snacks.

152
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,166
Something very simple.

153
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,101
He takes light snacks.

154
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,203
What's this? Broccoli.

155
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,439
-That's a lot.
-Why do you have so much broccoli?

156
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,375
-Four packs?
-You must like it.

157
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,110
-No.
-You don't like it?

158
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,579
It's one of the things
that I eat against my will.

159
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,147
I never eat vegetables,

160
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,416
so I boil it and dip it in <i>chogochujang</i>.

161
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,385
-I see.
-Do you usually not prefer vegetables?

162
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,754
-I don't find it particularly delicious.
-It's not.

163
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,855
THE DISAPPOINTED NATURALIST

164
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,057
And this one.

165
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,459
-It's delivery food.
-He must've gotten this delivered.

166
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,129
-It's beef bone soup, <i>gomtang.</i>
-This is <i>gomtang?</i>

167
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,997
But I didn't get it.

168
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,667
The CEO of my agency
visits my place often,

169
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,603
so I got those from him.

170
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,605
Are you sure it was the CEO?

171
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,672
Yes.

172
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,675
Your CEO was worried about you.

173
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,744
He has two bowls.

174
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,613
Did someone want to have this with you?

175
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,580
No.

176
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,115
COUGH

177
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,917
You cough whenever you're surprised.

178
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,352
That's not the case.

179
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,954
When I'm in a rush, I just don't eat.

180
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,623
THE TYPE WHO DOESN'T PRIORITIZE FOOD

181
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,826
Next, the fresh produce shelf.
He said he didn't like veggies.

182
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,061
-Whoa, man.
-What is this?

183
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,864
-It's full of cheese.
-Why does he have so much?

184
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,533
What are all these?

185
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,334
What will you do with these?

186
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,436
-My gosh.
-Whoa.

187
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,439
Look at all the cheese.
He wouldn't have this much

188
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,308
unless he was set on opening
a cheese business.

189
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,510
-He has more than my restaurant.
-There are all kinds.

190
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,145
I don't really remember why.

191
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,747
-But you have a lot.
-What do you mean?

192
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,215
I don't know why I got those.

193
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,585
-So he's pleading the Fifth.
-Wait, these are…

194
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,320
It's hard to understand.

195
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,855
Wait, 2019?

196
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,524
-The year 2019?
-February 21.

197
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,528
<i>-April 22, 2020.</i>
<i>-This expired on June 12, 2021.</i>

198
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,163
He got all these around the same time.

199
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,166
-That's odd.
-Something must've happened in 2019.

200
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,936
-Something happened.
-There must've been something.

201
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,238
The amount of cheese…

202
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,041
-What could've happened with the cheese?
-Something must've happened.

203
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,543
-Think about it.
-It means he must've liked it.

204
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,046
Is it inedible
even though I didn't open it?

205
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,682
Is it inedible even if it isn't opened?

206
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,250
He suddenly changes the subject.

207
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,886
-That was random.
-But please answer his question, chefs.

208
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,121
-I eat it, though.
-I see.

209
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,225
-He can probably eat the firm ones.
-The firm ones.

210
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,694
-But if it has liquid, it's dangerous.
-That's right.

211
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,430
-If the sealing came undone,
-Right. If it's still sealed…

212
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,232
-It's still sealed.
-it can be seriously dangerous.

213
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>A few are still sealed,</i>
<i>so take a good look before you use it.</i>

214
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:25,671
You should take a look
and tell him what he can and cannot eat.

215
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,241
-This is still soft.
-You're right.

216
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,476
Wait a second. Come to think of it,

217
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,378
he had stale cheese in his fridge

218
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,014
when he visited us ten years ago.

219
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,250
-The package was about to burst.
-Even back then?

220
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,219
It's cheese, but it's about to burst.

221
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,088
-It's about to burst!
-Something's coming out.

222
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,623
It's about to burst!

223
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,460
THE CHEESE FLEW LIKE A TICKING BOMB

224
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,096
-Even back then?
-Yes, back in 2015.

225
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,964
So he keeps buying cheese,

226
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,267
only to keep them around
and leave them unused.

227
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,104
I saw something like cheese toast
in a movie

228
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,873
and wanted to make that,
so I must've bought all those.

229
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,409
-Right. No way.
-Goodness, my man.

230
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,611
Even so, no one buys this much cheese.

231
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,914
Does he keep them as pets?

232
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,849
Does he like to grow mold?

233
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,053
-You had the most cheese in our history.
-That's true.

234
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,755
And the most kinds.

235
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,090
Look at how everything is lined up.

236
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,127
-Some pick-me-ups.
-Are we at a pharmacy?

237
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,295
This is for a cold.

238
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,797
He must buy things in bulk
when he gets something.

239
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,965
That's just my type.

240
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,569
-You must like to stock up on things.
-I do.

241
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,205
When I feel under the weather
before I go to sleep,

242
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,607
-I take some.
-The herbal tonic?

243
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,676
Would you like one now?
You've been coughing.

244
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,379
It's our first time
offering a tonic during a shoot.

245
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,648
-You should take some.
-Wait.

246
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,083
-He can't take that cold.
-Heat it.

247
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,619
-Heat it up.
-He needs a little pick-me-up.

248
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,020
Please use the microwave.

249
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,290
I can't keep prying
because he coughs every single time.

250
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,727
Gosh, Young-kwang.
I needed to pry a little deeper.

251
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,196
My gosh.

252
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,231
-The herb tonic, <i>ssanghwa-cha.</i>
-It's still hot.

253
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,733
Have a hot drink.

254
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,736
And wait, are these <i>chogochujang?</i>

255
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,172
-<i>Chogochujang?</i>
-Why do you keep a pile of these?

256
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,342
-Those look like delivery condiments.
-And I found two bottles.

257
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,911
What's going on
between you and <i>chogochujang?</i>

258
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,447
I ordered raw fish fillet,

259
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,282
and they gave me too many packs,

260
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,352
but I didn't want to waste them,
so I kept them there.

261
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,221
-I get these, but these are different.
-Those aren't from there.

262
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,123
You're right. We got you.

263
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,358
I got those

264
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,628
in case the fish places
didn't give me enough <i>chogochujang.</i>

265
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,430
-He went ahead and got two bottles?
-Right?

266
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,967
They had a buy-one-get-one-free deal,
and it was much cheaper.

267
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,068
-Lemon.
-Lemon juice.

268
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
-Do you enjoy this?
-Yes.

269
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,206
I use a shot glass

270
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,409
to mix lemon juice with olive oil
and take it.

271
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,045
I hear lots of people do it,
so I've been doing it recently.

272
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,980
You have lots of such information.

273
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,016
He has lots of information.

274
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,385
What about ginger juice?
Is this good for you too?

275
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,053
Yes, I heard it was good.

276
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,655
-Is it the extract?
-It's good for a cold.

277
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,957
I also see some cabbage juice.

278
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:58,991
He has two of everything.

279
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,726
He knows what's good for him,

280
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,795
-but he doesn't consume anything.
-Tell me about it.

281
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,664
And to the freezer.

282
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,332
-This one.
-He has lots of meat.

283
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,100
He has so much food.

284
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,268
This is crazy.

285
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,936
You keep that much beef?

286
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,907
-I think he buys things in bulk.
-The same product in bulk?

287
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,610
When I shop for groceries on an app,

288
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,079
two or three of the same thing
doesn't sound enough,

289
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,048
-so I get more.
-Two or three sounds enough.

290
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,451
-Does he feel bad?
-Then I end up with five of everything.

291
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,155
That's why I end up with so much food.

292
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,957
You're the type
who falls for marketing tricks.

293
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,626
He's a big spender.

294
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,961
-And some natto.
-Why do you have so much natto?

295
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,463
Recently,

296
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,265
-while we were…
-Yes?

297
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,534
-…promoting <i>Trigger,</i>
-Starring Kim Nam-gil.

298
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,438
I heard Nam-gil loves to eat natto
because it's good for your health.

299
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,906
I got those after hearing that.

300
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,140
SO THAT WAS THE CASE

301
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709
INSPIRED BY NAM-GIL

302
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,610
He got these thanks to Nam-gil.

303
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,246
Again, there are so many packs.
One, two, three…

304
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,048
-He has lots.
-He got like five packs of three.

305
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,083
Is he easily convinced?

306
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,219
I guess so. Look at this.

307
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,620
Look at the bread.

308
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,591
Why didn't you get just one?
You bought so much of this.

309
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,227
I finally get
why he has so much cheese now.

310
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,963
-Me too.
-I see why he got so much.

311
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,999
-Look. He never buys just one.
-It's always two.

312
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,469
-Look at these.
-What's that?

313
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,137
-He has two.
-Are those minced garlic?

314
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,072
You can just get one bag for yourself.

315
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,807
You'll never get lonely.

316
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,610
-He has two of everything.
-It's always in twos.

317
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,946
-He has lots of these too.
-Yes.

318
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,180
-My gosh.
-Wait a moment.

319
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,416
He's the first to bring so many of these.

320
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,485
Pupae.

321
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,253
-What?
-He has pupae?

322
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,355
Why do you have this in bulk?

323
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,324
Isn't this scary?

324
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,861
-It doesn't really suit you, Young-kwang.
-Pupae?

325
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,196
You buy these in bulk too?

326
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,831
-Do you like pupae?
-Are those edible?

327
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,134
-I do.
-You do?

328
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,203
I saw that it was good for your stamina,

329
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,639
so I bought those, thinking I'd eat them.

330
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,574
But I never touched them
after they arrived.

331
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,110
HE PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER AND FORGOT

332
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,347
I know there are smaller bags.
Why do you get such a big one?

333
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,415
-It'll take forever to finish.
-Good grief.

334
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,318
-I've seen those in cafes.
-Like a <i>bingsu </i>place.

335
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,687
Why do you get such huge bags?

336
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,223
-Everything he gets is big.
-You can actually buy those?

337
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,326
Young-kwang loves to buy in bulk.

338
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,396
-Do you live with five others?
-Right?

339
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,865
Blueberries, gold kiwi,

340
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,901
-and strawberries.
-Those are for commercial use.

341
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,569
-They are.
-My gosh.

342
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,004
Oh, my.

343
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,373
I blend those with protein.

344
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,508
-Like a smoothie?
-Yes.

345
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,278
He's very concerned about his health.

346
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,848
He's concerned,
but he doesn't eat anything.

347
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,783
-The placebo effect.
-He has some seafood.

348
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,152
-He does.
-We found some shrimp.

349
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,022
-And halibut fillet. Cuttlefish.
-Cuttlefish.

350
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,158
Why do you have so much halibut?
Just get one at a time.

351
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,793
I don't think he likes it.

352
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,330
-He must've been interested in it before.
-You're right.

353
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,600
It gets boring
only to eat chicken breast forever,

354
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,703
-so I wanted to switch to fish for a bit.
-For protein.

355
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,672
So those are the leftovers from that time.

356
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,673
These are in twos too.

357
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,209
Do you actually eat instant udon?

358
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,511
I'm not good with spicy food,

359
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,246
so I prefer instant udon.

360
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,082
That was Young-kwang's fridge,

361
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,118
a tall man and a big spender.

362
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,055
That was funny.

363
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,792
And now,
what does Young-kwang want to eat today?

364
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,161
Let's take his orders.

365
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,563
What does he want to eat today?

366
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,499
A dish
for Young-kwang's glorious physique.

367
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,969
-His physique.
-For his physique.

368
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,605
I have to eat lots of protein,

369
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,039
but I never end up eating much.

370
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:38,177
So I wanted to eat a delicious dish
that helps me take in lots of protein.

371
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,647
He has broad shoulders and is 190 cm tall,

372
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,449
so he needs to keep that shape

373
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,517
by eating protein, but it's not so good.

374
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,952
-No, right.
-Right.

375
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:47,953
What's the next order?

376
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,822
What does he want to eat?

377
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,725
A glorious beer snack.

378
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,793
A PERFECT ORDER FOR A BEER FAN

379
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,462
Do you want a beer snack?

380
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,832
I want to eat something lighter

381
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,468
yet something that goes well with beer,

382
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,005
something that helps me
end the day on a high note.

383
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,373
All right, then.

384
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,643
Hyun-suk, Poong, Nam-no,
and Sung-jun are left.

385
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,845
Of course, I should go.

386
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,779
You took a photo.

387
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,447
-After ten years.
-I did,

388
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,283
and we both have good physiques.

389
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,120
-Well, I did, ten years ago.
-Yes, back in the day.

390
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,855
So I'll cook for his glorious physique.

391
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,156
That sounds great.

392
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,692
I wonder who'll fight Hyun-suk today.

393
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,594
-Poong?
-I'll go.

394
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,095
Will you fight him again?

395
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:30,996
Of course,

396
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,933
-I'll go with the beer snack.
-Beer snack.

397
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,601
-He'll be tough to beat.
-The beer snack.

398
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,703
-I knew it.
-I'm the go-to guy for bar snacks,

399
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,039
and he had a great ingredient.

400
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,140
WHAT DOES THE DEVIL COVET?

401
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,310
Chef Sung-jun, can you grant me a chance?

402
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,711
There's someone I must avoid.

403
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,279
I should probably take the first one.

404
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,949
-I'll cook for his physique.
-His physique.

405
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,251
-Jeez.
-I think he's avoiding him.

406
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,919
I'm yet to be freed from Poongphobia.

407
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,723
Then Sung-jun automatically
gets the beer snack.

408
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,793
I think I have a good chance
after winning against Chef Sam

409
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,829
back when we had to pair our dish
with the perfect drink.

410
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,931
So this is something
you know you're good at.

411
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,135
Then let us begin today
with Hyun-suk and Nam-no's battle.

412
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,503
HYUN-SUK AND NAM-NO'S FIRST BATTLE

413
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,743
<i>This is the first cook-off</i>
<i>with Young-kwang's ingredients.</i>

414
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,613
The two chefs who are known
for their physiques are up.

415
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,051
Chef Choi Hyun-suk,
the vertically huge man of 1.9 meters,

416
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,723
and Chef Yoon Nam-no,
the horizontally-huge food fighter.

417
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,492
This is their first cook-off in history.

418
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,730
Anyway, Chef Nam-no.
You chose him to avoid Poong, right?

419
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,264
I've admired Chef Hyun-suk

420
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,334
since my younger days
as a kid watching <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>

421
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,803
so I chose this round
to have my cook-off with him.

422
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,239
That means you'll win against
the best chef of the show.

423
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,309
Also, Chef Hyun-suk
has never lost twice in a row.

424
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,312
I'd like to make that happen
for the first time today.

425
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,881
This darned world of culinary arts.

426
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,816
This darned world has no discipline.

427
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,320
During our last team dinner,

428
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,223
we wondered which chef would
grill the meat at a barbecue place

429
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,258
if four famous chefs dined together.

430
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,526
Choi Hyun-suk,

431
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,761
Son Jong-won,

432
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,928
Jung Ji-sun,

433
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,498
and Yoon Nam-no were sitting at a table.

434
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,034
And there, Hyun-suk took on the burden.

435
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,135
He did.

436
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,770
As you already know from my demeanor,

437
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,139
I always take up the hard work.

438
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,008
Nam-no could've done it.

439
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,644
-I was sitting at the next table.
-Okay.

440
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,080
And their table
kept spreading smoke to us,

441
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,749
-so it nearly killed me.
-Like CBR training.

442
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,153
Didn't Nam-no have to hold
the exhaust hood?

443
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,188
Yes, he was holding on to it.

444
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,757
Yes, he had to hold it
to suck the smoke in.

445
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:43,495
<i>They made such a big scene</i>
<i>while cooking some meat.</i>

446
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,197
I was in charge of grilling meat,

447
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:49,768
while Nam-no was in charge
of controlling the exhaust hood.

448
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,770
If the smoke reached the next table,

449
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,806
that's on him.

450
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,308
This happens when you go
to a barbecue place with chefs.

451
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,178
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS: CUTTLEFISH,
PARMESAN, HALIBUT, BRIOCHE, SHRIMP, LEMON

452
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,313
PICKLED CHILI, LEMON JUICE, BROCCOLI,
GARLIC SAUCE, GOMTANG, EGG SOY SAUCE

453
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,915
The dish I prepared is called

454
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,284
Your Physique is Quenelle.

455
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,252
-Your Physique is Quenelle.
-Your Physique is Quenelle?

456
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,321
-Yes.
-Quenelle?

457
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,791
I'm going to make a type
of French fish cake called quenelle,

458
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,094
made by mincing fish and scallops.

459
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,796
-It's a fish cake?
-Is this a French dish?

460
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,033
I'll serve it
with a Spanish sauce called <i>pil-pil.</i>

461
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,934
<i>Pil-pil?</i>

462
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,836
<i>-Pil-pil.</i>
<i>-Pil-pil?</i>

463
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,171
-It's made with fish collagen.
-With collagen?

464
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,841
I saw nice <i>gomtang </i>in his fridge,

465
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,342
so I'll make a nice sauce with that.

466
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,778
He'll make the sauce using <i>gomtang.</i>

467
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,314
Yes, so it's protein,
protein, and protein.

468
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,950
INTRIGUED

469
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,819
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS: GROUND BEEF,
SIRLOIN, PROVOLONE, MOZZARELLA, BRIOCHE

470
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,955
MONTEREY JACK, CHEDDAR, CREAM CHEESE,
BROCCOLI, BRIE, ONION, EGG SOY SAUCE

471
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,290
The name of my dish is…

472
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,792
Young-kwang,

473
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,527
I've Been Burgering to See You.

474
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,496
-Burgering to See You.
-Burgering to See You?

475
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,365
-What does that mean?
-Not burning to see him, but burgering.

476
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,200
-Is he making a burger?
-A hamburger?

477
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,037
I remember eating
the best hamburger of my life in Sicily.

478
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,173
It was so delicious.

479
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,110
I wanted to share the delicious experience
with Young-kwang today.

480
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,446
-I see.
-Also, to stay in shape,

481
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,782
you need a good mix
of fat and carbs with the protein,

482
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,585
and that is what I'll make for you today.

483
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,254
I see.

484
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,790
And now, it's time to begin the cook-off.

485
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:23,328
Chef Hyun-suk is up right now to regain
his glorious looks from ten years ago.

486
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,832
But Chef Nam-no is here to fight him
and take the glory

487
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,101
in beating the best chef on the show.

488
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,138
Which one of them will take the glory
of winning Young-kwang's star?

489
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,375
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

490
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,244
IT'S SUCH AN HONOR

491
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,646
Begin!

492
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,449
Hyun-suk is up.

493
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,018
Broccoli?

494
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,720
Hyun-suk works with broccoli first.

495
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,589
You said you didn't like broccoli,

496
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,024
but it's good for you.

497
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,926
So if you eat it with your food,

498
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,826
it's good for you.

499
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:59,097
He knows it's good for him,
but he doesn't like how it tastes.

500
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,400
-I'll make it delicious for him.
-Really?

501
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,569
-Even broccoli is good if you make it?
-Yes.

502
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,904
You only had it with <i>chogochujang.</i>

503
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,806
-Yes.
-You felt obligated

504
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,208
after hearing it was good for you.

505
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,809
Let's do this.

506
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,244
-Bread?
-He's using bread.

507
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,880
He's cutting the bread into star shapes.

508
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,350
Nam-no keeps making stars with the bread.

509
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,652
Is there a reason for the stars?

510
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,087
To make maple leaves? What is it?

511
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,323
-What?
-Why are you making stars with bread?

512
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,226
I wanted to pay attention
to the presentation today.

513
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,596
They look like snowflakes.

514
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,231
-That's right.
-Yes.

515
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,234
1. OIL BRIOCHE STARS AND TOAST IN THE OVEN

516
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,702
A HANDFUL OF SOMETHING!

517
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,770
What does Chef Hyun-suk have in his hands?

518
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,106
-Onion.
-Yes, onion.

519
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,009
He's caramelizing the onion.

520
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,578
It's been a minute already.

521
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,747
BROILING PARBOILED BROCCOLI

522
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,084
-He puts the broccoli over the grill.
-Over the fire?

523
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,553
Because today, Young-kwang needs to eat

524
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,487
a delicious meal.

525
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,422
Those look good.

526
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,192
Are you putting those in the burger?

527
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,027
They'll go into the burger,

528
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,698
and it'll also be served
as a delicious broccoli garnish.

529
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,902
He broiled it lightly, just like that.

530
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,372
GOMTANG SOUP

531
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,907
GARLIC CLOVES

532
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,442
CRACK

533
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,111
He just threw in cheese too.

534
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,112
A STICK OF PARMESAN

535
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,914
As we speak, Nam-no is

536
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,984
-chopping some seafood.
-What did he take?

537
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,720
-Shrimp, halibut…
-Shrimp, halibut, and cuttlefish.

538
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,856
-The neglected halibut.
-Those are the ones.

539
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,291
He didn't know what to do.

540
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,460
-He's making fish cake.
-By grinding it.

541
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,196
Nam-no makes fish cake with seafood.

542
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,899
He's making fish cake right now.

543
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,768
Don't you need some eggs?

544
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,169
HE'S ALREADY DONE?

545
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,070
It's not working.

546
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,872
AND INTO A BOWL!

547
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:47,906
AN EGG

548
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,242
Chef Nam-no just added an egg
to the ground seafood

549
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,744
to make it a little more moist.

550
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,881
It's not completely ground up.
Is that how he wants them?

551
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,182
I need some texture.

552
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,051
-I see.
-What did you throw in?

553
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,485
-Butter, I think.
-It's butter.

554
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,888
Actually, I need to mix it with béchamel,

555
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,792
but today, I'm going to skip those steps.

556
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,861
He didn't ground them thoroughly
to give it better texture.

557
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,030
Did he finish grinding those?

558
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,899
It looks good.

559
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,234
A GOOD AMOUNT OF CREAM CHEESE

560
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,870
GOES INTO A POT!

561
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,174
He's putting the broccoli into that pot.

562
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,342
The broccoli he makes…

563
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,543
HI-YAH!

564
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,179
CHUCKLE…

565
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,081
A shot of salt.

566
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,149
HE'S PLAYING BASKETBALL

567
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,719
He recently seems devious
when he does that.

568
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,688
-There are a variety of versions.
-Right.

569
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,824
SPRINKLE

570
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,260
He's still the same Chef Hyun-suk,
but he looks devious.

571
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,629
He's been doing
the underarm version recently.

572
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,431
What's that?

573
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,500
I think he's making gratin.

574
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,534
Broccoli gratin.

575
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,970
And what's he doing now?

576
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,673
I think he's making
cheese gratin of sorts.

577
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,309
I see. He's using lots of cheese.

578
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,643
He said he liked cheese.

579
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,747
This must be the side dish.

580
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,815
-The side dish.
-It looks like broccoli gratin.

581
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,620
Nam-no is putting lots of work
into the fish cake.

582
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,591
He's putting it into the plastic
to shape the fish cake.

583
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,094
Wait, will the huge ground pieces
come out through that hole?

584
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,195
Zipper bag.

585
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,430
Zipper bag?

586
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,365
Where is it?

587
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,567
-What's wrong?
-Zipper bag.

588
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,736
-Zipper bag.
-Zipper bag!

589
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,037
-Zipper bag.
-It's an emergency.

590
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,973
-What do you need?
-He's looking for a zipper bag.

591
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,042
-You should've prepared it before!
-He's getting anxious.

592
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,644
You're running out of time!

593
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,613
It's down there.

594
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,015
-The zipper bag.
-It's down on the right side!

595
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,618
-Where is it?
-It's under the sink!

596
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,386
It's under the sink!

597
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,156
-Under the sink!
-It's an emergency.

598
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,858
-It's under the sink.
-He just lost 30 seconds!

599
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,095
-You should've checked beforehand.
-It's an emergency.

600
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,731
He just lost 30 seconds!

601
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,199
They don't let anyone off easy.

602
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,968
Nam-no just lost
30 seconds of precious time.

603
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,804
Why is he putting it into the bag?

604
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,540
-He doesn't think that one will work.
-Oh, the first one won't work?

605
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,342
-Or he'll flatten it out.
-What are you going to do now?

606
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,111
Chef Nam-no.

607
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,146
You must check your tools beforehand.

608
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,714
He's using this chance.

609
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,950
What if Young-kwang
eats meat that isn't tasty?

610
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,753
He's such a huge nag.

611
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,455
CAN'T HEAR, CAN'T BE BOTHERED

612
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,790
He's just making the fish cake?

613
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:20,992
Into a square shape?

614
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,562
He's using the zipper bag
to make the shape.

615
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,398
HE OILS THE GRILL!

616
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,400
That's really hot.

617
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,935
What's he doing on that grill?

618
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,137
Is that meat?

619
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,072
He'll start broiling the meat now.

620
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,640
It looks like beef.

621
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:36,741
He'll cook it whole.

622
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,477
What are you rubbing on it?

623
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,979
-Seasoned soy sauce.
-Seasoned soy sauce.

624
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,382
1. RUB SIRLOIN WITH EGG SOY SAUCE
AND BROIL OVER THE GRILL

625
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,617
GROUND BEEF

626
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,653
Is that the patty?

627
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,455
-Ground beef.
-What's he doing?

628
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,656
That's not the sirloin.

629
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,925
HE'S DOING THAT AGAIN

630
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,763
Nothing went into the pan.

631
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,499
Not a single granule went in.

632
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,634
No, I added a good amount.

633
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,135
And his arm doesn't reach up

634
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,804
<i>as far as he used to ten years ago.</i>

635
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,472
<i>It used to be much higher.</i>

636
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,675
His eyesight is worse now,
so he failed to aim correctly.

637
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,144
-He's more cautious now.
-Yes.

638
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,413
-It practically didn't go in.
-No.

639
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,282
When he really needs it,
he adds it like this.

640
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,783
Young-kwang feels…

641
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,819
QUIET, ALL OF YOU!

642
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,821
LOOK AT THAT GUY

643
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,792
He still has his game!

644
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,396
It went into that pot.

645
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,032
-The <i>gomtang</i> might be salty.
-It became salty.

646
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,434
HE'S NOT IN THE RIGHT MIND TO DO CHECK

647
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,703
INSTANT RICE

648
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,905
My hands are shaking. Why?

649
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,244
Chef Nam-no washed instant rice
to get rid of the starch.

650
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,013
I think he'll deep-fry it.

651
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,915
-Are those rice grains?
-They are.

652
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,616
He's deep-frying the rice?

653
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,185
-He is.
-Just like that?

654
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,556
-I think it might overflow… No!
-No!

655
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,424
-Turn it off.
-The oil.

656
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,326
-No!
-No!

657
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,761
It's an emergency!

658
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,230
-It's an emergency.
-It went over.

659
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,332
Nam-no turned off the heat.

660
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,335
-He's in a crisis.
-I feel anxious.

661
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,870
There are those days.

662
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:16,141
You should be careful, Nam-no.

663
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,676
THE TORCH TOP FALLS OFF

664
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,044
Oh, no.

665
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,513
-I feel anxious. Be careful.
-This isn't good.

666
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,815
He was flustered
when he couldn't find the zipper bag.

667
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,017
He seems quite anxious now.

668
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,919
-You have eight minutes.
-Eight minutes.

669
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,188
It's all right. That's done.

670
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,489
HE LOST THE ATTENTION

671
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,524
All right.

672
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,659
I'M EATING CHEESE

673
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,128
Nam-no is in a crisis.

674
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,098
GIVES IT ANOTHER GO

675
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,736
He was flustered
when he couldn't find the zipper bag.

676
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,706
Chef Hyun-suk is using lots of cheese.
Are you sure they're all edible?

677
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,774
Yes, I can't tell you
how everything tastes,

678
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,110
-but I've been looking at it.
-Is that so?

679
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,979
I left out everything that went bad.

680
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,548
He's adding even more cheese.

681
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,852
He's making use of the cheese
that had been neglected for a while.

682
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,254
Aren't you happy to see that, Young-kwang?

683
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,956
You should thank him.

684
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,424
I think the meat is burning.

685
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,626
It is.

686
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,495
HE FLIPS THE FORGOTTEN MEAT

687
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,197
-It's dark!
-Did it burn?

688
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,099
WHAT NOW?

689
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,534
Was that what he wanted to serve him?

690
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,405
-He looks flustered.
-The burnt piece of meat?

691
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,474
Isn't the meat burnt?

692
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,110
That'll clog up his veins right away.

693
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,978
That's what he's serving.

694
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,481
-That's it.
-He wanted something good for his health.

695
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,118
He doesn't talk when he's in a pinch.

696
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,819
He's adding salt quietly.

697
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,022
The throw-in didn't work,
so he adds salt quietly.

698
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,090
HE BECOMES QUIET AND COMPOSED

699
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,693
The throw-in didn't work,
so he adds salt quietly.

700
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,062
-It didn't go in before.
-He can't hear you.

701
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,132
-It's burnt, right?
-The meat is burnt. What will he do?

702
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,300
It looks like an asphalt road.

703
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,136
He's trying to scratch it out.

704
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,304
You'll see if it tastes burnt or not.

705
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,007
He teased others last time
for burning their food.

706
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,375
REAPING WHAT HE HAS SOWN

707
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,977
We'll see if it's burnt.

708
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,814
HE CALMLY MOVES ON TO THE NEXT STEP

709
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,051
What's that?

710
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,186
He's using a sheet of paper.

711
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,254
3. PUT PROVOLONE ON THE SHEET

712
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,424
I think he's trying to make tuile.

713
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,459
SOMETHING UNHEARD OF, MONTEREY JACK

714
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,027
How many kinds are you using?

715
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,763
-Will he toast that?
-It must go on top of the burger.

716
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,933
-It'll turn crispy.
-It looks good.

717
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,968
You have under six minutes now.

718
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:29,607
6. WASH CHILI PICKLES
AND CUT INTO SMALL PIECES

719
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,244
GRABS A TRAY AND A STRAINER

720
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,814
What's he doing?

721
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,049
<i>-Gomtang.</i>
<i>-Gomtang</i> boiled with garlic.

722
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,918
-What's he doing?
-Why is he doing that?

723
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,254
-What's he doing?
-He needs a strainer to emulsify the soup.

724
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,190
He's stirring it with the strainer.

725
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,859
-He's just using it on the tray?
-Yes.

726
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,762
-He's not throwing that away?
-That's how he emulsifies this?

727
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,531
Poong's going to use this
one of these days.

728
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,966
I'll do that soon.

729
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,735
Nam-no shows an advanced technique

730
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,804
while Hyun-suk has burnt his sirloin.

731
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:03,007
Lemon juice and zest.

732
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,577
Sung-ju, please report to us
from the kitchen.

733
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,679
-All right. Let me go out.
-Okay.

734
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,013
They're both in a rush.

735
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,416
I'm fascinated by this.

736
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,751
Can you try the sauce?

737
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,953
Yes, he keeps squeezing that in.
What is it?

738
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:16,955
Oh, no!

739
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,757
-It exploded.
-It exploded.

740
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,291
Please!

741
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,860
-What's with me today?
-It exploded.

742
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,161
It just exploded.

743
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,996
Half of it burst out.

744
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,134
What will he do now? Nam-no is sweating.

745
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,568
The fish cake isn't done, either.

746
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,437
Nam-no is busy.
You have 3 minutes and 40 seconds.

747
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,105
What's Hyun-suk doing?

748
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,308
This is their first battle,

749
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,111
and Hyun-suk has never lost
twice in a row.

750
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,679
4. FILL THE BRIOCHE WITH STIR-FRIED MEAT
AND MAKE THE BURGER

751
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,580
He's serving it.

752
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,948
Hyun-suk is serving the food.

753
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,619
He seems to be in a rush too.

754
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,188
And the meat. Isn't it burnt?

755
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,457
He got mad when we said it seemed burnt.

756
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,627
Let me check and see
if the sirloin is burnt or not.

757
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,128
I'll check if it's burnt.

758
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,634
-Is the meat burnt?
-Does it taste burnt?

759
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,169
It's burnt, yet it's delicious!

760
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,871
-Hey.
-Was this intentional?

761
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,774
-Searing.
-Searing.

762
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,709
He called it searing.

763
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,344
Searing.
You have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

764
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,980
The problem is Nam-no.

765
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,649
He's in a serious situation

766
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,018
and in a hurry.

767
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,653
How is he going to use those?

768
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,221
7. STRAIN THE SAUCE AND SERVE

769
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,423
He's putting in a lot of work into that.

770
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,458
Look at that.

771
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,828
THE FRIED RICE GRAINS ARE DONE

772
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,163
He needs to turn this into a fish cake.

773
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,365
Nam-no is in a hurry.

774
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,100
That's the deep-fried rice, right?

775
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,535
The deep-fried rice.

776
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,838
Wait, what about his thing in the oven?

777
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,606
Let me see. Did it turn out well?

778
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,575
-It needs to.
-It looks good.

779
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,776
You have 2 minutes 16 seconds.

780
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,678
He pulled something out from the oven.

781
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:51,316
And he does that with the cheese!

782
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,151
OH, MY

783
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,019
WHOA

784
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,389
-And he does that with the cheese!
-Right away?

785
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,624
My gosh.

786
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,460
-My gosh.
-He's covering the burnt meat.

787
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,829
And he uses a torch!

788
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,030
ADDING THE SMOKY TASTE WITH A TORCH

789
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,266
I can smell the cheese.

790
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,169
Hyun-suk brings out
the smell of the cheese.

791
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,104
He looks so cool when he's focused.

792
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,473
He looks like how he did ten years ago.

793
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,442
A minute and 40 seconds.

794
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,577
NAM-NO FINALLY PULLS OUT THE FISH CAKE

795
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,613
-Huh?
-Huh?

796
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,981
-It's not cooked.
-Wait. It's not.

797
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,582
The fish cake isn't cooked.

798
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,251
The fish cake… Wait.

799
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,653
-Did water seep into it?
-I hope it's done.

800
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,188
-It's still raw.
-It's not.

801
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,957
-Is it cooked?
-Is it?

802
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,525
He says it's cooked.

803
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,527
All right, Nam-no.

804
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,696
The fish cake!

805
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,064
It's piping hot.

806
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,666
The fish cake is his biggest concern.

807
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,668
He pulls something out from the oven.

808
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,671
-Okay.
-I hope it turns out nicely.

809
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,705
A minute and 40 seconds.

810
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,008
MAKING THE TOP CRISPY!

811
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,009
He's roasting the top.

812
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,577
-That looks good.
-It is.

813
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,512
The fish cake.

814
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,447
Hyun-suk finishes!

815
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,050
He finished
with a minute and 20 seconds left.

816
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,754
-He made three different dishes.
-Can you film this while it's boiling?

817
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,856
It's still simmering.

818
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,326
-It's simmering.
-Yes, I can see it moving.

819
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,962
The fish cake is his biggest concern.

820
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,397
He tops it with the stars.

821
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:15,133
Nam-no has a minute left!

822
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,868
-It's way too hot!
-It's hot!

823
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,404
-It's too hot.
-Even chefs find those too hot.

824
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,406
Nam-no hurts himself while cooking!

825
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,507
It's too hot!

826
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,977
Will he make Hyun-suk lose
two rounds in a row?

827
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,478
-Thirty seconds.
-You got this!

828
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,180
He's grating that?

829
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,849
-Twenty-six seconds.
-You can do this!

830
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,786
You can do this!
But wouldn't the broccoli smell grassy?

831
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,754
ROOT FIRST, THEN DISS

832
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,524
-He's just throwing these in.
-The pepper.

833
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,626
-You have six seconds!
-You can do it!

834
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,161
Five. Four.

835
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,596
Nam-no is finished too.

836
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,966
Please give it up for him.

837
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,600
CLAPPING

838
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,601
Great job!

839
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,502
You've done well.

840
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,171
THE FINISHED DISHES TAKE OFF

841
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,339
That was rough.

842
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,375
This is a bowl of cheese.

843
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,510
I forgot to use the chopped chili.

844
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,678
May I use these?

845
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,213
Go ahead. Do whatever you want to.

846
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,781
-He had it done.
-Yes.

847
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,516
He's not making something new.

848
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,753
-He spent a while washing the pickles.
-He did.

849
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,789
-But he forgot to use them.
-Jeez, Nam-no.

850
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,358
Jeez.

851
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,461
Both dishes are finished
just for Young-kwang.

852
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:20,665
This is a burger,
and this is a dish called quenelle.

853
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,767
You got to watch them again
after ten years,

854
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,701
so any thoughts?

855
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,904
-First of all, it was hilarious.
-It was?

856
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,907
-They've become TV personalities.
-They're funny.

857
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,176
-Yes.
-I may have become a TV personality,

858
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,345
but I'm still a good chef,
so only that counts, right?

859
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,380
You're right.

860
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,649
-Thanks for that. You're the top chef.
-Of course.

861
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,084
-He's the best.
-That's right.

862
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,955
All right. It's time to try
I've Been Burgering to See You.

863
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,626
BROCCOLI GRATIN, GOLDEN BROWN BRIOCHE,
AND CHEESEBURGER

864
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:53,197
SERVED WITH CHEESE OVER STEAK

865
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:58,336
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
I'VE BEEN BURGERING TO SEE YOU

866
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:03,141
WE WERE REUNITED AFTER 10 YEARS…

867
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,876
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU

868
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,611
You served three dishes,

869
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:07,979
-so where does he begin?
-Which one?

870
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,748
-Try the burger first.
-The burger.

871
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,216
Have a bite of that burger

872
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,285
and some broccoli served as garnish.

873
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,787
HOLDING TIGHTLY

874
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,889
Will the burger work for him?

875
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,724
-It looks good.
-Yes.

876
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,092
-Here we go.
-Thank you.

877
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,760
He's going for the burger.

878
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,695
A BIG BITE

879
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,898
All right.

880
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,166
-It looks good.
-He makes it look good.

881
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,635
He stir-fried the meat inside.

882
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,503
And a bite of the garnish too.

883
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,805
Try the garnish too.

884
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,606
It looks good.

885
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,708
-He said he didn't like broccoli,
-Right.

886
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,178
-but I served it with cheese to help him.
-You did.

887
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,613
It's a great sign
if he says the broccoli is good.

888
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:47,685
-It looks too hot.
-Anyone can see that steam.

889
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,653
It looks so good.

890
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,054
Take your time.

891
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,990
It's steaming right now.

892
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,392
He can't even touch it.

893
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,829
-It's way too hot.
-It's too hot.

894
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,730
Try something else and let it cool down.

895
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,765
-Try something else.
-Yes.

896
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,434
FLEEING TO THE BURGER

897
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,138
The broccoli has been cooked piping hot.

898
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,007
HE FINALLY TRIES THE BROCCOLI GRATIN

899
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,744
Will Young-kwang end up liking broccoli?

900
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,947
It's way too hot.

901
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,715
Did you have to make it this hot?

902
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,751
He can lose a bit of sweat
to gain more muscles,

903
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,587
as well as a bit of tongue.

904
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,289
-Even his tongue?
-His tongue?

905
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,325
Okay, now.

906
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,559
-The broccoli.
-Gosh.

907
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,794
-Is it good?
-Very much so.

908
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,764
HE KEEPS GOING FOR THE BROCCOLI

909
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,999
He went for it again.

910
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,667
-On the burger.
-Like that?

911
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,637
-He's eating it together.
-Even though it's scorching hot.

912
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,372
TAKES A BIG BITE

913
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,673
GOSH…

914
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,041
Hey, Young-kwang.

915
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,045
-It's too hot!
-For the second time.

916
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,014
Be careful.

917
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,950
-Look at him.
-It's too hot.

918
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,752
HE MAY LOSE HIS TONGUE, BUT…

919
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,921
Your tongue may get burnt.

920
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,090
-He's turning his head.
-His mouth is fuming…

921
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,159
-What's going on?
-He's acting like the Turtle Ship.

922
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,628
-He's turning his head.
-His mouth is fuming…

923
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:07,331
-What's going on?
-He's acting like the Turtle Ship.

924
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,333
-It's so…
-Is it good?

925
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,502
He says it's good.

926
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,470
He loves it.

927
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,705
FINISHES THE LAST PIECE

928
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,741
-And the steak.
-The steak.

929
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:17,842
He's done with the burger.

930
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,043
NEXT, STEAK WITH CHEESE

931
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,945
It seems burnt, yet it's not.

932
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,181
It's not that the meat is burnt.

933
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,416
I put soy sauce on it,
so it's just the layer of that.

934
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,018
-Is that so?
-It's the burnt soy sauce.

935
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,153
I see.
It's the taste of the burnt soy sauce.

936
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,423
-It looks good. Of course, it is.
-The steak.

937
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,258
CURIOUS

938
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,465
SUCH A GLORIOUS RESPONSE

939
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,434
Gosh, look at that.

940
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,304
My kids would do that as infants
when they ate something nice.

941
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,141
-Yes, they do that when it's good.
-"It's so good!"

942
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,443
He must like it a lot.

943
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,045
Gosh.

944
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,782
The soy sauce kicks in later.

945
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,053
At first, I can only taste the meat
and cheese when I chew it,

946
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,223
but the soy sauce flavor lingers
toward the end.

947
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,792
You've returned as a gourmet.

948
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,761
THIS TIME, BROCCOLI WITH STEAK

949
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,031
-Gosh.
-Gosh. He ate that in one bite.

950
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,634
He had it with steak
instead of the burger.

951
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,736
The broccoli.

952
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,605
The broccoli must be the key.

953
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,540
He loves broccoli.

954
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,109
-He loves it a lot.
-He does.

955
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,477
Is it good?

956
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,045
It's salty,

957
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,180
greasy,

958
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,817
-hot, but it's so good.
-Gosh.

959
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:33,784
That's odd.

960
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,854
It's what you expect
when you eat American food.

961
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,257
-I think so.
-Salty, greasy, and hot.

962
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,524
That's peculiar.

963
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,026
He needs soda.

964
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,995
He opens a can of soda.

965
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,363
It's supposed to be beer food.

966
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,430
GULPING

967
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,732
I WANT SOME TOO…

968
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,100
Gosh.

969
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,335
He's already done with the burger.

970
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,904
-He looks excited.
-That was so good.

971
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,640
Tell us about the burger you had.

972
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,174
Was it different from a regular burger?

973
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,677
It was kind of similar.

974
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,681
-It was just a burger.
-A burger is a burger.

975
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,018
But when these three came together,

976
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,986
-The mix?
-it was so good. Yes.

977
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,088
I loved the bread too.

978
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,456
The bread was good.

979
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,725
It's time to switch.

980
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,761
<i>Your Physique is Quenelle.</i>

981
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,429
<i>It's a French dish called quenelle.</i>

982
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,298
FRENCH FISH CAKE FULL OF PROTEIN
ON TOP OF GOMTANG SAUCE

983
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,935
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
YOUR PHYSIQUE IS QUENELLE

984
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,570
It's such an exquisite fish cake,

985
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,274
-made with shrimp, cuttlefish, halibut.
-Halibut.

986
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,309
That's halibut.

987
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,712
Nam-no felt rushed toward the end
and had a dramatic finish.

988
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,381
Try the sauce first.

989
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,617
He put a lot of work into the sauce.

990
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,520
Yes, he made it with <i>gomtang.</i>

991
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,390
He'll forget the burger
with a sip of the sauce.

992
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,593
You can try it with everything now.

993
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,596
-He looks serious.
-He does.

994
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,533
-What's going on, Young-kwang?
-He looks serious.

995
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,268
What's going on?

996
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,637
He was so excited before.

997
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,272
Jeez. He's not sure.

998
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,940
-Why?
-He got a taste now.

999
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,610
-It might be sour because of the lemon.
-It might change when he eats everything.

1000
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,513
It would be too bland
without the acidity, so I added it.

1001
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,248
You'll see why when you eat it all.

1002
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,151
He knows how to eat it.

1003
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,620
Try the star and a piece of the fish cake.

1004
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,322
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy it.

1005
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,124
This is what's important.

1006
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,227
-When he has everything together.
-I hope he likes this one.

1007
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,563
All right. Young-kwang?

1008
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,566
IS THAT A FROWN?

1009
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,968
-What's wrong?
-Is that a shudder?

1010
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,803
-What is it?
-Is it too sour?

1011
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,573
TILTING HEAD

1012
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,942
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

1013
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,344
-Is it too sour?
-First of all, it's good.

1014
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,214
-It is?
-It's good, but?

1015
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,750
But personally speaking,

1016
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,618
it's a bit salty.

1017
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,422
EYES SHUT

1018
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,724
Is it because you had
something strong before this?

1019
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,794
If mine was too strong,
that wouldn't feel salty.

1020
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,730
-If mine was too salty.
-That means it's really salty.

1021
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,000
It's too salty?

1022
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,870
He tries it once again.
He might have had only the salty part.

1023
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:06,771
Why is it salty?

1024
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,074
Were the seafood already pretty salty?

1025
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,545
Wait. This side isn't as salty.

1026
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,414
-What?
-It depends on the part?

1027
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,250
-Was it not seasoned evenly?
-That might be it.

1028
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,887
-What's the reason?
-I spread it out. It should be the same.

1029
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,256
I've never had

1030
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,425
anything like this before.

1031
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,959
-It's a French dish.
-Right.

1032
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,962
It tastes a bit unusual.

1033
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,030
An unusual taste?

1034
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,132
-It's unfamiliar.
-He has to get familiar.

1035
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,934
Do the French eat their food salty?

1036
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,469
Of course.

1037
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,770
Since they eat it with wine.

1038
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,539
THAT'S WHY FRENCH DISHES ARE SALTY

1039
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,275
It must be salty enough
for it to be served with a drink.

1040
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,110
He had to cook for his physique.

1041
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,344
Chef Nam-no.

1042
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,048
He must hold back on liquor
to keep his good physique.

1043
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,784
Jeez. He's such a nuisance.

1044
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,554
I think Chef Hyun-suk's dish
was higher in fat.

1045
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,622
ATTACKS HIM ON THE SLY

1046
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,291
He takes another piece.

1047
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,660
I'm curious. I want to try it.

1048
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,062
It seems like the saltiness isn't even.

1049
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,898
-Mmm.
-Yes?

1050
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,734
It doesn't taste too bad

1051
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,470
after a few bites.

1052
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,506
It doesn't taste too bad
after a few bites?

1053
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,740
Please.

1054
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,743
Was the fish cake
similar to what we already know?

1055
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,079
It's a bit softer.

1056
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,747
-I see.
-Yes.

1057
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,917
He didn't add anything starchy.

1058
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,587
<i>-It must be softer.</i>
<i>-It's just an egg and butter.</i>

1059
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,556
He put the fork down. All right.

1060
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,191
NERVOUS

1061
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,460
Will you try some, Young-ae?

1062
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,629
What will Jang-geum think of this?

1063
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,899
These are the three dishes
Chef Hyun-suk made.

1064
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,569
She goes for the garnish,
the broccoli first.

1065
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,276
Broccoli is great for your health.

1066
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,246
But what will it be like with cheese
instead of <i>chogochujang?</i>

1067
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,548
It tastes even better

1068
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,918
because he made it just now
and it's still hot.

1069
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,888
-Freshly cooked cheese.
-Yes.

1070
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,690
-And the burger.
-He made that again too.

1071
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,159
Gosh, she enjoys it so much.

1072
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,828
PLEASED

1073
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,799
The bread is very soft,
which helps bring out its flavor.

1074
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,968
The meat is good,

1075
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,005
-but the bread also plays a big part.
-Right? It's the bread.

1076
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,974
She must like the bread a lot.

1077
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,510
She even bought some
on the Internet just now.

1078
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,846
-The two bags of bread he had?
-Yes.

1079
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,215
-I hear that bread is good.
-Is it?

1080
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,852
That's delicious bread. It's brioche,

1081
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,087
made with lots of butter.

1082
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,956
Where did you get the bread?

1083
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,157
I got it on this website.

1084
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,191
On a website?

1085
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,595
You'll find it if you search for brioche.

1086
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,864
Bri-what?

1087
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,400
-Brioche.
-Bri…

1088
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,801
FOCUSED, NOT A PRODUCT PLACEMENT

1089
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,937
-There it is.
-Brioche.

1090
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,473
-I ordered it right now.
-She just did that.

1091
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,143
It wasn't even expensive. Just 8,000 won.

1092
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,347
-It's great for the price.
-It's not too bad, really.

1093
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,350
Next, the steak.

1094
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,653
Steak topped with cheese.

1095
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,188
My gosh.

1096
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,456
I see.

1097
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,725
She gasped a little.

1098
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,162
She keeps nodding.

1099
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:22,299
-She loves it more than the last episode.
-She seems to like it better.

1100
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,835
-Jang-geum just gasped.
-She likes salty and greasy food.

1101
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,173
It's the cheese.

1102
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,941
It brings out the flavor a lot.

1103
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,643
THE CHEESE ADDS TO THE MEAT

1104
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,245
I loved how it mixed with the cheese.

1105
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,914
The cheese was the star.

1106
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,817
He turned the neglected cheese
into the star.

1107
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,587
Next, Chef Nam-no's quenelle.

1108
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,688
Can't say anything yet.

1109
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,291
Young-kwang said it was too salty.

1110
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,261
CURIOUS

1111
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,731
-It's good.
-Is it?

1112
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,532
Is it too salty?

1113
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,101
It's not.

1114
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,003
THE QUENELLE ISN'T TOO SALTY FOR JANG-GEUM

1115
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,672
Because the cheese was as salty as this.

1116
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,409
-You're right.
-So it doesn't feel as salty.

1117
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,579
Also, this was crunchy,
unlike the soft bread.

1118
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,648
<i>The mix of crunchy bread</i>

1119
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,917
<i>and the soft fish cake</i>

1120
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,754
isn't something ordinary, which I loved.

1121
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,790
I love that you tried something new.

1122
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,626
-I can't get this anywhere else.
-I see.

1123
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,194
It's good.

1124
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,629
She gives a thumbs-up.

1125
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,232
So why did it taste too salty?

1126
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,335
He said it was salty
because it tasted like salt.

1127
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,836
-Come on.
-Good grief.

1128
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,305
He said it was salty
because it tasted like salt,

1129
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,641
so if you ask him for the reason…

1130
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,044
Some are speculating right now

1131
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,945
that Chef Hyun-suk

1132
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,215
-intentionally put salt in Nam-no's dish.
-It must've gone in there.

1133
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,051
He scattered it like this in the middle.

1134
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:51,155
-Yes, he did it this way once.
-He did that, and it went into that pot.

1135
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,223
We must do a replay.

1136
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,125
Our viewers may get curious,

1137
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,896
<i>so please take a look and see</i>
<i>if he put salt into Nam-no's dish.</i>

1138
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,798
<i>We'll play it in slow motion.</i>

1139
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,766
<i>Where did the salt land?</i>

1140
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,203
<i>It went into the pot!</i>

1141
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,137
I may seem

1142
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,075
rather flashy in the way I move,

1143
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,910
but I keep my business ethics.

1144
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,580
Look at Young-ae.

1145
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,082
She loved it so much

1146
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,684
that she had to open a can of soda.

1147
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,519
She opened the cola.

1148
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,321
I thought you were a naturalist.

1149
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,858
-She said that.
-You love both soda and cheese.

1150
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,395
Why did you live
in Yangpyeong for so long?

1151
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,599
-You have the palate of a city dweller.
-She's one of us.

1152
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,902
-She likes the food city folks eat.
-That's why I said

1153
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,804
life is like instant food.

1154
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,073
She's finally making a confession.

1155
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,008
-She loves it too much.
-She loves it.

1156
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,144
She's enjoying it very much.

1157
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,346
-It's time to make a decision.
-It's time.

1158
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,814
<i>Press one for Yoon Nam-no.</i>

1159
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,717
<i>Press two for Choi Hyun-suk.</i>

1160
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,321
-I don't know how it'll end.
-Right.

1161
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,991
I have to ask him
to make a decision and push the button,

1162
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,426
but he already made his choice.

1163
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,795
This means

1164
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,431
he had a strong preference.

1165
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:12,169
-This is a matter of personal taste.
-You're right.

1166
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,938
I don't mean that this was bad.
They were both really good…

1167
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,474
-We don't know the result yet.
-He already pointed to this.

1168
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,243
He already pointed to this.

1169
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,844
It's his preference.

1170
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,746
-That was…
-He pointed to that as he spoke.

1171
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,815
Please put the star on him!

1172
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,818
He wasn't speaking to Nam-no.
We don't know yet.

1173
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,921
Look. He's like, "Goodbye."

1174
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,623
He's already saying goodbye.

1175
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:33,557
It's not that.

1176
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,459
Let's find out what his choice is!

1177
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,127
This is a tough one.

1178
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,630
This was a dish
for Young-kwang's glorious physique.

1179
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,967
Will Hyun-suk rise above his previous loss

1180
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,637
and seize a victory again?

1181
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:51,175
Or will Nam-no humiliate him
by making him lose twice in a row

1182
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,977
Who did Young-kwang choose?

1183
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,713
-Which one is it?
-Who's the winner?

1184
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,882
CHOI HYUN-SUK

1185
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,051
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
I'VE BEEN BURGERING TO SEE YOU

1186
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,487
-Hyun-suk wins.
-What a big twist.

1187
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,724
-That was such a twist.
-It was.

1188
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:12,296
HIS CELEBRATION BECAME EVEN FLASHIER

1189
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,031
CONGRATULATIONS

1190
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,834
-It was perfect for my taste.
-He captured your taste.

1191
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,538
And thank you so much
for using all the cheese.

1192
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:26,210
What a story. They reunite after ten years
and exchange a star too.

1193
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,579
I knew he was a good man ten years ago,

1194
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,081
but he showed up again
with an exquisite palate.

1195
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,317
It was an honor, Young-kwang.

1196
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,653
-I see.
-Jeez.

1197
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,489
Young-kwang, please put a star
on the chef of your choice.

1198
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,659
Hyun-suk takes his 12th win.

1199
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,063
Yes, Young-kwang and Hyun-suk.

1200
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,332
-Congrats on your 12th star.
-Thank you.

1201
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,133
-Let's go!
-Congrats, Hyun-suk!

1202
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:57,407
<i>We're about to begin the second cook-off</i>
<i>with Young-kwang's ingredients.</i>

1203
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,844
These two are up against each other
to help him loosen up

1204
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,846
with a glass of beer after work.

1205
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,483
Chef Kwon Sung-jun the beer ambassador is

1206
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,854
up against Webtoon Artist Kim Poong,
the MVP of the world of beer.

1207
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,891
What do you mean
by the beer ambassador and the MVP?

1208
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,760
I saw the kind of beer
he kept in his fridge,

1209
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,862
and I'm the ambassador for that brand.

1210
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:20,864
You are?

1211
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:25,235
The beer I had the most in my life is
sitting right inside his fridge right now.

1212
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,437
How much do you mean by the most?

1213
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,940
I had a total of

1214
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,108
six cans.

1215
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,412
-That was the most drinks you had?
-About six.

1216
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,683
I can finish six cans of beer
just as aperitif.

1217
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,251
I don't drink often,

1218
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,520
but I'm a genius of drink pairing,

1219
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,155
so I know I'll do well.

1220
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,390
Pairing is important,

1221
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,425
but beer snacks are a bit different.

1222
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:52,429
Beer is something you can drink
even without some snacks,

1223
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:56,433
so if the snack tastes too strong,
it kills the taste of beer.

1224
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,769
That was where I began.
We started off differently.

1225
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,004
He needs to know why people drink beer.

1226
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,839
-That's true.
-Yes.

1227
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,343
Poong, when do you enjoy
a drink of beer the most?

1228
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,346
I've been raising my child lately,

1229
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,015
so after my baby falls asleep,
my wife and I

1230
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,885
enjoy a nice sippy of beer…

1231
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,986
Sippy?

1232
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,555
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say it's only a sippy.

1233
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,657
We chug some beer together.

1234
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,292
THE BEER IS GOING THROUGH A LOT

1235
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,828
Why can't he just plain drink it?

1236
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,164
It's because I love it that much.

1237
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,401
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: BRIOCHE,
GROUND BEEF, SHRIMP, LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI

1238
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,503
HALIBUT, LEMON, PARMESAN, BUTTER, GOUDA,
CHEDDAR, CREAM CHEESE, GOMTANG AND MORE

1239
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,272
My dish is called

1240
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,574
Napoli Matpizza.

1241
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,876
-Napoli Matpizza?
-Pizza.

1242
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,645
Are you making pizza?

1243
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,146
I'll make two dishes.

1244
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,882
First, it'll be similar to cheese pizza,

1245
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,119
served with pistachio cream cheese.

1246
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,587
-I'll make those.
-Sure.

1247
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,791
Here's the thing.
There's a Venetian dish called <i>cicchetti.</i>

1248
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,960
-<i>Cicchetti.</i>
-Among <i>cicchetti,</i>

1249
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,696
there's something called
<i>baccala mantecato.</i>

1250
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,167
It's a kind of spread
made with ground fish,

1251
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,403
so I'll make that with halibut.

1252
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:11,241
The key aspect of this pairing is this.

1253
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,110
Beer has different flavors,

1254
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,845
like sourness, bitterness, and nuttiness.

1255
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,615
I'll add those flavors
into the dish and serve it to you.

1256
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,884
How does pizza sound with beer?

1257
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,086
-It sounds great.
-Does it?

1258
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,423
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:

1259
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,525
PUPAE, INSTANT UDON SOUP BASE
SHRIMP, WHOLE WHEAT BREAD, BROCCOLI

1260
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,560
The dish I'll make is

1261
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,662
Pupa and Shrimp.

1262
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,464
-Pupa and Shrimp?
-Yes.

1263
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,066
You're using shrimp?

1264
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:37,801
And pupae.

1265
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,236
YOU GOT YOUR HANDS ON THOSE!

1266
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,904
Yes, he had pupae.

1267
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,073
-He had a huge bag of it.
-Yes.

1268
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,875
Those pupae with shrimp.

1269
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,043
Yes.

1270
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,744
They look very plump.

1271
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,380
It's my first time seeing these.

1272
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,850
-I've never seen them raw.
-They look awful.

1273
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,621
We often come across these
in cans, don't we?

1274
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,657
But these look freshly picked,

1275
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,060
straight from nature.

1276
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,096
-Really?
-These pupae literally came from nature.

1277
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:09,399
This was an exceptional opportunity
I couldn't miss.

1278
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,203
Also, pupae are the best kind of bar snack
to eat with beer.

1279
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,273
-He mentioned stamina and all.
-I know.

1280
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,743
So I'll make use of these.

1281
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,013
There's a Cantonese dish called
crispy garlic flakes shrimp.

1282
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,114
Crispy garlic flakes?

1283
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:28,085
It's a dish made with shrimp
toasted with garlic flakes

1284
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,520
and breadcrumbs,

1285
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,024
usually made with shrimp or crab.

1286
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,360
I thought it wouldn't be bad
to throw in some pupae.

1287
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,597
Once you get addicted to those,
you won't be able to stop.

1288
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,400
You look a bit embarrassed
to hear about your pupae.

1289
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,170
Why does he look embarrassed
with a hand over his mouth?

1290
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,239
I probably shouldn't have bought those.

1291
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,375
I thought you liked these.

1292
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,211
It's not that I can't eat them,

1293
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,780
but I wasn't sure why I got those.

1294
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,015
-Right.
-Wait.

1295
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:03,186
I get why he's flustered
because I was surprised to see those too.

1296
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,288
The pupae we usually eat

1297
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,758
tend to be flattened
after they were dried.

1298
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,161
But those are plump.

1299
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,929
Yes, they look like worms.

1300
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,464
They look like

1301
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,633
they can turn into moths any minute now.

1302
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,036
-It looks possible.
-How did you get those?

1303
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,472
But that means
they're of the highest quality.

1304
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:26,009
-I think so. They look great.
-They must be of great quality.

1305
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,679
And now, let's make him
a glorious beer snack

1306
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,715
through this cook-off.

1307
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,752
The beer ambassador who only drinks
because he gets paid,

1308
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,221
Chef Kwon Sung-jun.

1309
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,324
And here's a man who drinks beer
after a day of parenting.

1310
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,759
OLD EYES

1311
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,127
Ggul's daddy?

1312
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,296
-Ggyul.
-Ggyul?

1313
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,464
That's my son's name.

1314
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,732
-His name is Ggyul?
-Yes.

1315
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,734
Kim Ggyul?

1316
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,768
Yes.

1317
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,003
PSEUDONYMS FOR DAD AND SON

1318
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,406
-We call him by his baby bump name.
-Oh, his baby bump name.

1319
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,576
Ggyul's daddy,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong is up.

1320
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,045
Who'll become the glorious winner?

1321
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,514
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1322
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,451
A BATTLE IN THIS GLORIOUS NIGHT!

1323
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,553
Beer snacks.

1324
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,755
SUNG-JUN STARTS BY BOILING GOMTANG

1325
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,557
What's he doing? Is that the soup?

1326
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,092
-The bone soup?
-The beef bone soup.

1327
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,661
-And halibut.
-Halibut.

1328
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,062
<i>Baccala mantecato </i>is

1329
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,332
-usually made with salted cod.
-Ugh.

1330
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,301
-The pupae.
-He's using the pupae.

1331
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,637
Look at those. They look like jelly.

1332
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,706
They must've pulled off
only the head and the legs.

1333
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:30,974
I can't believe this.

1334
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,475
He's using the pupae.

1335
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,345
They're popping!

1336
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,613
Ugh!

1337
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,316
-Something popped out!
-Watch it!

1338
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,650
THIS IS THE CRAZIEST INGREDIENT!

1339
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,088
Whoa. Wait a moment.

1340
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,490
Something is coming out!

1341
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,491
Something white.

1342
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,460
They do look plump.

1343
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,896
The ones we eat all seem dry, right?

1344
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,165
-But those are…
-They're raw.

1345
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,300
These are literally raw pupae.

1346
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,668
How…

1347
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,370
How did you get those?

1348
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,272
Yes, how did you get those?

1349
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,306
Where can you get those?

1350
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,841
Are these available for purchase?

1351
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,244
I just looked it up on the Internet.

1352
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,045
-I feel bad.
-Look at that.

1353
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,847
Something yellow is popping out.

1354
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,749
-It's the inside.
-They're popping.

1355
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:16,152
Gosh, it's like the innards
of sea cucumbers.

1356
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,487
Jeez.

1357
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,456
-Is it okay?
-It might taste good.

1358
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,224
-Those?
-It may turn out well.

1359
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,759
TRUST HIM

1360
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,229
-It's the inside.
-They're popping.

1361
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,466
It doesn't look anything like
the canned pupae we all know.

1362
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,434
-Are you boiling those?
-I am.

1363
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,737
He's using raw pupae.

1364
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,905
SUNG-JUN LOST EVERYONE'S ATTENTION!

1365
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,507
HE TRIES TO TAKE IT BACK BY CHOPPING!

1366
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,376
I don't know if they're good quality,

1367
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,145
but I can tell they surely are raw
by the way they pop.

1368
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,281
It must feel odd.

1369
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,182
It'll pop in your mouth.

1370
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,619
-Are you using beef, Chef Sung-jun?
-I am.

1371
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,554
Did you know about the pupae?

1372
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,990
No.

1373
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,295
He just heard
that it was good for your stamina,

1374
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,298
so he had bought them
and forgot about them.

1375
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,832
SALT

1376
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,903
3. STIR-FRY CHOPPED ONION
AND GROUND BEEF IN AN OILED PAN

1377
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,839
MINCED GARLIC

1378
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,076
THE TWO TOPPINGS FOR HIS PIZZA!

1379
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,678
Is he going to grind the bread?

1380
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,747
-He's making breadcrumbs.
-To make breadcrumbs?

1381
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,050
2. GRIND WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
AND MAKE BREADCRUMBS

1382
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,352
POWDERY

1383
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,920
It's going over.

1384
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,955
The pot is boiling over.

1385
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,357
It just boiled over.

1386
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,226
You used a lot. That's a lot.

1387
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:31,828
If it turns out well,

1388
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,597
it'll be like fried grasshoppers,
and some people eat those.

1389
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,633
Beer fills you up,

1390
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,402
-so the snack can't be too heavy.
-No.

1391
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,306
I'm a bit worried that
the pizza may be a bit too heavy.

1392
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:47,043
But the dough makes up
about half of what a pizza is.

1393
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,244
Where's the dough?

1394
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,412
He grabbed bread.

1395
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,284
HE PREPARED THE BREAD
WHILE EVERYONE LOOKED AT THE PUPAE

1396
00:55:54,851 --> 00:56:00,190
4. CUT BRIOCHE INTO SQUARES
AND TOAST IN THE OVEN

1397
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,260
-The bread?
-He's using the bread?

1398
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,731
Wait, Chef Sung-jun is making

1399
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,232
something familiar.

1400
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,101
-What?
-In the previous round…

1401
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,936
Is that the burger filling?

1402
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,038
He's using both ground beef and onion.

1403
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,107
But he won't throw in cheese, will he?

1404
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,209
-Chef Sung-jun.
-Yes?

1405
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:23,680
Are you copying Chef Hyun-suk
after seeing him win?

1406
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:24,948
No way.

1407
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,451
After all, I'm the Baby Hyun-suk,
so we must've had the same idea.

1408
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,453
You copied him.

1409
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,688
He's adding the smoky flavor.

1410
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,824
HOW WILL HIS DISH DIFFER
WITH THE SAME IDEA?

1411
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,259
MINCED GARLIC, BUTTER

1412
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,427
What's that? Shrimp?

1413
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:38,862
Shrimp.

1414
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,364
The shrimp were that big? They look good.

1415
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,032
-Red shrimp.
-Red shrimp.

1416
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,068
Poong uses shrimp too.

1417
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,403
Pupa and Shrimp.

1418
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,139
Like crispy garlic flakes,

1419
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,774
a Cantonese dish.

1420
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,143
Are you throwing in <i>ramyeon </i>soup base?

1421
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,980
Is that the soup from his instant udon?

1422
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:57,981
Yes.

1423
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,716
-The instant soup base?
-I added some.

1424
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,017
The soup from the udon.

1425
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,453
HE CRUSHES THE BROCCOLI

1426
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,523
3. BOIL UDON SOUP BASE AND COOK BROCCOLI

1427
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,658
He's boiling broccoli in udon soup base.

1428
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,859
What?

1429
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,530
-He's boiling broccoli in udon soup base?
-I am.

1430
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,899
But he has a point.

1431
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:19,402
There are Japanese dishes
where ingredients are parboiled in broth.

1432
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,837
And the shrimp.

1433
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,573
-He's deep-frying those.
-He is?

1434
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,043
HOW DID THE BRIOCHE TURN OUT AS HIS DOUGH?

1435
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,179
The bread looks so good.

1436
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,314
-Is that the bread?
-You're right.

1437
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,183
He toasted it in the oven.

1438
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,551
To top it with meat.

1439
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,286
He's topping it like this.

1440
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,455
-It's similar to Hyun-suk's dish.
-It's similar.

1441
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,923
I think the difference is

1442
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,459
if it's folded or spread out.

1443
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,695
-I folded it before serving it.
-You're right!

1444
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,864
No. No way.

1445
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,432
He's also using cheese.

1446
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,135
He's using the same cheese.

1447
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,404
MUSTARD LEAF KIMCHI

1448
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,874
6. TOP BRIOCHE WITH MEAT,
CHEDDAR, AND MUSTARD LEAF KIMCHI

1449
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,810
He's topping it with mustard leaf kimchi.

1450
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,979
-He's using that as the kick.
-He used kimchi.

1451
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,948
It goes back into the oven.

1452
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,884
WHAT'S WITH THIS FACE?

1453
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,520
IT MEANS THAT THE FRIES ARE DONE!

1454
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,422
SHRIMP FRIES ARE DONE!

1455
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,525
POONG'S LIST OF FRIES: 1. SHRIMP FRIES

1456
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:17,494
AND THE PROBLEMATIC…

1457
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,663
-He grabs the pupae!
-The pupae!

1458
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,798
Who's reporting this time?

1459
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,032
It's Jung-hwan.

1460
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,602
Can you taste the pupae broth?

1461
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,036
That sounds great.

1462
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,571
He has to try that.

1463
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,506
Sung-ju.

1464
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,641
I'll go out twice next time,
so can you go?

1465
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,710
Goodness, I don't want to do that, either.

1466
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,545
I'm a picky eater too.

1467
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,280
THE GUY WHO HAS TO EAT IT

1468
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,215
Jeez. That's too much.

1469
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,384
Poong uses broccoli,

1470
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,153
although Young-kwang
doesn't like it that much.

1471
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,122
CHECKING THE BROCCOLI

1472
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,423
It looks good.

1473
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,791
You have nine minutes left.

1474
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,560
It's not bad.

1475
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,795
The way he cooked the broccoli is

1476
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,198
a technique often used
in Japanese cuisine.

1477
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,499
It's usually katsuobushi broth,

1478
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:00,136
but instead he's using
the instant udon soup base.

1479
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,171
That's how he's adding flavor
to the ingredients.

1480
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,941
-I think he'll fry those.
-You're right.

1481
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,577
-Where did you learn to do this?
-Right?

1482
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,946
-He has a point.
-How clever.

1483
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,882
THE LEMON JUICE HE SQUEEZED OUT

1484
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,119
GOES INTO THE GARLIC BUTTER SHRIMP

1485
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,322
7. ADD LEMON JUICE
TO GARLIC BUTTER SHRIMP AND GOMTANG

1486
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:23,059
HE FINISHES COOKING HALIBUT IN GOMTANG

1487
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,261
MOVES HALIBUT TO AN ICED BOWL

1488
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,463
Sung-jun is done with the halibut.

1489
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:31,834
He's crushing those over iced water
and keeping them cold.

1490
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,169
Is there a reason?

1491
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,305
I'm going to cool it down and mix it.

1492
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,839
It's a dish that's served cold.

1493
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,374
9. SPRINKLE LEMON ZEST OVER SHRIMP

1494
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:41,878
Lemon. That's something he likes.

1495
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,813
I wonder if the pupae taste good.

1496
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,248
THIS TIME, CHECKING THE PUPAE

1497
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,485
FIRST, DRY THEM

1498
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,087
If they're undercooked…

1499
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,523
-They'll smell fishy.
-…they will pop.

1500
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,891
He deep-fried broccoli, right?

1501
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,427
-It looks good.
-It's been cooked well.

1502
00:59:57,493 --> 01:00:00,930
-It looks golden brown. Did he do well?
-It'll taste good too.

1503
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:04,133
Well, people say everything is good
when it's deep-fried,

1504
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,668
so broccoli must taste good too.

1505
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,305
ADDING LEMON ZEST INTO HALIBUT TOO

1506
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:10,873
LEMON JUICE

1507
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,442
HALIBUT, OLIVE OIL

1508
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:17,347
10. BLEND HALIBUT, LEMON ZEST,
LEMON JUICE, AND OLIVE OIL

1509
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,348
BUTTER

1510
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:21,618
LASTLY, ADD BUTTER TO MAKE
HALIBUT MANTECATO!

1511
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,387
Will you deep-fry the pupae too?

1512
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,190
-Yes, I will. I'll fry everything.
-You'll deep-fry those?

1513
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,725
Man.

1514
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,161
It's as if he's deep-frying worms.

1515
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,330
-He's deep-frying them.
-Look at his face.

1516
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:38,601
Poong must think
deep-fried dishes go very well

1517
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,703
with a glass of beer.

1518
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,374
It'll taste quite nice.

1519
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,975
It's going well, so I'll be fine.

1520
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,378
Goodness. What is this?

1521
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,513
-They look like small hornets.
-Yes.

1522
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,749
You're frying those too?
Why do you deep-fry so many things?

1523
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,050
I have to.

1524
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,152
-What's that?
-Breadcrumbs.

1525
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,854
-You're frying those?
-Yes.

1526
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,489
I see. Breadcrumbs.

1527
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,557
He's working hard
on deep-frying everything.

1528
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:03,693
Right.

1529
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,761
CREAM CHEESE

1530
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,829
11. MAKE A DIP WITH CREAM CHEESE,
PISTACHIO SPREAD, LEMON JUICE

1531
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:07,997
What are you up to, Sung-jun?

1532
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,366
-You have five minutes.
-It's a dip.

1533
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,901
Five minutes! Jung-hwan.

1534
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,370
Run out there and try the pupae!

1535
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,172
What's he deep-frying?

1536
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,007
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

1537
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,742
JUNG-HWAN MUST REPORT FROM THE SITE

1538
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,778
Let me report from the kitchen.

1539
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,946
So this will become the dough?

1540
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,215
Some mustard leaf kimchi

1541
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,550
and plump shrimp.

1542
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,285
PISTACHIO DIPPING SAUCE

1543
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,187
HE TASTES THE DIP

1544
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,523
AND ADDS LACKING FLAVORS!

1545
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,993
THE PISTACHIO DIP IS READY!

1546
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,796
HE BEGINS TO SERVE IT RIGHT AWAY!

1547
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,632
THE SIGN THAT THE DEEP-FRIED FOOD IS DONE

1548
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,335
LIST OF FRIES: SHRIMP, BROCCOLI, PUPAE

1549
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:47,704
The problem is these pupae.

1550
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,972
Can you try some?

1551
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,942
-Gosh, these?
-Yes.

1552
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,678
-Chef Sung-jun is already serving.
-Why do you keep going there?

1553
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:56,913
What's this sauce?

1554
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,681
-That's <i>baccala.</i>
<i>-Baccala.</i>

1555
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,850
Should I try the <i>baccala?</i>

1556
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,586
Try the pupae first before you move on.

1557
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,955
-Let me try one, then.
-Okay.

1558
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,057
-You have to try it.
-It's Poong's masterpiece.

1559
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,259
-Young-kwang bought these for his health.
-The viewers are curious.

1560
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,096
-All right.
-The pupae.

1561
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,598
Tell us how they're different
from the usual pupae.

1562
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,734
Will it become a glorious snack?

1563
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,302
A BRAVE BITE

1564
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,738
Does it feel glorious or just awful?

1565
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,340
Jung-hwan!

1566
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,709
The pupae!

1567
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:27,677
Yes?

1568
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,845
What's it like?

1569
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,180
Do you feel itchy?

1570
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,782
Do you?

1571
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:33,850
BUT WE'RE HAPPY

1572
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,318
All right. The pupae.

1573
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,652
What was it like?

1574
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,489
-Pupae.
-Really?

1575
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,057
But plump pupae.

1576
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,360
-They're different from canned ones.
-The texture must be better.

1577
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,661
I can feel how plump they are.

1578
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,430
They're good, but they're the same pupae.

1579
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,165
-What a relief.
-Does it feel weird?

1580
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,200
-Something pops.
-Pops?

1581
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,268
POPS OUT IN A LAUGHTER

1582
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,671
-It feels awful, but it tastes like pupae.
-I can still taste it.

1583
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:56,839
-All right.
-It's the same.

1584
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,708
-What are you frying?
-Minced garlic.

1585
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,676
Minced garlic?
You're deep-frying everything.

1586
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,045
Yes, and then I'll toast everything.

1587
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,848
-You have 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
-It's 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

1588
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,150
The shrimp are ready,

1589
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,719
-I can do this.
-You can.

1590
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,355
He's melting butter with garlic.

1591
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,556
He's now frying these.

1592
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,525
FRIED RED SHRIMP, FRIED PUPAE

1593
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,894
The soup base?

1594
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,462
5. TOAST FRIES WITH INSTANT SOUP BASE

1595
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,464
DEEP-FRIED BROCCOLI

1596
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,399
DEEP-FRIED MINCED GARLIC

1597
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,169
A CANTONESE DISH, CRISPY GARLIC FLAKES

1598
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:29,405
The taste of pupae lingers.

1599
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,641
Can you taste anything else?

1600
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,777
If the taste of pupae lingers,
Sung-jun needs to finish first.

1601
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,280
It's kind of strong,

1602
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,448
so Chef Sung-jun should finish first.

1603
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,784
OPENS THE OVEN!

1604
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,586
The pizza is ready.

1605
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,656
Chef Sung-jun's dish looks so good.

1606
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:52,195
He made pizza with both meat and shrimp.

1607
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,833
SALT?

1608
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,968
The pupae were salty enough.
Are you adding more salt?

1609
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,469
-It's sugar.
-Sugar?

1610
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:01,437
It needs sugar.

1611
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,506
Yes, that dish has a bit of sweetness.

1612
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,274
-I see.
-Is Sung-jun done?

1613
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,576
-Yes, he's done.
-He's done!

1614
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,910
SUNG-JUN FINISHES MAKING NAPOLI MATPIZZA

1615
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,146
You have lots of time, about a minute.

1616
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,148
He made a Chinese dish

1617
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,650
-a Cantonese dish.
-Ground pepper.

1618
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,385
I'm glad you finished first.

1619
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,188
I can still taste the pupae in my mouth.
I'm glad.

1620
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,223
It would've been bad.

1621
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,891
It keeps getting stuck in my teeth.

1622
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,828
But it looks like a Chinese dish.

1623
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:26,996
-Chef Eun-yeong.
-Yes?

1624
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,531
Is that similar to that Cantonese dish?

1625
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,967
It needs a pile of breadcrumbs over it,

1626
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,470
but it only looks like
it took a stroll on a sandy beach.

1627
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,639
-A pile of breadcrumbs, right?
-Yes, he needs that.

1628
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,708
IN THAT CASE!

1629
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,976
He keeps adding more.

1630
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,245
I think that's just a new dish he made.

1631
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,714
-You have thirty seconds left.
-Thirty seconds.

1632
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,983
I'm all done.

1633
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,585
Fifteen seconds. Here.

1634
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,387
He's serving his dish.

1635
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,322
-Ten seconds.
-Nine.

1636
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,857
Eight! Seven!

1637
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,893
-Six! Five!
-Six! Five!

1638
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,262
-Four! Three! Two!
-Two!

1639
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,664
One! It's over.

1640
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,300
-He must serve it like that.
-It looks convincing.

1641
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,636
THE BEER SNACK ROUND IS OVER!

1642
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,538
IT'S TIME TO TURN ON THE TV
AND OPEN A BEER!

1643
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,807
You've both done well.

1644
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:15,845
And now, both dishes were
cooked for Young-kwang.

1645
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,248
What do I begin with?

1646
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,551
The one who finished first,
Chef Kwon Sung-jun's dish.

1647
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,687
-Is it the pupae?
-He's too thrilled.

1648
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,722
No, that's not it.

1649
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,058
-Why were you offended?
-It's not like that.

1650
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,595
Then first, please try
Chef Sung-jun's Napoli Matpizza.

1651
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:36,098
SHOW A SMILE WITH A DRINK OF BEER

1652
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:41,771
BEEF, HALIBUT, AND SHRIMP
ON TOP OF CRUNCHY BREAD

1653
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:47,810
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S NAPOLI MATPIZZA

1654
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,446
-Should I pour him a beer?
-You should.

1655
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,649
-I'm the official bartender here.
-Right.

1656
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,851
-That's his favorite beer.
-Please have a seat.

1657
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,954
-Goodness.
-Please. Sit down.

1658
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,057
JUST LIKE THE BEER HE HAS
AT THE END OF THE DAY

1659
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,192
Your day is over. Time to relax.

1660
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,027
AMAZED

1661
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,062
That was perfect.

1662
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,965
-How should he eat it?
-Try eating the pizza first…

1663
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,567
-This one.
-…and then the shrimp.

1664
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,835
And I made the dip

1665
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:17,073
with pistachio to add the nutty flavor
just like beer.

1666
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,608
So try it without the dip first,

1667
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,144
and then add a bit of sauce
when you grow tired of it.

1668
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,814
-Thank you.
-He's about to try it.

1669
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,683
Gosh.

1670
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,820
He tries the bar snack first.

1671
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,723
I added mustard leaf kimchi as a kick,

1672
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,292
-so it won't be greasy.
-That sounds delicious.

1673
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,260
Was it the kimchi that looked stale?

1674
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,062
-It was in great condition.
-Was it?

1675
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,898
-The kimchi in that rectangular container.
-Yes.

1676
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,001
That's the kick.

1677
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,803
-That's unlike what Chef Hyun-suk did.
-Right.

1678
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,372
That's the moment.

1679
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,578
I can imagine how he has a drink at home.

1680
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,614
He had a great shoot today.

1681
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,483
CHUCKLING

1682
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,785
EVERYONE FEELS REFRESHED
JUST BY WATCHING HIM

1683
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,822
-Great job, Young-kwang.
-You've done well today.

1684
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,457
He was coughing up until now,

1685
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,827
but he didn't have a problem
chugging that beer.

1686
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,929
-He got better.
-It seems so.

1687
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,231
TRIES THE HALIBUT AND SHRIMP!

1688
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,466
-The shrimp.
-That looks so good.

1689
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,936
<i>It's made with shrimp and halibut</i>
<i>with a touch of lemon.</i>

1690
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:23,572
-And that's bread.
-Yes, I used bread too.

1691
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,142
The smell of yeast in the bread
will go well with beer,

1692
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,178
along with the refreshing lemon.

1693
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,013
Mmm.

1694
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,681
I see.

1695
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:36,352
He got some sauce on his mouth,
but he doesn't even care.

1696
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,387
Would you like another glass?

1697
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,356
-You can sit down.
-He won't say no.

1698
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,892
He made it look so delicious.

1699
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,261
-He downs two glasses right away.
-Yes.

1700
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:48,731
The shrimp and this sauce go very well

1701
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:49,865
with beer.

1702
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,001
GOSH

1703
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,202
It tastes

1704
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,503
kind of classy.

1705
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,539
-I see.
-Something like that.

1706
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,707
-As if you're getting treated?
-It tastes expensive.

1707
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,977
It tastes expensive?
As if he put in a lot of money into it?

1708
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,847
-It's pistachio and cream cheese.
-He put the sauce on it.

1709
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,849
He just said it goes well with beer.

1710
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,118
THIS IS IT!

1711
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,820
He must like it a lot.

1712
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:14,123
He automatically reaches for the beer.

1713
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,158
Pistachio can taste kind of heavy,

1714
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,461
so it'll feel dry in his mouth,

1715
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:19,762
so beer will taste great then.

1716
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,164
-Automatically.
-He's right.

1717
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:23,599
Was that it?

1718
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:27,436
It melted and disappeared
as soon as I drank some beer.

1719
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:30,039
It opened up his dry mouth.

1720
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,642
He looks the happiest yet.

1721
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:34,910
Your cold is gone, right?

1722
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,645
I think so.

1723
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:37,947
FULLY HEALED

1724
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,648
WHAT A RELIEF!

1725
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,684
Then next, it's Pupae and Shrimp.

1726
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:45,754
POONG'S DISHES ALWAYS MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH

1727
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:50,893
CRISPY GARLIC FLAKE SHRIMP AND PUPA

1728
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,965
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S PUPA AND SHRIMP

1729
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,833
Okay. First things first.

1730
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,869
It looks kind of dark.

1731
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:00,903
How should he eat this?

1732
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:05,007
-Just loosen up and eat it as you like.
-Loosen up and eat it. Yes.

1733
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,176
Who cares about the order?

1734
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,246
Just eat it however you like.
It's a bar snack.

1735
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,449
Try it however you like.

1736
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,017
The pupae and shrimp.

1737
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,218
He's kind of bold.

1738
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,420
His friend recommended those and said

1739
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:22,091
pupae are good for his stamina,
and he fell for that.

1740
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,192
All right.

1741
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,693
I CAN'T SEE MYSELF EATING THIS

1742
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,130
This might ruin his entire appetite.

1743
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,999
I thought you liked it.

1744
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,000
"Why did I order these?"

1745
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,435
His cold relapsed.

1746
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,071
THE PUPAE ERUPTED
BEFORE THEY WERE DEEP-FRIED

1747
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,606
Isn't it overdone?

1748
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,041
No, it's okay.

1749
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,243
-Crispy garlic flakes.
-Thank you.

1750
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,546
Will it taste good or not?

1751
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,848
WHAT ARE THE WOUNDED PUPAE LIKE?

1752
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,816
-It's probably nutty and delicious.
-What?

1753
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:48,851
What?

1754
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,219
-The Kim Poong magic?
-What is it?

1755
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,520
Did he work his magic?

1756
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,055
No way. What?

1757
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:56,158
-What?
-Wait, that's a dangerous face.

1758
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,594
-He got everyone with that face.
-I can't let him do that.

1759
01:09:58,661 --> 01:09:59,562
Wait. This is good.

1760
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,463
-Is it?
-It's good, right?

1761
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,999
-The pupae are delicious?
-This is an emergency.

1762
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,401
CONFUSED

1763
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,136
They feel like chips.

1764
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,605
-They do?
-Yes, they feel like chips.

1765
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:12,141
They don't pop much.

1766
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,376
<i>They taste toasty like chips.</i>

1767
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:15,878
REALLY?

1768
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,346
Is it because he toasted them?

1769
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,481
-I deep-fried those.
-That's why.

1770
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,717
-I can taste it.
-You can?

1771
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,653
-He can taste it much later.
-Yes.

1772
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,989
-What's it like? Shrimp chips?
-It's like shrimp chips.

1773
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,024
-It's like that.
-It tastes like shrimp chips?

1774
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,759
Like actual chips?

1775
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:33,495
Insects taste very similar to shrimp.

1776
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,031
Grasshoppers taste like shrimp too.

1777
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,067
You were in a bit of a doubt before.

1778
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,502
It doesn't taste odd at all.

1779
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,972
-Nothing… No.
-Nothing gets in the way?

1780
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,041
<i>Did he pour instant udon soup base</i>
<i>all over the shrimp?</i>

1781
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:49,745
<i>I need some MSG,</i>
<i>so I made use of the instant soup base.</i>

1782
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,581
-Try it with beer.
-See if it goes well with beer.

1783
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,184
It has to be a beer snack
instead of a side dish.

1784
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,319
It's crunchy, so it probably goes well.

1785
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:00,923
Whoa.

1786
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,626
The sip of beer

1787
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,195
brings out the taste of pupae.

1788
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,330
-It does?
-Is that good?

1789
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,733
Do you like that flavor or not?

1790
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:13,469
-It's not so bad.
-It's not?

1791
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,337
He says it isn't so bad.

1792
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:19,141
Sung-jun should brace himself.

1793
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:22,011
He just scooped up
a spoonful of only pupae.

1794
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:23,512
Oh, my.

1795
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,114
His friend told him to eat these

1796
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,349
because they were good for stamina,
but he didn't like them.

1797
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,785
This is a perfect beer snack.

1798
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,723
-I'm sure. It's been deep-fried.
-Yes.

1799
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:39,028
This is the kind of response
we've often seen on the show,

1800
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:42,331
and it always frightens Poong's opponent.

1801
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,400
-It's good.
-It's good?

1802
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,902
His doubts have melted away.

1803
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,705
Does it call for more beer?

1804
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,574
It's a bit dry,
but a sip of beer washes it down,

1805
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,443
making everything undone.

1806
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,546
-It comes undone?
-I see.

1807
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,715
My gosh. Look at him.

1808
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:03,085
It'll go perfectly with a sip of beer.

1809
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,287
It comes with bread at the bottom.

1810
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,658
It's the pizza.

1811
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:12,695
The mustard leaf kimchi is stunning.

1812
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,797
I like that spicy note.

1813
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,933
The one you made with seafood is
delicious and refreshing with that lemon.

1814
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,903
I loved it very much.

1815
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,405
It's a mix that has to be delicious.

1816
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,042
And when it feels a bit greasy,
the mustard leaf kimchi comes in,

1817
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,713
-which will help me keep eating this.
-It must be the kick.

1818
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,648
He made good use of the kimchi.

1819
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,284
Next, let's try Pupa and Shrimp.

1820
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,390
-What?
-It's more like a worm.

1821
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:45,594
It's good.

1822
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,229
NODDING

1823
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:50,799
It really tastes like
that Chinese shrimp dish.

1824
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,034
CHUCKLING

1825
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,370
-Gosh.
-Whoa.

1826
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,738
It's good.

1827
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,706
I keep craving more beer.

1828
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,341
Cheers.

1829
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,977
WE'LL CHUG THESE TOO

1830
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,980
I love pupae,
so I like how it tastes like them,

1831
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,049
as well as chips.

1832
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,217
It has many different flavors.

1833
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,219
-I really love pupae.
-I do too.

1834
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,721
But these feel more like worms.

1835
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,356
I've often cooked these for you.

1836
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,458
LETS HER GUARD DOWN AND EATS

1837
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,626
It's very toasty.

1838
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,395
I love it.

1839
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:20,996
A REFRESHING SIP OF BEER

1840
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,698
The pupae dish is overwhelmingly good.

1841
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:25,134
Did you try the pupae, Young-ae?
Is it good?

1842
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,636
-Yes, it's so good.
-Is it?

1843
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,406
I thought you wouldn't eat those,
but you did.

1844
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,508
I remember eating these as a child,

1845
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,243
but these were completely different.

1846
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,745
I wouldn't have noticed
if you didn't say anything.

1847
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:38,480
I craved beer as soon as I took a bite.

1848
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:39,648
When we eat peanuts,

1849
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:42,384
we wash them down with beer
when it feels too greasy, right?

1850
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,987
-But this has much better flavors.
-It does.

1851
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,722
I already chugged two drinks.

1852
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:49,324
Deep-fried pupae will be a hit
if it becomes a bar snack.

1853
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,326
-I've never seen it before.
-Right?

1854
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:53,228
They aren't easy to work with

1855
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,531
because the batter gets stripped
when you just mix them in.

1856
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:01,136
You have to chop them up a little
before you put them in the batter.

1857
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,306
It tastes like
the fatty filling in beef tripe

1858
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:08,243
as the innards seep out
with its savory flavor.

1859
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,745
It'd be rather easy

1860
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:12,281
to let this taste funky
if the pupae weren't treated well.

1861
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,750
But he coated everything
with crispy garlic flakes,

1862
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,553
giving it the texture of chips.

1863
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,822
He made a wise decision to make this.

1864
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,790
Once again,

1865
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:24,359
he never fails to amaze me.

1866
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,262
I knew this would be the case
by his face after he finished.

1867
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,430
<i>He looked confident.</i>

1868
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,765
<i>He knew it was good.</i>

1869
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,834
When no one believed in the pupae…

1870
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,303
He scared me a little.

1871
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,772
I see.

1872
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,442
He's the MVP when it comes to beer snacks.

1873
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,878
Young-ae finished everything.

1874
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:46,081
She came a long way
from her naturalist era.

1875
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,116
It was only up until last episode.

1876
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:50,519
-She just chugged that beer too.
-Yes.

1877
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,055
How did she spend
seven years in Yangpyeong?

1878
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,090
-It was eight.
-Eight years?

1879
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,459
She used her kids as an excuse
to move out.

1880
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,328
She's good with alcohol too.

1881
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,931
It's time for Young-kwang to choose
either Sung-jun or Poong.

1882
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:03,966
Please make your choice.

1883
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,535
<i>Press one for Kwon Sung-jun</i>

1884
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,136
<i>and two for Kim Poong.</i>

1885
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:13,141
Look at that smile.
I don't know how this will turn out.

1886
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,643
-Did you press one?
-Yes.

1887
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,812
He already pressed it.

1888
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,180
Who did he choose?

1889
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,749
Let's find out who he chose!

1890
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,152
A glorious beer snack.

1891
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:27,556
Will Poong take his eighth win

1892
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,491
and tie for second place again?

1893
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:33,562
Or will Sung-jun win
and be tied with Poong on third place?

1894
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,797
It's all on Young-kwang's choice.

1895
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,866
Whose dish was more glorious?

1896
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:39,968
Who did he choose?

1897
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,603
Who is it?

1898
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,407
Who is it?

1899
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:46,975
KIM POONG

1900
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,610
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
PUPA AND SHRIMP

1901
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,613
Poong shows his magic again! He wins!

1902
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,015
A BIG HUG

1903
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,417
Kim Poong wins.

1904
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,353
He's… he's so evil.

1905
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:03,325
Sung-jun's biggest fear
has become reality.

1906
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:07,629
This was unbelievably delicious,

1907
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,898
so I had no other choice.

1908
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,833
I feel scammed.

1909
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,869
It was so good that you felt scammed?

1910
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,338
-The pupae played a part, right?
-Of course.

1911
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,541
At first, I was embarrassed
that I had bought and kept them,

1912
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,443
but I feel much better now.

1913
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:24,980
Pubs might begin
to deep-fry the pupae from now on…

1914
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,616
-The pupae.
-…after seeing what Poong did.

1915
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,420
They'll go, "Kim Poong deep-fried
the pupae Kim Young-kwang brought."

1916
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,355
This was your eighth victory,

1917
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,525
so you're now tied in second place
with Chef Ho-young.

1918
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,795
Then Young-kwang,
please put a star on him.

1919
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,030
LET ME GET AHEAD OF YOU!

1920
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:45,000
Look how majestic he looks!

1921
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,602
The majestic Poong!

1922
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,303
He takes his eighth victory!

1923
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,871
Congratulations.

1924
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,007
STAY TUNED FOR NEXT WEEK'S FRIDGE OWNERS

1925
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,509
Please welcome today's fridge owners!

1926
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,211
-Hello, we're NCT DREAM.
-Hello, we're NCT DREAM.

1927
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,512
-Hello, we're Stray Kids.
-Hello, we're Stray Kids.

1928
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,014
BEING ON CHEF & MY FRIDGE?

1929
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:00,449
Listen to his deep voice.

1930
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,651
We took the flight
right after our schedule yesterday.

1931
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:03,819
We haven't eaten anything.

1932
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,120
Because of <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

1933
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,555
-Of course.
-Totally.

1934
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,624
He asks me more questions
than my students.

1935
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,225
He texts me at 5:00 a.m.

1936
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,326
I'm actually frightened.

1937
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,729
He wants everyone's number today.

1938
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,263
Their specialties are all different.

1939
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,499
You won't be able to sleep, then.

1940
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,934
They're the historic rivals.

1941
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:20,936
PERFORMING LIKE AN IDOL STAR

1942
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,337
Look at his performance!

1943
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:23,705
It's a bit salty.

1944
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:24,673
I don't believe you.

1945
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,341
He doesn't believe you anymore.

1946
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,978
It'll be our first team battle
in this new season.

1947
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,413
Their teamwork is perfect.

1948
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,581
They're moving as one.

1949
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,117
-Let me use this!
-What? Why? We need it!

1950
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,585
THE TENSION IS SPARKING

1951
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,953
My arm hurts!

1952
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,588
Potatoes. Get the potatoes first.

1953
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,656
<i>What now?</i>

1954
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:45,527
Look at MARK. He looks pleased.

1955
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,595
What do you think?

1956
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,930
-It's so good.
-I see.

1957
