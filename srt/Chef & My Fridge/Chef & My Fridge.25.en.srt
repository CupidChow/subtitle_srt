1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,084
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,022
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,290
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,726
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,332
It's great to see everyone.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,267
Today in the studio, we have

7
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,737
-a number of chefs in Chinese cuisine.
-Chinese chefs.

8
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,439
We have the Queen of Dim Sum…

9
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,142
-Oh, my.
-…the Prince of Dongpo Pork,

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,780
as well as the Grand Master
of Chinese cuisine.

11
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,314
Please welcome Chef Lu Chinglai.

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,050
Hello. It's great to be here.

13
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,586
Chef Chinglai has an amazing career.

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:58,358
<i>He was the first Korean chef</i>
<i>in Chinese cuisine</i>

15
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,728
who received the title
as the Grand Master from China.

16
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,063
-My gosh.
-Yes.

17
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,130
My respect.

18
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,933
I wonder who he's here to take down today.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,604
There are new strong players
of Chinese cuisine on either side.

20
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,441
I'm here to get my revenge
against Chef Tae-hun,

21
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,444
who helped me return home quickly.

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,712
-<i>He's here to get revenge?</i>
-Self-Made Chef survives.

23
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:24,117
Chef Tae-hun won, made a deep bow,
and sent Chef Chinglai away.

24
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,386
-Exactly.
-That's why Chef Chinglai

25
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,122
now refuses any deep bows,
even from kids on holiday.

26
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,423
He refuses any kind of bowing.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,992
-Why would he bow after winning?
-Right?

28
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,095
-It was a celebration.
-That's right.

29
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,298
Will you accept the match
if he chooses to fight you?

30
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,135
It's an honor for me, actually,

31
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,937
although it's a huge pressure.

32
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,405
Why is he stuttering?

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,440
So you think you're up for the challenge?

34
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,777
-You've won once before.
-I'm not saying I feel confident.

35
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,845
But for now…

36
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,481
-What's he saying?
-Stop stuttering.

37
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,283
If a master chef like him asks,
he should say yes without hesitating.

38
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,853
-He doesn't get any say.
-So that's the rule in that industry?

39
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,521
-Of course.
-I see.

40
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,723
The world of Chinese cuisine
has not become foul yet.

41
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,927
I feel so nervous to sit next to him.

42
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:12,365
We're going to witness a big match
between two chefs in Chinese cuisine.

43
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,701
It's time to welcome the fridge owners.

44
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:19,672
We invited two people
whom we all call geniuses.

45
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,975
-I wonder who came to visit us today.
-Who could it be?

46
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,110
Let me present the fridge owners.

47
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,545
Come on out!

48
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,681
-Today's fridge owners.
-Who could it be?

49
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,916
ANTICIPATION

50
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,117
WOW

51
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,686
The geniuses of the century!

52
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,022
Please welcome
Lee Se-dol and Lee Chan-won!

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,493
<i>He won against artificial intelligence</i>
<i>with his stroke of genius.</i>

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,096
<i>-The only man who won against AI.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

55
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,697
<i>Please welcome the living legend,</i>

56
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,366
the Go genius, Lee Se-dol!

57
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,134
THE LIVING LEGEND, GO GENIUS LEE SE-DOL

58
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,602
He's looks snazzy.

59
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,870
WELCOME

60
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,072
-It's great to meet you.
-Hello.

61
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,674
Thank you for having me.

62
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,376
-It's such an honor.
-It is.

63
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,278
This next man started as a trot prodigy.

64
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,214
The Grand Prize of the Entertainment Award
goes to Lee Chan-won!

65
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,049
<i>And he even won the Grand Prize</i>
<i>of an Entertainment Award.</i>

66
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,018
<i>A trot genius and a variety show genius,</i>

67
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,686
<i>Lee Chan-won aka Chantobaegi!</i>

68
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,289
-It's great to meet you!
-Hello.

69
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,224
It's great to be here. Hello.

70
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,493
-Welcome.
-It's great to have you.

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,364
Se-dol isn't the kind of person
we can often meet on a variety show.

72
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,833
He's literally the living legend of Go.

73
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,669
For a total of 13 years,

74
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,606
he maintained his global position
as one of the top three Go players.

75
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,241
-Whoa.
-Among the 13 years,

76
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,010
he kept his first place
for five consecutive years.

77
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,047
He also has won 18 world tournaments

78
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,882
<i>and 32 domestic tournaments.</i>

79
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,651
-He's a legendary player.
-That's crazy.

80
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,886
That's amazing.

81
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,555
We're sitting here with a man like that.

82
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,558
So what brings you here
to <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

83
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,696
My wife loves this show very much.

84
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,499
In a way, I'm here on behalf of her.

85
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,802
-Did you get her permission?
-Of course.

86
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,371
-She has absolute power.
-Absolute power?

87
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,472
Of course.

88
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,407
-How dare I defy her?
-He's under her thumb.

89
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,776
And we're here with Chan-won too.

90
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,379
I hear you can't eat your meals

91
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,147
-without <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>
-I can't.

92
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,584
This show has to be the best dish
I can have with my meals.

93
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,454
I watched every single episode
since the show launched

94
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,756
-on November 17th, 2014, the 1st season.
-Whoa!

95
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,224
He's a true fan.

96
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,926
I keep watching the reruns
and reruns of reruns.

97
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,694
I'm that big of a fan.

98
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,930
He's like the director
of the Korea Communications Commission.

99
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,065
I'M SAYING I LOVE IT THAT MUCH

100
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,634
Since you've watched every episode,

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,369
do you have suggestions for improvements?

102
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,605
Are there things
that we can slightly improve on?

103
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,440
-His analysis.
-It's an opinion from a fan.

104
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,575
Any suggestions?

105
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,977
Everything about the show is perfect,

106
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,846
including the panels of best chefs

107
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,181
and the incredible show hosts.

108
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,217
-But there's one thing!
-There's one thing!

109
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,352
-What is it? What could it be?
-What's that?

110
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,221
That one thing is

111
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,822
the five-minute interim check.

112
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,691
-When we go out?
-The five-minute check?

113
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,293
Everything is great,

114
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,928
but your reviews
became way too cliché.

115
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,996
I KNEW IT!

116
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,101
-The hosts were the problem!
-The hosts.

117
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,437
-Everything else was fine.
-I saw the episodes…

118
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,505
That was rough.

119
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,341
…and 90% of what you said
during the check were these.

120
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,742
"It's too salty!"

121
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,910
"It's too sweet!"

122
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,445
It's too salty!

123
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,946
It's too sweet!

124
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,815
We should reflect on that.

125
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,784
You should be analyzing the texture

126
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,386
and the visual of the food too.

127
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,588
You're right. They lack that detail.

128
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,124
Then you can go out
for the five-minute check

129
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,894
and show us how we can improve.

130
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,595
If it isn't discourteous of me, then…

131
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,664
-I saw Won-young do it last time.
-Yes.

132
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,299
It's sour!

133
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,401
I'll go out and play that role

134
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,470
and show you how food review is done.

135
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,474
What if he does a better job

136
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,510
and replaces one of you?

137
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,846
I don't think we should let him do this.

138
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,349
-You're a singer, so you should sing.
-Yes.

139
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,917
-What now?
-He's a soccer player.

140
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,654
-Anyway, you'll get that chance later.
-I guess it must be hard.

141
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,924
Not only is Se-dol famous as a Go player,

142
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,993
-but he has many famous quotes.
-You're right.

143
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,830
There's something
Chef Sung-jun says all the time.

144
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,232
"I don't think I can lose."

145
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,034
-<i>I don't think I can lose.</i>
-He can't lose.

146
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,804
Se-dol was the first person
who was known for saying that.

147
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,607
-He was the first to say it.
-He's right.

148
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,744
Are you the type who likes to bluff?

149
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,545
-He seems modest.
-Let me just check that.

150
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,547
-Just a little.
-A little, right?

151
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,915
-I see.
-A bit.

152
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,118
I'm very excited to meet him here

153
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,788
because he's my role model,
someone I really look up to.

154
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,156
I'm sick of hearing this.

155
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,424
I'm very moved.

156
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,226
-Yes.
-I don't think

157
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,727
I can make anything that tastes bad.

158
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,130
-Right.
-Something like that.

159
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,197
I love it.

160
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,068
-He just raised my expectations even more.
-Right?

161
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,303
I just can't.

162
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,739
When people heard Se-dol will be here,

163
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,675
all the chefs and even Chan-won said

164
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,111
they wanted to fight Se-dol,
the man who won against AlphaGo,

165
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,280
in a game that involves Go stones.

166
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,649
-I'm serious.
-They all made that request.

167
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:02,021
People who play Go are
very used to using the stones, right?

168
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,990
So what can we do?

169
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:08,861
-He means, "You can't beat me anyway."
-You're right.

170
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,265
-He's like, "Give me your best shot."
-Yes, that was the nuance. He'll take it.

171
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,633
You shouldn't be called Se-dol.

172
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,134
You're Bluff-dol.

173
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,005
-You're right.
-Bluff-dol.

174
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,274
He bluffs every single time.

175
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,342
In the end, they brought up a game called

176
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,744
Alkkagi.

177
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,412
-I hope he says yes.
-Alkkagi.

178
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,182
-We can't play Go against you.
-That's ridiculous.

179
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,951
Since Chan-won is here as a guest,

180
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,188
-we'll give him the first chance.
-That sounds great.

181
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,692
THE CHEF & MY FRIDGE CUP
ALKKAGI TOURNAMENT

182
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,862
-Hello, Alkkagi fans around the country.
-But this is…

183
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,064
Hello.

184
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,266
I'm trying to commentate this game.

185
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,002
-I think he wants to win.
-Right?

186
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,038
-Yes?
-I'm warming up.

187
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,172
Warm up your fingers.

188
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,242
You're watching Alkkagi
between nine <i>dan</i> professional, Lee Se-dol

189
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,511
-and three <i>dan</i>, Lee Chan-won.
-The game of the century.

190
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,180
The Alkkagi game will begin shortly.

191
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,549
-I'm not sure…
-Lee Se-dol attacks first.

192
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,518
He attacks first.

193
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,488
-He's looking at the trajectory.
-He's measuring the angle.

194
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,089
Lee Se-dol.

195
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,525
Lee Se-dol.

196
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,463
-Wait!
-That was so accurate.

197
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,467
He aims right for the black stone.

198
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,336
That was quite a distance.

199
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,604
Lee Se-dol.

200
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,839
ONE SHOT, ONE KILL

201
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,643
CHAN-WON IS IN SHOCK

202
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,412
Chan-won is on the defensive.

203
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,581
-You should flick it out.
-His hand is shaking.

204
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,983
TAP

205
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,551
-His hand is shaking.
-And now…

206
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,319
What just happened?

207
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,189
-He botched it.
-He botched it.

208
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,525
-He botched it.
-No, you can go again.

209
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,361
-Are you sure?
-He's offering another chance.

210
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,364
-Will you let that slide?
-Yes, I'll let it slide.

211
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,466
-Then please go ahead.
-Let me try it just once.

212
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,168
-Se-dol shows him mercy.
-Sure.

213
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,604
-It flew off.
-Was that mine?

214
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,074
<i>Lee Chan-won, the three </i>dan <i>player,</i>
<i>loses his stone.</i>

215
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,175
<i>What just happened?</i>

216
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,244
It's another chance to get ahead.

217
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,781
SE-DOL DOESN'T MISS HIS CHANCE

218
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,017
-Look how it stops right there.
-That was crazy.

219
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,154
-You have to make this work.
-It's now Chan-won's attack.

220
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,623
Come on, Chan-won!

221
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,325
Come on, Chan-won!

222
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,893
HE MAKES IT EASIER FOR SE-DOL

223
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,562
It flew over to this side.

224
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,930
He'll flick both away at once.

225
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,632
-He'll get two with one stone.
-All right, now.

226
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,367
Lee Se-dol!

227
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,435
Lee Se-dol!

228
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,339
Lee Se-dol!

229
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,607
HE GETS ONE WITH ONE STONE

230
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,675
Lee Se-dol!

231
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,376
WHAT A SHAME

232
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,514
-He doesn't stand a chance.
-You have one left.

233
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,848
Chan-won faces a crisis.

234
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,050
HE LOSES THE LAST ONE IN VAIN

235
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,686
What just happened?
The final score is five to zero.

236
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,288
-Lee Se-dol wins!
-He couldn't even get one.

237
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,556
That was crazy.

238
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,391
-It was.
-I knew it.

239
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,660
-He's on fire.
-Wait.

240
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,097
We'll change the player immediately.

241
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,167
-Chef Yang-rak.
-It's your turn.

242
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,736
-Chef Yang-rak.
-Chef Yang-rak?

243
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,804
Chef Yang-rak?

244
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,505
You're up against Choi Hyun-suk,
an eight <i>dan</i> player.

245
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,041
Choi Hyun-suk,
an eight <i>dan</i> Alkkagi player.

246
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,109
I'm nervous.

247
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,345
When you play Alkkagi,

248
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,281
it's better to use thicker Go stones.

249
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,816
And he attacks.

250
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,451
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SKILLS

251
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,686
-What just happened?
-What is this?

252
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,356
Hyun-suk versus Se-dol.

253
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,760
You lost your stone!

254
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,462
Okay, Hyun-suk.

255
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,598
Hyun-suk has one left. This is bad.

256
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,100
I never knew Alkkagi was so fun.

257
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,334
-I hope you get one.
-The middle one.

258
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,037
-I hope Hyun-suk gets one.
-The middle one.

259
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,106
HE HAS 0 STONES LEFT

260
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,173
I hope Hyun-suk gets one.

261
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,009
I hope Hyun-suk gets one.

262
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,077
HE EVEN CATCHES THE STONE

263
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,346
UTTER DEFEAT

264
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,848
The score is five to zero.

265
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,182
He didn't stand a chance.

266
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,318
Who else is good at this?

267
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,286
-I think I'll easily win against him.
-What?

268
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,221
Sung-jun? Okay.

269
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,155
NO EXPECTATIONS

270
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,690
He's our final player.

271
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,026
We won't drag this on anymore.

272
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,160
Hello.

273
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,529
-Please go first.
-You can go first.

274
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,998
-I hope you get at least one.
-He looks like he'll be good.

275
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,099
Sung-jun.

276
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,673
NICE!

277
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,175
He's good. He got this.

278
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,010
NERVOUS

279
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:22,715
-Whoa.
-Se-dol, nine <i>dan</i>, loses his white stone.

280
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,351
-He's shaken up.
-Do you use your left hand too?

281
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,019
Not very often.

282
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,121
-He attacks with his left hand.
-He's ambidextrous.

283
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,589
Using both hands is amazing.

284
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,757
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

285
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,326
HE CAN WIN EVEN WITH HIS LEFT HAND

286
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,062
The aim and hit was accurate.

287
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,431
-He's good with both hands.
-He's good with his left hand too.

288
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,665
I'm so nervous.

289
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,736
Sung-jun has to flick it very far.

290
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:44,804
The one at the edge.

291
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,906
-Both go out!
-Along with himself.

292
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,175
Self-destruction.

293
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,843
Both sides lose two stones.

294
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,611
-Three against three.
-This means…

295
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,380
-Se-dol is up.
-He's good.

296
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,282
The score is three to three. Se-dol.

297
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,517
It's Se-dol's attack.

298
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,855
Se-dol makes a mistake! Look!

299
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,590
Attack.

300
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,825
OUT

301
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,827
Se-dol makes a mistake! Look!

302
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,164
HIS VICTORY IS IMMINENT

303
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,634
-Look. It went out.
-He's shaken up!

304
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,737
-This is his chance.
-Jeez.

305
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,406
I can't find the angle
because of this one.

306
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,475
That's right. You can't touch this one.

307
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,344
You have to aim accurately.
It's a very important…

308
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,347
It's a very important…

309
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,149
LEFTOVER STONES

310
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,285
Sung-jun has two stones left!

311
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,353
He has two left!

312
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,389
-Se-dol is at the face of danger.
-My gosh.

313
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,825
-I can brag about this for life.
-Will he win against Sung-jun?

314
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,827
-Se-dol will lose if this one goes out.
-He'll win.

315
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,028
Will you take out both?

316
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,730
Attack!

317
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,665
Attack!

318
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,801
WHAT A SHAME

319
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,536
No!

320
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,338
This is so much fun.

321
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,873
It's so close.

322
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,307
I never knew Alkkagi was so fun.

323
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,742
-My gosh.
-What now?

324
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,378
-This? This is…
-What will you do?

325
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,713
-It's…
-I'm at a disadvantage.

326
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,616
This stone is halfway in the air.

327
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,051
It's halfway in the air.

328
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,820
-This is tough.
-This will be fun.

329
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,789
This is his final attack. Will you run…

330
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,024
Will you run…

331
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,125
IT'S HIS CHANCE TO TURN IT AROUND

332
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,927
-What now?
-No!

333
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,196
-It rolled back inside.
-It's over.

334
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,366
This is Se-dol's stone.
He must use his left hand.

335
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,002
-But my left hand…
-It's your left hand.

336
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,638
-But he took one out before.
-I did do that.

337
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,139
-But it's…
-These are too close.

338
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,707
Se-dol's final attack!

339
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,677
Final attack!

340
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,913
LEE SE-DOL WINS

341
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,114
Lee Se-dol wins.

342
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,116
-Lee Se-dol wins.
-Thank you.

343
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,250
Se-dol delivers.

344
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
-It was fun.
-I learned a lot.

345
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,024
That was an awesome match.

346
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,892
You have a knack for this.

347
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,228
That was so close.

348
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,630
Thank you very much for winning.

349
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,132
If he had won,

350
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,602
he wouldn't have let go of this
for the next three episodes.

351
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,971
-He'd keep on going about this.
-If I had won, yes.

352
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,940
I would've bragged about it for life.

353
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,310
It's time to look into Se-dol's fridge.

354
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,045
Before we look through his fridge,

355
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,881
I have one announcement for the chefs.

356
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,349
-Yes.
-Se-dol has

357
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,185
the most particular appetite.

358
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,354
-Really?
-What? The most particular?

359
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,722
What do you mean?

360
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,759
Se-dol's wife said, "My husband, Se-dol,

361
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,263
is a man who eats
all three meals a day at home,

362
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,832
but his appetite is very tough to please.

363
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,503
Even if he doesn't show
a big response after eating your dish,

364
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,907
just know that it's how he is."

365
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,609
Is this true?

366
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,878
I guess I'm a bit particular.

367
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,114
-You eat all three meals at home?
-He always eats at home.

368
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,618
-I rarely eat out.
-I see.

369
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,188
What kind of ingredients
does Se-dol keep in his fridge

370
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,724
-with his particular appetite?
-I wonder what he has.

371
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,426
What's your family like?

372
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,763
-It's me, my wife, and my daughter.
-I see.

373
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,431
Your wife is
probably watching intently right now.

374
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,766
-Please make good comments.
-Okay.

375
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,035
What does Se-dol keep in his fridge?

376
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,103
Let's find out!

377
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,940
-Whoa.
-That's a lot.

378
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,441
Look at this.

379
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,611
-I thought it was a Go board.
-You're right.

380
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,013
It's like a Go board.

381
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,750
-Everything is organized.
-It looks so clean.

382
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,320
I don't think she cleaned it up
after you said you'd come.

383
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,923
-It's the usual setup?
-It's like this.

384
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,524
-Let's look at the first shelf.
-The first shelf.

385
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,460
I see something huge up here.

386
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,095
-It's rockfish.
-It's rockfish.

387
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,730
Yes, it's rockfish.

388
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,133
-Do you enjoy rockfish?
-Of course. I love it.

389
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,101
-Do you like spicy fish soup?
-I do.

390
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,971
-Do you prefer spicy soup or non-spicy?
-What if you had to choose one?

391
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,240
-If I had to, spicy soup.
-Spicy soup.

392
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,442
Something spicy and hot.

393
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,945
-Look at these.
-He must love fish.

394
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,747
-What is this?
-I think it's squid ink.

395
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:49,815
Is it squid ink?

396
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,084
Down here. This is it.

397
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,620
-Is that small octopus?
-Small octopus.

398
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,088
-Small octopus?
-That's small octopus? I see.

399
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,024
-Do you like small octopus?
-I love them.

400
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,693
-He clapped at that.
-I love them.

401
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,663
-There are a few of them here.
-Look at them.

402
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,298
Is this your favorite?

403
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,067
I think it might be.

404
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,936
How do you usually eat octopus?

405
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,404
I usually stir-fry them.

406
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,340
-The spicy stir-fry?
-Yes.

407
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,508
-He must like spicy food.
-He likes spicy food.

408
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,011
Is there a particular reason
why you love octopus?

409
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,580
Flavor is obviously the most important.
It tastes good.

410
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,948
-And…
-What about the texture?

411
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,417
-It also gives you energy.
-It gives energy.

412
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,820
When cows seem tired,

413
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,457
people would feed them small octopus
to make them get back up.

414
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,258
-Have you seen that happen to cows?
-Yes.

415
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,194
-I've seen it.
-He's seen cows get back up.

416
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,297
-They were actually revived with energy?
-Yes, they were.

417
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,566
What's in here?

418
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,601
-Scallops? Manila clams?
-Manila clams.

419
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,770
We often use it to make broth.

420
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:50,509
-Wait, your hometown is an island, right?
-That's right. Bigeum Island.

421
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,277
-It's Sinan.
-Sinan, yes.

422
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,013
BIGEUM ISLAND, SINAN,
SOUTH JEOLLA PROVINCE

423
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,280
-He lived by the sea.
-Bigeum Island.

424
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,416
You must've had lots of food like this.

425
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,884
Of course, when I was younger.

426
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,953
Seafood may be your best choice.

427
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,424
I also found some mussels.
He has a lot of seafood.

428
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,494
Those were left over
after we used them to make broth.

429
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,930
You're putting an emphasis
on making good broth.

430
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,866
We probably have some broth.

431
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,968
-You do?
-It must be this one.

432
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,403
-It's right there.
-You're right.

433
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,604
That wasn't sikhye?

434
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,574
One container is broth
made with anchovies and mussels,

435
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,009
and the other is chicken stock.

436
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,678
-My gosh. Chicken stock?
-She made chicken stock?

437
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,847
If she made chicken stock at home,

438
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,883
it must mean she's a great cook.

439
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,552
If she made broth herself,
do you not prefer the taste of MSG?

440
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,320
I rarely eat it, actually.

441
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,289
But I do like ramyeon.

442
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,691
-There's no MSG in ramyeon now.
-I like ramyeon.

443
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:44,730
There's Mr. Particular.
He likes ramyeon but not MSG.

444
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,566
I see side dishes on the third shelf.

445
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,068
It's like a Go board.

446
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,335
Bean sprouts.

447
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,271
-Dried squid.
-Dried squid.

448
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,505
There are many side dishes.

449
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,840
Here's one thing.

450
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,543
-There are two kinds of anchovies.
-Yes, there are.

451
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,413
One of them is for my daughter,
and the other one is mine.

452
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,916
-What's the difference?
-One of them is probably sweet

453
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,451
and made with some nuts.

454
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:09,221
-But I don't really like sweet flavors.
-You don't like anything sweet?

455
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,356
He doesn't like nuts or sweet flavors.

456
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,826
Why do you not like sweet things?

457
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,427
I wouldn't say I don't like it.

458
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,297
-I don't eat it as a meal.
-You don't eat it as a part of a meal.

459
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,500
So you don't eat sweet things
when you eat your meals.

460
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,870
He won't like it
if you use too much sugar.

461
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,371
It's not even too much.

462
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,973
Not even a little.

463
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,642
-Not even a little?
-Not even a little bit of sugar?

464
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,644
I really don't like it.

465
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,147
-He doesn't like any sugar?
-He's very particular.

466
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,949
-That sounds right, though.
-Oh, my.

467
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,384
If you think about it,
is there anything sweet we eat

468
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,919
in a Korean meal?

469
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,754
Do you not like kimchi made with sugar?

470
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,490
That's why I rarely eat out.

471
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,258
-That's why.
-Wait.

472
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,294
-How do we add the sweet taste? Fruit?
-He doesn't like the sweet flavor.

473
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,264
-We invited a very special guest today.
-We did.

474
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,967
-Do you like these? Cheese?
-Butter.

475
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,735
I don't like them in my food,

476
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,370
and I rarely enjoy them at all.

477
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,607
-So no Western cuisine.
-You must not enjoy Western cuisine.

478
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,976
Butter and cheese are a must
when cooking Western cuisine.

479
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,445
I don't eat it that often.

480
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,215
That side is in trouble.

481
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,483
Butter and cheese.

482
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,652
It wasn't really for me.

483
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,156
-And I don't eat fried food, either.
-No fried food?

484
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,390
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE FRIED FOOD?

485
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,126
-He doesn't eat fried food?
-He doesn't like fried food.

486
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,095
We have a tip from his wife.

487
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,397
Here's a story
on how much he doesn't like fried food.

488
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,933
When their daughter orders fried chicken,

489
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,869
he'd sit next to her
and peel off the fried portion

490
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,071
-and eat just the meat.
-Just the meat?

491
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:37,176
-This is an emergency.
-Wait, this is a huge emergency.

492
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,546
I think the batter exists

493
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,682
to protect the chicken meat
when it gets fried.

494
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,484
That was my idea.

495
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,153
This is a phrase often used in Go games,

496
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,156
but he's telling us not to trick him
and take the bull by its horns.

497
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,694
-Chinese cuisine is mostly fried food.
-Yes, the Chinese chefs.

498
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,363
What if you served <i>basi?</i>

499
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,232
He may literally toss it.

500
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,168
-Fried sweet potato.
-Fried sweet potato covered in sugar.

501
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,337
-Like candied sweet potatoes?
-Yes, like those.

502
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,738
NO FRIED FOOD, NO SUGAR

503
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,874
-He wouldn't eat it.
-Wait.

504
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,109
You probably never had candied fruit.

505
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,312
<i>Tang, tang, hulu, hulu</i>

506
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,613
I've had candied fruit.

507
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,816
I just don't eat sweet food as a meal.
I still eat those as snacks.

508
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,520
-This is really bad.
-We're here today with a Grim Reaper.

509
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,455
-I'm in trouble today.
-Yes.

510
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,691
Maybe his wife agreed
to let him come on the show

511
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,228
-to mess with us.
-"Go ahead and try."

512
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,295
No, here's my take.

513
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,998
-"You all need to try too."
-"Try it."

514
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,368
Her intention may be,
"Chefs, go ahead and try this."

515
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,270
I never thought
I had a very particular appetite.

516
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,305
-Yes?
-But now that I'm here, I feel…

517
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,274
You aren't just a little particular.

518
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,909
And you eat all three meals at home?

519
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:44,977
What a brave husband.

520
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,579
A brave husband?

521
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,314
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE
FOR MR. PARTICULAR'S BRAVERY

522
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,149
There are lots of sauces too.

523
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,118
Sriracha and everything.

524
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,987
-I rarely eat those.
-You don't?

525
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,689
What if you had to use
either mayonnaise or ketchup?

526
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,158
Neither.

527
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,494
-Why not?
-Come on! This is bad.

528
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,031
Some people eat fried eggs with ketchup.

529
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,666
-No sauce?
-Stop trying to avoid this.

530
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,668
Chefs are
supposed to leap over this obstacle.

531
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,670
Please continue.

532
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,338
We should cook like we're at a temple.

533
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,907
How many times do I have to say
I'm not a chef?

534
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,976
What do you usually eat at home?

535
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,745
-I only eat Korean food.
-Just Korean food?

536
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,313
He only likes Korean food.

537
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,515
-I love spicy stir-fried pork.
-Spicy stir-fried pork.

538
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,317
A lot of sugar goes into that.

539
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,852
Some families don't use sugar.

540
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,920
Why would you use sugar
to make spicy stir-fried pork?

541
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,323
Wait, the recipe requires sugar.

542
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,026
-There's more sugar than gochujang.
-And gochujang has sugar in it too.

543
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,328
-There's sugar in gochujang?
-Yes, there is.

544
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,563
-And in spicy stir-fried pork?
-Yes, of course.

545
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,234
He's a full-on isolationist of food
in the world of Go.

546
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,403
-He has an ironclad appetite.
-He does.

547
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,971
Is this tteokbokki for your daughter?

548
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,740
-No, I like rice cakes.
-He likes rice cakes.

549
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,809
-How about tteokbokki?
-I like that too.

550
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,479
-Tteokbokki? No way! You're lying!
-It's made with so much sugar.

551
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,214
-It uses both gochujang and sugar.
-Tteokbokki?

552
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,684
-Tteokbokki is sweet.
-That sounds weird.

553
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,353
Gochujang isn't used to make tteokbokki,

554
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,655
and I had a bit of culture shock to hear

555
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,424
that tteokbokki can be sweet.

556
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,192
-What?
-Wait.

557
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,063
He says gochujang isn't used
to make tteokbokki.

558
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,164
Remember that.

559
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,799
-Room temperature ingredients.
-Yes.

560
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,134
Yes, you said you liked ramyeon.

561
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,103
-I do.
-He likes ramyeon.

562
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,304
Let's make ramyeon.

563
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,706
Peperoncino.

564
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,708
My daughter brought those home.

565
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,843
-I used it to make ramyeon…
-I see.

566
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,912
…by boiling it over medium heat
for 30 minutes.

567
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:32,117
I tried making ramyeon in that broth,
and it was delicious.

568
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,686
How many peperoncino did you use
to make ramyeon?

569
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,887
I just used a fistful.

570
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,956
-A fistful?
-It must be spicy.

571
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,258
-He does like spicy food.
-A fistful?

572
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,361
-I thought this was sugar.
-It's salt.

573
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,428
-Is it salt?
-Yes.

574
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,631
-It's from Bigeum Island.
-From Bigeum Island.

575
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,600
He doesn't have any sugar here.

576
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,635
I think the chefs will all run away.

577
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,238
We were duped by Se-dol's wife.

578
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,576
I think she let him come
because she gets a day off

579
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,144
without the fridge.

580
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,513
-Yes, that's it.
-I think you're right.

581
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,714
She gets a day off.

582
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,816
It's not just a day.
They took it yesterday

583
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,985
and will return it tomorrow,
so she gets three days off.

584
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,720
-It's her break.
-Three days of break.

585
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,555
Was that really the case?

586
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,960
-This is so hard.
-I didn't know I was so particular.

587
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,028
-You should all stay alert.
-It's an emergency.

588
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,464
Before I share his order,

589
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,935
I received a letter
from his wife to the chefs.

590
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,072
Wait, I have a feeling that something is…

591
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,242
She must be asking us
to do our best to please him.

592
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,943
-It's a long message.
-What did she say?

593
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,512
She must've been worried.

594
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,480
I had no idea what she said.

595
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,915
Let me read it for you.

596
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,450
"That man

597
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,218
doesn't eat anything sweet,

598
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,554
-and he doesn't eat sesame, either."
-Sesame?

599
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,690
"He doesn't like it
if you sprinkle nuts on the dishes.

600
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,527
He only eats nuts as a snack.

601
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,531
He likes the sauce on the side
for dishes like steak and hamburger.

602
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,332
If he doesn't like the sauce,

603
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,400
he gets mad."

604
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,002
(POETIC LICENSE)

605
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,505
Most hamburgers are
served with the sauce inside.

606
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,608
"He doesn't like any fried dishes,
but he loves noodles."

607
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,876
-Noodles.
-"However,

608
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,913
when pasta comes al dente,

609
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,481
he thinks it's undercooked,
so he doesn't like it."

610
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,916
I see.

611
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,052
-It's an emergency.
-You're in trouble.

612
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,521
-You're in huge trouble.
-He doesn't get it.

613
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,990
What does al dente mean?

614
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,392
"He's a particular man."

615
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,228
And she closes with this.

616
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,297
"Good luck, chefs."

617
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,998
GOOD LUCK

618
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,267
I feel like we've been duped.

619
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,536
"Good luck, chefs."

620
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,938
I think she's teasing us.

621
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,807
Let's find out
what Se-dol's orders are today.

622
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,409
Here are his orders.

623
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
Let's find out.

624
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,813
Zero sugar game.

625
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,216
ZERO SUGAR CHALLENGE?

626
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,118
It's a game, but it's a zero sugar game.

627
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,854
Do you want it to taste like this?

628
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,156
It's simply what it says.

629
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,159
-Something made without sugar. Sugarless.
-Sugarless.

630
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,827
-Zero sugar.
-That's all you need to do.

631
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,064
And please leave out
everything else I mentioned before.

632
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,132
That's way too many.

633
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,103
It's also a chef's role
to introduce him to a new appetite.

634
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,972
-Yes, whoa.
-Okay.

635
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,240
What's the next order?

636
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,307
OCTOPUS GAME

637
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,009
-Octopus.
-Octopus game.

638
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,245
-Octopus is good.
-Octopus dishes?

639
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,780
I love octopus,

640
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,583
so I think I'll enjoy
whatever you make with them.

641
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,552
These are Se-dol's orders.

642
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,587
-Four of you must participate.
-Yes.

643
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,724
-It sounds hard.
-Four of you must cook for Se-dol.

644
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,594
-Ji-sun? I knew it.
-Whoa.

645
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,996
-Chef Ji-sun.
-Whoa.

646
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,031
-I'll go with the octopus.
-Octopus.

647
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,432
-The octopus.
-The octopus.

648
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,434
It'll be amazing
if she makes octopus <i>basi</i>.

649
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,537
-Octopus <i>basi?</i>
-Octopus <i>basi?</i>

650
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,907
Ji-sun chooses the octopus game.

651
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,142
-I'll go.
-Yes, Nam-no?

652
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,244
I'll go for the octopus too.

653
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,780
-Octopus.
-It's better to choose early on.

654
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,415
Why are you all acting like weaklings?

655
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,716
Hyun-suk, will you join this?

656
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,486
No, I want to hear from other chefs first.

657
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,021
What?

658
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,156
-The zero sugar game.
-I can't deal with him.

659
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,559
-I'll do the zero sugar game.
-Sung-jun!

660
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,295
I've lost once before
against Poong because of sugar.

661
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,665
I've lost against him once
because of the reversed kouign-amann.

662
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,868
I think I might have the upper hand
if I chose this one.

663
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,603
So I wanted to do
the zero sugar game with him.

664
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,072
-I see.
-Poong can't work without sugar, though.

665
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,607
-He loves sugar.
-I've never skipped

666
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,742
a single episode of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> yet.

667
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,211
And I believe I always used sugar.

668
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,182
-Sugar.
-You always cook with sugar.

669
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,350
That's right.

670
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,352
My wife once said

671
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,922
Poong may be the right cook for me.

672
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,758
-She did?
-She said it in passing.

673
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:37,329
In that case, I must write history today.

674
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,198
-It's a real challenge.
-Are you up for the challenge?

675
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,602
I'll defeat Sung-jun without sugar.

676
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,270
-He's up.
-Poong is up.

677
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,472
Sung-jun and Poong will do
the zero sugar game.

678
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,341
Dang it. I lost my chance.

679
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,544
-Dang it. I missed it.
-Come on.

680
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,612
Jeez.

681
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,849
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Se-dol's fridge.</i>

682
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,718
The man who is against sugar,

683
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,419
a dish just for Lee Se-dol.

684
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,489
This round is the zero sugar game.

685
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,560
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong,
the man with no-cooking ethics,

686
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,597
is up against Chef Kwon Sung-jun,
the man against all good vibes.

687
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,133
I want to know

688
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,469
if he just doesn't want sugar
or if it can't be sweet at all.

689
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:21,039
Will it be okay for them to use
sweet flavors that aren't sugar?

690
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,142
-So no starch syrup or oligosaccharide?
-No.

691
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,677
-Not even those?
-No?

692
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,379
He's dead set on this.

693
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,880
He looks very concerned.

694
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,382
VERY CONCERNED

695
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,450
SHAKING IN FEAR, YES SIR

696
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,818
Last week,

697
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,922
<i>Poong splashed everyone with sugar</i>
<i>when he cooked for Mimi.</i>

698
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,791
Are you sure you can do this
without sugar?

699
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,927
How can I?

700
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,997
Right? I wonder.

701
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,933
-He's just trying.
-Yes, I'm just trying.

702
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,202
You both have four stars so far.

703
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,570
Hey.

704
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,839
They're tying as second places
of the entire show.

705
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,908
Poong won four times and lost eight,

706
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,077
Sung-jun won four times and lost seven.

707
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,080
-The difference isn't huge.
-We're about the same.

708
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,349
There's no huge difference
between Poong and Sung-jun.

709
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,352
Whoever wins today will become
the only second place.

710
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,089
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: RADISH,
CHEONGYANG PEPPER POWDER, ROCKFISH

711
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,158
BIGEUM ISLAND SALT, TOMATO SAUCE, KELP
SEAFOOD BROTH, PERILLA LEAVES, AND MORE

712
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,993
The dish I'm making is called

713
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,128
Napoli MatphaGo.

714
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,264
-What?
-Napoli MatphaGo?

715
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,033
-Like AlphaGo?
-Like AlphaGo, MatphaGo.

716
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,135
-MatphaGo.
-MatphaGo.

717
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,403
What's it like?

718
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,739
I'll cook with rockfish today.

719
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,109
I'll start by making
spicy rockfish soup as the base

720
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,046
-and make kal-guksu.
-Kal-guksu.

721
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,048
And to add a touch of Naples,

722
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,185
I want to use tomato sauce
and bring out the savory taste.

723
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,953
He said he liked tomatoes.

724
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,056
-He doesn't look thrilled.
-Is tomato sauce okay?

725
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,392
What do you think
about kal-guksu and tomato?

726
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,327
How about spicy rockfish soup and tomato?

727
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,129
I dare not say anything.

728
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,832
He feels uneasy.

729
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,700
Sung-jun, you're in trouble.

730
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,302
No tomatoes.

731
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,238
-It'll be fine as long as it's good.
-But it's kal-guksu.

732
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,006
Do you like soggy noodles

733
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,809
-or firmer noodles? Soggy ones?
-A little on the soggy side.

734
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,878
I don't think I can do this.

735
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,046
I can't make my dish taste bad.

736
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,315
He took my line right away.

737
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,650
-I see.
-I love the confidence.

738
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,587
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
PEPERONCINO, RADISH, OCTOPUS INK

739
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,689
POTATOES, PREPPED BLUE CRAB,
TOFU, CHICKEN STOCK, MANILA CLAM

740
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,024
The dish I'll make is called

741
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
A Stroke of Poong.

742
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,896
-A Stroke of Poong.
-Not a stroke of genius.

743
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,097
A stroke of genius.

744
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,601
-A Stroke of Poong. I like the name.
-That sounds good.

745
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,069
What's the move you'll make?

746
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,704
I plan to make

747
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,606
a game of Go today.

748
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,674
MAKE A GAME OF GO?

749
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,243
-A game of Go?
-Make a game of Go?

750
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,311
I'll use potatoes

751
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,780
to make cake.

752
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,348
-Make what?
-Really?

753
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,016
-He'll make cake.
-I'll mix it with starch.

754
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,418
And I'll make Go stones with those.

755
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,287
He'll make Go stones with potatoes.

756
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,022
Will you make both white and black stones?

757
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,493
You're right. As for the black stones,
I saw some leftover octopus ink.

758
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,761
-Yes, he had some ink left.
-Yes.

759
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,832
I'll use octopus ink
to make the black stones.

760
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,901
He gets creative
like the webtoon artist he is.

761
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,171
Yes, and I'll make the Go board with tofu.

762
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,573
Go board with tofu?

763
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,241
I can't imagine this.

764
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,778
And on top of that board,

765
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,748
I want to display
the stroke of genius he showed

766
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,484
against AlphaGo
when he played his 78th move.

767
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,354
I believe you have 15 minutes,
not 150 minutes.

768
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,989
-That's right.
-You get 15 minutes.

769
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:29,160
You're right.
So I'll make a miracle in just 15 minutes.

770
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,798
You're saying
it'll definitely look stunning.

771
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,534
I'll capture his heart
with the presentation,

772
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,570
as well as his appetite
without using sugar

773
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:42,440
to win against MatphaGo
just as how you won against AlphaGo.

774
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,676
It's all about the presentation.

775
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,712
-What is it, Sung-jun?
-I won't use any sugar in my dish today.

776
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,013
I won't use MSG, either.

777
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,582
And third, no oil.

778
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,785
I plan to make something
more nature-friendly.

779
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,286
Poong, you'll do that too, right?

780
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,921
Sure.

781
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:00,191
-I won't use any sugar today.
-Okay.

782
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,860
Or MSG.

783
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,728
But a little bit of oil.

784
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,599
I heard you took MSG.

785
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,133
-What?
-You found MSG?

786
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,369
-This is…
-Wait.

787
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,005
I have it at home.

788
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,874
I didn't bring it to use it.

789
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,976
I had to bring it here
like a good luck charm.

790
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,078
-Like a talisman.
-It's like a talisman for me.

791
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:24,282
I had to have it here
to feel more at ease.

792
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,684
And now, let us begin

793
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,287
the zero sugar round for Se-dol.

794
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,222
My gosh. Oh, no.

795
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,925
This man wants to prove
that his previous loss was

796
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,128
caused by sugar, not by Poong.

797
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,596
Chef Sung-jun is up.

798
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,366
But Webtoon Artist Kim Poong thinks

799
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,770
he just can't lose against Sung-jun
even if he can't use sugar.

800
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,139
Will they be able to bring down
Se-dol's ironclad decision

801
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,642
never to eat any sugar again.

802
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,611
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

803
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,214
You can do this!

804
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,949
Begin!

805
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,752
-Fifteen minutes.
-What?

806
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,087
Sung-jun begins by using the rockfish.

807
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,123
-Are you making broth?
-I am.

808
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,592
-The broth.
-Yes.

809
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,661
You're adding more broth
into the broth you're making?

810
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,230
-Sand lance.
-Sand lance sauce.

811
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,998
The broth looks so good.

812
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,501
He begins by making clam broth.

813
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,569
-He's making broth.
-Poong uses Manila clams.

814
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,238
That'll become his soup.

815
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,408
-Poong, is that the broth?
-I think it's the chicken stock.

816
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,677
I'm using everything
from chicken stock to blue crab.

817
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,645
When chicken stock is
mixed with seafood broth,

818
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,881
-it tastes very classy.
-It's really good.

819
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,750
Sung-jun and Poong are putting in
lots of work into the soup.

820
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,620
SUNG-JUN PULLS OUT THE ROCKFISH

821
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,722
-Already?
-He gets the rockfish out.

822
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,892
I parboiled it
to get rid of the fishy smell.

823
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,760
-And you'll boil it again?
-Yes.

824
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,028
He's using a pressure cooker.

825
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,297
2. BOIL WATER, PARBOILED ROCKFISH, GARLIC,
AND GREEN ONION IN A PRESSURE COOKER

826
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,901
That looks good. Look at that.

827
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,604
How will you make Go stones with potatoes?

828
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,106
He'll need flour.

829
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,607
He'll need to make the dough.

830
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,178
He's microwaving those to cook them.

831
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,547
They cook much faster in a microwave
compared to boiling them.

832
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,449
Yes, he's saving time.

833
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,785
Poong continues to boil
his refreshing broth.

834
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,354
Be careful. It's going to overflow.

835
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,189
-Poong, the broth.
-The broth is overflowing.

836
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,290
The broth!

837
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,059
Darn it.

838
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,830
-It's boiling over again.
-The broth.

839
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,897
Darn it.

840
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,734
-The heat. Lower the heat.
-The heat is too high.

841
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,002
Isn't the heat too high?

842
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,536
I'm really worried about Poong.

843
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,305
He's the type who pretends to fall

844
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,307
but he throws a blow as he gets up.

845
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,076
KIM POONG,
THE EXPERT OF CLEVER MOVES

846
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,412
ON THE OTHER HAND, MATPHAGO IS
PLAYING THIS THE TEXTBOOK WAY

847
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,314
He's finally making the actual broth.

848
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,717
HE USES RADISH TOO

849
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,221
SPEEDING UP

850
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,189
I knew Sung-jun would be that fast.

851
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,325
-Yes.
-He's very fast.

852
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,862
4. ADD SLICED RADISH, GREEN ONION, AND
CHEONGYANG PEPPER IN THE ROCKFISH SOUP

853
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:54,399
Se-dol likes his food spicy
rather than bland.

854
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,634
5. MIX GOCHUJANG, DOENJANG, GROUND PEPPER,
AND SOY SAUCE TO MAKE THE SEASONING

855
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,002
Are you making ssamjang?

856
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,771
-No, the seasoning.
-No?

857
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,140
That's a lot. Was that a fistful?

858
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,275
-I'll make it spicy.
-Yes, he made it spicy.

859
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,810
The seasoning goes in.

860
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,512
You didn't use any sugar, right?

861
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,113
-No.
-No.

862
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,349
INSTEAD, HE USES TOMATO SAUCE

863
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:12,984
LOTS OF SAUCE

864
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,152
Make it spicy.

865
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,753
Rockfish kal-guksu.

866
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,122
It's a creative dish.

867
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,625
POONG ALSO HAS A STROKE OF CREATIVITY

868
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,127
-The Go board.
-Hey, he's making the Go board.

869
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,330
-The Go board.
-Hey, he's making the Go board.

870
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,799
-He's trembling.
-His hands are trembling.

871
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,801
Poong's hand is trembling.

872
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,636
He's using the entire tofu?

873
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,305
He's cutting it into a Go board.

874
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,840
He's turning that into a Go board?

875
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,041
I can't see anything.

876
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,976
Shouldn't he add some dark lines?

877
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,213
He has 15 minutes, so there's a chance
it'll get soggy if it's cooked too long.

878
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,649
-Yes.
-Tofu already has some water.

879
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,751
I hope the lines are straight too.

880
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,120
-His hand is trembling.
-Oh, no. You're shaky.

881
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,823
-His hand is shaking.
-It is.

882
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,991
I have no idea what he's making.

883
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,059
Right?

884
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,763
It's all right. It's okay.

885
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,965
Is that soy sauce?

886
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,700
Will it show the lines?

887
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,768
COATING TOFU WITH SOY SAUCE

888
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,970
He's doing that to show the lines.

889
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,439
A-HA

890
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,343
It kind of looks like a Go board
with that soy sauce color.

891
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,078
Olive oil.

892
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,314
-Will he fry the tofu?
-Yes, he has to.

893
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,582
He's using oil.

894
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,217
Will that make the lines darker?

895
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,553
-I don't think it'll show.
-I think it'll get smashed.

896
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,021
I hope it doesn't turn darker.

897
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,923
That tofu is the Go board.

898
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,625
-They have ten minutes left.
-Yes.

899
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,960
You have under ten minutes.

900
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,462
SUNG-JUN BEGINS TO MAKE THE DOUGH

901
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,731
Is that the dough?

902
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,733
Will the noodles come out nicely?

903
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,669
Will he have enough time

904
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,004
-to make the noodles?
-He has enough time.

905
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,273
Nine minutes left.

906
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,308
Nine minutes left.

907
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,576
He's already done.

908
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,711
Shouldn't you knead it some more?

909
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,384
Poong looks anxious,
as if he doesn't know what to do.

910
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,552
AND HE FINALLY FLIPS THE TOFU

911
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,354
I wonder what happened to the board.

912
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,723
-Hey!
-It looks like a Go board!

913
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,325
-It's the Go board.
-The lines became darker.

914
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,527
I can't believe it.

915
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,762
-Whoa!
-It looks great.

916
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,231
HE GETS THE BROTH HE HAD BEEN BOILING

917
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,299
Just the soup?

918
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,468
AND HE POURS IT OVER
THE TOFU GO BOARD

919
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,536
Oh, my!

920
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,672
-He's pouring the broth.
-He'll boil it down.

921
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,541
The soup was poured over the fried tofu.

922
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,842
The lines on the board became darker.

923
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,546
-You're right. It's a Go board.
-It's opening up.

924
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,613
I can't believe this.

925
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,049
-That's so cool.
-Whoa. It's really cool.

926
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,918
That's a great idea.

927
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,421
It seems like
Poong begins with an advantage.

928
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,056
He just needs the Go stones now.

929
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,126
OPENING THE MICROWAVE

930
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,094
It's hot. Damn it.

931
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,162
IT'S HOT! DAMN IT(?)

932
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,830
THROWING IT DOWN

933
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,099
So he actually cooks like that?

934
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,169
-The potatoes are ready.
-And mash them. That's it.

935
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,506
The potato will turn into Go stones.

936
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,408
-Water?
-Was that iced water?

937
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,577
-Iced water? Why?
-It'll make it firmer.

938
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,213
Poong adds some four into the potato.

939
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,415
If he doesn't have enough potatoes,

940
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,016
the dough may come undone.

941
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,153
-He could use some more flour.
-Yes, I hope the stones look sturdy.

942
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,089
How will you make
two different colors of stones?

943
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,159
HE HAS THE WHITE DOUGH READY

944
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,428
How will he do that?

945
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,064
I wonder. That's the black stone!

946
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,665
-He's making black stones.
-That's good.

947
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,102
He added octopus ink
into the potato dough.

948
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,770
This takes a lot of work.

949
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,072
His gloves are turning darker too.

950
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,874
There's the black stone dough.

951
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,310
Chef Sung-jun is making noodles.

952
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,546
Sung-jun makes noodles.

953
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,382
-The noodles.
-He's flattening the dough.

954
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,719
I wonder how chewy it'll be.

955
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,554
Do you like chewy noodles?

956
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,189
Yes, that's all good,

957
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,590
but look at the time.

958
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,992
He's only worried about the time.

959
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:45,096
He's not looking at them cooking.
His eyes are only on the time.

960
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,964
THEY CONTINUE TO COOK
DESPITE SE-DOL'S CONCERN

961
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,501
7. CHOP THE FLATTENED DOUGH
AND MAKE KAL-GUKSU NOODLES

962
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,837
He just began to chop the noodles.

963
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,605
He's chopping the noodles.

964
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,941
You see people chopping noodles like that
when you go to traditional markets.

965
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,110
You're right. Sung-jun.

966
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,514
KAL-GUKSU NOODLES ARE DONE

967
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,917
-Hand-pulled noodles.
-Yes, you have six minutes.

968
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,519
PEPERONCINO

969
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,521
DROPPING A FISTFUL

970
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,922
HE POURS IN LOTS OF PEPERONCINO

971
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,224
Isn't that too much?

972
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,525
Are you sure about this?

973
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,327
Poong, what did you throw in?

974
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,630
-Peperoncino. He's pulling them out.
-He's fishing them out.

975
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,532
Didn't you throw in too many?

976
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,268
-His poop will be fiery at that rate.
-Tell me about it.

977
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,637
-That was a lot.
-Fish them out already.

978
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,073
HE GETS THE POTATO CAKE DOUGH

979
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,708
Go stones.

980
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,977
Poong begins to make the Go stones.

981
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,012
Why are they so big?

982
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,581
He's throwing them into the broth for now.

983
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,784
Honestly speaking,

984
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,820
I don't really care
about how the food is presented.

985
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,323
I don't really care
about how the food is presented.

986
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,191
You can't tell him that now.

987
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,127
Se-dol just said that.

988
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,897
But it'll be important
if they're equally good.

989
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,032
Please take his hard work into account.

990
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,601
What's important is the move he made
to win against AlphaGo.

991
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,570
Does he remember that?
He doesn't know anything about Go.

992
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,706
Can he really bring it to life?

993
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,841
It's not easy
for a layman to remember that.

994
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,811
THE SPICY ROCKFISH SOUP LOOKS DELICIOUS

995
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,647
-The soup.
-His soup is ready.

996
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,683
Is he making kal-guksu
just by using that soup?

997
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,285
HE ONLY USES THE STRAINED SOUP

998
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,753
That soup looks strong.

999
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,555
He made the spicy soup.

1000
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,457
He'll throw the noodles in there?

1001
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,158
You have under five minutes.

1002
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,094
Sung-ju, please tell us
how things are going.

1003
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,363
-All right. I'll go out.
-Okay.

1004
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,399
-It's the scariest moment.
-They both have four wins so far.

1005
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,768
First of all, you made this spicy soup.

1006
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,170
-And the noodles.
-The noodles went in.

1007
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,505
He's cooking them separately.

1008
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,573
He should.

1009
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,709
Let me try this spicy soup.

1010
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,478
-I wonder what it's like.
-It'll taste like gochujang jjigae.

1011
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:45,249
Did he make it taste delicious
even without sugar?

1012
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,119
-He couldn't. It's awful.
-No, right?

1013
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,588
-He couldn't. It's awful.
-Oh, no.

1014
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,822
-That's cruel.
-It's awful.

1015
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,258
He couldn't do it. It's awful.

1016
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,994
-Is it bland?
-It's awful. Yes.

1017
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,729
The rockfish.

1018
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,765
-He has something in the pressure cooker.
-It's ridiculous.

1019
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,666
It's ridiculous.

1020
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,869
This is Poong's Go board.

1021
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,070
And the Go stones.

1022
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,406
The stones are quite big
compared to the board.

1023
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,307
NOT IN PROPORTION

1024
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,942
Do you want to try his soup too?

1025
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,078
Let me try his soup too.

1026
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,914
-How's Poong's soup?
-It looked good.

1027
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,983
Was it a stroke of genius?
Or did he fail miserably?

1028
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,985
-It's miserable.
-It is?

1029
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,787
-It's miserable.
-It is?

1030
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,822
-It's miserable.
-Why?

1031
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,525
It doesn't taste spicy or salty.

1032
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,593
-It's weird.
-It's not this or that.

1033
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,797
How spicy do you like your food?
This wasn't really spicy.

1034
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,432
The spicier it is, the better.

1035
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,599
Do you like extremely spicy food?

1036
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,767
He likes spicy food.

1037
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,402
It just tastes deliciously spicy.

1038
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,006
Peperoncino won't give off the spicy taste
unless it's peeled open.

1039
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,674
He's using Cheongyang pepper.

1040
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,676
Cheongyang? He's using Cheongyang pepper.

1041
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,178
ADDING MORE SPICINESS

1042
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:51,115
-No sugar is allowed.
-He threw in Cheongyang peppers.

1043
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,284
He just dropped in a handful of them.

1044
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,986
You added so many of them.

1045
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,722
You're both having a tough time
cooking without sugar.

1046
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,293
ADDING THE KAL-GUKSU NOODLES
INTO THE SOUP

1047
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,695
Mussels.

1048
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:09,400
I knew it! He's getting the meat
from the broth he made before.

1049
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,937
-Sung-jun throws in crab meat.
-He's squeezing them.

1050
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,707
HE FINALLY OPENS UP
THE PRESSURE COOKER

1051
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,578
Gosh, look at the broth boiling.

1052
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,713
It's boiling fiercely.

1053
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,115
He threw in crab meat
and all the other seafood.

1054
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,718
-And rock fish goes in too.
-He's getting just the flesh.

1055
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,820
He's getting just the meat.

1056
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,356
-It'll be much easier to eat it.
-It will be.

1057
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,292
POONG TASTES THE SOUP AGAIN

1058
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:38,963
He threw in crab meat…

1059
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,965
STEALTHILY

1060
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,801
I see. Why do you have chicken here?

1061
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,404
-Se-dol, what's in the fridge over there?
-What?

1062
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,173
What do you mean?

1063
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,942
HE PULLS A TRICK

1064
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,911
AND USES HIS TALISMAN(?)

1065
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,279
What do you mean?

1066
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,881
Oh, you put that in?

1067
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,082
He didn't.

1068
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,985
-Did you?
-Yeah.

1069
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,621
He fixed it up a little, so let me try it.

1070
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,055
There are two minutes left.

1071
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,193
Will Poong bring a new wind this time?

1072
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,996
My gosh!

1073
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,398
-He got it!
-He got it!

1074
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,101
-It's delicious.
-He got it.

1075
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,570
-He got it!
-He got it!

1076
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,206
-It's delicious.
-He did it.

1077
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,575
Poong fishes out the tofu.

1078
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,310
That's really unique.

1079
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,580
HE STRAINS THE POT
AND GETS JUST THE SOUP

1080
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,051
He's making it thicker with starch.

1081
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,554
Poong's dish looks like

1082
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,156
something I've never had before
in my life.

1083
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,625
You have about a minute left.

1084
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,260
Please hurry. One minute.

1085
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,931
TOPPING THE NOODLES AND SEAFOOD
WITH PERILLA LEAVES FIRST

1086
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,501
LASTLY, TRYING THE SOUP

1087
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,537
SALT FROM BIGEUM ISLAND,
CHEONGYANG PEPPER POWDER, SOY SAUCE

1088
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,873
If they can't use sugar,
Sung-jun thinks he can win easily.

1089
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,910
Wait, hey.

1090
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,946
Wait, hey.

1091
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:06,016
Poong had this on him.
He drew the winning move.

1092
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,484
He has a cheat sheet.

1093
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,753
It's the move Se-dol made to beat AlphaGo.

1094
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,455
It's the move that beat AlphaGo.

1095
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,324
CHEATING OUT IN THE OPEN

1096
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,261
On that side. Right there.
Just like that. Yes.

1097
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,163
-Another white stone.
-Hurry up!

1098
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,333
-Forty seconds left!
-Can you finish this in time?

1099
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,469
Forty seconds. Poong's hands are shaking.

1100
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,604
White stones. Thirty seconds.

1101
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,872
You need three white stones.

1102
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,742
-Three white stones. Fifteen.
-Twenty seconds.

1103
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,211
I think this is a huge stretch.

1104
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,780
-Fifteen seconds. You need the soup.
-Hurry.

1105
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,516
-Ten. Nine. Eight.
-Ten. Nine. Eight.

1106
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,753
-Seven. Six. Five.
-Seven. Six. Five.

1107
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,156
-Eight. Seven. Six.
-Eight. Seven. Six.

1108
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,058
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1109
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,161
-Five. Four. Three.
-Five. Four. Three.

1110
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,430
-The final move!
-Two.

1111
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,798
-The final move!
-Two.

1112
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,134
The time is up!

1113
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,402
Poong finishes first.

1114
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,939
Sung-jun, please ring the bell.

1115
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,141
The dishes are all done.

1116
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,743
Everything came out in 15 minutes.

1117
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,112
-That was amazing. I admire them.
-Yes.

1118
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,680
These look amazing.

1119
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,949
I admire them.

1120
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:16,387
Both dishes were finished just for Se-dol.

1121
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:19,289
You were reluctant that
they'd be able to do this in 15 minutes.

1122
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,791
I'll find out only after I try it,

1123
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,259
if it was truly possible or not.

1124
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,929
If it isn't good, you won't acknowledge it
as a finished dish?

1125
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,398
It's meaningless.

1126
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,966
-I see.
-That's harsh.

1127
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,434
He's scary.

1128
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,703
-That's scary.
-Yes.

1129
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,539
Se-dol is impregnable.

1130
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,808
You heard everything his wife said, right?

1131
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,344
-He never shows a fake response.
-No.

1132
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,047
<i>Please try Poong's dish first.</i>

1133
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,314
<i>A Stroke of Poong.</i>

1134
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,552
BLACK AND WHITE STONES MADE WITH POTATOES
ON TOP OF TOFU GO BOARD

1135
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,056
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
A STROKE OF POONG

1136
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,191
-Here.
-Thank you.

1137
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,193
Are the stones in the right positions?

1138
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,028
<i>It's close enough.</i>

1139
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,663
-Really?
-Yes, pretty much.

1140
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,967
-The white one in the center is that move.
-Yes, I know.

1141
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,502
FEELING PROUD

1142
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,337
-The move that defeated AlphaGo.
-I'll save it.

1143
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,440
-He made the moves…
-Where do I begin?

1144
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,041
-How do I eat this?
-Where does he begin?

1145
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,444
Try the sauce, the tofu,
and the potato cake

1146
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,813
-all at once with a spoon.
-Yes, with a spoon.

1147
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,749
-With a spoon?
-Yes, please use a spoon.

1148
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,084
Are you the type

1149
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,985
who rushes when you eat?

1150
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,954
-I didn't expect that.
-No.

1151
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,123
-Try the soup too.
-The soup.

1152
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,093
He tries the Go board,
the Go stones, and the soup too.

1153
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,830
WILL POONG'S GENIUS MOVE WORK?

1154
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,067
-Will he like it?
-He made it in just 15 minutes.

1155
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,604
-He's showing a bit of a smile.
-I wonder.

1156
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,973
I've seen this face when he played Go.

1157
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,643
This time, he tries just the Go stone.

1158
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,645
He seems to enjoy it.

1159
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,416
Hmm?

1160
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,617
What? What's wrong?

1161
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,385
No, it's better than I thought.

1162
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,554
It's better than he thought.

1163
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,323
HE CAN'T BELIEVE IT

1164
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,390
What were you imagining?

1165
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,694
That's a positive response.
It's better than he thought.

1166
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,729
-It's better than I expected.
-And the potato cake.

1167
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:06,997
-Is the stone okay?
-How about the stone?

1168
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,732
I like the Go stones.

1169
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,001
What does it taste like?

1170
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,503
It's chewy.

1171
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,874
-It must be like potato balls.
-Potato balls.

1172
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,008
And the soup.

1173
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,878
I like spicy food,
and I can taste a bit of it.

1174
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,347
<i>-It has a hint of spiciness.</i>
<i>-He poured in peperoncino.</i>

1175
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,415
<i>-That's the spiciness.</i>
<i>-And I added Cheongyang pepper too.</i>

1176
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,885
-It definitely tastes spicy.
-It does, right?

1177
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,954
-Is it not too salty?
-No, I enjoy salty food.

1178
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,490
-It just can't be sweet.
-That was a positive response.

1179
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,993
-That was…
-But the thing is…

1180
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,295
-That was…
-But the thing is…

1181
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,332
-Tofu was just tofu.
-Tofu was just tofu?

1182
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,400
It wasn't different.

1183
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,402
I guess he did it for the presentation.

1184
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,070
-It was.
-It's just tofu.

1185
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,139
THE GRIM REAPER
SENDS HIM DOWN TO THE TOFU HELL(?)

1186
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,574
It wasn't so moving.

1187
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,643
Doesn't it look like a Go board?

1188
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,944
It's tofu.

1189
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,213
It's just tofu.

1190
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,982
-It's tofu, but I like tofu.
-Yes, right?

1191
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,951
Did he make any bad moves
if you think about it again?

1192
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,452
Stop asking him questions.

1193
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,190
-Any bad moves?
-He just used the broth I had.

1194
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:10,460
It would've been amazing
if he made this in just 15 minutes,

1195
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,663
but all he did was this.

1196
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,999
He's asking if all Poong did was
making these stones in 15 minutes.

1197
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,134
He's very cold.

1198
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,769
-His wife did everything.
-Yes.

1199
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,906
-He just made the Go stones.
-He used the broth you already had.

1200
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:26,210
-But the Go stones were good.
-He gives a good score to the stones.

1201
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,679
<i>All right. Moving on.</i>

1202
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,582
<i>Chef Sung-jun's Napoli MatphaGo.</i>

1203
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,653
HE MAKES THE WINNING MOVE
WITH HAND-PULLED NOODLES AND SEAFOOD SOUP

1204
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:42,025
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S NAPOLI MATPHAGO

1205
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,394
-Will you pour the soup now?
-Yes.

1206
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,064
-I prepared it in Bigeum Island style.
-Thank you.

1207
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,066
-Bigeum Island?
-Is that how they eat noodles?

1208
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,768
He pours out soup out of the fish's mouth.

1209
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,337
I think he really wants to win today.

1210
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,506
Sung-ju, you said it was a bit bland

1211
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,342
-when you tried it before.
-Yes.

1212
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,712
He didn't use any sugar.

1213
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,181
Do people use sugar
to make dishes like these?

1214
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,682
-Yes, of course.
-A lot, actually.

1215
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,718
People use sugar to make soup and broth.

1216
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:08,952
-I see.
-Yes.

1217
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,622
-May I try it?
-Yes, please go ahead.

1218
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:15,259
-Se-dol's noodles. He tries the soup.
-He smells it first.

1219
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,694
The soup.

1220
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,933
-He's unsure.
-He's savoring it.

1221
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,168
You can't tell by his face.

1222
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,071
It'll taste different
if he tries it with the noodles.

1223
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,806
-He made fresh noodles.
-He topped it with perilla leaves.

1224
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,975
-I love perilla leaves.
-He must like it.

1225
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,044
He tries the noodles. Kal-guksu.

1226
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,812
He just hand-pulled the noodles.

1227
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,681
Yes, he just did.

1228
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,284
And he used all kinds of ingredients,
including rockfish.

1229
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,220
-Mussels and Manila clams.
-Mussels and Manila clams, everything.

1230
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,622
-And the crab.
-Blue crab.

1231
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,558
He used everything that gives off
the savory taste in broth.

1232
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,160
The noodles are good.

1233
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,162
-I see.
-I was a bit worried.

1234
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,664
Why were you worried?

1235
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,266
I thought it'd be undercooked.

1236
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,101
Because he didn't have much time?

1237
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,503
He must like noodles.

1238
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,838
He likes noodles
when they get a bit soggier.

1239
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:05,008
If you think about it,
both of these were noodle dishes.

1240
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,945
He seems as cautious
as he is during Go games.

1241
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,315
-The noodles taste great.
-The noodles are great.

1242
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,816
But it's the broth.

1243
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,252
-He's very careful.
-Did he make a bad move?

1244
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,621
-The broth must be unexpected.
-He made it with seafood.

1245
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,556
-You said it was bland.
-Yes.

1246
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,657
It's a little bland.

1247
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,626
OH, NO

1248
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,961
You were right.

1249
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,996
It's not how it was seasoned.

1250
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,532
It would've been better
if he made it spicy.

1251
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,401
It wasn't spicy enough.

1252
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,971
That was a bit of a shame.

1253
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,407
This is hard.
It's not easy to please his appetite.

1254
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,475
Here's the thing.

1255
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,478
I'm a bit torn.

1256
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,746
In what aspect?

1257
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,016
It should be all about the taste,
but this dish

1258
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,951
actually feels like a dish.

1259
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,955
-Chef Sung-jun's food was like a dish.
-His food?

1260
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,223
What about Poong?

1261
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,324
It's somewhat…

1262
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,626
-It was uncanny.
-Uncanny?

1263
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,929
-It didn't feel like a dish, but…
-I'm very torn.

1264
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,330
Do I have a time limit?

1265
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,532
Well, there's a time limit in Go games,

1266
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,768
but we'll give you enough time to decide.

1267
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,737
-Really?
-We'll give you time to think.

1268
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,705
He must be torn.

1269
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,574
He goes back to it once again.

1270
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,510
First off, Poong's dish,
A Stroke of Poong.

1271
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,213
The Go stone, the Go board, and the soup.

1272
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,683
-I can taste some crab.
-Yes.

1273
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,386
-Whoa, it's spicy.
-It's quite spicy.

1274
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,888
He's still torn.

1275
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,057
I can taste some sweetness. Why is that?

1276
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,692
It tastes pretty sweet.

1277
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:32,362
<i>There's sweetness</i>
<i>in the Manila clams and blue crab.</i>

1278
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,465
<i>-He added the natural sweet flavor.</i>
<i>-And radish.</i>

1279
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,000
He made it so deliciously,

1280
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,702
so it almost tastes like soft tofu.

1281
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:42,105
Do you remember how he fried the Go board?

1282
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,708
-I like that texture too.
-Yes, also,

1283
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,345
the potato cake feels like gnocchi to me.

1284
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,115
Everything was done nicely.

1285
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,155
You're trying something
whenever the chefs speak up.

1286
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,459
And next, Chef Sung-jun's Napoli MatphaGo.

1287
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,328
It tastes like spicy fish soup.

1288
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,130
It's spicy fish soup.

1289
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,032
It's rockfish kal-guksu.

1290
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,534
The noodles are delicious.

1291
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,270
-It's good.
-It's spicy.

1292
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,105
HE TRIES THE NOODLES AGAIN

1293
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,040
The noodles are great.

1294
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,942
The flavor seeped into the noodles

1295
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,511
after they sat in the soup for a while.

1296
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,647
<i>I appreciate that deep and subtle flavor.</i>

1297
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,451
-You can eat this for a long time.
-And it tastes clean.

1298
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,552
But it was a bit spicy.

1299
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,353
WHAT? IT'S SPICY?

1300
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,323
Se-dol tries it once again.

1301
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,792
-Yes, it's definitely the case.
-Yes.

1302
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,929
-The first dish was much spicier.
-It was.

1303
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,464
My tongue was numbed from that.

1304
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,165
I tried it again
and noticed the spiciness.

1305
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,067
I see. The first dish was too spicy.

1306
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,703
-All right. You can decide now.
-Have you decided?

1307
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,772
-I have.
-Okay.

1308
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,207
-Yes.
-Please grab the button.

1309
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,175
Press one for Kwon Sung-jun

1310
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,010
and two for Kim Poong.

1311
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,412
Please make your decision

1312
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,148
and press the button.

1313
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,550
I have no idea what to choose.

1314
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,152
This was the zero sugar game.

1315
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,654
-All right.
-We have the result.

1316
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:09,025
Which one of them did Se-dol choose?

1317
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,695
Show us the result.

1318
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,263
Kim Poong versus Kwon Sung-jun.

1319
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,532
They both have four wins thus far.

1320
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,135
The winner of this round will become

1321
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,470
the second place of the entire show.

1322
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,240
Who did Se-dol choose?

1323
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,641
Will it be Poong?

1324
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,976
Will it be Sung-jun?

1325
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,445
-Who's the winner?
-Who's the winner?

1326
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:29,980
Who is it?

1327
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,249
Who's the winner?

1328
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,584
Who is it? Sung-jun!

1329
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,886
Sung-jun wins.

1330
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,156
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
NAPOLI MATPHAGO WINS

1331
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,224
Sung-jun wins.

1332
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,294
-I'm sorry.
-Chef Sung-jun takes the star.

1333
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,297
Here's the thing. Honestly speaking,

1334
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,634
I was quite worried about Poong's dish.

1335
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,303
But it was much better than I thought.

1336
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,571
At first,

1337
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,941
I thought I should choose him.

1338
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,077
-But the noodles got better over time.
-After some time.

1339
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,747
It felt less spicy
because I had this dish first.

1340
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,484
I liked how the soup
seeped into the noodles over time.

1341
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,920
-That was why.
-You craved it more.

1342
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,822
All right. Please put a star on Sung-jun.

1343
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,560
Sung-jun takes his fifth victory!

1344
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,161
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1345
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,997
-He takes the win.
-He takes his fifth star.

1346
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,065
Sung-jun's fifth win.

1347
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:26,269
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with Se-dol's ingredients.</i>

1348
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,872
They're to cook with octopus,
an ingredient that brings back

1349
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,540
even exhausted cows to full health.

1350
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,008
Yes, the octopus game.

1351
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:35,045
Se-dol is a man who witnessed

1352
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:39,182
a cow that got right back up with energy
after eating some octopus.

1353
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,418
Both chefs today should aim

1354
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,588
to make Se-dol spring up from his seat.

1355
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,557
As you have already seen,

1356
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,626
-Se-dol has a harsh appetite.
-He does.

1357
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,095
-That's right.
-It wasn't easy.

1358
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:56,366
At this moment,
Chef Ji-sun has won all three rounds.

1359
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,368
-She hasn't lost once.
-Whoa, zero losses.

1360
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,771
She doesn't just think she'll ever lose.
She simply hasn't lost.

1361
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,608
She won against Poong, Eun-yeong,

1362
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,810
-and even Tae-hun.
-She took Tae-hun down.

1363
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,746
-She taught them all a lesson.
-Everyone who makes Chinese food.

1364
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,249
She's on a roll right now.

1365
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,418
Chef Ji-sun said something like this
as soon as her opponent was chosen.

1366
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,120
-Yes?
-"Nam-no

1367
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,090
doesn't come to the show to cook.

1368
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,025
He comes here to eat."

1369
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,027
"He comes here to eat."

1370
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,795
She says he comes to eat.

1371
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,531
"If he continues to do this,
he should return his paycheck

1372
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,267
and pay for the food."

1373
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,535
-That was what she said.
-She's right.

1374
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,638
-Her win rate is 100% right now.
-It is.

1375
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:38,008
I'll drop that right down to 75%.

1376
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,676
HE'LL BRING ABOUT HER FIRST LOSS!

1377
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,911
The world of culinary arts has fallen

1378
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,981
because these young kids are
defying all of their seniors.

1379
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,182
There's a bit of a problem.

1380
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,185
I brought order back to Chinese cuisine,
so it's Western cuisine today.

1381
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,688
Yes, teach him a lesson.

1382
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,523
In this round,

1383
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,226
Chan-won will go out
and do the five-minute check.

1384
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,961
-I'll be there.
-Yes.

1385
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,063
-I'll do it.
-Finally.

1386
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,998
Let's see how well you do.

1387
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,367
-We'll keep a keen eye on him.
-Yes.

1388
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,802
When we have guests here,

1389
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,906
some will say they'll sing or dance
when the food tastes good.

1390
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,776
So if it tastes really good,
please spring up from your seat.

1391
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,979
-Can you do that?
-Do I just have to stand up?

1392
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,982
-Yes.
-No, can you also moo?

1393
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,451
MOO?

1394
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,387
-Why would he…
-I pressed the wrong button, right?

1395
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,889
He's holding a grudge, right?

1396
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,190
He has hard feelings.

1397
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,026
I thought it'd be fun if you mooed.

1398
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,730
CHEF JI-SUN'S INGREDIENTS: RADISH, PEAR,
CHEONGYANG PEPPER POWDER, TOFU, OCTOPUS

1399
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,832
PREPPED PINEAPPLES, BIGEUM ISLAND SALT,
SAND LANCE SAUCE, LAVER, DRIED POLLACK

1400
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,301
-Chef Ji-sun, what's your dish?
-Yes.

1401
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,837
My dish is called Octopus Dim Sum.

1402
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,739
-Octopus Dim Sum.
-Octopus Dim Sum.

1403
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,041
-It must be made with octopus.
-Octopus Dim Sum?

1404
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,143
-That's her best move.
-What's it like?

1405
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,513
I wanted to show that dim sum is better
no matter what Chef Nam-no makes.

1406
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,683
So I prepared a dish
called Octopus Dim Sum.

1407
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,819
It's a bit of a wordplay.

1408
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,320
I've never made anything like this before.

1409
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,823
I'll fill up the heads with filling
and steam them

1410
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,592
to make soft dim sum and serve those.

1411
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,494
He said he didn't like condiments,

1412
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,130
so I'll use seasoned dried laver
to season the dim sum.

1413
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,132
-What?
-I also saw that he thinks

1414
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,669
seasoning the dish with his wife's broth
would mean it was his wife's dish,

1415
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,604
so I'll make my own broth.

1416
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,675
She'll make a new batch of broth, then.

1417
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,578
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS:
PHO SAUCE, OCTOPUS, CHOPPED CABBAGE

1418
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,713
ROCKFISH, SHRIMP MEAT, SLICED GARLIC,
SCORCHED RICE, MUSSEL MEAT

1419
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,882
The dish I prepared is called

1420
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,450
Maniac Se-dol.

1421
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,553
-Maniac Se-dol?
-Maniac Se-dol.

1422
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,190
Lee Se-dol plus Cooking Maniac,
so Maniac Se-dol.

1423
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,558
-I see.
-Maniac Se-dol.

1424
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,760
You aren't offended, are you?

1425
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,795
-He doesn't like it.
-Well…

1426
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,029
I'm not so sure.

1427
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,098
-He's not so sure about it.
-I'm not sure.

1428
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,400
He's not thrilled.

1429
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,467
What's it like?

1430
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,003
It's seafood and scorched rice soup.

1431
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,671
-I see.
-Scorched rice.

1432
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,040
-Scorched rice soup sounds good.
-Yes.

1433
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,210
-I saw that he had the ready-made version.
-Yes.

1434
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:57,847
I'll deep-fry those deliciously
and serve it with nice sauce.

1435
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,549
He said he didn't like deep-fried food.

1436
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,351
Is it fine if it doesn't have batter?

1437
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,687
Well, it's all fine
as long as it's delicious.

1438
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,489
LOTS OF PRESSURE

1439
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:10,760
And now, let us begin
the octopus game for Se-dol.

1440
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,663
Chef Jung Ji-sun is here to teach a lesson

1441
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,433
to the Cooking Maniac
and take her fourth victory.

1442
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,335
But Yoon Nam-no wants to open up
Se-dol's limited appetite

1443
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:24,374
and destroy Ji-sun's undefeated record.

1444
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,877
Who'll capture the appetite
of the Grim Reaper of <i>Chef & My Fridge?</i>

1445
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,448
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1446
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,316
You can do this!

1447
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,919
-Begin!
-You can do this!

1448
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,521
I'll get your revenge.

1449
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,923
You'll get my revenge?

1450
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,791
You can do this, Nam-no!

1451
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:42,859
LOTS OF SALT

1452
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,362
-They're both already using the octopus.
-Yes, the small octopus.

1453
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,731
CUTTING OFF JUST THE HEAD

1454
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,266
She said she'd only use the head.

1455
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,969
-She'll fill it up with filling.
-Yes, that's right.

1456
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,138
The small octopus looks amazing.

1457
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,973
-It's as big as an actual octopus.
-Yes.

1458
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,341
It doesn't look so small.

1459
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,976
-Look at that.
-It's huge.

1460
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,345
It's like Kraken.

1461
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,446
They look very solid.

1462
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,315
His wife keeps those
because her husband loves them.

1463
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,853
SHE PARBOILS OCTOPUS HEADS
JUST FOR 10 SECONDS

1464
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,388
-She's parboiling them.
-They go right into ice.

1465
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,157
It'll become firmer.

1466
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,526
-It'll maintain its texture.
-Yes.

1467
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,762
-The octopus isn't submerged.
-They aren't?

1468
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,731
1. ADD SALT TO BOILING WATER
AND BOIL THE OCTOPUS

1469
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,832
Those are huge.

1470
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,101
HE WORKS ON FISH AFTER THE OCTOPUS

1471
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,803
Nam-no, which fish are you using?

1472
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,505
-Rockfish.
-Rockfish.

1473
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,139
-The rockfish was that big?
-Yes.

1474
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,975
There's a lot of meat.

1475
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:36,579
-We finally see it getting prepped.
-That's Nam-no.

1476
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,381
It's as big as a sea bass.

1477
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,183
Yes, it's as big as a sea bass.

1478
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,685
He debones the rockfish.

1479
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,921
Rockfish tends to be drier when cooked

1480
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,156
compared to other fish like sea bass.

1481
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,058
It's not easy to give it a good texture.

1482
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,327
-He'll grind it.
-He's grinding it?

1483
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,930
-Is he making filling?
-Rockfish paste?

1484
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,534
Is he going to make fish balls?

1485
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,369
He might make dumplings without skin.

1486
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,105
He's crushing the shrimps too.

1487
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,541
Shrimps?

1488
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:07,443
ADDING THE SAVORINESS
OF BOTH ROCKFISH AND SHRIMPS

1489
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,711
WHAT ABOUT JI-SUN'S FLAVOR?

1490
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,747
-Dried pollack?
-What are those?

1491
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,215
-Dried pollack.
-Dried pollack.

1492
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,183
She's using dried pollack.

1493
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,121
CUTTING UP RADISH

1494
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,757
AND ADDING IT TO THE SMALL OCTOPUS LEGS

1495
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:24,027
-And Cheongyang pepper to add spiciness.
-Spiciness.

1496
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,798
-She's making broth with that.
-She's using that.

1497
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,033
-If you…
-She's making broth.

1498
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,168
…roast that in a pan
before using it to make broth,

1499
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,304
-it'll add much more flavor.
-More earthy.

1500
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,706
She parboiled the legs too.

1501
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,075
The small octopus looks solid.

1502
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,777
It goes into iced water right away.

1503
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:46,115
-Chef Ji-sun is smashing tofu.
-Yes.

1504
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,217
-Tofu? Like dumplings?
-Tofu.

1505
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,186
That must be the filling.

1506
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,355
-Dried laver?
-Dried laver.

1507
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,424
And the octopus leg.

1508
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,125
This small octopus isn't so small.

1509
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,294
-It's huge.
-Yes, it's big.

1510
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,163
-Yes.
-It's huge.

1511
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,799
-Tofu, dried laver, and octopus.
-Tofu, dried laver, and octopus.

1512
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,902
-That looks good.
-It must be the filling.

1513
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,837
HE FIGHTS BACK
WITH ROCKFISH, SHRIMP, AND SALT

1514
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,374
STARCH, SOY SAUCE

1515
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,809
ROLLING

1516
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,377
You were right. Like fish balls.

1517
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,846
-It's like dumplings without skin.
-Dumplings without skin.

1518
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,082
-Fish balls.
-Fish balls.

1519
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,317
-Did you add starch?
-Those look good.

1520
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:22,719
You have ten minutes.

1521
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,020
They both used lots of ingredients,

1522
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,421
-so it'll be good.
-This time, yes.

1523
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,690
SCORCHED RICE

1524
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,194
3. DEEP-FRY SCORCHED RICE

1525
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,528
UNSURE

1526
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,397
Those both look good.

1527
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,598
-Do they seem delicious?
-Yes.

1528
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,367
-Are you looking forward to it?
-Yes.

1529
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,603
First and foremost,
they're both using small octopus.

1530
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,872
-Are you more drawn to it?
-Yes.

1531
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,407
-It's your favorite.
-Yes.

1532
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,009
WHAT ARE THOSE?

1533
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,344
-Pineapple?
-Pineapple?

1534
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,946
Pineapple?

1535
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,047
-Pineapple?
-Pineapple?

1536
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:54,484
He didn't like the taste of sugar,
so I'm using fruit to add sweetness.

1537
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,254
-I see. With pineapple.
-She's using pineapple.

1538
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,256
-Pineapple.
-She uses fruit.

1539
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,858
Don't you like the sweetness from fruit?

1540
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,394
Well, yes. Sure.

1541
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,729
Tell us how you feel.

1542
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,531
It means he doesn't like it.

1543
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:11,134
Honestly, I'll have to try it.

1544
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,605
He has played Go all his life,
so he doesn't want to show his move.

1545
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,909
-He never shows what he's thinking.
-He doesn't.

1546
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:23,579
The pineapple looks like the sweet kind.

1547
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,348
-For pineapple pizza.
-Yes.

1548
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,350
Yes, it's for pineapple pizza.

1549
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,218
Should she leave those out?

1550
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,987
No, let her do her thing.

1551
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:35,391
-The scorched rice.
-The scorched rice won't bubble up.

1552
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,360
They seem kind of small.

1553
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,095
-That's not a lot.
-It's not made with sticky rice.

1554
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:41,097
The fried scorched rice pieces for soup
are usually pretty big.

1555
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,966
It has to be made with sticky rice
to bubble up.

1556
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,103
-It's just regular rice.
-That's just rice.

1557
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,972
-And there's too much oil on it.
-It's greasy.

1558
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,074
It's okay.

1559
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,608
You're boiling the small octopus
for too long.

1560
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,712
Is he cooking the octopus
in Italian style?

1561
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,313
He's cooking it for a while.

1562
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,283
Yes, Italians cook it for a while.

1563
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,552
HE'S DONE COOKING THE OCTOPUS

1564
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,021
OLIVE OIL

1565
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,757
ONION, GREEN ONION

1566
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,193
He's making green onion oil.

1567
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,362
WHAT ABOUT JI-SUN?

1568
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,898
-Is she making chili oil?
-Chili oil.

1569
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,800
I didn't know you could do that.

1570
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:21,604
We always saw Poong
starting it with green onion oil.

1571
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,740
She's using green onion too.

1572
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,141
-Like green onion oil.
-Like green onion oil.

1573
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:29,345
7. OIL PAN AND MAKE CHILI OIL
WITH RED PEPPER POWDER AND GREEN ONION

1574
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,649
4. STIR-FRY ONION AND GREEN ONION
TO MAKE GREEN ONION OIL

1575
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:34,884
Cabbage.

1576
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,920
FANCY WRIST FLICKS!

1577
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,288
Nam-no is making Chinese.

1578
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:42,325
It looks more like
he's making a Chinese dish.

1579
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,760
Nam-no is making Chinese.

1580
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:44,827
He's making Chinese food.

1581
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:46,829
The smoky flavor.

1582
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:47,897
Are you watching this, Ji-sun?

1583
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,500
Nam-no is making Chinese.

1584
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,103
ADDING GARLIC TO THE CHILI OIL

1585
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,838
-I'll get your revenge.
-Okay.

1586
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,273
ADDING SMALL OCTOPUS

1587
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,877
He's adding such huge pieces?

1588
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,280
-He's really making Chinese food.
-I think so.

1589
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,048
5. STIR-FRY CABBAGE AND SMALL OCTOPUS IN
GREEN ONION AND ADD WATER TO MAKE SOUP

1590
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,884
Eight minutes left.

1591
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,585
What's that? MSG?

1592
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,288
No, it's salt.

1593
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:13,856
I'm just joking.

1594
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,191
What's that?

1595
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,026
-Wait!
-Wait.

1596
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,594
-Wait.
-It's nothing.

1597
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,229
-Wait.
-What was that?

1598
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,864
You used MSG before.

1599
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,133
-What's that?
-Did you add MSG?

1600
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,569
-He added pho sauce.
-The pho sauce.

1601
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,637
I see.

1602
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,038
Is that sauce okay?

1603
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,374
-It's fine as long as it's good.
-Do you eat that?

1604
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,543
-Do you like pho?
-He likes noodles.

1605
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,779
I rarely eat pho, but sure.

1606
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,948
I haven't seasoned it yet. Give it back.

1607
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,584
There are no additives in the sauce.

1608
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,152
Shh.

1609
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,054
UGH…

1610
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,924
-Mussels.
-It'll be fine as long as it's good.

1611
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,660
Nam-no is making Chinese right now.

1612
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,462
JI-SUN FINISHES MAKING THE CHILI OIL

1613
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,632
8. MIX CHILI OIL
INTO THE DIM SUM FILLING AND MIX

1614
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,837
Ji-sun finally fishes out
the octopus heads.

1615
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,840
-So she'll fill those with the filling?
-That's right.

1616
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,576
I wonder how chewy they are.

1617
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:10,079
The dim sum skin seems
much thicker than usual.

1618
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,147
You're right.

1619
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,583
-I hope it's tender.
-I hope it's soft.

1620
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,051
She adds some eggs.

1621
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,686
And in goes the filling.

1622
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:18,888
She's filling up the small octopus head.

1623
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,724
That dim sum looks so good.

1624
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,359
-Doesn't it?
-Yes.

1625
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,561
But on the other hand,
it may be too tough.

1626
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,396
-She'll steam those, right?
-Right.

1627
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:28,764
That's the key.

1628
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,668
-Will the octopus be too tough?
-Exactly.

1629
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,570
I hope she steams it soon.

1630
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:37,106
Yes, they don't have much time.

1631
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,875
She parboiled it,
so she'll have enough time.

1632
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,744
-Really?
-And steaming doesn't take long.

1633
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:42,845
-I see.
-That's cool.

1634
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,380
I just need three minutes.

1635
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,115
She made two dim sum.

1636
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,818
You have about five minutes left.

1637
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,853
-Chan-won?
-Yes, I'm on my way!

1638
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,722
-Please go out to the kitchen.
-I'm coming!

1639
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,923
I'm looking forward to this.

1640
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,524
Let's see how well he does.

1641
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,327
THE FISH BALLS
GO INTO THE SMALL OCTOPUS SOUP

1642
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,196
-These are too hot.
-It must be.

1643
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,397
That's hot.

1644
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,232
-Man.
-Look at the fish balls.

1645
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,469
7. THROW FISH BALLS INTO THE SOUP
AND BRING TO A BOIL

1646
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,037
-All right!
-She's steaming them now.

1647
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:12,108
The dim sum goes into the steamer
with five minutes left in the round.

1648
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,443
Tell us how everything is going.

1649
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,511
What can I try?

1650
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,979
-Please try this.
-May I do that?

1651
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:20,683
-He tries Nam-no's dish right away.
-He needs ground pepper.

1652
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,419
It's like he's making soup

1653
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,888
-for Vietnamese noodles, pho.
-Hurry up. I'm losing time.

1654
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,590
Hurry up.

1655
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,992
Let's see how well he reviews this.

1656
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,994
But your reviews became way too cliché.

1657
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,196
"It's too salty! It's too sweet!"

1658
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,098
What's it like, Chan-won?

1659
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,433
WHAT'S CHAN-WON'S REVIEW LIKE?

1660
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:39,936
Sung-ju and Jung-hwan!

1661
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,337
I'm so sorry.

1662
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,605
It's too salty!

1663
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,174
-He put in more soy sauce.
-It's too salty!

1664
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:48,210
-He put in more soy sauce.
-He uses more soy sauce!

1665
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,779
-You used too much salt before.
-No.

1666
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,213
I have the scorched rice.

1667
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,784
He hasn't added scorched rice yet.
It'll taste less salty after that.

1668
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,453
-Just soak it now.
-Put it in now.

1669
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,755
You have to let it sit.

1670
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,991
What can I try here?

1671
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,160
-It's not ready yet.
-It's not?

1672
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,095
-Try whatever she isn't done with.
-Yes.

1673
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,430
Should I try this as is?

1674
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,266
You can try it later when it's done.

1675
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,500
Try the soup.

1676
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,269
SPICY

1677
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,438
Will it make Se-dol
spring up from his seat?

1678
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,908
WHAT WILL HE SAY FOR THIS REVIEW?

1679
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,876
The small octopus has fallen,

1680
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:21,944
and it can't get up!

1681
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,880
The octopus?

1682
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,682
-The cow.
-He means the cow.

1683
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:29,318
-You mean the cow, right?
-Octopus can't get up anyway.

1684
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,687
-How can the small octopus get up?
-They travel like this.

1685
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,289
The fallen cow can't get back up.

1686
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,559
No, the fallen cow
can't get back up quite yet.

1687
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,228
His reports aren't refined yet.

1688
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,697
This one was salty,
but this one was bland.

1689
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,765
They're on different ends.

1690
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,367
That's something we always say.

1691
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,634
-Yes.
-Is that so?

1692
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,570
Please check on the situation!

1693
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,673
-Things are hectic. She uses fish sauce.
-Fish sauce?

1694
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,342
-She's adding more fish sauce.
-Sand lance sauce.

1695
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,844
You didn't add scorched rice yet, right?

1696
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,146
-I did.
-Did he add the scorched rice?

1697
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,749
HAHAHAHA… HEHEHEHE

1698
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:00,950
May I try it?

1699
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,685
Go away. You're getting me confused.

1700
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:05,755
-He told you to leave.
-Go away?

1701
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,391
-He won't even answer him.
-He ignores him.

1702
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,492
You haven't added starch, right?

1703
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,227
-No, not yet.
-He tries it once again.

1704
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:15,297
-How's Maniac Se-dol?
-What's it like?

1705
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,999
-Is it too salty?
-It's too bland!

1706
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,401
NO!

1707
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,869
THAT'S ALL?

1708
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,604
He needs to add more starch.

1709
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,907
-Can you share something else?
-It's like how he says it's too salty.

1710
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:27,243
-How are you any different?
-Say something more.

1711
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,145
Wasn't that pretty good?

1712
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,714
It wasn't so different
from how he says it's salty.

1713
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,649
It's very difficult to report from here.

1714
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,719
-How are you any different?
-How are you different from us?

1715
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,587
It's boiling over!

1716
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,523
-It's boiling over!
-It's boiling over!

1717
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:41,824
Get that with your camera!

1718
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,126
-Yes, get it with your camera.
-This is bad.

1719
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,262
The stove is down.

1720
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,496
You have under two minutes.

1721
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,265
Use the next stove over.

1722
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,100
Chan-won looks flustered.

1723
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,436
IT'S NOT EASY TO KNOW
WHEN TO STEP IN AND OUT

1724
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,704
Chan-won gets cautious,
hoping he won't bother them.

1725
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,773
Make sure you travel carefully.

1726
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,675
A minute and 30 seconds.

1727
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,546
The scorched rice soup looks too thin
to call it that soup.

1728
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,613
-You're right.
-Yes.

1729
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,616
It should look thicker.

1730
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,051
Add more starch water.

1731
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,654
He removed the Chinese cuisine flavor
as he moved it into another pot.

1732
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,322
Nam-no, that looks too thin.

1733
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,658
I have to pull them out.
Where are my tongs?

1734
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,494
FIRM AND BOUNCY

1735
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,695
TWO DIM SUM

1736
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,630
THREE SMALL OCTOPUS DIM SUM

1737
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:25,134
HE TRIES IT QUIETLY ONCE AGAIN
IN CASE THEY DEMAND ANOTHER REVIEW

1738
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,402
That's the flavor.

1739
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:27,970
It's good.

1740
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,205
What's good?

1741
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,341
The broth Chef Ji-sun
just finished making is delicious.

1742
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,777
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's the real deal.

1743
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,613
I get that it's good, but how is it good?

1744
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,548
This isn't that easy.

1745
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,017
-It's very delicious.
-Come on.

1746
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:44,453
You have nothing much to say
once you're out there.

1747
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,356
I'm sure it's delicious. And what?

1748
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,358
-Sung-ju and Jung-hwan.
-Yes?

1749
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,660
You two are amazing show hosts.

1750
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,329
All right. Forget us.

1751
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,930
-Chan-won.
-How is it good?

1752
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:55,998
Chan-won.

1753
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,434
You shouldn't have messed with Jung-hwan.

1754
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,072
You have 40 seconds left.

1755
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,508
Nam-no's dish was excellent!

1756
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,244
-Of course. But how?
-But how?

1757
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,378
Thirty seconds

1758
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:12,114
-It's exceptionally delicious.
-Exceptionally delicious?

1759
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,349
You have to finish up.

1760
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:14,750
I'm about to cry.

1761
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,585
THE TIME IS TICKING DOWN
TOWARD THE END OF THE OCTOPUS GAME

1762
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:19,989
SHE CUTS OFF THE BOTTOM PART

1763
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:23,726
AND PLACES THREE DIM SUM
ON A PLATE!

1764
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:24,994
Thirty seconds!

1765
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,763
-It's exceptionally delicious.
-Exceptionally delicious?

1766
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,031
You must finish up now.

1767
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,267
-Twenty-three seconds.
-Twenty seconds.

1768
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,603
Nam-no is almost done.

1769
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,472
She's pouring broth over the dim sum.

1770
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,641
-That looks good.
-The broth looks good.

1771
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,776
Ji-sun is almost done too.

1772
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,379
-Who'll end first?
-She rings the bell.

1773
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,446
She's done.

1774
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,682
Nam-no is done too.

1775
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,317
HIS DISHEARTENED BACK

1776
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,053
Chan-won didn't do much
before he returned.

1777
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,355
He just said two things.

1778
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:56,091
He said the food was salty and bland.
Nothing else to it.

1779
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,727
-That was all.
-It's not easy to be out there.

1780
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:00,996
-We're all done.
-All done.

1781
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:04,033
-Great work.
-Great work.

1782
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,701
I had high expectations.

1783
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:11,774
The small octopus dishes
for Se-dol are finished.

1784
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,109
Great work, chefs.

1785
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:17,246
You look a bit happier
than Sung-jun and Poong's round.

1786
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,448
Not only do I like small octopus,

1787
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:22,518
-but the way they cooked felt reassuring.
-Reassuring.

1788
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,322
The previous round
must've seemed nerve-racking.

1789
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,157
All right, then.

1790
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,326
This was the octopus game,
Se-dol's favorite ingredient.

1791
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,661
Chef Ji-sun made dim sum,

1792
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,663
so please try those first.

1793
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,533
DIM SUM MADE WITH TOFU FILLING
IN SMALL OCTOPUS HEADS

1794
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,469
SERVED WITH LOTS OF SOUP

1795
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:45,941
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S OCTOPUS DIM SUM

1796
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:48,177
Should I cut it
or should I eat the whole thing?

1797
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,879
-If you can eat it whole, please try it.
-If you can.

1798
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,448
But those are kind of big.

1799
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,515
Will it fit?

1800
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,318
-Only if you can do it.
-Cut it up.

1801
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,920
-Isn't it too big?
-It's too big, right?

1802
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,455
He's going to eat it.

1803
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,057
Se-dol did it! My gosh.

1804
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,693
-He had a big mouth.
-Isn't it hot?

1805
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,462
He puts it in one bite.

1806
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,697
-And he likes this ingredient.
-He enjoys it a lot.

1807
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,032
Is it too tough?

1808
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,101
The small octopus head
may have become too tough.

1809
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,338
It's a bit…

1810
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,607
-It's a bit?
-It's a bit?

1811
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,143
He doesn't give a positive response.

1812
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,380
-If it's tough, it's tough.
-He's honest.

1813
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,949
-Try some soup too.
-Yes.

1814
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,017
-The soup.
-It might be tough.

1815
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,252
She didn't use your wife's broth.

1816
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,154
He has to be the judge of that too.

1817
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,189
I think the dried laver was the key.

1818
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,659
Tell us what it's like.

1819
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,460
No, I… Goodness, what a shame.

1820
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,830
Honestly speaking,

1821
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:44,967
-I'm too busy enjoying this.
-You're too busy?

1822
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,669
-It must be good.
-It must be.

1823
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,037
That's amazing.

1824
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,073
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1825
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,809
-It's not something I've had before.
-No?

1826
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,578
I'm the type who doesn't like new dishes.

1827
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,380
-Yes, they seem unfamiliar.
-Yes.

1828
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,049
However,

1829
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,450
this is good.

1830
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,052
-He said it was good.
-He's serious.

1831
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:06,722
I was really worried
when I saw you chop the pineapple.

1832
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:09,658
But it's not so bad.

1833
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,060
Does it taste a bit sweet?

1834
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,995
It's not that noticeable.

1835
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:15,764
-It's not.
-Even Se-dol likes subtle sweetness.

1836
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,701
You can either cut it or eat it whole.

1837
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,302
A BITE, TWO BITES

1838
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,971
-What about the soup?
-He's enjoying it a lot.

1839
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,708
I'm not sure how
I'm supposed to express this.

1840
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,043
-It's…
-Tell us.

1841
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,645
It's good.

1842
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:32,281
But how am I supposed to explain this?

1843
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,317
You said you'd spring up
if you thought something was good.

1844
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,686
-Right.
-Will you moo?

1845
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,688
-Did it make you spring up?
-It's…

1846
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,791
-Will you moo?
-Did it make you spring up?

1847
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,627
I should decide after trying this.

1848
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,030
I have to try that one too.

1849
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:51,800
All right. The next dish is Maniac Se-dol.

1850
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,904
THICK SEAFOOD SOUP IN AN EARTHEN POT

1851
01:12:56,972 --> 01:13:01,577
LARGE PIECES OF SCORCHED RICE,
SEAFOOD BALL, AND OCTOPUS LEGS

1852
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:06,248
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S MANIAC SE-DOL

1853
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:07,983
Maniac Se-dol.

1854
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,818
-How do I eat this?
-What is it, Nam-no?

1855
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,987
-What is it?
-I wanted to serve it.

1856
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,055
Yes, please.

1857
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:16,024
This sort of kindness
may impact the result.

1858
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:19,828
-Please try this and this.
-He's just serving it.

1859
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,131
Why don't you feed him too?

1860
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,465
SHALL I?

1861
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,000
You can even chew it for him.

1862
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,237
-That's kind of gross.
-Like when he was a baby.

1863
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,304
So?

1864
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,739
HE HAS A BITE OF THE SCORCHED RICE!

1865
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:35,043
Chef Nam-no
also didn't use your wife's broth.

1866
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,079
It looks nice in that earthen pot.

1867
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,347
It does.

1868
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,182
-It looks warm.
-Yes.

1869
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,918
-Yes? A little?
-He tries the octopus leg.

1870
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,486
Just now, it was the head.

1871
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,855
He must love small octopus.

1872
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,023
So?

1873
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,293
He doesn't say anything.

1874
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,163
-Is this a fish ball?
-Yes, a fish ball.

1875
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:56,799
-I made them with rockfish and shrimp.
-Rockfish and shrimp?

1876
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:57,866
It's a fish ball.

1877
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,835
-He seems to enjoy it.
-It sounds good.

1878
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,271
He must love small octopus a lot.

1879
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,605
SAVORING

1880
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:05,641
What is it?

1881
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,342
First of all, it's very delicious.

1882
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:08,877
That looks so good.

1883
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,480
-The fish balls are delicious.
-The fish balls are good.

1884
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,182
-Isn't it too salty?
-Not at all.

1885
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,150
-It's not too salty.
-Is the octopus too tough?

1886
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,418
No, it's fine.

1887
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,986
I like how it's cooked.

1888
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,489
-He likes how it's cooked.
-He likes it.

1889
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,691
-But honestly speaking…
-Yes?

1890
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,293
-He'll be honest.
-An honest take.

1891
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,861
-The scorched rice…
-The scorched rice?

1892
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:27,596
-He speaks out.
-The scorched rice?

1893
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,998
-…wasn't so necessary.
-It wasn't necessary!

1894
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:31,800
A BOLT OUT OF THE BLUE

1895
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:32,868
Just the seafood soup, then?

1896
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,237
You should've just served the fish balls.

1897
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,440
-That's not good.
-The scorched rice doesn't go too well.

1898
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,477
ANXIETY METER

1899
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:44,179
He's set on this.
He doesn't like anything deep-fried.

1900
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:47,749
-Yes, you're right.
-Why did he deep-fry the scorched rice?

1901
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:50,486
Let me try this again.

1902
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,720
He goes back to the dim sum.

1903
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,288
-The soup is important.
-He's very sensitive.

1904
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,057
He keeps trying the soup.

1905
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:58,861
When will you spring to your feet?

1906
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,763
I don't think it was that good.

1907
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:02,831
I think I lost the timing.

1908
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,102
-I lost it by a little bit.
-I see.

1909
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,973
And now, Chef Ji-sun's octopus dish.

1910
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,476
SLURP

1911
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,979
It tastes like the sauce

1912
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,815
for assorted stir-fried seafood and rice
in Chinese cuisine.

1913
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,783
That's what the sauce tastes like.

1914
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,253
It's just like that sauce.

1915
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:27,623
-It's spicy too.
-It's spicy and tastes like seafood.

1916
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,057
The dried laver.

1917
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,693
Is it because she made dim sum?
Putting dried laver inside is

1918
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,428
something quite unexpected.

1919
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:37,032
But I thought that became
a very unique touch for this dish.

1920
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:40,669
And the pear adds nice texture

1921
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,372
and gives it a wonderful touch.

1922
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:47,509
Next, Chef Nam-no's dish.

1923
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,849
It smells like the streets of Taiwan.
Why is that?

1924
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,784
It's the pho sauce.

1925
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,786
It tastes like Southeast Asia.

1926
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,122
Southeast-no.

1927
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,424
It smells like Southeast Asia,

1928
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,427
but the earthy flavor of scorched rice

1929
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,296
hits you pretty hard.

1930
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,197
I like the scorched rice.

1931
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,299
You do?

1932
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,635
-It's your preference.
-There's a difference.

1933
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,138
It tastes refreshing yet earthy,

1934
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:18,006
thanks to the scorched rice.

1935
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,675
When he first took a bite,

1936
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:24,179
it might have felt too hard
because it was just fried.

1937
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,148
But it got soggy after a while,

1938
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:29,318
so it became much better
when it got mixed with the soup.

1939
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,787
He's saying it'll taste better now.

1940
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,255
Try everything together.

1941
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,159
The octopus Chef Ji-sun made was

1942
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,827
not tough at all.

1943
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,829
But it still kept the texture going.

1944
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,665
However, this dish is much softer
and easier to chew.

1945
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:47,102
I think the decision will
only depend on his preference.

1946
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,738
And now, it's time to make your choice.

1947
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:51,540
It's either one or two.

1948
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,542
Press one for Jung Ji-sun,

1949
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,043
and press two for Yoon Nam-no.

1950
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,578
Please make your decision.

1951
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,213
And press the button.

1952
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,750
He's doing his best to hide it.

1953
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,719
We'll find out in ten seconds anyway.

1954
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,420
That was literally a secret ballot.

1955
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,522
Of course, I should try hard.

1956
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:08,824
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN AGAINST HIM

1957
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,891
Turn around.

1958
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,860
Let's find out the result.

1959
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,862
Which side did he choose?

1960
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:16,131
That was the octopus round.

1961
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,067
Ji-sun has won all three rounds
she fought in.

1962
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:22,070
Will Nam-no be able to seize his victory?

1963
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,940
Who did Se-dol choose?

1964
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,509
Which octopus did he like better?

1965
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:29,344
Who's the winner?

1966
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,780
Who's the winner?

1967
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,749
WHO WON THE OCTOPUS ROUND?

1968
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,250
Who's the winner?

1969
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,318
JUNG JI-SUN WINS

1970
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,953
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S
OCTOPUS DIM SUM WINS

1971
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,988
Jung Ji-sun!

1972
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,290
-My gosh.
-Ji-sun wins!

1973
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,693
Ji-sun wins four times in a row.

1974
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,929
I don't mean that
Chef Nam-no's dish was bad.

1975
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,865
This was perfect for my appetite.

1976
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,668
-I just liked it better.
-It's not that he lacked anything.

1977
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:57,005
You thought Chef Ji-sun
understood your appetite a little better.

1978
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:01,009
And I rarely ever eat pineapples.

1979
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:04,346
<i>But it didn't seem too odd</i>
<i>when I had everything together.</i>

1980
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,581
You got to experience something new today.

1981
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,617
Her winning streak continues.

1982
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,719
-She won all four rounds.
-She won all four times.

1983
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,287
Let's hear from her.

1984
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,857
When these young chefs challenge me,

1985
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,225
teaching them a good lesson will

1986
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,262
bring back the natural order
back to the world of culinary arts.

1987
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,030
<i>All these younger chefs got a lesson.</i>

1988
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:24,700
-She's here to bring order.
-She is.

1989
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,334
Please put a star on her.

1990
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:28,503
JUNG JI-SUN TAKES HER 4TH STAR

1991
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,938
Congratulations!

1992
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,106
Congratulations!

1993
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:33,675
WHO'LL BREAK HER WINNING STREAK?

1994
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,344
I feel the thrill whenever I cook.

1995
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:38,013
Try it on behalf of our viewers.

1996
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,781
That wasn't even a bite.

1997
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:41,316
I'm full right now.

1998
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,018
Se-dol and I share nothing in common!

1999
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,787
-How come you two came together?
-Tell me about it.

2000
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,090
This is their first fight.

2001
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,325
I knew it.

2002
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,526
All righty!

2003
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:52,861
What are you up to?

2004
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:55,063
-He's bothering him.
-Go away.

2005
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,332
HYUN-SUK IS IN A BIG CRISIS

2006
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,101
This is the Chinese cuisine return match.

2007
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,369
<i>I'll think of him as my teacher</i>
<i>and do my best.</i>

2008
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,705
<i>I'll gladly accept him.</i>

2009
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:05,874
Tae-hun, are you watching this?

2010
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,143
EXPLODING AND ON FIRE

2011
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,244
It's a fire show!

2012
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,846
I'll let Se-dol try it.

2013
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,247
How is it?

2014
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,282
-This is awesome.
-He finally learned how good sugar is.

2015
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,350
What do you think?

2016
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,552
My gosh. This is the real thing.

2017
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:18,887
WHAT'S THE REAL THING?

2018
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:22,991
My wife is probably watching, right?

2019
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,860
My dear, I've grown.

2020
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,995
If anyone is particular about food,
they have to be here.

2021
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:28,764
Yes, you're right.

2022
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:42,978
