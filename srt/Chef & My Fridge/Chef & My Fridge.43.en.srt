PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,251
Please welcome,
Jo Woo-jin and Park Ji-hwan!

3
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:21,654
<i>Boss</i> is scheduled
to premiere on October 3rd.

4
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,324
You were taught
by Chef Park Eun-yeong for this film.

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,159
It's been a while
since I've seen my teacher.

6
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,994
Has it been six or seven years?

7
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,697
He called his wife, "My lady."

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,566
I want to surprise her.

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,002
This is so much fun.
How does it look, honey?

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,138
He's shaping crispy bulgogi
into a heart shape.

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,939
How did this turn out so classy?

12
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,008
Jung Ho-young wins.

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,711
Who will he choose
between his teacher and his family?

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,646
AT A LOSS BECAUSE OF THE AMAZING DISHES

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,547
What am I going to do?

16
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,082
He hit the bull's eye of my taste.

17
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,651
Son Jong-won wins!

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,053
He chooses his family.

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,320
HOW WILL THE ROUNDS GO TODAY?

20
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,725
We're with the final boss-level actors,
Jo Woo-jin and Park Ji-hwan.

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,728
Ji-hwan is an actor
who grossed 40 million viewers.

22
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,863
He starred in all four films
of <i>The Roundup</i> franchise.

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,998
Why do you think it's just me?

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,600
<i>His character in the franchise,</i>
<i>Jang Yi-soo, became a favorite…</i>

25
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,769
-It wasn't me.
-<i>…for many film fans.</i>

26
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,205
Don't come near me.

27
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,543
We all thought you died
in the first series, <i>The Outlaws,</i>

28
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,379
<i>but you kept coming back</i>
<i>in the second, third, and the fourth film.</i>

29
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,148
I'm sure the production company
also thought

30
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,917
you were a big box office draw.

31
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,453
Actually, before the production began
for the second film,

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,787
I went to say goodbye to Don Lee

33
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,923
-because my character already died.
-Yes, you did.

34
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,357
So I went to root for him,

35
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,927
-and he said, "You didn't die."
-You didn't.

36
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,697
He said, "You didn't die.
You lived. He missed the attack."

37
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,499
"So let's do Two together."

38
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,733
I said, "Would that work?"

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,870
He replied, "It's fine.
We can just say you lived."

40
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,241
You must've been significant
if he had to bring you back.

41
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,442
-He must've been.
-Right?

42
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,611
We received a report from Nam-no.

43
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:55,615
"Ji-hwan has a secret doppelgänger."
What do you mean?

44
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,318
I meant Tae-hun,
who's sitting right next to me.

45
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,487
-Tae-hun?
-They look alike.

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,255
INTRIGUED

47
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,757
-He looks like Jang Yi-soo?
-I can see it.

48
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,160
-I can see the similarity.
-There is.

49
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,062
Do you get that a lot, Tae-hun?

50
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,731
My staff at the restaurant would
see me and say something like,

51
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,201
"Mr. Lim, you look like Jang Yi-soo."

52
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,470
-I see.
-They said I could be in the film for you.

53
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,739
I can see the resemblance.

54
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,041
-The overall vibe seems similar.
-You're right.

55
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,143
I can see it.

56
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,277
You're the same type.

57
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,213
Why don't we compare them
in the split-screen mode?

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,516
-In split screen?
-It's an honor.

59
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,918
-Let's see if they look alike.
-It's an honor.

60
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,421
LET'S SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN

61
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,159
We need you two to look straight ahead.

62
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,396
-There's a resemblance.
-There is.

63
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,465
It's like meeting a relative
in the holidays.

64
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,367
You're right. There's a resemblance.

65
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,235
<i>I can see it in their mouths.</i>

66
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,337
<i>-Their noses too.</i>
<i>-Their brows are similar.</i>

67
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,972
<i>Their brows?</i>

68
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,476
He looked like Wi Ha-jun,
but he was the older version.

69
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,679
And he looks like Jang Yi-soo,
but the overcooked version.

70
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,315
He's been cooked for too long.

71
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,984
-Don't say that, Hyun-suk!
-He's a person!

72
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,220
How can you say
a person was overcooked? Come on!

73
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,922
Don't you think that was too much?

74
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,957
-Yes, he's been caramelized.
-It's the gist of it.

75
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,293
-That was an analogy as a chef.
-It's the chef jargon.

76
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,861
-It's his jargon.
-It's his expertise.

77
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,430
I was involved in theater in the past.

78
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,565
-Really?
-Theater?

79
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,601
It was in my Catholic church
through middle and high school.

80
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,136
It's just an extracurricular activity.

81
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,338
We'd get together every weekend,
read the script,

82
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,307
and get in the character's emotions.

83
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,741
Here's what's funny, though.

84
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,111
-I always played the villain.
-Not the good guy?

85
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,681
It looks like he had a passion for acting.

86
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,751
Tae-hun, are you willing to perform
if someone casts you as his twin?

87
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,054
-Yes, no questions asked.
-You will?

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,889
You can play Ji-hwan's twin brother.

89
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,557
I'd love to play that part.

90
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,259
I'll try to make it happen.

91
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,561
CAN IT REALLY HAPPEN?

92
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,462
Thank you.

93
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,632
-I just had an inspiration.
-Really?

94
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,501
You'll make a recommendation,
but it's not a casting call yet, right?

95
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,936
No, I'll bring him in right away.

96
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,504
-Are you serious?
-Can you do that?

97
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,440
-I'll try.
-Will you make your debut?

98
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,575
He's not saying it just to be polite.

99
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,844
-He's not just being polite?
-No.

100
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,614
-Thank you.
-Good for you, Tae-hun!

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,983
That's that, but there's something else

102
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,318
-he's been getting a lot lately.
-What is it?

103
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,854
That his looks aren't the same as before.

104
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,291
-He looks way too handsome now.
-I can see that.

105
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,994
-I lost some weight after jogging.
-He shed some weight.

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,962
-He looks a lot sharper than before.
-We…

107
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,098
We've met before at a marathon.

108
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,099
-You met?
-At the marathon?

109
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:30,503
I met him at the JTBC marathon
and said hello to him.

110
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,338
Why were you there?

111
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,840
I went to run the marathon.

112
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,542
-Really?
-Are you serious?

113
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,078
I've been training.
I ran 5 km this morning too.

114
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,179
-My gosh.
-You did?

115
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,015
I knew he had shed some weight.

116
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,816
-He didn't.
-Yeah, he did.

117
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:44,884
How far do you run?

118
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,753
I ran 26 km yesterday.

119
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,021
You ran 26 km?

120
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,890
You ran 26 km? That's a half marathon.

121
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,158
THE SECRET TO HIS HANDSOMENESS

122
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,193
-Do you run every day, Ho-young?
-Yes.

123
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,429
I run about 160 km a month.

124
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,666
He runs 5 km and eats 5 kg of food.
That's how he stays consistent.

125
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,702
-It works up my appetite.
-Of course, after a workout.

126
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,837
Are you making sure
you continue to look the same?

127
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,140
I thought I've become
more good-looking recently.

128
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,041
No?

129
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,511
He asked me
if he looked a bit more handsome,

130
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,979
so I told him he was still safe.

131
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,850
-He's still safe.
-Since he eats twice as much.

132
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,353
As soon as he said that,

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,156
he knew what he said was funny, right?

134
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,557
FLINCH

135
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,960
There's this face he makes
when he holds his laughter.

136
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,664
-My wife and I love that face.
-I see.

137
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:35,501
There's a face he makes
when he knows what he said was funny.

138
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,136
He looks pleased.

139
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,005
-It's this face.
-That face.

140
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,074
Doesn't he look like a fennec fox?

141
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,811
THEY'RE ALSO LOOK-ALIKES

142
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,713
While we're on the subject of look-alikes,

143
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,684
we have to bring up Woo-jin's look-alike.

144
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,654
<i>-It's Kim Byong-chul, the actor.</i>
<i>-You're right.</i>

145
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,491
-Some people get you and him confused,
-That's right.

146
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,094
and some of our chefs
also got you two confused.

147
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,330
When we told them that
our next guest was Woo-jin, they said,

148
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,467
"I know that guy.
The catastrophe guy from <i>Guardian</i>!"

149
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,068
"That guy, right?"

150
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,904
<i>There were so many people</i>
<i>who said that to me,</i>

151
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,172
<i>and this would happen too.</i>

152
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,941
People go, "It's Kim Byong-chul!"

153
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,509
At times, I even do that for them.

154
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,144
I don't go, "Hello."

155
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,812
I go, "This will be a catastrophe."

156
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,482
-I just do the line for them.
-That line?

157
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,583
Intentionally.

158
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,319
-I've even said the line.
-I see.

159
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,488
Then people go, "You're so great!"

160
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,423
EVERYONE IS HAPPY(?)

161
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,291
You just let it slide.

162
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,326
All right, then.

163
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,696
It's time
to look through Ji-hwan's fridge.

164
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,898
Is this your family fridge?

165
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,701
With my wife and a 5-year-old boy.

166
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,202
I see.

167
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,138
He has a lot of ingredients
outside as well,

168
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,373
so that's already quite a difference.

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,177
I'm also happy to see that
he brought a bigger fridge.

170
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,781
Do you use the fridge often?

171
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,649
I don't have a huge share in it.

172
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,385
My wife is a really good cook.

173
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,087
-She is?
-Yes, she is.

174
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,456
So when I crave something,
she magically makes it happen.

175
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,360
I try to stay away from eating out
because she's such a good cook.

176
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,430
-She must be quick and good.
-There's no need to go out.

177
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,864
JEALOUS

178
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,334
Let's see what Ji-hwan eats at home.

179
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,603
-We present his fridge!
-His fridge!

180
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,274
AMAZED

181
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,680
-Everything looks neat.
-That's more than plenty.

182
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,982
Everything is spread out evenly.

183
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,218
First of all, the side dishes.

184
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,354
-Everything is lined up.
-Yes.

185
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,557
"Stir-fried pollack skin."

186
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,292
-What's this?
-"Stir-fried pollack skin"?

187
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,693
I think it's white kimchi.

188
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,161
Seasoned mushroom.

189
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,096
-Kimchi.
-"Sweet potato stem kimchi."

190
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,165
That must be good.
It's in season right now.

191
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,934
This is stir-fried eggplant.

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,535
-Stir-fried peppers.
-Typical homemade dishes.

193
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,703
Black garlic.

194
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,907
And there are all kinds of kimchi
all the way in the back.

195
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,577
Did your wife make everything?

196
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,846
-My mother-in-law did.
-His mother-in-law.

197
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,848
These are from your mother-in-law?

198
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,951
She often makes them and gives them to us.

199
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,954
But my wife mostly recreates main dishes.

200
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,324
I guess her talent is from her mother.

201
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,493
-She's from Mokpo.
-I see.

202
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,228
She must be a good cook.

203
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,697
-Her daughter must've learned well.
-You're right.

204
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,999
Now, what's this on the second shelf?

205
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,001
It must be for your health.

206
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,971
Marsh snail. Marsh snail juice, actually.

207
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,206
-Marsh snail juice.
-Marsh snail juice?

208
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,041
Isn't that good for your liver?

209
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,543
What's marsh snail juice?

210
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,445
-Doesn't it taste strong?
-It does.

211
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,581
That's the only health supplement I use.

212
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,316
It's marsh snail juice for me.

213
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,485
-I've been having it for six years now.
-Six years?

214
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,787
-Yes.
-Is that the secret to your looks?

215
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,656
It helped me a lot.

216
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,993
-What's it good for?
-First off, it boosts your immunity.

217
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,862
I also have dry eyes and poor eyesight,

218
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,831
and it helped with those.

219
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,066
-It's also good for your liver.
-I see.

220
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,003
I drink a pouch when I become forgetful,

221
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,070
then I remember again.

222
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,573
-It helps with your memories?
-It sounds like a cure-all.

223
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,275
-Your memories?
-With remembering?

224
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,211
There are times when I feel frustrated
and my acting isn't quite working,

225
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,146
and when I drink some of that juice,

226
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,181
I can suddenly act out the scene.

227
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,651
-Let's have one each.
-I need one.

228
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,386
It sounds like the best medicine.

229
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,954
-It's a cure-all.
-It sounds like it.

230
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,590
It must also be good
for those who're studying for exams.

231
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,826
-When I was broke,
-Yes? Did you get money?

232
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,162
-I drank that and even got paid.
-You got paid?

233
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,897
-I even got paid.
-You got paid?

234
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,899
-That's so effective.
-Even money?

235
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,102
-It's a funny little thing for me.
-It's like your lucky charm.

236
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,804
He must be into shamanism…

237
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,740
-Let's take some.
-Faith in marsh snail juice.

238
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,210
-There are seven pouches here.
-May we have some?

239
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,912
-You can have some.
-He's intrigued.

240
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,681
He's intrigued with the juice.

241
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,318
-The long-distance dad should have one.
-You should have some.

242
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't take us the wrong way.
This isn't a medical program.

243
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,122
We aren't sponsored, either.

244
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,090
He'll try some first.

245
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,726
My doctor who does my checkups once asked,

246
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,662
"What in the world do you eat each year

247
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,698
to rejuvenate your organs?"

248
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,000
-His organs got younger?
-Even your organs?

249
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,269
-It sounds like great medicine.
-That actually happened?

250
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,570
It sounds like a religion.

251
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,839
I mentioned this,
and my doctor ordered it right away.

252
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,108
-I should get some.
-Should I order some too?

253
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,211
This is for the long-distance dad.
But look at this color.

254
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,380
It's the color of marsh snails.

255
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,716
-You should have some.
-Thank you.

256
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,117
Why are you opening that? For you?

257
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,654
I'm working hard by myself too.

258
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,890
-It'll help you host the show better.
-Will it really?

259
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,492
-Is it that good?
-Of course.

260
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,160
It's a cure-all.

261
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,163
-It makes you walk faster too.
-Even your walk?

262
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,466
-It makes you walk faster?
-And you can run better.

263
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,467
-Really?
-It's the best medicine.

264
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,136
Ji-hwan is slowly turning
into a snake oil salesman.

265
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,005
He said I can host the show better.

266
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,440
Let's say "marsh snail" in three.
One, two, three.

267
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,441
-Marsh snail.
-Marsh snail.

268
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,609
A TOAST TO MARSH SNAILS

269
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,012
This smells strong.

270
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,680
-It is.
-I know what this smells like.

271
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,650
People used to sell boiled marsh snails
in front of schools as a snack.

272
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,619
-It smells just like that soup.
-How's the taste?

273
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,554
Does it taste okay?

274
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,957
-He finished it.
-Look at him.

275
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,959
It tastes healthy.

276
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,694
What's it like?

277
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,429
-We call it marsh snail poop.
-The innards?

278
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,033
-It tastes a lot like the innards.
-The bitterness.

279
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,334
Can they use it to cook?

280
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,336
-You can use everything.
-Someone can use this.

281
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,872
You can use it to cook,
but it smells a bit strong.

282
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,042
I already feel like
my tongue is sliding more smoothly.

283
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,310
-My pronunciation is better.
-It's already better.

284
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,712
It's working right away?

285
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,947
-I suddenly want to play soccer.
-You do?

286
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,450
Should I return to the field?

287
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,419
It'll be amazing
if he returns to the field.

288
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,587
What if he really returns as a player?

289
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,589
-I found cheese.
-Cheese.

290
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,291
Look at all the cheeses.

291
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,960
There are all kinds of cheese in the box.

292
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,295
How are these used?

293
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,932
My son loves the pasta my wife makes,

294
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,367
so she uses it to make that.

295
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,970
-I see some pasta at room temperature.
-He has some pasta here.

296
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,572
-There's penne.
-Yes.

297
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,774
-Does she make Western cuisine too?
-Yes.

298
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,644
Well, she can do everything,
Japanese, Western, Indian, and more.

299
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,312
-Indian?
-Indian?

300
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,980
I found curry.

301
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,117
Curry is one of my favorite dishes.

302
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,152
-I see. Do you like curry?
-Curry?

303
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,922
If I had to eat
only one dish before I died,

304
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,092
I'd choose curry,
white rice, and dried laver.

305
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,593
-I see.
-Dried laver.

306
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,095
-He has some laver here.
-Yes.

307
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,230
You should have marsh snail juice, though.

308
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,934
No, because that way, I wouldn't die.

309
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,936
-You won't?
-He won't die.

310
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,072
-He has so much faith in them.
-You can live forever with that juice.

311
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,441
You can't die if you drink that juice.

312
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,578
Jang Yi-soo came back after <i>The Outlaws</i>
because of marsh snail juice.

313
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,979
THAT WAS HOW HE CAME BACK?

314
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,281
You're right! That's how he came back!

315
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,051
-Don said, "You had it? Come back."
-I see!

316
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,986
Everything is making sense.

317
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,688
He has the traditional-style laver.

318
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,491
I actually prefer the kind of laver

319
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,428
that are coated sesame or perilla oil
and grilled on the spot.

320
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,696
I love that.

321
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,698
You can get that at marketplaces.

322
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,633
-Look at the vegetables.
-The veggies.

323
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,902
-You must love veggies.
-It's like a grassy field.

324
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,771
I really love vegetables.

325
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:55,741
-There are so many mushrooms!
-These are different kinds of mushrooms!

326
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,743
-You have so many of them!
-There are so many!

327
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,612
-And the wood ear!
-He has wood ears too.

328
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,080
Wood ear. Button mushroom.

329
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,815
-He has so many mushrooms.
-Enoki.

330
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,085
I'll always choose mushrooms
if I had to choose between that and meat.

331
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,920
-Really?
-He loves mushrooms.

332
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,289
-That's why he's so healthy.
-Yes.

333
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,691
Let's look at the freezer.

334
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,394
-I see a lot of food. This is lamb.
-Yes.

335
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,263
I found some lamb.

336
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,265
A whole chicken. Look at that.

337
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,866
It's for <i>samgyetang,</i> chicken soup.

338
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,604
There are times when I leave home
and drive or camp alone

339
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,640
to go to my little hideout.

340
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,342
I make something called gar-ken porridge.

341
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,512
<i>I only use</i>
<i>garlic, salt, and chicken to make it.</i>

342
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,915
-That's why it's gar-ken.
-Gar-ken porridge.

343
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,050
That turns into a delicious dish.

344
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,652
It's hard to fail.

345
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,621
I saw you only using scissors to cook
instead of a knife.

346
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,657
<i>It's the easiest and fastest way,</i>

347
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,660
<i>so I prefer to cut everything</i>
<i>with scissors and finishing quickly.</i>

348
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,028
<i>So you don't use a knife.</i>

349
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,397
I found a shelf of seafood.

350
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,466
Some seafood. There are lots of oysters.

351
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,635
-Blue crabs are prepared for use.
-Yes.

352
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,004
Do you also like seafood along with meat?

353
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,741
If I had to choose between sea and land,
I'd choose the sea,

354
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,911
except for mushrooms and marsh snails.

355
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,179
But mushrooms and marsh snails?

356
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,649
He's sticking around on land
because of mushrooms and marsh snails.

357
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,852
He seems to have a certain kind of palate,

358
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,387
and he's highly concerned
about his health.

359
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,389
That was all for Ji-hwan's fridge!

360
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,891
FINISHED CHECKING JI-HWAN'S FRIDGE

361
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,430
I wonder what kind of dishes
Ji-hwan is looking to eat today.

362
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,198
Let's find out his orders.

363
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,166
Please show us.

364
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,068
What does Ji-hwan want to eat?

365
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,237
It's not made with a knife!

366
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,873
-It's not made with a knife!
-We can't use knives?

367
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,276
-Only use scissors.
-Only use scissors?

368
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,411
-That's tough.
-Can you elaborate?

369
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:44,183
I want to see you make something

370
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,920
-only by using a pair of scissors.
-That sounds tough.

371
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:48,921
Can it happen?

372
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,656
-It sounds hard.
-Can they do it with scissors?

373
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,591
What's the next order?

374
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,294
The best dish of the Mushroom Gang.

375
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,163
-This is good.
-He wants you to use mushrooms.

376
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,966
I want to taste
the most delicious mushroom dish

377
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,002
made by the best chefs.

378
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,837
I'll never get another chance

379
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,740
to eat mushroom dishes
like I would anywhere else.

380
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,009
-Yes, he loves mushrooms.
-That sounds good.

381
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,179
Hyun-suk, Tae-hun,
Nam-no, and Sung-jun remain.

382
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,850
-Can Tae-hun go first as a doppelgänger?
-Can he?

383
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:22,321
-I can't make Chinese food with scissors.
-It must be hard.

384
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,857
I better choose the Mushroom Gang dish.

385
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,525
Is Chinese difficult without a knife?

386
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,427
Our knife is the key.

387
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,229
You have to chop a lot.

388
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:35,100
Western cuisine requires
more delicate cuts than Chinese food.

389
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,236
He says your cuts aren't delicate.

390
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,071
-Yours is like a hammer.
-Is that so?

391
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,708
But I want to show you that
you can make a classy dish with scissors.

392
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,476
I'll do the scissors round.

393
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,445
Don't go the harder way.

394
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,447
I will take the path less chosen.

395
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,982
I knew it.

396
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,986
But today, I might face
yet another challenge against myself.

397
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:54,987
Let's do this.

398
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,488
-He's a bit…
-Listen to him

399
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,724
-He's an expert at bluffing.
-I want to…

400
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,926
He called out your bluff right away.

401
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,728
Only an expert like him can do it.

402
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,797
-He's an expert chef.
-You're right.

403
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,799
Hyun-suk chooses the tough road.

404
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,602
I'm also another person
who always chooses the path less traveled.

405
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,871
-Of course.
-Yes, he has the same character.

406
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,507
-You two can travel that way.
-Take that path of thorns.

407
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,643
So Nam-no will make a mushroom dish.

408
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,878
The matches have been decided.

409
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,548
"It's not made with a knife"
won't be an easy round,

410
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,818
but let the round
between Hyun-suk and Sung-jun begin!

411
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,252
It's not made with a knife!

412
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,154
It sounds fun.

413
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:33,325
<i>This is the first cook-off round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Ji-hwan's fridge.</i>

414
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,661
It's not made with a knife.

415
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,297
I can't say it right.

416
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,198
Can you do it again?

417
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,300
It's not made with a knife!

418
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,801
-Only use scissors!
-Only scissors!

419
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,972
The big boss of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>

420
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,607
Chef Hyun-suk is in this round,

421
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,544
as well as the baby boss, Chef Sung-jun.

422
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,313
It's the new versus old.

423
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,984
In the beginning of the season,
he claimed that he was Baby Hyun-suk

424
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,721
<i>and announced he'll take the path</i>
<i>Hyun-suk has traveled.</i>

425
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,223
But during the season,

426
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,925
he left Hyun-suk's side.

427
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,093
He did.

428
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,096
I wouldn't say I left.
It's just a short break.

429
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,831
-He changed sides.
-He switched.

430
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,633
So you're looking into others?

431
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,370
Life is all about associating
with the right people.

432
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,506
I've been keeping my eyes out there,

433
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,375
wondering who I should associate with.

434
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,211
Hyun-suk must've been
quite disappointed in Sung-jun.

435
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,647
He said, "How can he do this to me?"

436
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,217
-You even shed tears?
-Why?

437
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,620
He was thrilled
when Sung-jun said he looked up to him.

438
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,824
Sung-jun said he copied me
because he looked up to me,

439
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,693
but I did not see
a hint of respect in him.

440
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,364
-From Sung-jun?
-He's willing to use anyone

441
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,965
to promote himself.

442
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,000
MILK THE COW

443
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,635
He takes advantage of the hottest one,

444
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,405
but when the temperature drops,
you never know who'll be next.

445
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,340
He's completely serious.

446
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,910
-Look, he's crying.
-He's crying.

447
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,378
My goodness.

448
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,612
Well, what he said

449
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,980
is true.

450
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,550
-He won't deny it.
-It's accurate.

451
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,784
Even today,

452
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,720
I had a feeling
that Poong seemed to be doing well.

453
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,922
POONG IS PRETTY HOT THESE DAYS

454
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,925
That's why I want to copy him a bit.

455
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,526
I remember seeing him win

456
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,097
<i>when he had to cook only with scissors</i>
<i>in the previous season.</i>

457
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,064
<i>Yes, right.</i>

458
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,901
I think I can beat him
with a bit of inspiration from Poong.

459
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,004
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS:
OYSTER, MARSH SNAIL JUICE, SQUID, SHRIMP

460
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,440
FRESHWATER SNAIL MEAT, LAMB, BOK CHOY,
CARROT, PAPRIKA, NAPA CABBAGE, ETC

461
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,242
The dish I prepared is called

462
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,611
Scissors, Scissors, Boss.

463
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,079
CHEF SUNG-JUN:
SCISSORS, SCISSORS, BOSS

464
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,614
-Scissors, Scissors, Boss!
-Boss!

465
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,016
-The word boss is in the title.
-Nice touch.

466
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:43,622
I want to use oysters and make stir-fried
seafood and vegetables over rice.

467
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,291
I want to add a touch
of the marsh snail juice

468
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,760
to make it both healthy and tasty.

469
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,763
-How will that go?
-It's strong, so it'll be a nice kick.

470
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,998
And the second dish.

471
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,134
-He said he liked curry.
-He did.

472
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,105
I want to marinade lamb in curry
and deep-fry it in Chinese style.

473
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,541
-That sounds great.
-So I'll make my dish in Chinese style,

474
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,744
inspired by my teacher, Kim Poong.

475
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,647
-Go to Poong for Chinese.
-Are you sure?

476
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,884
-He's now your teacher?
-There are two Chinese chefs here.

477
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,852
My gosh. His teacher, Poong?

478
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,854
I don't care how desperate I am.

479
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,923
I do not want to be his protégé.

480
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,492
How far is Sung-jun willing to go?

481
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,495
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS: MARSH CLAM,
BLUE CRAB, OYSTER, SQUID, SHRIMP

482
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,497
MACKEREL, LAVER, BRIE, MOZZARELLA,
MILK, PENNE, CURRY POWDER, ETC

483
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,599
I'm making a dish called

484
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,502
Scissors, No Losers.

485
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,305
-Why is he acting cutesy?
-Scissors, No Losers?

486
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,340
POUTY

487
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,675
CUTESY TURN

488
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,576
SCREAMS

489
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,478
SCREAMS

490
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,913
THE PRODUCTION CREW RESISTS

491
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,347
-What?
-Don't be cutesy to us.

492
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,449
-Scissors, No Losers.
-Scissors, No Losers.

493
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,020
-Scissors.
-The actual scissors.

494
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,723
I'll make a dish I can't lose with
by using a pair of scissors.

495
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,559
There's an Italian dish called cannelloni,

496
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,828
a type of pasta
made with pipe-shaped dough.

497
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,132
-I'll make some crêpe
-Crêpe.

498
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,468
and fill it with oysters,
other seafood, and cheese.

499
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,106
I'll also make curry penne
with mackerel and shrimp.

500
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,709
-Will he have enough time?
-I wonder.

501
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,478
As always, I'm fighting against myself.

502
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,813
YOU CAN DO THIS…

503
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,248
I like adventures.

504
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,616
-Adventures.
-I knew it.

505
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,952
-Chef Hyun-suk is all about adventures.
-Take an adventure.

506
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,186
Take things far.

507
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,722
Taking away the knife from a chef
is just like asking an actor

508
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,024
-to act without talking.
-Yes.

509
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,593
-You're right.
-That's it.

510
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,896
-I want to see how that adventure goes.
-Yes, of course.

511
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,164
The winning chef

512
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,032
will receive a prize with the star.

513
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,468
The biggest talk in the town,

514
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,571
the gold-bar Spam set.

515
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,973
-I love that.
-All right.

516
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,874
Let us begin the round for Ji-hwan,

517
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,845
and his order is called,
"It's not made with a knife!"

518
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,714
-The tension is high.
-It is.

519
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,049
The sign is up for 15 minutes.

520
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,853
He does not want to lose
this scissors round today.

521
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,356
Says the big boss, Chef Choi Hyun-suk.

522
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,726
But this guy is here to destroy Hyun-suk.

523
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,162
The baby boss, Chef Kwon Sung-jun
is up against him.

524
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,833
Who'll seize the victory
without using a knife?

525
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,269
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

526
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,937
LET'S GO, SCISSORS!

527
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,240
SUNG-JUN STARTS WITH INSTANT RICE!

528
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,142
-Poong, are the knives gone?
-Yes.

529
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,778
-The knives are gone.
-He's making marsh clam broth right away.

530
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,447
He's making broth
with marsh clams and blue crabs.

531
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,949
The soup will taste amazing.

532
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,917
Butter.

533
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,319
He's making roux.

534
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,087
They cannot use a knife at all.

535
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,057
I've used only scissors to cook
in the previous season,

536
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,259
and it's all about
getting used to scissors.

537
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,327
GREEN ONION

538
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,062
HE GRABS SCISSORS!

539
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,630
-Excellent job.
-He's using scissors.

540
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,965
-Good one.
-He's good.

541
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,366
He's good with scissors.

542
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,068
-He's good with them.
-Sung-jun is doing well.

543
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,538
It looks like
Sung-jun is good with scissors.

544
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,673
Onion.

545
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,408
-He cuts an onion with scissors.
-Scissors.

546
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,077
He doesn't even hesitate.

547
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,745
-He's good.
-He's good with scissors.

548
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,514
He must use scissors to cook at home.

549
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,983
Sung-jun cuts the carrot with scissors.

550
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,118
-Look at him.
-He's so good with scissors.

551
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,953
-He's good.
-Sung-jun Scissorhands.

552
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,422
He's spinning it around.

553
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,324
-He's good.
-He's better with that than a knife.

554
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,492
Yes, you might be better off with that
than a knife.

555
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,228
-He cuts paprika with scissors!
-It's a paprika.

556
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,798
CUT IT ONCE AND SPIN IT AROUND

557
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,733
2 CUTS, 3 CUTS

558
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,901
He cuts paprika with scissors.

559
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,637
-He's good with scissors.
-He's good.

560
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,372
He's better with those than a knife.

561
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,940
Sung-jun proceeds without hesitation.

562
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,443
Is that soy milk?

563
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,311
-It's milk.
-You're right.

564
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,014
-Yes. It's milk.
-Milk and egg.

565
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,749
-He's making crêpe batter.
-Crêpe batter.

566
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,817
HE GRABS SCISSORS

567
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,852
-Now, scissors.
-He's using scissors.

568
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,254
USING THE OTHER END!

569
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,090
THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX!

570
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,092
-He uses the handle!
-It's the handle!

571
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,094
HA!

572
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,162
-Is that okay?
-This is unthinkable!

573
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,331
-My gosh.
-Is that okay?

574
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,433
He's an artist.

575
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,269
HIS BLUFFING TAKES IT TO A LEVEL OF ART

576
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,371
What a performance!

577
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,239
This is Choi Hyun-suk.

578
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,374
He uses the handle.

579
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,710
-Did you wash those?
-He did.

580
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,579
He used just the handle.

581
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,013
Is he cutting salt?

582
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,849
SHOWING OFF BY CUTTING FLOUR!

583
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,016
He's cutting flour!

584
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,520
-No, he's cutting salt!
-Did he cut it?

585
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,490
I want to see that in slow motion
to see if he cut anything.

586
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,758
I doubt it.

587
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,194
<i>He's cutting flour!</i>

588
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,329
NEVER INTENDED TO ADD IT

589
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,730
It'll become finer.

590
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,732
His show-off skills have improved.

591
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,434
UPGRADED SHOWMANSHIP

592
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,136
NEXT, STRAIN THE BATTER

593
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,972
The flour didn't get mixed at all!
I knew it.

594
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,340
He didn't have a whisk.

595
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,209
He's making crêpe.

596
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,646
I'll remember this moment for a long time.

597
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,149
I was expecting this.

598
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,251
That's penne.

599
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,219
It flew everywhere.

600
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,554
ART INCOMING

601
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,523
MUSIC START!

602
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,659
He did it like he was
using a pair of scissors.

603
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,396
<i>-Once on the right, once on the left.</i>
<i>-Like he was using a pair of scissors.</i>

604
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,633
-Hyun-suk the scissors.
-Scissors, No Losers.

605
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,967
NO SALT IS SPRINKLED BY COINCIDENCE

606
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,503
He sprinkled salt everywhere.

607
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,871
SUNG-JUN
PROCEEDS QUIETLY

608
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,941
MAKING LAMB MARINADE
WITH MINCED GINGER, COOKING WINE, SALT

609
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,276
-Cumin?
-Yes.

610
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,977
And paprika seasoning.

611
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,447
He added curry, ginger, and garlic.

612
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,783
-Sung-jun gets lamb chops as we speak.
-Lamb chops.

613
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,084
THE SCISSORS RETURN!

614
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,787
-He's cutting lamb chops with scissors.
-He cuts lamb with scissors.

615
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,491
He's making cuts
to make sure it's marinated thoroughly.

616
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,592
-Is that so?
-Yes.

617
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,861
-He's good with scissors.
-That's the main dish.

618
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,031
He's preparing lamb chops, his main dish.

619
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,133
Is that starch?
Is he coating it with starch?

620
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,534
Yes, it's starch.

621
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,703
-I think he'll deep-fry those.
-He's putting them in!

622
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,473
-The lamb chops go in!
-Coated with starch and deep-fried.

623
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,476
The oil doesn't look too hot.

624
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,544
I'll start over low heat
and raise the temperature.

625
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,647
He starts by deep-frying it over low heat.

626
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,950
Three minutes have gone by.

627
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,685
-It's too thin.
-Oh, no!

628
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,588
-The batter was too watery.
-Did it rip?

629
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,424
-I think the crêpe will rip.
-Right?

630
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,526
What's he doing?

631
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,427
What are you doing?

632
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,596
ARE YOU CRYING?

633
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,130
Shrimp tails.

634
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,133
-He looks… He's using scissors.
-Goodness.

635
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,902
His moves seem so unnatural.

636
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,637
Hyun-suk looks very troubled.

637
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,073
It looks like
Sung-jun is better with scissors.

638
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,842
-He used to be good.
-He was good before, but not anymore.

639
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,778
-My gosh!
-Sung-jun Scissorhands!

640
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,415
THE BOSS OF SCISSORS IS HERE!

641
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,751
-Great job!
-Sung-jun is on a roll!

642
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,987
He's destroying that squid with scissors.

643
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,321
He's like a hairdresser.

644
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,990
He is Sung-jun Scissorhands.

645
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,992
HAIRDRESSER KWON
SPECIALIZES IN SQUID CUTTING

646
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,159
DONE PREPPING THE SQUID

647
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,861
He's in his element.

648
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:33,198
Sung-jun knew he was ready for this.

649
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,634
The game is tough for Hyun-suk
in the beginning.

650
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,701
GETS THE BLUE CRABS

651
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,771
AND THROWS THE MEAT
INTO THE SEAFOOD STIR-FRY!

652
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,540
ADDS BÉCHAMEL SAUCE TOO!

653
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,642
He's stir-frying seafood.

654
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,310
The scissors return.

655
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,213
-Is that cheese?
-He's cutting cheese with scissors.

656
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,714
-Cheese.
-Aren't those too big?

657
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,551
I've never seen him frown like that.

658
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,685
LIKE THIS!

659
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,819
LIKE THIS?

660
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,521
How's the crêpe?

661
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,789
I think it's burning.

662
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,424
The crêpe smells burnt. Is it okay?

663
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,493
-It's burnt.
-Is the crêpe burning?

664
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,729
-Chef Hyun-suk seems troubled.
-I think it's burnt.

665
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,765
The batter is stuck.

666
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,567
-This is bad.
-Keep it down.

667
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,502
-He tells us to be quiet.
-The batter was too thin!

668
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,437
-I told you!
-Poong didn't take after Hyun-suk,

669
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,439
but it looks like
Hyun-suk is becoming Poong.

670
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,975
I kept telling you
not to be like me in this aspect!

671
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,778
-Shush.
-They're going after each other.

672
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,979
A VARIETY OF FUN!

673
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,848
If one thing goes wrong,
they begin to go after each other.

674
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,250
We can't show our mistakes.

675
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,319
Things look more grim for Hyun-suk.

676
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,653
-In there.
-The batter. Okay.

677
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,854
-It looks good.
-That's good.

678
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,757
He puts it on the crêpe in the pan… No!

679
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,593
IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

680
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,594
SHUDDERS

681
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,495
WIDE-EYED

682
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,731
-It's ruined!
-I can't watch this!

683
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,433
I TOLD YOU TO KEEP IT DOWN…

684
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,368
-Hyun-suk is in trouble!
-No!

685
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,603
It's burnt and undercooked!

686
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,371
-Can he save this?
-He can't.

687
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,706
-He can't.
-He can't?

688
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,407
Can you save that?

689
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,775
UNFORTUNATELY NOT…

690
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,977
OH NO

691
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,678
Cook it in the oven.

692
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,280
Toast it just like that.

693
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,781
-Be quiet, guys.
-You can save it.

694
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,583
He puts it back together.

695
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,653
I'M CHOI HYUN-SUK
FAILURE ISN'T IN MY VOCABULARY

696
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,224
He's topping it with mozzarella.

697
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,960
Yes, top it with cheese.

698
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,162
I think he'll be fine
if he broils it whole.

699
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,399
Hyun-suk is in trouble.

700
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,534
This looks bad.

701
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,305
This means Sung-jun has the upper…
He's using both hands!

702
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,609
BORN AS A VEGGIE-CUTTING MACHINE
AND FELL IN LOVE WITH A HUMAN!

703
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,277
Dual scissorhands!

704
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,613
Sung-jun is having fun with both hands!

705
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,281
-He always delivers!
-Yes!

706
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,616
He's chopping veggies!

707
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:34,653
SLOWLY LOSING STRENGTH

708
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,388
He needs
the <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> soundtrack.

709
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,223
Jeez, Sung-jun.

710
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,058
-I can't cut this.
-He's sure he'll win.

711
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:44,496
If he cuts it with both hands,
it'll rain veggies outside.

712
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,131
-You're right.
-It'll rain veggies.

713
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,566
That happens
when Sung-jun Scissorhands does that.

714
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,971
As of this moment,
Sung-jun surely has the upper hand.

715
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,839
He has the advantage.

716
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,441
FINISHED

717
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,610
-Will Sung-jun win?
-He's catching up.

718
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,812
FIGHT SCISSORS WITH SCISSORS!

719
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,380
It's not easy, even for the first place.

720
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,082
-Hyun-suk.
-Can you hold this, Ho-young?

721
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,617
-Hold this.
-Here?

722
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,519
What are you going to do?

723
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,554
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST PERFORMER!

724
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,024
"ORIGINALS ARE IRRELEVANT IN ART!"
BY ANDY WARHOL OF THE KITCHEN

725
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,760
He uses double scissors!

726
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,162
Hyun-suk uses double scissors!

727
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,197
BORN AS A GARLIC-CUTTING MACHINE,
LOVED SHOWING OFF

728
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,000
He's chopping garlic with two scissors!

729
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,601
It kinda works.

730
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,571
That's impressive. My gosh.

731
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,473
He didn't need a knife.

732
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,608
You have seven minutes left.

733
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,845
Chef Sung-jun is doing a great job
cooking with scissors.

734
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,413
He's so relaxed.

735
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,482
-<i>Tsuyu</i>?
-Soy sauce?

736
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,617
-It's sukiyaki sauce.
-Sukiyaki sauce.

737
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,054
Sung-jun sails smoothly
through the recipe.

738
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,356
Sung-jun continues smoothly.

739
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,226
Hyun-suk cuts shrimps with scissors.

740
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,829
-That's hard.
-I don't think he should cut it through.

741
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:55,500
-Shrimps curl up if you cut it vertically.
-Yes, it curls.

742
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,302
He still manages to talk.

743
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,137
He's also cutting mackerel with scissors.

744
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,606
-He cuts mackerel with scissors.
-Yes.

745
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,442
I think Sung-jun will finish first.

746
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,777
10. MAKE YOGURT SAUCE

747
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,012
-Balsamic vinegar.
-Mustard.

748
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,115
I think he's making a dip
for the lamb chops.

749
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,484
Is that the sauce on the side?

750
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,921
Both chefs
are doing their best for Ji-hwan!

751
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,523
How will he use the dried laver?

752
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,526
He grabs dried laver as we speak,
Ji-hwan's favorite.

753
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,529
If he's to die tomorrow,
he wants to eat curry

754
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,797
with dried laver.

755
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,999
-Yes, you're right.
-That's the laver.

756
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,134
It's everything you like.

757
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,969
He adds crushed garlic.

758
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,203
It's been crushed nicely.

759
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,374
-That'll add a nice texture.
-You're right.

760
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,976
Hyun-suk looks quite troubled.

761
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,345
His dish is called Scissors, No Losers,

762
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,247
but he's in a pinch.

763
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,481
Five minutes.

764
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,549
-Sung-ju.
-Five minutes.

765
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,451
Let me go out there.

766
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,487
-The tension is really high.
-Isn't it?

767
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,388
CUTS

768
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,158
That's the marsh snail juice.

769
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,627
-He uses the marsh snail juice.
-Marsh snail juice.

770
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,695
-Marsh snail juice.
-He added marsh snail juice.

771
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,330
Can you try that sauce?

772
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,632
INTERCEPTED

773
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,934
-He stole the juice?
-He steals the marsh snail juice.

774
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,537
It's the lucky charm.

775
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,138
He's praying that he'll win.

776
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,607
-Marsh snail juice, the lucky charm.
-Curry powder goes in.

777
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,810
-He uses curry powder.
-Curry.

778
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,212
I'll add more.

779
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,949
Things look way too smooth
for Scissors, Scissors, Boss.

780
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,018
Let me try this one.

781
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,719
I'll try this sauce.

782
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,755
-He just added the juice.
-Scissors, Scissors, Boss.

783
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,623
-Is he Sung-jun Scissorhands?
-Where is he going?

784
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,292
-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?

785
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,526
READYING HIS CRITIQUE

786
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,862
-What?
-Where are you going?

787
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,564
Is that salt?

788
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,499
MOVED

789
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,668
-Is he busy?
-Try that.

790
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,670
Let me try this one more time.

791
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,637
2ND TRY

792
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,539
CRITIQUE READY

793
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,709
HYUN-SUK SCISSORHANDS
KEEPS INTERFERING!

794
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,277
It's already chopped.

795
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,612
What's he cutting?

796
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,881
-Peperoncino, I think.
-Peperoncino?

797
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,984
What's he cutting?

798
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,253
HIS REVIEW GOT IGNORED AGAIN

799
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,754
-He's something.
-What was it like?

800
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,022
-What?
-What was it like?

801
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,357
-It was a bit bland.
-It was?

802
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,159
-Isn't it too bland?
-The marsh snail.

803
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,328
-Yes, you needed salt.
-Does it taste like marsh snail?

804
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,930
The marsh snail juice? Hey, yes!

805
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,900
-There's a hint, right?
-There's a hint of marsh snail.

806
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,770
THE LAMB CHOPS HAVE BEEN FRIED
FOR THE FIRST TIME

807
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,505
Is that starch water?

808
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,675
11. ADD MARSH SNAIL JUICE
AND STARCH TO THE SEAFOOD STIR-FRY

809
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,545
CUTTING OLIVE OIL!

810
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,614
-He's cutting oil!
-He's cutting oil too?

811
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,717
THE MAGICAL SCISSORHANDS CUT EVERYTHING

812
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,486
-He's cutting oil!
-Hyun-suk even cuts oil.

813
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,288
He cuts everything.

814
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,624
He's getting
the most use out of the scissors.

815
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,259
I really look up to that guy.

816
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,729
-Chef Hyun-suk puts on a piece of artwork.
-How about the pasta?

817
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,031
Let me try this,

818
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,132
the pasta sauce.

819
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,033
SLURP

820
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,701
IT'S HOT

821
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,437
What's it like?

822
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,505
-What's it like?
-So?

823
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,307
-Isn't it too salty?
-It is?

824
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,075
-No?
-It's too salty.

825
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,944
-He'll add pasta.
-Will it be okay then?

826
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,545
You're right.

827
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,014
Hold on. Let's check this out.

828
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,415
What's that?

829
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,451
It's that thing.

830
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,687
That's gratin, right? It's gratin!

831
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,622
THE CANNELLONI TRANSFORMED INTO GRATIN

832
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,925
He was trying to make gratin?

833
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,760
That's gratin, right? It's gratin!

834
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,628
-Right?
-It's the ruined crêpe, right?

835
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,562
It's not ruined.

836
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,331
-It's not?
-No.

837
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,066
Your face says it's ruined.

838
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,567
-It's not ruined.
-No?

839
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,203
He keeps emphasizing that it's not ruined.

840
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,272
-But it looks ruined.
-The gratin isn't ruined.

841
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,641
-That's gratin?
-It is gratin.

842
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,512
-Let me tell you why it's like this.
-Will you?

843
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,781
He tops it with dried laver.

844
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:34,085
He calls it gratin and tops it with laver,
Ji-hwan's favorite.

845
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,187
I think it'll taste great.

846
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,555
I think so too.

847
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,825
SUNG-JUN DOUBLE-FRIES THE LAMB CHOPS!

848
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,793
HARRUMPH!

849
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,695
Soy sauce.

850
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,764
AND THE INSTANT RICE HE STARTED WITH

851
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,501
HE PUTS IT INTO A LARGE BOWL

852
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,038
HE FRIED THE LAMB CHOPS
OVER HIGH HEAT ONE MORE TIME

853
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,540
LOOKING DELICIOUS

854
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,608
-You have two minutes left.
-Two minutes.

855
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,444
He's putting a lot of work into this.

856
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,913
Everything he's making is Chinese style.

857
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,015
Look at him tossing the wok!

858
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,217
THE TECHNIQUE THAT GAVE HIM HIS RISE!

859
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:11,022
MANTECARE!

860
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,857
Mantecare is all he ever does!

861
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,425
AND HE SERVES IT OVER RICE!

862
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,327
-He pours it over rice.
-It's going over rice?

863
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,328
That looks good.

864
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,329
It'll be delicious.

865
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,998
It's assorted stir-fry over rice.

866
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,132
It's like the special rice.

867
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,234
-Stir-fried seafood on rice, the special.
-You're right.

868
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,135
RETURN…

869
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,004
THE ATTENTION TO ME!

870
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,140
He's chopping with scissors again.

871
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,708
Hyun-suk.

872
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,910
Look at him. Goodness.

873
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,347
-He'll get some points for the show.
-He will.

874
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,116
He drains the penne.

875
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,519
-Penne's ready.
-Okay.

876
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,854
HE SERVES THE LAMB CHOPS

877
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,556
Next, he's serving lamb chops.

878
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,393
SERVES GOLDEN BROWN FRIED
LAMB CHOPS ON A LARGE DISH

879
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,330
WITH LOTS OF YOGURT SAUCE

880
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,731
The penne…

881
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,334
-He's done!
-He finishes first.

882
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,237
Sung-jun finishes first.

883
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,972
I'LL USE SCISSORS TOO!

884
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,540
He's using penne.

885
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,375
He's stirring the pasta with scissors.

886
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,144
HYUN-SUK BEGINS TO SERVE THE FOOD

887
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,613
GRABS A DISH

888
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,014
You have 30 seconds!

889
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,316
Thirty seconds. He's serving the dish.

890
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,718
You have 15 seconds left.

891
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,019
He uses scissors until the end.

892
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,923
-He's chopping wood ear with scissors.
-Is that wood ear?

893
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,125
-Nine seconds. Eight. Seven.
-Seven.

894
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,795
-Six. Five. Four.
-Six. Five. Four.

895
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,097
PICKS UP THE SCISSORS AGAIN?

896
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,031
Still using the scissors?

897
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,801
Time's up, Hyun-suk. You're done.

898
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,769
V for victory?

899
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,273
HYUN-SUK FINISHES SCISSORS, NO LOSERS

900
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,941
That was the best.

901
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,277
-This is amazing.
-How awesome.

902
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,112
THE SCISSORS DISHES ARE FINISHED

903
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,047
It must've been hard.

904
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,048
Just what you wanted.

905
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,950
Thank you.

906
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,888
Both dishes for Ji-hwan's order,
"It's not made with a knife"

907
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,024
has been finished and filled.

908
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,125
This is insane.

909
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,161
-It's insane.
-"This is insane."

910
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,964
The 15 minutes didn't seem like cooking.

911
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,567
It was like a piece of art,
like a short film.

912
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,903
-I was immersed in the experience.
-I see.

913
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,639
All right, then.
Chef Sung-jun finished first,

914
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,742
so try Scissors, Scissors, Boss first.

915
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,680
DEEP-FRIED CHINESE-STYLE LAMB CHOPS

916
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,016
SERVED WITH STIR-FRIED OYSTER,
SEAFOOD, AND VEGETABLE OVER RICE

917
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:24,789
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
SCISSORS, SCISSORS, BOSS

918
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,657
-He did this in 15 minutes.
-It's of great quality,

919
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,526
-considering he used scissors.
-Yes.

920
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,361
It's incredible.

921
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,029
My gosh!

922
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,397
-It already smells good?
-Yes.

923
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,799
Where should I begin?

924
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,001
You can try the rice first.

925
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,871
You said you didn't like strong seasoning,
so I kept it moderate.

926
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,173
I also added marsh snail juice
as the kick.

927
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,975
He used marsh snail juice.

928
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,577
That's rice served with toppings.

929
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,079
I'll try this.

930
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,614
Let me try it.

931
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,151
-He smells it first.
-He tops it with different ingredients.

932
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,952
THE FIRST BITE

933
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,123
He's someone who enjoys natural flavors.

934
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,892
Mmm.

935
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,593
And he likes mushrooms.

936
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,296
Something must've been impressive.

937
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,532
It's so good.

938
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:08,866
OF COURSE

939
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,903
-His first words are, "It's so good."
-It's so good.

940
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,805
Let's say shrimps have
ten different strong points.

941
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,642
He picked out the best one
and put the essence in here.

942
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,645
He also did the same for mushrooms,
one out of ten.

943
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:24,248
Then he put them together
and made a harmonious dish.

944
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,150
-Yes.
-All right.

945
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,153
-But I can point out the main ingredient.
-I see.

946
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,490
And I love it so much
because it's my favorite ingredient.

947
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,592
Marsh snails?

948
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,561
-Marsh snails and oysters.
-He's enjoying it.

949
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,763
-Oysters? The frozen oysters!
-Yes.

950
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,398
-He had oysters.
-Oysters.

951
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,465
Man.

952
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,435
He begins to dig in.

953
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,937
ANOTHER BIG BITE

954
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,004
MMM

955
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,141
DROP?

956
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,242
Is it a bit…

957
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,878
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

958
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,913
-What is it?
-What's inside?

959
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,381
-What is it?
-What's inside?

960
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,983
-What is it?
-What's inside?

961
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,952
-No, it was so good.
-Right?

962
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,588
I thought you were spitting something out.

963
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,890
It's the kind of flavor I love.

964
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,060
It's clean and not overly seasoned.

965
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,661
-The ingredients' natural taste.
-Yes.

966
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,197
I can taste it right away.

967
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,700
-I can eat this every day.
-Really?

968
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,835
I'm sorry,
but you can't have it every day.

969
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:22,173
You have to come here every time we shoot
if you want that every day.

970
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,476
When you get a bit bored with it,
try the lamb chops

971
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,812
with lots of yogurt sauce.

972
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,313
He made cuts with scissors, right?

973
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,817
-I made cuts with a knife… No, scissors.
-Scissor cuts.

974
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,518
Did you make sauce?

975
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,886
Yes, with yogurt and ricotta.

976
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,890
These lamb chops just spoke to me
and said, "Why are you holding those?

977
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,793
-Put them down."
-Yes, put them down.

978
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,729
He made those with scissors.

979
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,164
-You're a funny guy.
-He is.

980
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,935
GOING RIGHT AT IT!

981
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,804
IN ONE BITE, LIKE A BEAST!

982
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,275
-He's giving the Jang Yi-soo vibes now.
-He is.

983
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,144
I haven't seen him
enjoy something that much for a while.

984
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,914
-This is insane.
-It's insane?

985
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,650
I can't believe I heard that live!

986
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,619
-Yi-soo says, "This is insane."
-One more.

987
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,955
He's been running a lot lately,

988
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,657
so his appetite must be heightened.

989
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,059
-How is it cooked? Was it cooked nicely?
-Yes.

990
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,429
It was cooked perfectly.

991
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,466
He started cooking those over low heat,
so it was cooked thoroughly.

992
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,467
That's great.

993
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,038
Next up,
Chef Hyun-suk's Scissors, No, Losers.

994
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:31,142
TWO DISHES MADE TO RISE AS A WINNER

995
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,447
GRATIN TOPPED WITH LOTS OF DRIED LAVER

996
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,518
AND CURRY PENNE WITH MACKEREL AND
SHRIMP, TOPPED WITH WOOD EAR

997
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,322
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
SCISSORS, NO LOSERS

998
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,157
Which one should he eat first?

999
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,959
-Try the sea urchin-shaped gratin first.
-Sea urchin?

1000
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,263
-Is that sea urchin-shaped?
-Sea urchin.

1001
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,366
Cannellonis are supposed
to look like round pipes,

1002
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,836
so he wanted to roll the crêpe
with filling inside.

1003
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,306
But it became gratin. Or is it cheese?
Is it pizza you eat with a spoon?

1004
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,375
Anyway, it turned out to be something.

1005
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,944
Most of the flour got strained,

1006
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,447
so the batter turned out to be too thin.

1007
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,683
But it's mostly made
with seafood and béchamel sauce,

1008
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,251
so it'll taste quite rich.

1009
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,687
-It came out exactly like that.
-I see.

1010
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,522
Then please try some.

1011
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,459
It didn't turn out the way he planned,

1012
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,594
-But it looks good.
-but still,

1013
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,930
-he managed to switch plans.
-It looks good.

1014
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,399
-That's the dried laver he loves.
-Yes.

1015
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,433
I'll try some.

1016
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,037
A BIG BITE

1017
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,872
He makes it look so good.

1018
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,344
-That's a different face he's making.
-He looks serious.

1019
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,179
-What's going on?
-This is scary.

1020
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,782
My gosh.

1021
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,051
The process was whimsical,

1022
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,052
but this is a masterpiece.

1023
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,724
-Hey, Hyun-suk.
-It's a masterpiece.

1024
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,760
-I said I like adventures, right?
-Yes.

1025
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,194
The moment I ate this,

1026
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,763
it reminded me

1027
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,199
of Zorba the Greek or Don Quixote.

1028
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,201
-Zorba?
-It's whimsical,

1029
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,270
and I've never had anything like this.

1030
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,773
-I love it so much.
-Don Quixote.

1031
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,941
It's like someone I want to see again.

1032
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,244
The flavor of La Mancha.

1033
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,646
-Something foreign, Italy or Greece.
-Yes.

1034
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:19,150
-It's not ordinary.
-It's like Zorba the Greek.

1035
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,219
-He means that it's unique.
-Yes, like Zorba the Greek.

1036
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:25,589
He cut the flour with scissors.
He cut the oil with scissors.

1037
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,924
<i>-Even the salt too.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1038
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,259
<i>It wasn't ordinary.</i>

1039
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,594
Who can do something like this?

1040
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,130
-It's magnetic.
-Is it?

1041
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,232
-I'm so curious.
-That's odd.

1042
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,768
How did he do this?

1043
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,203
Your favorite, curry.

1044
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,372
-That's curry penne with wood ear.
-Curry penne.

1045
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,973
Are you sticking it in the fork?

1046
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,244
That's a unique way.

1047
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,079
-Have some mackerel with it.
-Okay.

1048
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,080
It's up here.

1049
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,149
He stuck a piece of penne
in each prong of the fork.

1050
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,951
IN ONE BITE

1051
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:54,852
All right.

1052
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,221
GIGGLING

1053
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,422
It made him laugh.

1054
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,424
The process for this dish

1055
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,160
-seemed complicated and fussy.
-Fussy.

1056
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:07,465
But I want to say this proves
that he's a master chef.

1057
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,902
Every single flavor hits me slowly,
one after another.

1058
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,171
In different orders?

1059
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,173
It's not confusing.

1060
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,942
It'll taste even better
when they're mixed.

1061
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,210
-These two?
-Yes, both of them.

1062
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,811
Is that okay, Hyun-suk?

1063
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,880
-That wasn't my intention.
-It wasn't?

1064
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,250
-You didn't, but it'll taste good.
-Poong makes a suggestion.

1065
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,852
TOPPING PENNE WITH GRATIN

1066
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,021
NOM

1067
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,291
If you don't like it, say so.

1068
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,461
-They should be eaten separately.
-Separately? Come on, Poong.

1069
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,163
-I knew it.
-Poong.

1070
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,599
-That's a warning.
-That wasn't Chef Hyun-suk's idea.

1071
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,268
Why don't we try these together?

1072
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,338
First, let's try
Chef Sung-jun's Scissors, Scissors, Boss.

1073
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,406
Right, Woo-jin? Aren't I right?

1074
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,307
Isn't it really good?

1075
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,909
It smells amazing.

1076
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,480
Marsh snail juice is amazing with oysters.

1077
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,148
The flavor doubles.

1078
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,384
-Doesn't it?
-It tastes so clean.

1079
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:04,154
It could've been an ordinary
stir-fried seafood with vegetables.

1080
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:09,126
But the marsh snail juice added
the bitter yet rich flavor.

1081
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,928
I love that kick.

1082
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,063
The marsh snail flavor spreads first,

1083
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,133
and the oysters kick in later and explode.

1084
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,301
FINISHES WITH AN EXPLOSION OF OYSTER

1085
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,305
-Woo-jin tries the lamb chops.
-Yes.

1086
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,607
-And balsamic vinegar.
-Thank you.

1087
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,210
The stroke of genius shining through.

1088
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,312
The flavor is just…

1089
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,681
EXCAVATING THE BONE

1090
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,517
-It's so tender.
-It is.

1091
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,553
NOTICES NAM-NO

1092
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,821
Chef Nam-no, how are the lamb chops?

1093
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,659
I love the subtle smell
of curry and cumin,

1094
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,262
<i>and this sauce he made</i>
<i>with mustard and yogurt</i>

1095
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,797
<i>tastes quite exotic,</i>

1096
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,500
<i>but it's hard to point to one country.</i>

1097
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:54,238
I haven't felt such a vigorous spirit
in a dish in a while.

1098
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,806
You can feel it, right?

1099
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,209
I noticed how he seemed determined

1100
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:04,315
to get rid of the gamy lamb smell
while making sure it tastes wonderful.

1101
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,251
I want to keep eating this.

1102
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,386
THANK YOU

1103
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,555
All right, then.

1104
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:15,659
Let's try
Chef Hyun-suk's Scissors, No Losers.

1105
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,361
-Two dishes.
-This is so much fun.

1106
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,166
Was it burnt?

1107
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,934
-No.
-No?

1108
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,003
-It's not burnt at all.
-Not at all.

1109
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,506
This is a non-Korean dish
topped with Korean seasoned dried laver,

1110
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,475
-but they work so well.
-They do.

1111
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,345
-Woo-jin, have you tried this?
-This?

1112
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,880
-This is perfect for my taste too.
-Is it?

1113
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,449
-I also love curry.
-I see.

1114
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,184
-It tastes like expensive curry.
-It does.

1115
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:45,522
He mixed curry with the broth he made
by using blue crabs and marsh clams.

1116
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:50,160
That's why it has a note
of Thai stir-fried crab with curry powder.

1117
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:53,530
-It tastes like crab with curry.
-That was the flavor.

1118
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,467
I can see why you ran over
to get the peperoncino.

1119
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,969
Yes, the spiciness is the kick.

1120
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,205
-I cut it with scissors, remember?
-Yes.

1121
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,341
I cut it about eight times
to add the perfect amount of spiciness.

1122
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,676
That was why.

1123
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,012
SCISSOR MEASURING METHOD?

1124
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,114
So you cut it exactly eight times…

1125
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,416
-The spice level got cut off.
-Well, Chef Hyun-suk.

1126
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,652
Chef, I have a question.

1127
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,055
Is there a difference

1128
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,224
between cut oil and uncut oil?

1129
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,959
AS IF…

1130
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,162
If I hadn't and just served it
like any old restaurant by mixing it in,

1131
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,799
like how servers pour oil by the table,
called a gueridon service…

1132
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,335
Stop laughing so much.

1133
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,237
-He's on the verge of tears.
-Don't make me feel conscious.

1134
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,940
He's in trouble now.

1135
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,644
-It's time to decide.
-It's not easy to make a decision.

1136
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,746
<i>Press one for Kwon Sung-jun,</i>

1137
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,448
<i>and two for Choi Hyun-suk.</i>

1138
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,918
Make your decision and press the button!

1139
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,521
-I did.
-He pressed it.

1140
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,755
That was so hard.

1141
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,757
Let's find out the result!

1142
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,927
It's not made with a knife.

1143
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,595
The chefs only used scissors to cook.

1144
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,632
They didn't use any knives.

1145
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,535
Will it be Hyun-suk or Sung-jun?

1146
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,336
That was the show-off chef derby.

1147
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,173
Will it be the original show-off chef?

1148
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,442
Or will it be his protégé?

1149
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,343
Who did Ji-hwan choose?

1150
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,745
Who is it?

1151
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,548
Who did you choose, Ji-hwan?

1152
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,349
Who's the winner?

1153
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,819
CHOI HYUN-SUK WINS

1154
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,754
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
SCISSORS, NO LOSERS WINS

1155
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,456
Hyun-suk wins.

1156
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,092
The original show-off chef wins.

1157
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,429
He's doing something again.

1158
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,565
IT'S ME, THE MASTER SCISSORHANDS

1159
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,266
LIKE THIS?

1160
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,534
So?

1161
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:41,805
If someone asked me to eat this every day,
I would immediately choose this.

1162
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,340
But his dishes were so amazing.

1163
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,643
-These were masterpieces.
-I see.

1164
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,947
He made mistakes in the process,

1165
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,217
but he never showed that
he thought the dish was ruined.

1166
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:57,321
I saw him enjoying the moment
and continuously creating something new.

1167
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,890
<i>I thought I saw that in him today.</i>

1168
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,393
That process was touching and fascinating.

1169
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,896
As you said,
if I stopped when the dish was ruined,

1170
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,931
that would actually mean it was ruined.

1171
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,000
But if I don't give up and continue,

1172
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,035
-I will find a good result.
-You're right.

1173
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,371
-That's the Kim Poong spirit.
-Sure.

1174
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,074
-He learned it from Poong?
-That's the Kim Poong spirit.

1175
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,041
CLENCHES TEETH

1176
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,512
I saw his eyes turning miserable
and growing red too.

1177
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,616
Yes, we saw everything.
We've never seen you this miserable.

1178
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,451
He's trying not to cry.

1179
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,819
What's with him?

1180
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,722
Everything was going so smooth
for you today, Sung-jun.

1181
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,724
This is why everyone needs

1182
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,459
a good teacher.

1183
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,827
What do you mean?

1184
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,964
When I side with the wrong guy,
I can fall into a ditch and stay there.

1185
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,967
I never told you to side with me.
You came and joined me on your own.

1186
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,803
I'll find a new teacher now.

1187
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,071
He blames others when he loses.

1188
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,273
Will you go back to Hyun-suk?

1189
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,143
I might give Chef Ho-young a try.

1190
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,179
He's feeling out everyone.

1191
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,014
-I'm fine with it.
-He's a floater.

1192
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,948
You failed to switch.

1193
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,151
Chef Hyun-suk wins yet another star

1194
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,687
still securing his place as first place.

1195
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,856
-Thank you.
-Congratulations, Hyun-suk!

1196
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:10,260
And take the Spam set as your prize.

1197
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,161
Congratulations!

1198
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,197
THE SHOW-OFF'S CELEBRATION

1199
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:17,601
<i>This is the second cook-off</i>
<i>with ingredients from Ji-hwan's fridge.</i>

1200
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,771
You'll cook for Ji-hwan,
the boss of the Mushroom Gang

1201
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:25,843
who loves mushrooms,
and make the best mushroom dish.

1202
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,878
We're about to begin the round.

1203
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,113
This man even looks like his boss.

1204
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,716
The face of the Mushroom Gang,
Chef Lim Tae-hun,

1205
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,318
is up against Chef Yoon Nam-no,

1206
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,688
the biggest man of the Mushroom Gang.

1207
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:41,992
This round will decide
who'll be the number two in the gang.

1208
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,761
I hear you two had
the worst first impressions of each other.

1209
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,630
-Both of them?
-Yes, against each other.

1210
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,165
When I first met him,

1211
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,301
he seemed like someone
who went through many rough patches,

1212
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,571
so I thought he must've had a rough life.

1213
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,107
It seemed like
he must've jumped through loops.

1214
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,842
You aren't any better.

1215
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,511
-You're right.
-All right.

1216
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:06,516
They may not leave
a good first impression,

1217
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,487
but they both have
the softest hearts in the gang.

1218
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,922
This will become your first fight.

1219
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,525
I heard they couldn't even
look at each other in the green room.

1220
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,327
They feel too awkward.

1221
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,063
He's a dear friend,

1222
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,065
so I had a moment of weakness.

1223
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,834
Do you want to give him the star too?

1224
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,570
Yes, of course.
I want to give him one now.

1225
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,238
He only has one star.

1226
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,173
He only has one!

1227
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,076
-The stars aren't important.
-He wants to give that up too?

1228
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,712
-You'll need one to give me one.
-Look who's talking.

1229
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:40,217
-But this is a battle.
-It is, so I'll try to win the star.

1230
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,219
I also feel really bad for him.

1231
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,854
-You do? Why?
-Yes.

1232
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,357
-I have a feeling I'll win today.
-Because you'll win?

1233
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,793
There are days
when you can feel it in the air.

1234
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,897
Mushrooms are the key to this match.

1235
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,500
Chef Tae-hun,
you often work with mushrooms.

1236
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,168
I often make <i>dongpo</i> pork,

1237
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,737
so I use about a box and a half
of king oyster mushrooms a day,

1238
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,540
a box of <i>pyogo</i>,

1239
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,010
and a box and a half of enoki.

1240
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:10,047
I've worked with lots of mushrooms,

1241
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:14,351
so I have a feeling I'll win this round.

1242
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,787
Chef Nam-no couldn't have used that much.

1243
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,555
He just mentioned <i>dongpo</i> pork again,

1244
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,124
and I'm so sick of hearing it.

1245
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,727
-That's true.
-Actually,

1246
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,063
it doesn't matter
if he uses mushrooms for <i>dongpo</i> pork.

1247
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,732
After all, <i>dongpo</i> pork is a meat dish.

1248
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,036
Also, it's impossible
to make that in our studio.

1249
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,372
I hope he brings some for us
to have a taste

1250
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,308
-one of these days to eat for lunch.
-Yes, bring us some.

1251
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,444
-I'll bring some next time.
-Please do.

1252
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,713
-Yes, bring some.
-That'd be great.

1253
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,681
The production crew needs some too.

1254
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,483
Our crew needs to have a taste.

1255
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,385
-He'll have to cook for 200.
-That's right.

1256
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,954
-I hope to try it soon.
-It must be good.

1257
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,857
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS:
KING OYSTER MUSHROOM, WOOD EAR, EGGPLANT

1258
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,959
SHRIMP, RICOTTA, PEANUT BUTTER,
FISH SAUCE, SESAME, LEMON JUICE

1259
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,761
The dish I prepared is

1260
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,730
Junggok-dong Maniac.

1261
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,298
-Junggok-dong Maniac?
-Junggok-dong Maniac?

1262
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,799
What does that mean?

1263
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,668
Hello, Boss!

1264
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,503
He's scary.

1265
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,806
-Good acting.
-I'm Yoon Nam-no from Junggok-dong.

1266
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,942
Let me tell you about the dish I'll make.

1267
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,243
GO AHEAD

1268
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,113
I will dig out your favorite,
king oyster mushrooms,

1269
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,483
fill it with wood ear and shrimp…

1270
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,684
Excellent.

1271
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,819
…and bring out the crunchy texture.

1272
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,690
I'll also burn eggplants,
another one of your favorites,

1273
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,959
and make smoked eggplant purée
to serve on the side.

1274
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,462
-Eggplant purée is great.
-It'll be better than anything you expect.

1275
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,433
It's an honor to cook for you, Boss!

1276
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,668
PLEASED

1277
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,604
Is that how you greet him?

1278
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,073
Isn't that Psy's choreography?

1279
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,776
-Psy?
-He just has short arms. I do that too.

1280
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:46,877
Really?

1281
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,045
You saw that, Tae-hun.

1282
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,646
-He was in theater.
-Yes.

1283
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,383
I just briefly dabbled in it.

1284
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,618
I'm looking forward to it.

1285
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,487
CHEF TAE-HUN'S INGREDIENTS: WOOD EAR,
BUTTON MUSHROOM, OYSTER MUSHROOM, ENOKI

1286
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,623
PYOGO, KING OYSTER MUSHROOM, BOK CHOY,
TENDERLOIN, CABBAGE, CARROT, OYSTER SAUCE

1287
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,325
Here's a guy who was into theater
back during school.

1288
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,694
What are you making, Chef Tae-hun?

1289
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,563
The dish I'll make is

1290
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,998
Fake Yi-soo, the Seochon Boss.

1291
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,933
-Fake Yi-soo, the Seochon Boss.
-Fake Yi-soo, the Boss.

1292
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,902
Your restaurant is in Seochon.

1293
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:15,939
I've already taken over Seochon
and put the place under my order.

1294
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,507
So what now? What's next?

1295
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,508
Wait a moment.

1296
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:19,876
FAILS TO STAY IN CHARACTER

1297
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,379
WHERE'D THE ACTING GO?

1298
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,714
I don't think
he'll get a part in the film.

1299
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,184
-You can't do this with your bosses here.
-Wait.

1300
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,385
Here we go again.

1301
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,921
I've taken over Seochon, and…

1302
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:31,922
Yes?

1303
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:36,993
…I, Fake Yi-soo,
prepared a dish for you, Boss.

1304
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,930
I'm going to use six different mushrooms.

1305
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,865
There are six types,

1306
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,634
and I'll bring out
three different textures

1307
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,870
to make a healthy dish

1308
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,539
and serve it to you, Boss.

1309
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:54,010
Please have my dish and live long.

1310
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,613
HE SAFELY FINISHES HIS LINES

1311
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,015
BOSS IS IMPRESSED

1312
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,585
He's using six mushrooms
but only bringing out three textures?

1313
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,820
-You're losing half.
-This is unheard of.

1314
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,188
That's a new technique.

1315
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,458
-Three textures with six mushrooms.
-Three with six. That's even harder.

1316
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,160
All right, then.

1317
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:15,298
You will now begin cooking for Ji-hwan,
the best dish of the Mushroom Gang.

1318
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,567
He's here to become
the next in line in the gang.

1319
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,303
Junggok-dong Maniac, Yoon Nam-no.

1320
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,806
This man even looks like his boss.

1321
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:26,910
The overcooked Jang Yi-soo,
Chef Lim Tae-hun is also up.

1322
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,181
Who will be the number two
of the Mushroom Gang?

1323
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:35,285
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1324
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:36,987
Begin!

1325
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,421
THE BOSS IS EXCITED

1326
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,490
Begin!

1327
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,993
GIVE ME A HUG, MAN!

1328
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,227
HUG

1329
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,329
TOO MUCH ROMANCE

1330
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,797
That's romance.

1331
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,833
HOW WILL FAKE YI-SOO BEGIN?

1332
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,868
They're showing respect.

1333
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,704
-What's he doing?
-The sheath is still on!

1334
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,706
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

1335
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,109
What are you doing in front of the boss?

1336
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,244
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1337
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,847
He became flustered
after that acting spiel.

1338
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,182
-He's flustered.
-He is.

1339
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,083
1. MAKE GREEN ONION OIL
WITH GREEN ONION AND ONION

1340
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,252
Is he making green onion oil?

1341
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,555
But why is there so much oil?

1342
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,124
HOW WILL JUNGGOK-DONG MANIAC BEGIN?

1343
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,027
This guy is about to grill eggplants.

1344
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,695
The eggplants must be hot.

1345
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,231
Why is he broiling those over the fire?

1346
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:25,168
It's like roasted sweet potatoes.
It gets sweet and also smoky.

1347
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,437
-He won't eat the skin.
-Not the skin?

1348
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,106
He grabs a mushroom.
That's a king oyster mushroom.

1349
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,276
Are you using three of them?

1350
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,678
PIERCE

1351
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,514
Why? What's up?

1352
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,115
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING WENT WRONG

1353
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,917
-What's he doing?
-Piercing the mushroom.

1354
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,153
I had to dig into the dead center.

1355
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,122
He just stabbed the mushroom's tummy.

1356
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,958
He just stabbed it.

1357
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,493
-He destroyed it.
-He stabbed it.

1358
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,697
-He's merciless.
-He's destroying it.

1359
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:56,132
-It's an apple corer.
-Exactly.

1360
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,867
That removes the seeds.

1361
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,804
Nam-no keeps pushing the corer in.

1362
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,439
He's trying to make a hole.

1363
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,874
-That's so cruel.
-Not a bad idea.

1364
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:08,378
Let's see what Tae-hun is up to.

1365
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,513
1. BUTTON MUSHROOM

1366
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,650
Chinese chefs always prepare
the ingredients before they begin.

1367
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,485
4. PYOGO MUSHROOMS

1368
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,154
Chinese kitchen knives
really are threatening.

1369
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,358
-He's so good with that knife.
-Isn't he?

1370
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,127
-All right.
-Okay. He's slicing garlic cloves.

1371
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,663
-And green onion.
-And green onion.

1372
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,100
5. KING OYSTER MUSHROOM

1373
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:34,371
MAKING CUTS ON THE BOTTOM

1374
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,708
One is impaling stuff,
while the other is wrecking stuff.

1375
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,577
Wreck them.

1376
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:43,580
-I like both of them as my number two.
-You do?

1377
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,582
They're both rough.

1378
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,450
He's grilling the mushroom like that?

1379
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,687
-Tae-hun is about to grill the mushrooms.
-The ones with cuts.

1380
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,722
Why did he make those cuts?

1381
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,891
-You'll see.
-He said he'd bring out the texture.

1382
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,561
He mentioned three textures
with six mushrooms.

1383
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,297
-Is that right?
-I don't know.

1384
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,300
We thought you'd create
six textures with three mushrooms.

1385
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,435
-It's six mushrooms, three textures.
-The other way.

1386
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:06,903
I want to serve six mushrooms

1387
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,371
with three different textures.

1388
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,774
-Exactly. I just said that.
-Yes, you got that, right?

1389
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,742
He's turning six into three.

1390
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,312
-You'll see.
-What could that mean?

1391
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,815
-I don't get it. Really?
-It's probably frying, steaming, and more.

1392
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,384
NAM-NO GRABS THE BLENDER!

1393
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,689
1. BLEND SHRIMP AND WOOD EAR

1394
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,324
SHAKING THE BLENDER

1395
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,060
He's blending the shrimp.

1396
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,561
Did it go well?

1397
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,996
-It's not blending.
-No?

1398
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,266
-He's burning the eggplants.
-It's too hot.

1399
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,068
That's so cruel.

1400
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,869
Is that all right?

1401
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,605
He'll do that and dig up the insides.

1402
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,208
It'll taste moist and much sweeter.

1403
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,478
-Please be careful with your hands.
-Watch your hand.

1404
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,114
I wonder if the shrimp got blended well.

1405
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,949
-What?
-It didn't blend well.

1406
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,017
The wood ear is still intact.

1407
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,685
I'll just use the top part.

1408
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,087
These are blended.

1409
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,789
The mushrooms are smoking.

1410
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,859
The mushrooms are smoking.

1411
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,329
-Hey.
-It looks nicely cooked.

1412
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,299
-It won't flip over.
-He should flip it to the right side.

1413
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,469
-One side is fat and keeps turning over.
-It keeps turning to one side.

1414
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,305
-Flip it.
-Push it down.

1415
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,708
-He strained the green onion from the oil.
-Did he just want a hint of green onion?

1416
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:22,445
-He's using enoki. Tae-hun using enoki.
-Enoki.

1417
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:25,682
-I think he'll deep-fry those.
-He'll deep-fry those?

1418
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,950
He'll deep-fry enoki.

1419
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,585
He's going to deep-fry that.

1420
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,388
-Enoki is delicious when deep-fried.
-It is.

1421
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,455
I've never had it.

1422
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,325
-Is it good when deep-fried?
-It's really good.

1423
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,261
It'll taste chewy like squid.

1424
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:41,331
-It'll taste amazing.
-It adds a good texture.

1425
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:42,866
CRUSHED GARLIC

1426
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,502
MINCED GINGER

1427
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,771
2. MIX GROUND SHRIMP WITH GARLIC,
GINGER, FISH SAUCE, SALT, STARCH

1428
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:51,207
Nam-no seasons the ground shrimp.

1429
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,309
THE FILLING GOES INTO A PIPING BAG!

1430
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,179
-What's Nam-no doing?
-It's a piping bag.

1431
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,248
-What's Nam-no doing?
-It's a piping bag.

1432
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,417
SURPRISED

1433
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,253
-He looks flustered.
-He's flustered.

1434
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:06,256
He's going through a tough time
to become the number two.

1435
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:09,426
He's filling king oyster mushrooms
with shrimp filling, like <i>menbosha.</i>

1436
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,795
He made the piping bag for that reason.

1437
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,263
Will you steam those?

1438
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,831
-No, I'll deep-fry.
-You will?

1439
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:15,999
It's just like <i>menbosha.</i>

1440
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,568
-He'll deep-fry those?
-Deep-fry?

1441
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,037
3. COAT MUSHROOMS WITH COOKING WINE,
STARCH, AND SHRIMP FILLING

1442
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:25,375
Meanwhile, he's putting a coat on it.

1443
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,844
-What's that?
-Did you coat it with shrimp again?

1444
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,012
-Yes.
-I see.

1445
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,214
It's reversed <i>menbosha.</i>

1446
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,348
Reversed <i>menbosha?</i>

1447
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,350
-Reversed <i>menbosha?</i>
-If it's reversed…

1448
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,820
-Reversed <i>menbosha?</i>
-Reversed <i>menbosha?</i>

1449
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,290
-I've never seen that before.
-The shrimp is coated outside.

1450
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,959
-It's like a big shrimp ball.
-Please be cautious.

1451
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,093
Sesame seeds?

1452
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,628
It's a lot like <i>menbosha.</i>

1453
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,665
-He's frying it.
-What did he put on the outside?

1454
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,234
-Sesame seeds.
-He coated it with sesame seeds.

1455
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,203
-One's just the mushroom.
-One isn't coated?

1456
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,305
One's <i>menbosha, </i>the other's reversed.

1457
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,374
Wait, did he add butter?

1458
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,176
Butter for Chinese cuisine?

1459
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,913
-The butter's burning. It's too hot.
-The heat is too hot.

1460
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:07,016
The butter is burning! It's already burnt!

1461
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:07,984
Is it burnt?

1462
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,720
-It's already burnt. Is it okay?
-It's okay.

1463
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,690
Is it really? I thought it looked burnt.

1464
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,626
If he ruins three mushrooms out of six,
he'll have three textures.

1465
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,729
-He meant to throw away three out of six?
-He will.

1466
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,130
He'll throw away three mushrooms?

1467
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,199
I hope the mushroom dishes

1468
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,968
finishes intact without failing.

1469
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,339
If you mess up the mushroom dish…

1470
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,175
-No one will be my number two.
-No one will get the job.

1471
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,677
He's putting ground pepper on beef.

1472
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,880
And some starch.

1473
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:40,483
He adds some water and begins to mix it.

1474
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,353
He's frying that in the green onion oil.

1475
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,088
You have 8 minutes and 30 seconds.

1476
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,890
By this time, the eggplants

1477
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:50,326
-are asking to be saved.
-This is too cruel.

1478
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:51,828
-I can't watch this.
-They became soot.

1479
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,062
-Is it okay?
-This is cremation.

1480
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,265
May I go and watch?

1481
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,466
It'll taste good as sauce.

1482
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,402
-Shouldn't you put it in cold water?
-Is that okay?

1483
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,303
Is that okay?

1484
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,971
PRACTICALLY CHARCOAL

1485
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,007
-Is it okay on the inside?
-It's hot.

1486
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,042
PEELING UNDER COLD WATER

1487
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,178
It's still too hot. It's hot.

1488
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:10,079
-Dang it!
-It's hot.

1489
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,849
Hey, that's still too hot!

1490
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,817
-Is it ruined?
-You need ice.

1491
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,786
The eggplants are overly burnt.

1492
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,855
-They're too burnt.
-Can you save anything?

1493
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,759
Deal with it as a chef if you want to cook
a delicious dish for Ji-hwan.

1494
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,495
-Leave it in cold water.
-It's for your boss.

1495
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:29,532
If you ruin that dish,
that eggplant represents your future.

1496
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,971
-It must burn your hands.
-It must be hot.

1497
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,873
ENDURE IT

1498
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,541
Those look delicious, though.

1499
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,044
HE ENDURES THE HEAT
AND COLLECTS THE INSIDES

1500
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,212
Nam-no is blending something again.

1501
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,647
-Eggplants.
-Eggplants.

1502
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,549
Eggplant purée?

1503
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,751
He blended the eggplants.

1504
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,420
You have only six minutes left.

1505
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,056
-Six minutes and fifteen seconds.
-Is that all right?

1506
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,326
-Is that a block of butter?
-It's butter.

1507
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,528
-That's a lot.
-He's using that much butter?

1508
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,630
-I'll make sesame oil with brown butter.
-What?

1509
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,731
What's brown butter?

1510
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,401
If you cook butter for a while,
you can separate all the milk solids.

1511
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,736
Doesn't it take a long time?

1512
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:10,206
It's rich in flavor,
but it's hard to do in a short while.

1513
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,542
You have under six minutes left.

1514
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,711
-What is he fishing out?
-Beef.

1515
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,846
Yes, it's beef tenderloin.

1516
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:19,649
RAW TENDERLOIN INTO BOILING WATER!

1517
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:20,883
CRACK

1518
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,585
MAKING BROTH WITH GREEN ONION AND ONION

1519
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,787
WHAT'S NEXT?

1520
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,356
BOK CHOY, CABBAGE, CARROT

1521
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,124
HE PREPARES THE VEGGIES IN A FLASH

1522
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,560
-You have only six minutes.
-Okay.

1523
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,461
-Is that okay?
-Six minutes.

1524
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,562
I'll finish.

1525
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,799
5. COVER LID AND STEAM
BROTH, OIL, SALT, AND BOK CHOY

1526
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,668
He's using a wok.

1527
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,104
TOSSING WITH THE LID

1528
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,539
-I've never seen that before.
-It's to keep moisture in.

1529
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,842
He's doing that to retain the moisture.

1530
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:47,810
I see.

1531
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:52,548
-The mushroom.
-He's putting a lot of work into that.

1532
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,184
-Is that the main mushroom?
-I wonder.

1533
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,221
-It already looks delicious.
-It does.

1534
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,990
Peanut butter.

1535
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,027
-Peanut butter and ricotta.
-Ricotta.

1536
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,330
-And olive oil.
-Olive oil, lemon juice.

1537
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:08,564
SESAME, SUGAR

1538
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,734
Nam-no is taking quite a while.

1539
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,538
-He's making the eggplant sauce.
-I don't see anything finished.

1540
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,141
We're at five minutes,
so he should have something ready.

1541
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,976
-Please go out and report, Jung-hwan.
-Okay.

1542
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,178
Who'll become the number two?

1543
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:25,181
That looks good. The eggplant purée.

1544
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,684
-He got nothing done and has no time.
-Right?

1545
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,952
What's the eggplant sauce for?

1546
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,789
-I'll put it under the mushrooms.
-It'll go under.

1547
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,525
He's now putting the sauce
through a strainer.

1548
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,027
WHAT ABOUT FAKE YI-SOO WITH THE WOK?

1549
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,896
-The bok choy looks good.
-The bok choy.

1550
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,364
Is it cooked evenly?

1551
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,865
The bok choy are cooked.

1552
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,100
AN EXPERT WITH BOK CHOY

1553
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,135
This side is chaotic.

1554
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,670
RETRIEVES THE FRIED ENOKI

1555
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:48,604
It's still hot.

1556
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,574
-Try the oil.
-The oil?

1557
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:52,642
Do you want to die?

1558
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:54,277
It's still hot.

1559
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,179
DID HE REALLY MEAN THAT LINE?

1560
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,449
All right. He's oiling the wok.

1561
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,185
ADDING SOY SAUCE!

1562
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,086
GREEN ONION, SLICED GARLIC

1563
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,521
-A fire show.
-It's a fire show!

1564
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:06,823
It's a fire show!

1565
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,559
He puts on a show.

1566
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,295
THE CHINESE COOK OF 3 MONTHS IS AMAZED

1567
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,497
The boss looks thrilled.

1568
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,232
He takes everyone's attention.

1569
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,533
The boss looks thrilled.

1570
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,336
I'LL LET IT BURN FOR YOU, BOSS

1571
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,806
-That's it.
-The boss is standing up.

1572
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,242
THAT'S MY BOY, LIM TAE-HUN!

1573
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,810
"Yes, you're my number two!"

1574
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,113
"Tae-hun, you're my number two!"

1575
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,181
The boss looks pleased as he watches you.

1576
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,716
The mushrooms go in!

1577
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:36,119
-It smells so amazing.
-He's using <i>pyogo</i> mushrooms.

1578
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,488
-Okay.
-Will you keep cooking this?

1579
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,857
Can you show me anything, Nam-no?

1580
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,625
-What?
-Any performances?

1581
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,495
The boss is giving
all his attention to Tae-hun.

1582
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,530
You're turning this into sesame oil?

1583
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,665
That looks way too hot.

1584
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,467
Can you make brown butter
in this short while?

1585
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,169
It'll be similar to clarified butter.

1586
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,271
It's really brown.

1587
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,006
Can you do that in such a short while?

1588
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,174
AMAZED

1589
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,442
What's Chef Nam-no doing?

1590
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,177
-It looks a bit…
-It's spilling over!

1591
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,879
No!

1592
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,081
-Hold it for him.
-It's spilling.

1593
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,315
-Is that okay?
-It's fine.

1594
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:11,387
Chef Nam-no is betting it all
on these king oyster mushrooms.

1595
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,823
Chinese cuisine is fast
because he just needs to stir-fry.

1596
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,324
-Yes.
-It looks like Chinese food.

1597
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,960
-Is that beef broth?
-It is.

1598
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:21,330
-The boss has his attention on Tae-hun.
-Yes.

1599
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,732
DEEP-FRIED TENDERLOIN

1600
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,201
-Our boss loves mushrooms.
-Yes, sir.

1601
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,170
-Do this right.
-Yes, sir.

1602
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,905
That's his boy, Tae-hun.

1603
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,907
You have two minutes left.

1604
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,108
-Two minutes!
-Two minutes.

1605
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,376
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOUR DISHES, BOYS?

1606
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:36,846
HE PUTS STARCH SLURRY INTO A LADLE

1607
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:41,284
AND SPRINKLES IT AS HE TOSSES

1608
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,052
USING BOTH HANDS

1609
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,821
I love mushrooms so much,

1610
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,823
so I'm starting to get excited.

1611
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:47,890
He's excited.

1612
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,459
Is that oyster sauce?
No, that's sesame oil.

1613
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,028
A dash of sesame oil.

1614
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,863
Look at that color.

1615
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,299
He's serving the dish now.

1616
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,401
-He's serving it.
-Twenty-five seconds.

1617
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,838
So those are two textures.

1618
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:04,040
It's a work of art.

1619
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:07,310
-The losing chef must leave the gang.
-Yes.

1620
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,678
One minute.

1621
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,513
You have one minute!

1622
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,448
-One minute.
-He's ripping the mushroom.

1623
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,550
He's ripping the mushroom now.

1624
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,986
-That looks good.
-Look at that.

1625
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,189
You could've cut it
if you were going to rip it anyway.

1626
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,725
-The mushrooms could lose their moisture.
-The moisture?

1627
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,494
FRIED TEXTURE: ENOKI
GRILLED TEXTURE: KING OYSTER

1628
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,030
STIR-FRIED TEXTURE:
WING EAR, BUTTON, PYOGO, OYSTER

1629
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,600
-It looks fancy.
-He had a reason for those cuts.

1630
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,969
Nam-no pulls out a dish too.

1631
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,204
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds left.

1632
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,105
Thirty seconds.

1633
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,707
QUICKLY MIXES THE EGGPLANT PURÉE

1634
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,075
I hope the purée is good.

1635
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,944
He'll lay this out
and put mushrooms on top.

1636
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,313
-The sauce.
-You're running out of time.

1637
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,214
SPREADING IT FLAT!

1638
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,682
-Twenty seconds!
-Twenty seconds.

1639
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,150
BOK CHOY

1640
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,853
-Tae-hun will finish first.
-Chef Tae-hun is almost done.

1641
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,222
-Tae-hun is done!
-Tae-hun is finished!

1642
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,657
Nam-no!

1643
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,459
-It's still hot.
-Wrap up, Nam-no.

1644
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,261
-Butter.
-Eight. Seven.

1645
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,529
-Butter.
-Six. Five.

1646
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,865
-Four. Three.
-Butter.

1647
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,700
-Two. One.
-Two. One.

1648
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,903
Time's up!

1649
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,207
-Yes, Nam-no.
-Great work.

1650
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,642
THE MUSHROOM DISHES ARE READY

1651
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,644
Did you serve everything?

1652
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,878
It smells good.

1653
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,513
It's the most fragrant yet.

1654
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,848
-It smells good.
-This round, especially.

1655
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,716
FOOD'S ON ITS WAY, BOSS

1656
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:23,085
I'm seriously crazy about mushrooms.

1657
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,056
-You like it more than meat.
-I do.

1658
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:31,327
And now, both mushroom dishes
are finished just for Ji-hwan.

1659
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,362
-The winner will be my number two, right?
-Yes.

1660
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,766
-To the winning chef, I will offer…
-Yes?

1661
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,936
…tickets to the premiere of <i>Boss</i>
for your entire restaurant staff.

1662
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,939
-My gosh.
-That's amazing.

1663
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,340
-To the entire staff.
-I'm jealous.

1664
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,574
How many people work for you?

1665
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,010
I started out with 5 but have 36 now.

1666
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,512
-Really?
-Thirty-six.

1667
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,981
I have 18 employees.

1668
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:52,949
Is that okay?

1669
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,817
We can always treat you.

1670
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,585
Just wait, everyone!

1671
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,720
WHO'LL GET THE TICKETS?

1672
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,990
Chef Tae-hun finished cooking first.

1673
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,758
It's Fake Yi-soo, the Seochon Boss.

1674
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,861
RIGHT UP JI-HWAN'S ALLEY
WITH ASSORTED MUSHROOMS

1675
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,299
CRUNCHY, SOFT, AND CHEWY,
3 DIFFERENT TEXTURES

1676
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,502
WITH CRUNCHY BOK CHOY
TO REFRESH HIS MOUTH

1677
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,773
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
FAKE YI-SOO, THE SEOCHON BOSS

1678
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,910
ADMIRING THE PILE OF MUSHROOMS

1679
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,478
How should he approach this?

1680
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,715
Have a bite of the king oyster mushroom
on top of the dish.

1681
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,185
It'll smell smoky.

1682
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,487
-Mmm.
-Look at him.

1683
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,623
-He loves mushrooms.
-He looks happy.

1684
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,926
That mushroom is definitely delicious.

1685
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,227
How did he do this?

1686
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,295
JUST FASCINATED

1687
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,064
Does it mean the texture is better?

1688
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,666
The texture is insane.

1689
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,301
It feels crunchy.

1690
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,902
-The texture?
-It's like that?

1691
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,638
It feels like
I'm chewing on delicious silk.

1692
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,008
It's like chewing on silk?
I've never heard that before.

1693
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,676
I've never bit on silk before.

1694
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,945
-Does it taste silky?
-It does!

1695
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,080
-It can taste silky.
-Silky.

1696
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,615
It's only for the noblemen.

1697
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,584
-I should try some later.
-Yes.

1698
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,152
What's next?

1699
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,654
-That's it.
-Wrap it with the king oyster.

1700
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,723
-Wrap it?
-He's been curious about this.

1701
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,326
-Around enoki?
-He wrapped it around enoki.

1702
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,927
He wrapped it around fried enoki.

1703
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,196
-It looks like cheese.
-Yes, it does.

1704
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,198
IN ONE SWIFT BITE

1705
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,302
He said he has never had deep-fried enoki.

1706
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,871
That must be good.

1707
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,873
-Deliciousness meets deliciousness.
-Yes.

1708
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,541
CRUNCH

1709
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,575
My gosh.

1710
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,845
-The boss is in shock.
-Yes.

1711
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,715
It's tough to express in words.

1712
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,621
HOW WILL HE EXPLAIN THIS?

1713
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,322
It's really good.

1714
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,892
-It's really good?
-It's really good.

1715
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,897
-Enoki is cheap, ordinary mushroom.
-It is.

1716
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,298
It only gets stuck in your teeth.

1717
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,599
It gets stuck.

1718
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,270
But once it's deep-fried,
no one can win against this.

1719
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,771
The enoki.

1720
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,842
-It's like the main character of the dish.
-I see.

1721
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,911
-It's the main character.
-It's the boss.

1722
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,579
-The enoki boss.
-The enoki boss.

1723
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:04,747
It becomes the lead role.

1724
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,849
Let me try just this.

1725
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,284
Is there meat in there?

1726
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,188
-This is so good.
-The flavor must change with the meat.

1727
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,824
This is so…

1728
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,058
This is so good.

1729
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,261
-He's amazed.
-This is really good.

1730
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,530
-I'm sorry, but this is currently…
-First place?

1731
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,967
Yes, in my heart,
because I love mushrooms that much.

1732
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,669
It's the first place in his heart.

1733
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,604
-So far.
-Yes, so far.

1734
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:31,273
-He hasn't tried Chef Nam-no's dish yet.
-No.

1735
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,210
Does it taste greasy? I've been curious.

1736
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,444
Not at all.

1737
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,046
-Not at all?
-It's not greasy?

1738
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,882
If this is greasiness,
I can keep taking it.

1739
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,250
Really?

1740
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,018
-What a compliment.
-If that's greasy,

1741
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,553
he can keep eating greasy food.

1742
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,888
I wonder what the bok choy is like.

1743
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,225
He tries a piece of bok choy.

1744
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,826
It's a palate cleanser.

1745
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,595
GULPING

1746
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:55,264
He killed it in hot water,
but it's still fresh.

1747
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,565
It must've had marsh snail juice.

1748
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,801
-Maybe it did.
-It must've had that juice.

1749
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,871
-The dead bok choy came alive.
-It came back alive.

1750
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,906
Look at that.

1751
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,008
-This has to be good too.
-What's that like?

1752
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,644
Can you sense three different textures?

1753
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,713
I honestly am not sure if there are three.

1754
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,081
It's different from your intention.

1755
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,650
-No, it went as I planned.
-But I do know this.

1756
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:15,718
This pair is good,

1757
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:16,819
this other pair is good,

1758
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,053
and so is this pair.

1759
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,358
-It's something with superb balance.
-I see.

1760
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:25,161
Woo-jin got out of his seat.

1761
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,997
-Is it that good?
-He isn't sure about the texture, though.

1762
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,665
He's eating a lot of that dish.

1763
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,100
He'll get full soon.

1764
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,334
Are there no downsides?

1765
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,936
-Not at all?
-No downsides?

1766
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,070
It must be great, then.

1767
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:38,374
But I think this will be
another menacing dish.

1768
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,442
Next, Junggok-dong Maniac.

1769
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,647
DEEP-FRIED WHOLE OYSTER MUSHROOM
FILLED WITH WOOD EAR AND SHRIMP

1770
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,316
WITH RICH BROWN BUTTER SAUCE

1771
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,753
AND LOTS OF EGGPLANT PURÉE

1772
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,124
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
JUNGGOK-DONG MANIAC

1773
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,458
Tae-hun.

1774
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,693
May I sprinkle this?

1775
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,929
-No, you can't.
-Please?

1776
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,464
What's up?

1777
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,667
I was begging him to let me sprinkle this.

1778
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,168
-Smoked paprika.
-He wants to use that.

1779
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,369
-For his dish?
-Yes.

1780
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,038
You know, I want to give points

1781
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,007
-to how passionate he is.
-I see.

1782
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:12,908
Can he use it, then?

1783
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,744
-If it's okay with him.
-Yes, of course.

1784
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:19,682
-It's fine if that's what he wants.
-The boss wants this.

1785
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,251
Did you enjoy your side dish?

1786
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,454
-"Did you enjoy your side dish?"
-The side dish?

1787
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,157
It's all about his spirit.

1788
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,326
-That's rough.
-That's Junggok-dong Maniac.

1789
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,994
That was just a side dish.

1790
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,862
Did you enjoy the side dish?

1791
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:34,997
It smells so…

1792
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,932
It's like sesame oil.

1793
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,767
He says, "This is the main dish, boss."

1794
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,573
WHOA, BOSS

1795
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,675
Watch it! You're with the boss!

1796
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,011
Are you trying to hurt him?

1797
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,312
It was an assassination attempt!

1798
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,781
-Are you all right, Boss?
-I'm sorry, Boss!

1799
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,683
-I appreciate the energy.
-Gosh.

1800
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,151
THE BOSS IS RATHER POSITIVE…

1801
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,219
You tried to drown him.

1802
01:10:58,187 --> 01:10:59,488
He's sprinkling a lot on.

1803
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,390
-Isn't that too much?
-Just that one.

1804
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,325
-I think he came to kill the boss.
-Wipe it again.

1805
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,227
Please enjoy the main dish, Boss.

1806
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:06,996
-The main dish?
-Thank you.

1807
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,798
-It's filled with shrimp.
-There's shrimp inside.

1808
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,333
Look at that.

1809
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,239
-I wonder if it's cooked well.
-Oh, my.

1810
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,575
-"Oh, my"?
-"Oh, my"? Why?

1811
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:20,943
It smells amazing.

1812
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,879
Yes, he made eggplant purée too.

1813
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,382
He worked hard on that.

1814
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,550
It's an adventurous dish,
just as you like it, Boss!

1815
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,387
I don't want any adventures
for my mushroom dish.

1816
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,656
-Don't ruin the mushrooms.
-Just make them delicious.

1817
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,591
-He took it as a challenge.
-Don't do that.

1818
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,925
This smells amazing.

1819
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:39,094
-The mushroom.
-I wonder what the texture is like

1820
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,230
-with mushroom and shrimp.
-Right.

1821
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,766
He took a big bite of it.

1822
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,367
It probably has mushroom juice inside.

1823
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,336
-Yes.
-And eggplants.

1824
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,005
He continues to eat without a word.

1825
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:54,243
You made the other one
by coating the outside with shrimp too.

1826
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,146
<i>-Yes, I covered it with a layer of shrimp.</i>
<i>-So two layers of shrimp.</i>

1827
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,280
That one should be better.

1828
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,716
Maniac says the other one's better, Boss.

1829
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,253
Isn't that a bit too big?

1830
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,854
Can you fit it in your mouth?

1831
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,790
TAKES A BIG BITE

1832
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:10,359
Boss!

1833
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,161
That's how you should eat it.

1834
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,362
-That's how you eat it.
-That's it.

1835
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,697
-It looks good.
-In one bite.

1836
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,166
I wonder if it goes well
with the eggplant sauce.

1837
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,535
I wonder if the eggplant purée is good.

1838
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,403
NERVOUS

1839
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,005
ALSO NERVOUS

1840
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,573
It's perfect.

1841
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,141
That's perfect?

1842
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,976
RELIEVED

1843
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:31,847
I imagine lots of things, but I've never
imagined a taste like this before.

1844
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,717
-It was unexpected?
-It's a neck-and-neck competition.

1845
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:37,052
-What about that?
-You must like the sauce.

1846
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,421
-The brown butter sauce.
-Brown butter.

1847
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,324
This is so delicious.

1848
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,127
That's it.

1849
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,164
MMM

1850
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,667
He's about to finish that.

1851
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,168
YES

1852
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,404
He really loves mushrooms.

1853
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,807
-Ji-hwan will finish everything.
-He will.

1854
01:12:58,874 --> 01:12:59,975
Enough is enough.

1855
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,445
HE'LL WRAP UP HERE
FOR THE ANXIOUS WOO-JIN

1856
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,714
Next, Fake Yi-soo, the Seochon Boss.

1857
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,117
MMM

1858
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,054
-It's good.
-What does it feel like?

1859
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,256
I added a bit of seasoning.

1860
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,825
Deep-fried enoki.

1861
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,794
Woo-jin has never had deep-fried enoki.

1862
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,195
ISN'T IT GOOD?

1863
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:21,663
LAUGHING

1864
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,232
CHUCKLING

1865
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,835
Wrap it with the king oyster mushroom
and have it together.

1866
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,606
-Like this?
-You have to try it like that.

1867
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:31,807
The combo.

1868
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,009
THE BROWS OF TRUTH

1869
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,211
The texture of the mushroom is great,
isn't it?

1870
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:40,115
I've never had mushrooms
in such different textures and flavors.

1871
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,517
FEELING PROUD

1872
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,886
You used mushrooms
we're already familiar with,

1873
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,188
but once you added oil, heat,

1874
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,591
tossing of the pan, and your skills,
it made the flavor even richer.

1875
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,029
-It's everything good about mushrooms.
-Yes.

1876
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,864
-Let me try this too.
-All right.

1877
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,500
It's different from anything you imagine.

1878
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:01,703
-The butter.
-Yes, the butter. Junggok-dong Maniac.

1879
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,706
He tried the eggplant purée first.

1880
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,642
Is it all right?

1881
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:11,413
-I saw you making this despite the heat.
-Yes, it was hot.

1882
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,582
But I understand why you did that.

1883
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:17,352
As you mentioned before, it has
the smokiness of roasted sweet potatoes.

1884
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:20,856
That flavor is all inside this purée.

1885
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,692
I don't like sweets too much,
but I can love something like this.

1886
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:24,827
Thank you, Boss.

1887
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,930
Wait, he's supposed to be your boss.

1888
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,499
-He's another gang.
-That's another gang.

1889
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:33,735
-I wanted to know what this was like.
-Was it burnt?

1890
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:38,640
It has such a rich flavor,
as if you boiled this for a long time.

1891
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:43,445
It tastes luxurious
when it meets with this mushroom.

1892
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:46,081
I see why you said this was unimaginable.

1893
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,350
The one with shrimp on the outside.

1894
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,620
A different genre. Try the new genre.

1895
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,556
Let me coat it with more sauce.

1896
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,125
Please be good.

1897
01:14:58,293 --> 01:14:59,528
Mmm.

1898
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:00,796
It must be good.

1899
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,265
This is a dish you have to eat in a bite.

1900
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,435
It feels satisfying
when your mouth is full.

1901
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,504
It's really good.

1902
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,572
-It's really good?
-It is.

1903
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,742
This purée, this sauce,

1904
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,711
and that finishing touch, right?

1905
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,513
I get why you did that.

1906
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,751
It felt like many train cars
with mushroom flavors just swooshed by.

1907
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:25,254
It was amazing.

1908
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,555
It's another close round.

1909
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,091
Please make your decision.

1910
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,626
<i>Press one for Yoon Nam-no</i>

1911
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,661
<i>and two for Lim Tae-hun.</i>

1912
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,397
Honestly speaking, I had a bite
of something I always dreamed of.

1913
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:38,400
-I see.
-A mushroom dish I only dreamed of eating.

1914
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:39,668
That's a great compliment.

1915
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,303
SQUEEZE

1916
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,439
-I pressed the button.
-He pressed it.

1917
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,208
Let's see the result.

1918
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:48,977
-I can't tell.
-Who did Ji-hwan choose?

1919
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,747
Ji-hwan the mushroom lover.

1920
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:55,250
-The premiere!
-Will it be Tae-hun or Nam-no?

1921
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,686
Which chef will become your number two?

1922
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,589
Is it Lim Tae-hun or Yoon Nam-no?

1923
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:03,825
Which one of the two restaurants
will get to go to the premiere?

1924
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,427
Let's find out.

1925
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,628
Who's the winner?

1926
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:07,996
Who did he choose?

1927
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,531
LIM TAE-HUN WINS

1928
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,767
CHEF LIM TAE-HUN'S
FAKE YI-SOO, THE SEOCHON BOSS WINS

1929
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,268
Lim Tae-hun wins!

1930
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,204
THE MUSHROOM ROUND WAS INTENSE

1931
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,875
I'll give him the tickets to the premiere
just as I promised.

1932
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,777
DISAPPOINTED, HAPPY

1933
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:24,947
-It was absolutely delicious.
-Thank you!

1934
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,448
-Was it?
-It was so good!

1935
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,216
THANK YOU, BOSS!

1936
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,552
Chef Nam-no's mushroom dish

1937
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,788
was a delicious mushroom dish,

1938
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:36,124
-but they didn't feel like mushrooms.
-Rather?

1939
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,994
But Chef Tae-hun's dish

1940
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,130
-went all out with mushrooms.
-He did.

1941
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:45,267
I definitely preferred it that way.

1942
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,270
You should've kept the mushroom as is.

1943
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:51,673
Please put a star on Chef Tae-hun!

1944
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,041
CONGRATULATIONS

1945
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,844
This is Tae-hun's second star!

1946
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,713
-He wins a star.
-Congratulations!

1947
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,648
CONGRATULATIONS

1948
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,317
-It's from Ji-hwan!
-Boss!

1949
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,453
-It was delicious.
-Thank you.

1950
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,923
THANK YOU FOR INVITING US
BOSS WAS REALLY FUN

1951
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,725
Please welcome today's guests,

1952
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,760
Kwon Yul and Kim Jae-wook!

1953
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,195
He's a newlywed husband.

1954
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,162
Does she have a nickname?

1955
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,797
My cohabiter?

1956
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,866
He feels too awkward
to talk about his wife.

1957
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,267
I see some cola there.

1958
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:20,335
I FEEL SHY, SO STOP ASKING

1959
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,304
Jae-wook and I are both playing Salieri,

1960
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,439
and I want you to show off your talents.

1961
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,974
Theres only one way to win.

1962
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,010
Be born as Hyun-suk in your next life.

1963
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,111
Jeez.

1964
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,380
I feel very envious and jealous.

1965
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,482
The battle between
Mozart and Salieri of the show.

1966
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:34,816
MOZART'S SALT SYMPHONY

1967
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,084
That's it!

1968
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,519
If Hyun-suk does it, he'll do it too.

1969
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,655
-He's using his hand!
-He's using his hand!

1970
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:40,989
BRAVO

1971
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,191
-My Lord!
-He's praying in agony.

1972
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,793
The long-awaited mentor-protégé battle.

1973
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,828
<i>Daddy, please lose</i>

1974
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,998
I also only have one star.

1975
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,333
A FIGHT AMONG CHINESE CHEFS

1976
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,701
His hands tremble in anger.

1977
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,269
I've never trembled like this.

1978
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,238
Eun-yeong is doing great.

1979
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,205
WOW

1980
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:58,473
This tastes amazing!

1981
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,242
HOW WILL THE MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ ROUND END?

1982
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:06,214
He surely is a genius.

1983
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,584
That's why we call him Mozart.

1984
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,765
