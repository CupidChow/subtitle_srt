1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,184
We're here today with the extraordinary
Kwon Yul and Kim Jae-wook.

2
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,821
Jae-wook made his break
with the show <i>Coffee Prince.</i>

3
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,957
-It's a classic.
-It is.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,627
-It was a huge hit among the young.
-It really was.

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,363
But among our chefs, there is someone

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,166
who isn't very fond of him.

7
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,335
-He even holds a grudge.
-Who is it?

8
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,671
-He said Jae-wook ruined his life.
-Who?

9
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,407
-Whose life was ruined?
-Sung-jun?

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,842
-Why?
-It's that guy?

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,912
He puts himself into every narrative.
He always tries to get involved.

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,515
-What's wrong?
-I watched <i>Coffee Prince</i> when I was young,

13
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,450
and thought Jae-wook was really cool,

14
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,785
and wanted to open a café later.

15
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,820
Eventually, I opened one

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,056
and ended up going broke.

17
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,191
It was the darkest time of my life.

18
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,326
Poong, you know what it's like, right?

19
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,796
Why are you suddenly asking me?

20
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,799
He also had to close down his café.
Were you also inspired by the show?

21
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,368
The actual place is in Hongdae,
across from Theater Sanwoollim.

22
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,236
-It's nearby.
-I used to walk by that

23
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,972
and think to myself,
"I'll open a cool café like that too."

24
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,041
-Dear me.
-I'm sure everyone around that time

25
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,211
-had that thought on their minds.
-Everyone wanted that.

26
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,880
Jae-wook had impacted the lives
of these two men.

27
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:25,485
-I remember now. It was <i>Coffee Prince.</i>
-It cost them a lot.

28
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,489
One great thing about Jae-wook is that
he actually learns to do the job

29
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,324
whenever he takes on a new role,

30
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,593
no matter what the character's job is.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,496
-If you had to play a chef…
-Yes?

32
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,264
…who would you like to consult?

33
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,799
WHO AMONG THEM
WILL HE LEARN FROM?

34
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,635
Who do you want the character to be like?

35
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,037
The reference is important.

36
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,939
If the genre is comedy…

37
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,407
-If it is comedy?
-Then,

38
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,942
I would go to these two.

39
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,144
-Including me?
-These two?

40
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,646
POONG & HYUN-SUK ARE A THING NOW

41
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,684
-These two would be perfect references.
-You were Poong of <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>!

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,320
-Poong makes sense, though.
-The Poong of <i>Culinary Class Wars.</i>

43
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:04,190
Not only is Chef Hyun-suk good at his job,
but he also has a great sense of humor.

44
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,392
One of our chefs looked disappointed

45
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,495
-at Jae-wook's answer.
-What?

46
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,532
That chef said,
"Jae-wook looks great in a chef's coat."

47
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,969
"If anyone had to play
a cool-headed chef like myself,

48
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,571
I'd love to have him play me."

49
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,074
-"Cool-headed"?
-Who do you think said this?

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,409
Who could've said this?
And it was their own words.

51
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,478
Was it Chef Chinglai? Who?

52
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,180
-Jong-won, right?
-Chef Jong-won?

53
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,448
Did you say this?

54
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,450
I didn't word it like that, though.

55
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,619
-So it was you.
-But you said it.

56
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,322
I've been a huge fan
since his <i>Coffee Prince</i> days,

57
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,225
and I thought he would be
the perfect character as a chef

58
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,262
-who was kind of cool and standoffish.
-Thank you.

59
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,797
-You two have similar hairstyles.
-They feel similar.

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,000
-They have the same energy.
-Yes.

61
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,269
-A very authentic French chef.
-I want to play that.

62
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,373
He could play a sous-chef
who works for an elderly master chef,

63
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,608
the chef of a famous restaurant
with three Michelin stars.

64
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,343
-He's writing your character.
-Yes.

65
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,280
But let's say, he lives alone.

66
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,649
He lives alone and he's super lonely.

67
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,984
Why does he have to be lonely and alone?

68
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,287
-He has to be. Guys like that should be.
-Listen.

69
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,489
We already have this character going,

70
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,858
so stop adding your crazy ideas.

71
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,660
I'm a webtoon artist, man!

72
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,564
-I'm a webtoon artist, and you're a chef!
-He could put in his two cents.

73
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,667
You all are chefs, and I'm an artist.
I even worked as a scriptwriter!

74
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,102
-That's true.
-I'm right.

75
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,004
-Why do you keep saying that?
-He was a writer!

76
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,407
I'm trying to cast him as that character.

77
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,743
Jae-wook must be the type of person

78
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,613
who's very meticulous and thorough.

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,784
He has a routine he sticks to
every single morning.

80
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,786
-His morning routine.
-Successful people always have one.

81
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,287
As soon as I wake up,

82
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,857
-I drink two cups of warm water.
-Two cups.

83
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,627
And I take some probiotics
with the second cup.

84
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,029
Then I make some coffee.

85
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,931
-It's all about that coffee.
-Yes.

86
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,435
After that, I go out for a run,
between 3 km to 5 km.

87
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,771
That's how I start my day,
and I made a habit out of that.

88
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,941
Once I did that,
I was able to maintain my condition.

89
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,943
-It's a good thing.
-His routine has good vibes.

90
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,478
The good vibes routine.

91
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,580
-What about you, Chef Jong-won?
-You have one.

92
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,150
I take my vitamins and make some coffee

93
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,119
-along with some music.
-Do you work out?

94
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,788
-I do. I'm still doing CrossFit.
-What do you do?

95
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,690
He does CrossFit in the morning?

96
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,661
The guys with good vibes
both have refreshing routines.

97
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,730
-How elegant.
-I should learn from them.

98
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,033
-What about the anti-good vibes?
-Wouldn't they also shower and stuff?

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,469
-Nam-no?
-As soon as I wake up,

100
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,639
-I pop a can of soda.
-See? He drinks soda.

101
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,974
Because he hasn't recovered
from his dinner last night.

102
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,510
HIS ROUTINE HAS A GOOD REASON

103
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,479
The late-night snack hasn't been digested.

104
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:43,249
I need that carbonated drink
to open up my throat for the day.

105
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,817
-You do it with soda?
-Exactly.

106
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,519
My routine is the same for this show.

107
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,154
-I finished this.
-Already?

108
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,922
You already finished that?

109
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,524
-Yes.
-That's his usual routine.

110
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,327
HE'S THE FIRST ONE AT THE STUDIO

111
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,229
TO START HIS DAY
WITH A CAN OF SODA

112
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,066
And then I microwave the bite-size
corn dogs that I keep in the freezer.

113
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,567
Bite-size corn dogs?

114
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,537
-He must feel snacky.
-Yes, you digested your late-night snack.

115
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,173
HE STAYS HIS SIZE
BY KEEPING HIS ROUTINE

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,341
I get it.

117
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,909
What's your routine, Sung-jun?

118
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,878
I open the food delivery app
as soon as I get up.

119
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,747
-The delivery app?
-Is it open in the morning?

120
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,582
-As soon as you're up?
-Of course.

121
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,217
What do you order?

122
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,653
-Hamburger, fried chicken, or pizza.
-Are you serious?

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,222
-That's impressive. In the morning?
-After I order the food,

124
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,091
-I have to wait about 30 minutes, right?
-Yes.

125
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,759
I do something very important then.

126
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,661
-What do you do?
-I look up my name

127
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,530
on different online communities.

128
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,968
"Have I gotten canceled overnight?"

129
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,138
If nothing comes up,
I think, "I survived another day."

130
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,240
I look up others
once my safety is guaranteed.

131
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,811
-You look up others after your name?
-To see if anything happened?

132
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,847
It's to check and see if people
like Chef Nam-no had another ad gig.

133
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,950
To see if anything good happened
to others without his knowledge.

134
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,186
-Your rival chefs.
-See if they held any events,

135
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,420
then what I can do instead.

136
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,423
HOW ABOUT BITE-SIZE CORN DOGS?

137
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,360
By then, the food arrives,
so I start my day by eating that.

138
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,161
I'm sure Chef Ho-young has a routine.

139
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,831
My routine is healthier than you'd expect.

140
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,033
I get up and take a pill
for my high blood pressure.

141
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,571
A ROUTINE TO SURVIVE
AND LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE

142
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,207
-It's for his health.
-It isn't for health. You're a patient.

143
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,243
-For high blood pressure and cholesterol.
-He must survive first.

144
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,045
-High cholesterol?
-Do you take meds

145
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,748
-for high blood pressure and cholesterol?
-Yes, I take those first,

146
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,616
then I go out to exercise.

147
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,884
-So you exercise.
-He jogs.

148
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,252
In about a decade,

149
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,589
these two will be forced to join
this kind of lifestyle.

150
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,425
But these two
ruin their bodies in the morning, right?

151
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,961
I go crazy at night,

152
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,896
and then regret my decision
in the morning.

153
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,799
I can stay in this shape
because I constantly repeat that process.

154
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,702
Jae-wook, I also hear
that you can eat like a horse.

155
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,570
-Do you eat a lot?
-We heard that.

156
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,173
I'm not someone who eats small portions.

157
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,877
He even eats <i>ramyeon</i> the night
before an important work event.

158
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,245
-What?
-He even does that?

159
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,447
Getting puffy makes me look

160
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,015
better.

161
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
WHAT NOW?

162
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,885
He would look puffy after <i>ramyeon.</i>

163
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,453
-I don't do it every day, though.
-No?

164
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,789
When I start my day early,
end late at night,

165
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,957
return home, and look in the mirror,

166
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,993
I look like a martial arts athlete

167
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,462
just before their weigh-in
with these sunken cheeks.

168
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,431
My face looks that gaunt.

169
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,333
So if I don't eat something
that makes me look bloated the next day,

170
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,069
my cheeks won't look normal by morning.

171
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,305
And this is my non-puffy face.

172
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,741
WE KNEW YOU LOOKED THINNER TODAY

173
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,609
He doesn't gain weight
even if he eats a lot.

174
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,212
-I'm jealous of his metabolism.
-I'm jealous too.

175
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,113
All right, then.

176
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,317
We're about to take a look
through Jae-wook's fridge.

177
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,085
-You live alone, don't you?
-Yes.

178
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,456
I've been living alone for 17 years now.

179
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,591
He's a hearty eater with good vibes,

180
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,760
so I'm sure he keeps
lots of food in the fridge.

181
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,361
I don't think it's too little.

182
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,397
See? I told you.

183
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,165
And now, what does Jae-wook eat?

184
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,634
-We present his fridge!
-Fridge!

185
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,636
-Boing.
-Wow.

186
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,905
-And he lives alone.
-Look at that.

187
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,774
-We present his fridge!
-Fridge!

188
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,845
-It looks neat.
-And he lives alone.

189
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,948
-Everything looks neat.
-Most people don't keep these containers.

190
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,317
-Most people stash it in a plastic bag.
-That's true.

191
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,685
You keep things very neat.

192
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,088
-Look at the side dishes.
-Look at the side dishes on the top shelf.

193
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,091
-Those were made by my mother.
-Your mother?

194
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,793
I don't make side dishes myself.

195
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,861
Is she a good cook?

196
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,929
She's an excellent cook.

197
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,299
-Shishito peppers.
-These are great for those who live alone.

198
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,068
Do you also cook?

199
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,304
-I do think it's fun to cook.
-Probably because

200
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,772
-your mother is a good cook.
-Yes.

201
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,242
What's the one thing
she's the best at making?

202
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,110
There are too many of them.

203
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,812
-Too many?
-Yes.

204
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,348
There's a braised chicken dish she makes.

205
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,149
-Braised chicken?
-Yes.

206
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,485
-Is this it? Braised chicken.
-Braised chicken.

207
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,821
I see. I don't see any soup here.

208
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,723
No, it doesn't have any soup.

209
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,292
-I thought it'd be brown.
-It looks a bit like…

210
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,927
It doesn't have that chicken smell.

211
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,596
It has a subtle sweetness to it,

212
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,133
and that's how I usually like my food,
something not too strong.

213
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,334
Only this much sweetness.

214
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,803
Do you know the recipe for this?

215
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,039
-I know how to make it too.
-You do?

216
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,608
Can you share the recipe just as Yul did?

217
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,144
There isn't much to it,

218
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,078
but it's a secret.

219
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,248
-I can't tell you.
-He won't share.

220
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,150
He's the first
who said the recipe was a secret.

221
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,252
HEHE, IT'S A SECRET

222
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,954
It's nothing grand.

223
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,556
But I don't want to reveal it.

224
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,624
All right, then. That's inconvenient.

225
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,694
-Let's guess the recipe.
-Inconvenient?

226
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,362
Why can't you just share it?

227
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,899
Our chefs will begin to analyze it.

228
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,869
-They should find out.
-Let's find the secret behind the recipe.

229
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,238
Look at this.

230
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,575
The fridge owner is very cautious.

231
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,376
-He didn't want to share.
-It's nerve-racking.

232
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,445
It tastes like green onion.

233
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,980
-Do you taste green onion?
-A lot of it.

234
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,182
All I smell is green onion.

235
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,484
It smells very much like green onion.

236
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,220
Sesame oil and ginger, right?

237
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,722
-Sesame oil and ginger.
-And sesame.

238
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,725
Something like cooking wine or rice wine.
The sweetness is from that.

239
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,127
I do know
that there's no starch syrup in it.

240
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,030
Even I can guess like that.
She also didn't use red pepper powder.

241
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,633
-And no truffle oil.
-There are lots of omissions.

242
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,602
How about pear juice?

243
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,270
-Or is it cola?
-No pear juice was used.

244
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,139
-It wasn't used.
-I didn't think it was used.

245
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,175
Chicken wings are tiny, aren't they?

246
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,944
So the flesh slips off the bones
if they're cooked too long,

247
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,446
but this retained its texture.

248
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,617
It must've been cooked for a short time
compared to regular braised dishes.

249
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,853
-Without too much sauce.
-With some whole peppers.

250
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,490
-Did anyone guess one of the key aspects?
-The secret.

251
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,327
-She surprised me with the rice wine.
-Rice wine.

252
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,064
-Green onions do play a big role.
-Green onions.

253
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,201
-And ginger. These three are key.
-I see.

254
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,136
-Those were the key ingredients.
-Yes.

255
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,605
I was also surprised when he said

256
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,575
these would've been cooked quickly
in a small amount of water.

257
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,111
I can't braise these for too long.

258
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,813
-He's our number one chef.
-The number one chef.

259
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,615
IT'S ME, THE 1ST PLACE
OF CHEF & MY FRIDGE

260
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,517
THEY SAVED THE SHOW'S REPUTATION

261
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,818
All right, then.

262
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,021
-We actually managed to guess a lot.
-You did.

263
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,355
-This was fun.
-Okay, then.

264
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,892
You also keep some rice here,
so do you not eat instant rice?

265
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,862
I prefer to eat freshly cooked rice.

266
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,196
-Do you make your own?
-I do.

267
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,297
That's not easy to do.

268
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,967
What are these? I see Japanese on them.

269
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,102
That's Monkfish liver.

270
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,872
Those aren't usually in my fridge,

271
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,307
but I decided to get some
after I knew I'd be on the show.

272
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,443
It's actually one of my favorite foods.

273
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,544
-Monkfish liver?
-It's really good.

274
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,845
-I love to eat that.
-Isn't it greasy?

275
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:24,350
So I wanted to ask the chefs
to make me something,

276
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,985
since this is a rare opportunity.

277
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,822
-You loved this so much that you got some.
-I did.

278
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,358
-Veggies. You must love vegetables.
-He has lots.

279
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,162
Green onion, napa cabbage,
mushroom, and carrot.

280
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,798
I like all kinds of vegetables,

281
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,966
-but I especially love green onion.
-Green onion.

282
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,902
I even grill some separately
and eat it as is.

283
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,437
What's that Spanish dish?

284
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,739
<i>-Calçot.</i>
<i>-Calçotada.</i>

285
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,141
-I love the sweetness of it.
-It tastes sweet when grilled.

286
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,744
-He knows exactly how good it is.
-He loves green onion.

287
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,878
-I do.
-Okay.

288
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,181
Let's look at his freezer.

289
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,783
-Some meat, and they're prepped.
-The meat. Yes.

290
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,352
Many people stash these as they are
after they buy some.

291
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,121
-Beef.
-Beef brisket.

292
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,423
It's probably boneless rib meat.

293
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,826
-They're ready.
-They're wrapped separately.

294
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,162
-He prepped all these all by himself.
-That's his personality.

295
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,665
-Do you also enjoy seafood?
-I do.

296
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,235
-Halibut. Are these surf clams?
-Manila clams? Surf clams.

297
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,972
-I often use the clams to make pasta.
-For pasta?

298
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,407
-Vongole?
-Yes, pasta vongole.

299
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,542
Let's look
at the room temperature ingredients.

300
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,611
-I see some <i>ramyeon.</i>
<i>-Ramyeon.</i>

301
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,081
He needs these
to make his face look puffy.

302
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,851
I'm seeing lots of Japanese sauces here.

303
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,818
Yes, for Japanese food.

304
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,622
My family and I lived in Japan
for a while when I was young.

305
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,591
-I see.
-So that's why.

306
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:43,095
Yes, and Japanese cuisine
is rather simple to make, so that's why.

307
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,897
That was all for Jae-wook's fridge.

308
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,133
FINISHED INSPECTING
JAE-WOOK'S FRIDGE

309
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,203
It's time to find out
what he's asking of you today.

310
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,405
Please reveal his orders.

311
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,174
What are his orders?

312
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,742
-Green onion prince.
-Green onion prince.

313
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,644
Because he loves green onion.

314
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,945
Not <i>Coffee Prince.</i>

315
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,448
He plainly asks you to use green onion.

316
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,016
Is this green onion product placement?

317
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:09,688
I don't think I've ever eaten a dish
with green onion as the main ingredient.

318
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:14,727
So I wanted to try a new dish
that brings out green onion to the front.

319
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,628
I see.

320
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,063
I have some inspiration,

321
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,832
but I already went in the last episode.

322
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,500
LOVING HIS SENSE OF HUMOR

323
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,068
GENIUS PROBLEMS…

324
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,837
The first order was green onion prince.

325
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,338
What's his second order?

326
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,707
A high-calorie dish
to look cute and puffy.

327
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,843
This is something you need.

328
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,411
A DISH TO PREVENT
HIS SUNKEN CHEEKS

329
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,980
-I like it.
-Because your cheeks get sunken?

330
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,717
I thought it'd be nice to eat something
that makes me look cute and puffy.

331
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,553
What does it mean to look cute and puffy?

332
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,489
We can't confirm
if he'll look cute and puffy, though.

333
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,457
I know I can make anyone look puffy.

334
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,359
THE PUFFINESS EXPERTS(?)

335
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,527
Can you get puffy as you eat?

336
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,763
Puffy in real-time.

337
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,298
-I love it.
-As you eat.

338
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,532
Poong looks excited.

339
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,401
THAT ROUND SOUNDS YUMMY

340
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,102
-His mouth is watering.
-Watering?

341
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,470
I'LL MAKE YOU ABSOLUTELY PUFFY

342
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,739
EXCITED WITH ANTICIPATION

343
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,709
We plan to conduct
another two versus two round.

344
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,011
<i>After our previous team round aired,</i>

345
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,148
many viewers wanted to see
these particular pairs…

346
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,984
-These new teams?
-…in another team round.

347
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,820
These are the pairs
requested by the fans of the show.

348
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,590
WHO WILL THEY BE?

349
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,060
The sassy female lead
meets the polished male lead,

350
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,495
-Kim Poong and Son Jong-won.
-That's dangerous.

351
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,564
-People wanted them.
-They're such an unlikely pair.

352
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,532
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

353
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,068
-People wanted them.
-Good one, Jong-won.

354
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,036
Is that okay, Jong-won?

355
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,605
I've been looking forward to it.

356
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,939
-Really?
-Yes, at one point,

357
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,774
if it's okay with Webtoon Artist Poong.

358
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,477
I'll put Prince Charming
on my shoulders and run.

359
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,779
NOT ON A WHITE HORSE

360
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,248
And the next team.

361
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,483
WHICH TWO ARE UP AGAINST THEM?

362
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,951
The Anti-Good Vibes Twins,

363
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,454
-Yoon Nam-no and Kwon Sung-jun.
-No way.

364
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,257
-They're the other team.
-We have a good chance.

365
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,591
So, Team Anti-Good Vibes?

366
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,427
We've fought as a team before, actually.

367
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,097
THEY TEAMED UP
IN THE RISOTTO ROUND

368
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm sorry I keep bringing it up,
but without that, we're cooked.

369
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,501
WHEN THEY WERE AWKWARD

370
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,303
-Will it be ready?
-Yes.

371
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,105
I can't watch this anymore.

372
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,009
-They had awful chemistry.
-We have a chance.

373
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,510
WILL THEY BE OKAY TODAY?

374
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,078
-Isn't this the first time?
-It is.

375
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,080
-The two Italian chefs.
-This is fun.

376
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,849
-The Italian chefs.
-Let's decide the orders.

377
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,051
Well, we already know
the perfect order for us.

378
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,220
I'm the go-to puffiness guy here,

379
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,389
and he's the cuteness of the show.

380
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,492
We should probably go with a
high-calorie dish to look cute and puffy.

381
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,027
-That's good.
-The high-calorie dish.

382
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,162
Just look at us.
We already look puffy, don't we?

383
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,297
THE ALREADY PUFFY BROTHERS

384
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,798
Lumps of puffiness.

385
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,400
-Right, lumps.
-Lumps?

386
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,236
-They also go for the high-calorie round.
-Really?

387
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,072
This automatically places Sam and Fabri.

388
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,341
-The Italian derby.
-Yes.

389
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:43,943
RISING ANTICIPATION

390
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,778
We're expecting fascinating matches today.

391
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,547
-This is going to be fun.
-Yes. All right, then.

392
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>This is the first round played</i>
<i>with ingredients from Jae-wook's fridge.</i>

393
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,055
The two princes of Italian cuisine

394
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:01,126
take on the challenge
for the green onion prince, Kim Jae-wook.

395
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,463
The original Italian chef
of the show, Sam Kim.

396
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,033
And the actual Italian chef, Fabri.

397
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,869
-He's the original?
-The two are up against each other.

398
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,105
This is their first time
fighting each other.

399
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,442
-I look forward to it.
-First of all, Fabri has three stars,

400
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,145
and two of the three were won
against other Italian chefs.

401
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,413
It shows that he's Italian.

402
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,881
Sung-jun and Hyun-suk.

403
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,516
If you take Sam down today…

404
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,752
-That's everyone.
-…you would've taken down

405
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,253
-all the Italian chefs.
-The true Italian.

406
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,123
I've become a killer

407
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,293
-of these fake Italian chefs.
-So he's a fake?

408
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,695
-He spelled it out.
-He announced it.

409
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,565
They're all fakes to an actual Italian.

410
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,570
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS:
GREEN ONION, BEEF BRISKET, ORANGE, RICE

411
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,505
My dish is called

412
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,640
Have Sam Green Onion.

413
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,509
-Have Sam Green Onion?
-Have Sam Green Onion?

414
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,046
-Have Sam Green Onion.
-He said he liked freshly cooked rice,

415
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,583
so I thought of making
green onion hot pot rice.

416
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,684
Hot pot rice? Gosh.

417
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,286
I'll also make another green onion dish
with some bulgogi seasoning.

418
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,622
-Bulgogi with green onion.
-Bulgogi with green onion?

419
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,157
I'll also make a salad.

420
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,092
-Green onion salad?
-And the green onion…

421
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,894
-Well, lastly…
-Lastly?

422
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,064
-What is it?
-To start and finish with green onion,

423
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,800
I'll make a toothpick out of it.

424
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,435
-How will he do that?
-A toothpick?

425
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,170
-By cutting a slice?
-What does he mean?

426
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,238
It's nothing hard.

427
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,073
It's just a gist
that I did something like it.

428
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,374
Just the shape?

429
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,343
He can probably make
green onion floss, though.

430
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,311
-Floss?
-He can turn it into floss.

431
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,480
You can floss with a slice of green onion.

432
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,283
So your dish will begin
and end with green onion.

433
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,519
-That's right.
-It's all green onion.

434
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,420
That's tough to beat.

435
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,356
CHEF FABRI'S INGREDIENTS:
GREEN ONION, SPAGHETTI, SURF CLAM, ORANGE

436
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,425
PICKLED GARLIC, OLIVE, WHITE WINE,
MAYONNAISE, WASABI, COARSE SALT

437
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,693
The dish I prepared is

438
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,163
Till Green Onion Does Fabri Part.

439
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,065
-Till Green Onion Does Fabri Part.
-Till Green Onion Does Fabri Part.

440
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,433
Till Green Onion Does Fabri Part.

441
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,602
He's going to cook with green onion
till death do him part.

442
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,071
That's what he means by that.

443
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,005
What's it like?

444
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,975
I'm going to cook
a whole meal by using green onion.

445
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,877
Green onion frittata,

446
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,512
green onion carpaccio,

447
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,414
and green onion ravioli.

448
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,716
I'll make all three for him.

449
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,087
Carpaccio is a dish
usually made with some kind of protein.

450
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,256
<i>-With meat or fish, right?</i>
<i>-Thin slices of meat or fish.</i>

451
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,426
-But I'll make it 100% with green onion.
-Green onion?

452
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:19,064
Ravioli is also a dish
made with fillings inside dough,

453
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,366
but instead of the dough,

454
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,734
I'll use green onion

455
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,905
and fill it with clams and spaghetti.

456
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:31,176
So it'll be a ravioli dish
that tastes like pasta vongole.

457
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,077
And now,

458
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,114
let us begin
the green onion prince round.

459
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,184
Chef Sam Kim is here today,
so determined that he'll even make

460
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,386
a toothpick with green onion.

461
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,690
But up against him is Chef Fabri,
who's even willing to stick around

462
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,426
until green onion does him part.

463
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:52,197
Which one of the two chefs will capture
the heart of the green onion prince?

464
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,868
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

465
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,102
Okay!

466
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,940
THE BIG GREEN ONION MATCH BEGINS

467
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,010
-Wait! No!
-No!

468
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,078
Wait!

469
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,249
THE ITALIAN TABOO:
BREAKING SPAGHETTI

470
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,319
WHOA!

471
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,557
FABRI BREAKS THE TABOO
AND TAUNTS SAM

472
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,259
He taunts Sam!

473
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,728
SCREAM!

474
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,630
SEIZES THE UPPER HAND

475
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,298
-He just snapped the pasta!
-Wait!

476
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,534
-You'll grind that?
-A lot of pieces flew out.

477
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,870
-I just made many old Italian ladies cry.
-No!

478
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,906
-You can't do that to pasta.
-Please don't do that.

479
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,341
-No!
-What's he going to do?

480
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,076
PLEASE STOP WATCHING,
ITALIAN LADIES…

481
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,511
He's grinding that?

482
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,979
He's grinding that.

483
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,981
-He's grinding it.
-My gosh.

484
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,417
He gave up on living as an Italian.

485
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,820
-I don't think you can go back to Italy.
-He can't. That was just…

486
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,222
TRUE MADNESS

487
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,857
CLICK

488
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,991
THE STOVE WON'T LIGHT

489
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,092
No, wait.

490
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,827
What's going on? What?

491
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,929
IS IT THE ITALIAN CURSE?

492
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,431
-Shouldn't you make rice first?
-Rice.

493
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,699
-Rice.
-Rice first.

494
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,100
Some pasta got into my pot.

495
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,069
-Rice first.
-Some pasta got into my pot.

496
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,205
-Dang it.
-Some pasta got into the pot.

497
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,975
He's sabotaging your dish.

498
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,545
1. PUT OLIVE OIL INTO A POT
AND STIR-FRY CHOPPED GREEN ONION

499
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,214
FABRI USES OLIVE OIL TOO

500
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,082
1. OIL PAN AND BOIL
GROUND SPAGHETTI

501
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,550
That's the worst.

502
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,552
-It's like risotto.
-That's what Italians detest.

503
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,087
He's supposed to boil pasta.

504
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,790
They dread the idea
of cooking pasta in a pan with water.

505
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,059
You're right. He's pouring water.

506
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,961
-What?
-What's he doing?

507
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,529
-Salt-roasting.
-Salt?

508
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,297
-That's salt?
-For green onion?

509
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,566
-Green onion.
-He spread salt on a pan.

510
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,669
-He cuts the green onions in line.
-Green onions.

511
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,639
Are you salt-roasting the green onion?

512
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,007
It tastes good over the salt.

513
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,209
-You had a salt-roast yesterday, right?
-It tastes clean.

514
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,446
It's not shrimp roasted over salt,
but green onion roasted over salt.

515
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,914
Not shrimp, but green onion.

516
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,482
You must've visited Eulwang-ri recently.

517
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,718
-Was he there yesterday?
-It's like we're there.

518
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,586
SAM MAKES BULGOGI SAUCE

519
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,121
SOY SAUCE, SESAME OIL

520
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,789
MINCED GARLIC, GROUND PEPPER

521
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,458
SUGAR, RICE WINE

522
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,095
MARINADING MEAT IN THE SAUCE

523
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,063
2. ADD GREEN ONION STRIPS
AND OLIVE OIL

524
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,800
Sam makes green onion strips
and mixes it with some meat.

525
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,202
That must be bulgogi.

526
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,436
PICKING UP

527
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,639
THIS TIME,
HE CUTS THEM INTO BIG PIECES

528
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,973
He's using lots of green onion.

529
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,241
STRAIGHT TO THE GRIDIRON

530
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,744
-What about rice? Why won't you make rice?
-You need to.

531
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,545
-You have to make rice.
-Yes, rice.

532
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,315
-Make the rice first. Rice.
-Hurry up and make the rice.

533
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,750
-Rice first.
-The hot stone pot rice.

534
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,917
The scorched rice is important.

535
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,121
He just stir-fried
green onion in it, right?

536
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,155
It'll smell like it.

537
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,225
He'll need just seven minutes
after it begins to boil.

538
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,027
He has to serve it later.

539
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,629
-Yes, he has to ring the bell later.
-He has to.

540
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,997
Jeez.

541
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,632
And… Gosh.

542
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,135
Things already feel hectic.

543
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,070
Fabri slices some green onion.

544
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,105
He makes thin slices.

545
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,875
He's using just the green part.

546
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,844
The green part has a nice smell.

547
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,749
Sam is broiling green onion
over the gridiron

548
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,351
and cooking some in the pan too.

549
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,220
It already tastes good
when you broil it like that.

550
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,822
-It's good.
-It gets sweet.

551
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,391
Are you going to broil those
and use it to make hot pot rice?

552
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,261
No, the broiled ones will be used as oil.

553
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,030
-The broiled ones?
-To add that scorched flavor.

554
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,565
3. ADD BROILED GREEN ONION
TO OLIVE OIL

555
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,801
REFILLING RIGHT AWAY

556
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,904
He keeps adding more of those.
He's now broiling those slices.

557
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,007
Sam is also using
a whole lot of green onions.

558
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,675
It smells so strong.

559
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,010
REEKING OF GREEN ONION

560
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,914
Putting those on top
will add such a fragrant smell.

561
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,283
-The ones that were almost burnt?
-It smells broiled.

562
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,152
FABRI GRABS AN ORANGE

563
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,822
-It's an orange.
-Orange peel.

564
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,191
The zest.

565
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,659
Orange zest.

566
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,329
He sliced orange zest, mixed it
with green onion, and topped it with oil.

567
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,564
Cooking oil?

568
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,733
-Cooking oil?
-Why is he using both?

569
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,102
-Why?
-Why is he using regular cooking oil?

570
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:53,405
-An Italian just used regular oil?
-It's for green onion oil.

571
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,707
He's making fragrant oil,

572
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,110
-a mix of green onion and orange.
-Why orange?

573
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,511
And why not just olive oil?

574
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,846
Because it's too strong.

575
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,014
-The smell of the oil?
-Yes.

576
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,683
SAM BEGINS
TO MAKE SALAD DRESSING

577
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,819
4. MIX SESAME OIL, VINEGAR,
SOY SAUCE, AND OLIVE OIL

578
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,788
HE FINISHES THE DRESSING
IN A FLASH

579
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,858
Chef Sam's also cutting an orange.

580
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,594
-Chef Sam uses an orange.
-Sam's using an orange too.

581
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,896
5. CUT ORANGE INTO SMALL PIECES
AND LEAVE IT IN THE DRESSING

582
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,031
I don't think he's using the zest.

583
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,835
He just put the orange over ice.

584
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,103
Yes.

585
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,139
-I guess it has to be served cold.
-Yes.

586
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,408
He added soy sauce
and sesame oil into the orange.

587
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,776
-What? To orange?
-To orange?

588
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,077
-Soy sauce and sesame oil?
-Really?

589
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,745
Does that recipe exist?

590
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,113
No, it doesn't.

591
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,915
Is this your personal creation?

592
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,383
-It's my personal creation.
-It is!

593
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,785
THIS IS SAM KIM'S CREATION

594
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,653
-He made his own creation.
-It's his creation.

595
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,323
-It's my personal creation.
-It's his personal creation.

596
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,626
CHOPPING

597
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,428
What's he chopping?

598
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,562
Pickled garlic.

599
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,732
-Pickled garlic.
-It's his mother's pickled garlic.

600
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,301
That's nice.

601
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,603
CHOPPED INTO SMALL PIECES
AND INTO A POT

602
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,505
Olive oil.

603
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,474
SURF CLAMS GO ON TOP

604
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,043
-Surf clams?
-Surf clams, to make pasta vongole.

605
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,578
Just that by itself would be good.

606
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,314
It flew up in the sky.

607
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,319
FOCUS ON ME

608
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,489
POPPING A BOTTLE
OF SPARKLING WINE

609
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,691
POURING OVER THE SURF CLAMS

610
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,160
Mamma mia!

611
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,996
<i>Fantastico!</i>

612
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,866
-He did that for showmanship?
-He did.

613
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,935
SAM CONTINUES TO COOK
THE GREEN ONION IN THE CHAOS

614
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,338
-It's so chaotic.
-Yes!

615
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,440
The green onion would be good by itself.

616
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,009
Is that okay?

617
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,445
-Shouldn't you open it and check?
-No?

618
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,881
-Is the rice going well?
-It's boiling.

619
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,249
It's burning.

620
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,650
-The cloth is burning!
-The cloth!

621
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,653
What's burning?
The lid is going round and round!

622
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,655
-The lid is spinning.
-The heat went off.

623
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,792
-Is it burnt?
-Leave it on low heat.

624
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,594
Low heat.

625
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,962
-One second.
-Low heat.

626
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,296
OBSESSED WITH LOW HEAT

627
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,931
-Low heat.
-Take a look.

628
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,932
The lowest.

629
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,302
-Lower it as much as you can.
-Okay, good.

630
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,172
MAKING THE FRITTATA BASE

631
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,542
Chef Fabri just mixed eggs and mayonnaise.

632
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,411
-Yes?
-But mayo is already made with egg yolks.

633
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,415
-He's so Korean now. He just mixes those.
-Yes. That's true. He put those in?

634
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,985
My gosh. Goodness.

635
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,754
And he talks like a Korean too.

636
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,290
Like a middle-aged Korean man.

637
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,692
OPENING SALT-ROASTED GREEN ONION

638
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,229
-The salt-roasted green onions are done.
-Salt-roasted green onions.

639
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,831
He's showing what he has done.

640
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,567
-Does that taste like anything?
-It looks salty.

641
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,136
-It won't be. He'll peel it.
-Will you use just the center?

642
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,338
-After peeling one layer?
-I think he'll do that.

643
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,474
-I'm so curious about that.
-After brushing off salt?

644
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,576
-I'm sure.
-What's he…

645
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,946
-The risotto. His risotto is burnt.
-The pasta is burnt!

646
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,314
Is that supposed to be fri-char-ta?

647
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,583
It's burnt.

648
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,252
-It's charred, so is it fri-char-ta?
-Is that it?

649
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,289
He's using just the center
of the salt-roasted green onion.

650
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,058
-The pasta. Wouldn't it burn?
-It's okay.

651
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,294
HE TURNS THE HEAT OFF FOR NOW

652
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,395
WASABI

653
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,234
THE GREEN ONION AND ORANGE OIL
HE PREVIOUSLY MADE

654
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,437
A SCOOP ON THE DISH

655
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,939
ANOTHER SCOOP ON THE GREEN ONION

656
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,274
AND MIX

657
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,277
The frittata.

658
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,680
That's the frittata?

659
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,548
Wait, will it be cooked in time?

660
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,984
WILL IT GET COOKED
WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT?

661
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,989
GREEN ONION OIL

662
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,791
He's making bulgogi.

663
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:36,861
-That's the green onion bulgogi.
-It's green onion bulgogi.

664
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,530
But green onion is the main ingredient.

665
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,131
There's more green onion than meat.

666
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,667
-It looks good.
-Green onion is the main ingredient.

667
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,336
Something smells burnt.

668
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,739
Something smells like burnt rice,
but I'm not sure if it's this or that.

669
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,674
-Is this it?
-Something smells burnt?

670
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,543
-No idea, but it smells burnt.
-What is it? Rice?

671
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,612
-Hyun-suk points it out.
-Many things are burning.

672
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,847
-Something smells burnt.
-Does it?

673
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,283
I don't know whose side it is,
but something smells burnt.

674
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,986
-Five minutes!
-Let me go out.

675
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,687
-It's a war.
-Yes.

676
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,656
-It's like a sports game.
-A round between Italian chefs.

677
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,958
Something smelled like it was burning.

678
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,827
Can you try that seemingly burnt pasta?

679
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,063
Let me check the bottom
and see if it's burnt or not.

680
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,865
I'll try just a little.

681
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,367
A CAUTIOUS BITE

682
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,102
Is it burnt?

683
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,237
Is it burnt?

684
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,574
-It's not. It's good.
-It's not?

685
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,509
-Is it good?
-Yes, and it's not burnt.

686
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,944
-Thank you.
-It looked burnt.

687
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,445
I wonder what it's like.

688
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,982
-This is oddly good.
-That's how he made pasta?

689
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,250
It tastes really good.

690
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,021
His bulgogi looks really good too.

691
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,857
I can't hold it back anymore,
so let me try some.

692
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,459
Let me try a bite of bulgogi
with some green onion.

693
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,994
You have 2 minutes and 53 seconds.

694
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,863
HE TRIES GREEN ONION BULGOGI

695
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,164
The bulgogi.

696
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,832
Would you like to have Sam more?

697
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,134
Sam more?

698
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,603
I'd like Sam more, no, a lot more!

699
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,904
WOW

700
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,272
It's really good!

701
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,242
The bulgogi looks so good.

702
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,178
SERVES IT RIGHT AWAY
AFTER A POSITIVE RESPONSE

703
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:05,817
7. SERVE GREEN ONION BULGOGI
AND TOP IT WITH STIR-FRIED GREEN ONION

704
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,686
-That has to taste good.
-I wonder what's in here.

705
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,621
MAKING GREEN ONION
CARPACCIO SAUCE

706
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,922
Olives?

707
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,892
Olives and orange juice.

708
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,729
6. MIX CHOPPED OLIVES. ORANGE JUICE, ZEST,
GROUND PEPPER, GREEN ONION-ORANGE OIL

709
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,397
This is so chaotic.

710
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,199
Look at him.

711
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,967
He's using a Korean kitchen knife.

712
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,470
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

713
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,172
Goodness, it's hard to make a living.

714
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,075
-Fifteen minutes fly by up there.
-Doesn't it?

715
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,710
He begins to serve his food.

716
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,913
Fabri begins to serve the food
with two minutes and 18 seconds left.

717
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,581
7. TOP GREEN ONION
WITH CARPACCIO SAUCE

718
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,485
GREEN ONION CARPACCIO, FINISHED

719
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,288
RIGHT, THE SURF CLAMS

720
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,489
Oh, no!

721
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,857
WHAT? WHY?

722
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,360
-It's burnt!
-It's burnt!

723
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,663
-This must've been what was burning!
-It's burnt!

724
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,131
He's in shock.

725
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,766
This was the burnt smell!

726
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,568
FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE SMELL

727
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,204
-Are those the fri-char-ta?
-The clams were burnt!

728
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,707
-These are thoroughly burnt.
-Are those the fri-char-ta?

729
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,942
The charred fri-char-ta?

730
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,244
-Surf and charred clams.
-Surf and charred clams?

731
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,913
The clams were mostly burnt!

732
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,082
Why didn't these open?

733
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,550
Burnt surf clams.

734
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,686
I'm sure the insides are fine.

735
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,188
-You have 1 minute and 30 seconds.
-The clams are gone.

736
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,990
-Oh, no.
-This is bad.

737
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,825
This looks bad.

738
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,727
-It looks bad.
-It looks bad?

739
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,063
-So that was the smell.
-Yes.

740
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,798
-It's a mess.
-He's in shock.

741
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,767
-That's pasta vongole?
-That?

742
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,368
He's using this much clam.

743
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,269
HAHAHA

744
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,575
LOSING HIS MIND(?)

745
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,445
You have 1 minute and 15 seconds.
These were burnt beyond repair.

746
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,480
-They're charred clams now.
-Yes, they are.

747
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,349
So that was the smell.

748
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,718
HE BEGINS TO SERVE THE SALAD

749
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,553
It looks pretty in the dish.

750
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,556
-Is that orange marinated in soy sauce?
-You have 2 minutes and 53 seconds.

751
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,590
-You're right.
-Bulgogi!

752
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,759
Orange in soy sauce sounds good.

753
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,561
That looks good.

754
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,062

757
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,172
It's still watery.

758
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,907
THE RICE IS STILL WATERY

759
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,941
You can boil it some more.

760
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,643
Just for a minute.

761
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,312
Fifty seconds!

762
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,014
-Shouldn't you open it? 50 seconds.
-He can't.

763
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,016
-Ring the bell slowly.
-Forty seconds!

764
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,719
-Ring the bell after him. Not now.
-Don't open the rice yet.

765
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,688
Freshly cooked rice just for Jae-wook.

766
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,790
He doesn't eat instant rice.

767
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,059
Fabri, please serve your dishes.

768
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,931

Make at least one piece. At least one.

775
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,912
His hair is about to turn gray.

776
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,948

00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,544
-That's just a regular toothpick.
-How is that a toothpick?

789
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,579
You're using a regular toothpick?

-Five.
-How are you different from Poong?

794
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,456
That's the green onion toothpick?
What is that?

795
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,392
It's a toothpick. It's just like a pencil.

796
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,697
HE TOPS IT WITH A PIECE OF
SURF CLAM HE MANAGED TO SAVE

797
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,765

803
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,510
-It's dark!
-The soup's dark!

804
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,045
-My gosh!
-It's ruined.

805
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,247
-It's over. What now?
-It's dark.

806
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,515
It looks like an herbal tonic!

807
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,417
-Yes, it's an herbal tonic.
-It looks dark!

808
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,052
What will he do about this?

809
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,422
-Time's up. That's the time.
-Ring the bell!

810
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,190
Ring the bell.

811
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,427
Who's going to ring the bell?
Why won't any of you ring it?

812
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,362
Ring the bell!

813
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,298
Why won't any of you do it?

814
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,732
-Ring the bell!
-It's okay.

815
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,435
-You can go first.
-He tells him to go first.

816
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,637
WANTS TO LET THE RICE STAND
VS WON'T LET HIM DO IT

817
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,739
-They tell each other to ring it first.
-You're done.

818
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,174
Ring it first, Fabri.

819
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,543
-Fabri rings the bell first.
-Everything is burnt.

820
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,145
Sam needs to ring it too.

821
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,846
This was an unprecedented situation.

822
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,548
SAM'S TRICK WAS SUCCESSFUL

823
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,117

824
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,852
-It took a while to finish.
-The craziest yet.

I guess something hit him in the mouth.

844
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:21,866
It's good.

845
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,234
-Is it?
-I see.

846
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,402
I'm glad.

847
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,005
The olives and especially the orange.

848
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,376
The orange zest
keeps everything in balance.

849
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,177
The texture is still there,

850
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,912
while the fragrance is brought out.

851
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:39,317
-It feels like an excellent appetizer.
-I see.

852
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,385
-It's good.
-It is?

853
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,954
-Thank you.
-It's really good.

854
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,357
Next, the frittata.

855
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,161
-I used green onion and mayonnaise.
-Mayonnaise?

856
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,195
STILL SOFT

857
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,364
It doesn't look like steamed eggs.

858
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,532
It's like cheese fondue.

859
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,300
-Or hot spring eggs.
-Yes.

860
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,935
HAS IT BEEN COOKED THOROUGHLY?

861
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,304
The creaminess is the key.

862
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,041
-The creamy…
-The creaminess is the key?

863
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,809
Yes, of course.

864
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,645
It's like an omelet, isn't it?

865
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,814
It's just like
rolled omelet with green onion.

866
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,984
-It tastes just like it.
-There's that dish.

867
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,254
<i>But it melts in my mouth</i>
<i>instead of the usual fluffy texture.</i>

868
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,588
Yes.

869
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,790
-Exactly.
-I can also smell

870
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,726
-a lot of mayonnaise in this.
-Mayonnaise.

871
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,494
That was the kick.

872
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,997
He keeps adding comments.

873
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,599
He must be quite anxious.

874
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,701
-Yes, exactly.
-It's good.

875
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,238
-This was the pasta he made, right?
-The main course.

876
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,108
-That's…
-Are those charred clams?

877
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,344
I have a question.
Do Italians grind pasta like that?

878
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,379
No.

879
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,647
Is it your personal creation?

880
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,450
-Personal creation?
-Is it your personal creation?

881
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,885
-It's Fabri's recipe.
-Your personal creation.

882
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,654
-Personal creation.
-It's Fabri's creation.

883
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,556
I'm getting teased until the end.

884
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,358
-The soup will taste very rich.
-The soup?

885
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,260
It must be quite rich.

886
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,329
It might be good.
Charred food can be good.

887
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,333
The clams were burnt on the outside,
so I'm not sure how it is on the inside.

888
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,204
He takes a bite.
We don't know what it's like.

889
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,605
CRUNCH

890
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,607
-Is this…
-It sounds like radish kimchi.

891
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,909
Yes, something sounds crunchy.

892
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,179
-It must be the green onion.
-He's laughing, but I don't know why.

893
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,149
-Did he find a piece of clam shell?
-Will he spit it out?

894
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,584
Will he spit it out?

895
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,552
WILL HE REALLY?

896
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,722
He just wiped his mouth.

897
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,224
-I thought he'd spit it out.
-Me too.

898
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,192
I thought he would dab his tears.

899
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,062
Does it smell burnt?

900
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,136
It smells a bit burnt.

901
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:41,105
-It… Does it?
-Yes, it does.

902
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,507
-It has to smell.
-Of course.

903
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,209
The texture of the green onion is great,
and it's delicious.

904
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,811
How's the clam meat?

905
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,380
-Yes, it's okay.
-The meat was saved.

906
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,549
-He shouldn't have used the soup.
-Yes, he shouldn't have.

907
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,219
Next, please try
Chef Sam Kim's Have Sam Green Onion.

CHEF SAM KIM'S
HAVE SAM GREEN ONION

913
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,800
-The toothpick is the most important.
-The toothpick.

914
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,403
What is this thing?

915
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,439
-Look at this. He's no different from me.
-Recently…

916
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,242
Recently, I saw something
on the hood of my car.

917
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,610
It was a mantis.

918
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,846
COLLAPSING

919
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,715
-It feels like déjà vu.
-A visual déjà vu?

920
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,418
I was surprised
as I was trying to open my car.

921
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,287
-It looks like it.
-I'm sorry.

922
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,189
HE CALMS DOWN AND RETRIES

923
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,058
BUT FAILS

924
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,893
It looks gross like a grasshopper.

925
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,828
-You said you'd make it with green onion.
-Wait.

926
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,330
You're like me. What is this?

927
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,867
I was going to serve it on this dish.

928
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,769
-Put it on the dish.
-On this dish.

929
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,871
What difference does that make?

930
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,473
Does it make a difference
when it's on the dish?

931
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,009
-The toothpick?
-How does that change anything?

932
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,145
-Actually, my plan was…
-Serve it on the dish.

933
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,181
It looks more like a mantis.

934
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,519
-It's like an insect collection.
-Sam has become Poong.

935
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,020
What is this?

936
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,290
The toothpick was disappointing.
Let's make that clear now.

937
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,661
This isn't one of his dishes,
so let me pull it out like this.

938
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,763
Now, what should he begin with?

939
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,667
Please try the salad,
both green onion and orange at once.

940
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,735
Thank you.

941
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,104
This is the appetizer.

942
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,706
He broiled the green onion first.

943
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,041
It looks so good.
That's something I'd love.

944
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,676
-Orange.
-It looks good.

945
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:27,945
Orange and green onion.

946
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:31,616
RESPONDING RIGHT AWAY

947
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,484
He can't hide anything, either.

948
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,154
-He's a very straightforward guy.
-He must be.

949
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,924
THE FRANK MR. JAE-WOOK

950
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,461
It's my first time trying
orange with green onion,

951
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,528
and they go so well.

952
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,597
Does orange
really go well with green onion?

953
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,199
Fabri used orange zest.

954
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,934
-The zest.
-Yes, it had a good balance too.

955
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:53,237
-But that dish has the actual fruit.
-Yes.

956
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,806
Oranges taste better
when it's served cold,

957
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,409
<i>-so I had put it over ice.</i>
<i>-That was why.</i>

958
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,145
Was that why the green onion
had a better texture? It was cold?

959
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,982
We had no idea, because green onion
was never the main ingredient.

960
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,917
That recipe is his personal creation.

961
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,220
Is this your creation
or an Italian recipe?

962
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,355
-It's my personal creation.
-It's his creation.

963
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,890
He's stuck on that.

964
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,725
Because of what Eun-yeong said.

965
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,626
What's next?

966
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,928
-Please try the hot stone pot rice.
-Open it up.

967
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:18,996
Finally, the rice.

968
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,998
DID IT TURN OUT NICELY?

969
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,667
-All right.
-Okay. This is it.

970
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,402
-This rice.
-Let me open it.

971
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,237
-Yes, please open it.
-I wonder.

972
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,472
-Did it turn out nicely?
-I'm curious.

973
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,108
OPENED

974
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,009
How did it turn out?

975
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,844
CURIOUS

976
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,781
LOOKING DELICIOUS

977
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,349
It smells like green onion.

978
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,884
-The smell.
-Is that scorched rice?

979
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,553
-There's green onion on the rice.
-There's green onion.

980
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,488
Let's see how it is on the inside.

981
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,357
-It's not burnt.
-Is it burnt?

982
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,159
It's not burnt at all.

983
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,160
Not even scorched rice?

984
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,063
-The bottom layer is fried green onion.
-Stir-fried?

985
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,364
<i>There's more green onion below?</i>

986
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,634
Yes, so the rice didn't stick to the pot.

987
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,604
-You're right. I can see it.
-There's more green onion below the rice.

988
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,940
Fabri doesn't look so well.

989
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,277
-His face is as pale as green onion roots.
-You're right.

990
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,978
-Thanks.
-So will he eat just the rice?

991
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,814
Top it with some bulgogi.

992
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,316
-You can top it with this bulgogi.
-I see.

993
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,485
-That's game over.
-It is.

994
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,386
That mix.

995
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,223
We've seen bean sprout rice and <i>tot</i> rice,
but never green onion rice.

996
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,825
-I've never seen it either.
-Right?

997
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,761
-And there's <i>gondeure</i> rice too.
-Yes.

998
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,530
-Eat everything.
-The green onion are the same.

999
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,566
He's picking out the green onion.

1000
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,935
Have you had a bit too much?

1001
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,604
-Have you gotten sick of it?
-We got you.

1002
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,607
I don't think I wanted this much.

1003
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,276
GREEN ONION HELL

1004
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,945
TOSSING AROUND

1005
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,279
But you both did your best.

1006
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,682
This is why you should never say
you like something on this show.

1007
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,550
-Don't ever say it on the show.
-You've…

1008
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,520
You've given me
a feisty amount of green onion.

1009
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,123
I'm afraid of what will happen
with the monkfish liver.

1010
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,592
I'm already scared of it.

1011
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,327
-It looks good.
-Look at that.

1012
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,262
-It looks good.
-It has to be.

1013
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,197
-Thank you.
-Even Fabri can't say no to that.

1014
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,233
That's the Naju style.

1015
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,769
I wonder what it's like.

1016
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,738
NODDING

1017
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,241
Fresh rice and bulgogi? It's no joke.

1018
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,942
When you add lots of green onion

1019
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,245
to make fried rice,
it makes it even more savory.

1020
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,280
-It must taste like that.
-Yes.

1021
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,115
Just add a bit of salt or soy sauce.

1022
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,184
How can rice smell like this?

1023
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
YUM

1024
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,889
SPEAKING WITH
HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION

1025
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,924
The rice is good just by itself.

1026
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,161
-So? Should he use this or not?
-Should he pick his teeth?

1027
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,595
-He has to.
-I thought it'd be nice

1028
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,631
-for him to smell it until the end.
-He has to.

1029
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,033
-You said you liked green onion.
-Yes.

1030
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,302
He gave it to you
because you said you liked it.

1031
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,572
He's picking his teeth with green onion.

1032
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,707
It looks like he's preying on a mantis.

1033
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,810
SAVE ME

1034
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,813
-I think I saw one a few days ago.
-On the hood?

1035
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,382
-Thank you. This is cute.
-All right, then.

1036
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,150
THANK YOU

1037
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,121
Okay, then. Please try some, Yul.

1038
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,824
Should I eat it like this?

1039
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,292
Green onion ravioli.

1040
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,360
It smells good.

1041
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,096
-Does it? It can differ per person.
-Yes.

1042
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,333
-Some like that smoky smell.
-People like it.

1043
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,101
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1044
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,003
I don't think it tastes burnt.

1045
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,706
-It's on the saltier side for me.
-Rather?

1046
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,174
There was a difference.

1047
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,478
Next, please try Chef Sam's dish.

1048
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,415
He tried the green onion
that came with rice.

1049
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,850
The green onion in the rice.

1050
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,320
Press the button already.

1051
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,424
We can go straight to the results.

1052
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,459
Okay. Let's turn around.

1053
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,995
All right. Green onion prince.

1054
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,297
HIS TIME TO CHOOSE

1055
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,766
<i>Press one for Fabri, two for Sam Kim.</i>

1056
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,470
Okay.

1057
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,072
It took him 2.5 seconds.

1058
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,609
Let's check the result.

1059
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,078
Jae-wook, the green onion fanatic.

1060
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,213
Will it be Sam or Fabri?

1061
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,114
The Italian derby!

1062
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,449
SAM KIM WINS

1063
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,751
CHEF SAM KIM'S
HAVE SAM GREEN ONION WINS

1064
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,319
Sam Kim wins!

1065
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,523
-Great work.
-Great work.

1066
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,663
I was greatly touched
by his three-course meal,

1067
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,134
but the balance between the appetizer,
bulgogi, and the stone pot rice

1068
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,137
-seemed more put together.
-I see.

1069
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,974
It was also quite shocking to know
that orange and green onion

1070
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,477
could be such a tasty mix.

1071
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,747
Please put a star on him.

1072
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:33,017
Sam takes his fifth victory.

1073
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,118
Sam's fifth win!

1074
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,353
-Thank you. It was delicious.
-Thank you.

1075
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,824
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>played with Jae-wook's ingredients.</i>

1076
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,061
This is the long-awaited team round
the whole nation wanted to see.

1077
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,398
Team one, the polar opposite chemistry

1078
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,034
between the polished male lead
and the sassy female lead,

1079
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,336
Son Jong-won and Kim Poong.

1080
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,338
The doppelgänger chemistry

1081
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:59,176
between the two Anti-Good Vibes Twins,
Yoon Nam-no and Kwon Sung-jun.

1082
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,611
They look just like each other.

1083
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,148
It looks like
both teams dressed similarly.

1084
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:08,385
-Team Son-Poong is wearing an apron.
-Yes, the apron

1085
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,888
and Chef Jong-won's towel too.

1086
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,824
When you want to play
a sports game as a team,

1087
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,793
-it's important to be in a uniform.
-Yes.

1088
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,295
-That's why I'm wearing glasses.
-Even the glasses.

1089
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,564
The anti-good vibes are wearing bandanas.

1090
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,666
These bandanas aren't our size.

1091
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,068
THEY'RE WAY TOO SMALL

1092
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,371
It feels too tight around my head,
so I feel dizzy from lack of circulation.

1093
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,708
His eyes are pointing
to eleven and one o'clock.

1094
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,643
-Eleven and one.
-Eleven and one o'clock?

1095
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,811
Is the bandana too tight?

1096
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,013
Chef Jong-won said something like this.

1097
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,683
-"I'll give wings to Poong today."
-That's right.

1098
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,420
I wanted to add wings to his creativity

1099
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,822
and artistic touch

1100
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,124
as his faithful assistant today.

1101
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:51,095
There must've been some things
he wanted to do but couldn't

1102
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,497
because of the work ethics he has
as an upscale chef.

1103
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,434
I'll also put wings on him

1104
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,471
and let him loose
to try everything he ever wanted.

1105
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,939
So Poong is the head chef today?

1106
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,975
-I'll support as the sous-chef.
-The sous-chef?

1107
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,644
This is only right.

1108
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,046
Otherwise, whatever Chef Jong-won wants

1109
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,349
will have to be created in Poong's hands.

1110
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,618
I don't even want to imagine that.

1111
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,087
Poong always has great ideas,

1112
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,690
<i>-but he can't materialize it properly.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

1113
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,661
If he receives help from someone
who can properly bring it to life,

1114
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,496
it may turn out to be a masterpiece.

1115
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,731
-Let's look forward to it.
-Yes.

1116
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,734
This team has a pledge if they win.

1117
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,735
That's right.

1118
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,038
If we win, who should I be grateful for?

1119
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,106
I believe it's all Chef Jong-won.

1120
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,242
I may not be a knight in shining armor,

1121
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,145
but I can carry this prince
on my shoulders.

1122
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,647
-On your shoulders?
-Yes.

1123
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,483
However, Chef Nam-no
said something like this.

1124
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,752
"I will brand my own hand

1125
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,554
if Team Jong-won and Poong wins."

1126
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,955
WHAT?

1127
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,091
-Not me.
-That's rough.

1128
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,492
Teamwork is everything.

1129
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,661
But those two have lived
polar opposite lives.

1130
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:58,729
-That's true.
-Yes.

1131
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,331
-They're like heaven and hell.
-They have different energies.

1132
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,067
We'll come together

1133
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,869
and teach them
how bitter it feels to lose.

1134
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,172
Then which one of you is the captain?

1135
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,709
THE SYNCHRONIZED TWINS

1136
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,478
What do you mean? Drop it. I mean it.

1137
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,646
IT'S ME

1138
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,848
-This isn't good.
-He always wants to be the hero.

1139
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,149
-Of course it's me.
-Right.

1140
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,086
TEAM NAM-NO AND SUNG-JUN: MONKFISH LIVER,

RADISH, TSUYU, SUKIYAKI SAUCE, YUJA PONZU

1142
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,956
The dish we're making is

1143
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:27,791
H.O.T.

1144
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,827
-H.O.T.?
-H.O.T.?

1145
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,229
That's why you're wearing the bandanas.

1146
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,131
-H.O.T.?
-But what does it mean?

1147
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,167
High calories Of Twins.

1148
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,337
Two chubs who are high in calories.

1149
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,239
CHUCKLING

1150
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,075
Just like us, there are inseparable dishes
in Japanese cuisine.

1151
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,411
We're making buckwheat noodles
and a sushi roll.

1152
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,579
-Buckwheat noodles, sushi roll?
-Sushi roll?

1153
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,380
-Are those high calories?
-Buckwheat noodles

1154
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,718
are often had as a refresher
or even like a digestive medicine.

1155
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,887
-No?
-Does it work as a digestive dish?

1156
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:00,591
-You eat it toward the end of a meal.
-Like the end of it.

1157
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,192
He said he loved monkfish liver a lot,

1158
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,296
so we'll make a high-calorie sauce
made with monkfish liver.

1159
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:09,233
As for the sushi roll, we'll roll the rice

1160
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,601
with fish,

1161
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,269
pickled pepper,

1162
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,771
and salted pollack roe.

1163
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,105
These three fillings.

1164
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,040
We'll then roll it with brisket
and deep-fry it.

1165
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,809
Deep-fry?

1166
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,945
The moment you put it in your mouth,
it'll almost make your mouth feel numb.

1167
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,847
You'll get puffy the moment you eat it.

1168
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,249

00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,257
What are you making, Poong?

1172
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,759
-The name of our dish is…
-What?

1173
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,961
THE SASSY GIRL GRABS
THE POLISHED PRINCE'S HAND

1174
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,396
What?

1175
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,964
-It's called…
-What?

1176
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,866
Let's Go, Monkfish!

1177
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,269
-Let's Go, Monkfish?
-Yes.

1178
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,504
-Let's Go, Monkfish.
-Park Shin-yang's line, right?

1179
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,939
That's right.

1180
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,541
-Let's Go, Monkfish?
-Yes.

1181
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:55,012
I want to make Poong's three-course meal
in the fine dining style.

1182
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,014
-The Chinese style.
-It's the Chinese style.

1183
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,816
The first dish.

1184
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,485
-You said you liked monkfish liver…
-Yes.

1185
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,220
…so I'll use that and…

1186
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:04,822
What was it again?

1187
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,623
-A chilled appetizer.
-Yes, right.

1188
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,960
-It'll be a chilled appetizer.
-An appetizer.

1189
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,261
The main dish

1190
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,964
-is dry chili chicken.
-You're going to make dry chili chicken?

1191
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,099
But I didn't see any chicken,

1192
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,869
so I'll use beef
to resemble dry chili chicken

1193
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,871
to make a fried meat dish.

1194
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,140
I'll lay out fried noodles
as the first layer.

1195
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,309
It'll be
a high-calorie Chinese-style dish.

1196
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,412
Lastly, I'll use some fruit
to make <i>tanghulu</i>, candied fruit.

1197
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,447
-<i>Tanghulu</i>?
-Yes.

1198
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,682
You're going that far?

1199
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,085
-However, it'll look luxuriously artistic.
-Artistic.

1200
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,888
-All right.
-I look forward to this.

1201
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,156
Get ready.

1202
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,257
Pick up the green onion.

1203
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,093
HE DOES AS HE'S ASKED

1204
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,895
I don't think he wants to.

1205
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,163
No, I do.

1206
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,165
We're a team, so you have to.

1207
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,566
Ready pose.

1208
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:50,968
Let us begin this next round,

1209
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,637
a high-calorie dish to look cutely puffy.

1210
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,340
They will show the combined force
of the two look-alikes.

1211
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:00,310
Team High-Calorie Twins,
Yoon Nam-no and Kwon Sung-jun.

1212
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,247
These two will show
the synergy of polar opposites.

1213
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:07,551
Team Unlikely Match,
Kim Poong and Son Jong-won.

1214
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:12,556
Which one of the two teams
will make Jae-wook look puffier?

1215
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,157
This is a team round.

1216
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,327
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1217
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,228
Green onion!

1218
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,329
Begin!

1219
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,764
FULL OF ANTICIPATION

1220
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,866
All right! Green onion!

1221
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,668
SUDDENLY BREAKS A GREEN ONION

1222
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,802
-Put it in here.
-Break this?

1223
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,905
Put it in here. And garlic!

1224
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,573
Slam garlic cloves with your hand!

1225
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,074
With your hand. That's it! Good one!

1226
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,210
Yes, use your hands.

1227
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,679
-Great job with the garlic.
-Poong gives Jong-won orders.

1228
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,282
And add a whole cup of red pepper powder.

1229
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,483
I got garlic on my face.

1230
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,385
Jong-won is moving like a machine.

1231
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,354
-Poong gives orders and Jong-won acts.
-Yes.

1232
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,389
One, two, three.

1233
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,490
WHAT ABOUT THE TWINS?

1234
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,791
TO YOUR POSITIONS!

1235
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,627
NAM-NO WARMS UP
INSTANT RICE FIRST!

1236
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,296
Okay. This is great.

1237
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,965
What's he doing? Making chili oil?

1238
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,233
Chili oil, Poong's style.

1239
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,669
-You're making chili oil too?
-Poong's oil.

1240
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,338
-Red pepper powder.
-That's chili oil.

1241
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,174
-They're both making chili oil.
-You're right.

1242
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,477
But buckwheat noodles and sushi roll
don't use any chili oil.

1243
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:08,879
It must be a new style.

1244
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,383
-Nam-no and Sung-jun divided the labor.
-Chili oil?

1245
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,520
Look at Nam-no. I wanted to do that too.

1246
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,156
MAKING GREEN ONION SLICES

1247
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,458
Chef Nam-no made thin green onion slices.

1248
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,161
Yes, it goes well with monkfish liver,
so I'm preparing this.

1249
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,796
-Buckwheat noodles, going in!
-Let's go.

1250
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:26,863
Let's go, Sung-jun!

1251
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,266
-The noodles?
-The noodles are in.

1252
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,701
WHAT ABOUT THE PAN NEXT TO IT?

1253
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,369
-Halibut?
-Halibut.

1254
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,138
-Sung-jun begins to work with seafood.
-Yes, halibut.

1255
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,075
-Team Anti-Good Vibes have good teamwork.
-Right?

1256
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:41,378
They're working in two tracks,
which will make them faster.

1257
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,715
Yes, they're making two dishes
on two different sides.

1258
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,316
ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS TEAM…

1259
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,219
-What's next?
-Sugar.

1260
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,387
Sugar. Use your hands.

1261
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,091
Sugar. Just pour it in.

1262
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,426
He should be asking Chef Jong-won

1263
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,795
to use his techniques to cut ingredients.

1264
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,531
Why is he asking him
to move things and pour things in?

1265
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:02,899
Pour sugar in there.

1266
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,067
POURING IN

1267
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,636
Chef Jong-won should do
the technical stuff.

1268
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,538
A MOUNTAIN OF SUGAR

1269
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,773
Okay.

1270
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,442
You might need to add lots of water.

1271
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,177
It'll boil down anyway.

1272
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,748
THE POLISHED MALE LEAD DOES
EVERYTHING POONG ASKS HIM

1273
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,483
AFTER MAKING JONG-WON DO
BUSYWORK…

1274
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,919
Why does Poong keep chopping stuff?

1275
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,255
He's not bad at chopping green onion.

1276
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,491
He's made green onion oil
a fair share of times.

1277
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,027
Damn it. What's with the green onion?

1278
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,496
HE CAN'T EVEN DO THAT ANYMORE

1279
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,964
THE TWINS SAIL MORE SMOOTHLY

1280
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,933
Chef Nam-no and Chef Sung-jun

1281
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,470
aren't making the noodles
and the sushi roll separately.

1282
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,140
I guess they'll prepare the ingredients
and put them together

1283
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,408
-Yes.
-You're right.

1284
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:49,279
-Is the fish fillet for the sushi roll?
-Yes.

1285
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,881
HALIBUT IN SUSHI ROLL?

1286
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,950
I don't think
it's the regular triangular sushi roll.

1287
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,152
-I guess not.
-No, right?

1288
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,787
Is it like an actual fried roll?

1289
00:50:59,089 --> 00:50:59,923
SETS FIRE AND LEAVES

1290
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,926
He puts on a show!

1291
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,995
Sung-jun performs!

1292
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,565
He already knows that
our viewers love seeing these spectacles.

1293
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,201
JONG-WON FINALLY GRABS A KNIFE

1294
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,171
HE HEATS IT UP WITH A TORCH

1295
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:18,475
Chef Jong-won heated up the knife
to cut the monkfish liver.

1296
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,344
There it is. That's the monkfish liver.

1297
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,413
It's rather greasy,

1298
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,582
so it's easier to cut
when the knife is hot.

1299
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,717
-It keeps the shape.
-So that was his trick.

1300
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:31,121
He cuts the liver
after heating up the knife.

1301
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,156
CHOPPING RADISH

1302
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,658
Jong-won cuts radish.

1303
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,095
He just punched out
circular shapes from the radish.

1304
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:42,632
We'll see something pretty and fancy,
unlike Poong's usual dishes.

1305
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,368
BACK IN HIS ELEMENT
ONCE POONG STOPPED PESTERING HIM

1306
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,269
SWOOSH

1307
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,706
2. PARBOIL RADISH DISCS
AND COOL OVER ICE

1308
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,509
MEANWHILE
WHAT DID POONG DO?

1309
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,912
Poong cuts mushroom.

1310
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,148
Next, chili oil.

1311
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,951
-Should I strain it?
-Yes, do it here.

1312
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,019
Why did you use this?
That was for chili oil!

1313
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,789
-That was for chili oil. Wait.
-What's wrong?

1314
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,357
-Chili oil.
-They're shaken.

1315
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,392
Strain the chili oil here.

1316
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,528
Chef Jong-won begins to cook spaghetti.

1317
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,163
RUNNING POONG'S ERRAND
FOR THE 1,295TH TIME

1318
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,898
Their chili oil is ready.

1319
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,168
THANKS TO HIM, CHILI OIL IS READY

1320
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,137
-Let me use this.
-Sure.

1321
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,505
WHAT'S THE CHOPPER'S NEXT STEP?

1322
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:25,675
2. CHOP MONKFISH LIVER, THEN BOIL DOWN
WITH TSUYU, SOY SAUCE, AND YUJA PONZU

1323
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:26,576
TSUYU

1324
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,411
SOY SAUCE, YUJA PONZU

1325
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,746
I'll crush this anyway.

1326
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,448
-Can you boil this?
-Sure.

1327
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,483
-I'll leave it here. You can boil it.
-Okay.

1328
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,553
I believe the monkfish liver
has already been boiled down in sauce.

1329
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,055
-But they're using more sauce.
-It's already been boiled down?

1330
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,358
I'm going to plaster the dish with salt.

1331
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,027
A PLATE OF SALTY BOMB

1332
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,462
Sung-jun uses eggs.

1333
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,998
EGGS

1334
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,368
I think he's making a rolled omelet
to use for the sushi roll.

1335
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,737
For the sushi roll.

1336
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,872
-The meat next?
-The meat.

1337
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,440
<i>Ramyeon</i> soup base!

1338
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,644
-<i>Ramyeon</i> soup base! Wait.
-<i>Ramyeon </i>soup base?

1339
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,079
-<i>Ramyeon</i> soup base?
-It doesn't suit Chef Jong-won.

1340
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,681
Jong-won and <i>ramyeon</i> soup base?

1341
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,250
He told Chef Jong-won
to get a <i>ramyeon</i> soup base.

1342
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,752
They're in trouble. They're using <i>ramyeon.</i>

1343
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,287
-It's over.
-That's trouble.

1344
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,855
Do I put one in?

1345
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,124
They just said, "It's over.
They're using <i>ramyeon</i> soup."

1346
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,326
Jong-won has found some freedom.

1347
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,328
He has given up on his work ethics.

1348
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,030
THE MAN WHO MADE HIM
ABANDON HIS ETHICS

1349
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,798
-Put it in.
-Right here?

1350
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,334
-Chef Jong-won does it!
-He poured it in.

1351
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,870
OH MY

1352
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,839
Has he fallen for Poong's temptation?

1353
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,108
He's seasoning the meat
with <i>ramyeon</i> soup base.

1354
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,011
You should've stopped him from doing this.

1355
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,713
That has to taste good.

1356
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,516
Chef Jong-won compromises with Poong.

1357
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,586
He must've thought
he disguised himself with glasses

1358
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,054
and used <i>ramyeon</i> soup base.

1359
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,058
At the moment,
Jae-wook has been using <i>ramyeon</i>

1360
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,759
to make his face look puffier.

1361
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:53,997
-I have a feeling they have an upper hand.
-Because he's used to it?

1362
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,367
-Chef Nam-no, is that pickled pepper?
-Yes.

1363
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,703
That's the side dish his mother made!

1364
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,172
His mother is an amazing cook.

1365
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,974
-Is this good enough?
-Okay.

1366
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,376
NEXT, HE WASHES
THE SALTED POLLACK ROE

1367
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,378
-I'll leave these here, Sung-jun.
-Okay.

1368
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,513
-Is this it?
-Yes, I knew you'd come through.

1369
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,148
Hey, we're on a roll so far.

1370
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,986
-Is that a rolled omelet?
-It is.

1371
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,823
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING…

1372
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,491
Sugar.

1373
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,659
Where's the sugar?

1374
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,261
-It's here.
-Okay.

1375
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,064
Okay. I knew you'd know.

1376
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,567
That's why you're the leader.

1377
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,470
-He's making the rolled omelet.
-Rolled omelet.

1378
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,205
AND THIS TEAM?

1379
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,808
3. DRY RADISH
AND TOP WITH CHERRY JAM

1380
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:39,709
What's this?

1381
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,177
-Cherry jam.
-I see.

1382
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,481
TOPPING SUGAR ON MONKFISH LIVER

1383
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:47,217
He's glazing the top of the monkfish liver

1384
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,654
like you would when you make crème brûlée.

1385
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,757
-I see. He's detailed, as always.
-Yes.

1386
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:57,127
Foie gras usually goes well
with sweet flavors like sugar.

1387
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,561
I see.

1388
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,498
That was something
Poong wouldn't be able to do alone.

1389
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:06,369
-Wait, sugar.
-I'll finish this and make the ring.

1390
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,271
You can work on the meat.

1391
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,806
HELPS CALM POONG DOWN

1392
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,841
AND TOPS IT
WITH CHERRY TO FINISH!

1393
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,777
AND THE SAUCE,
CHERRY JAM AND YUJA PONZU

1394
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:18,481
THE SAUCE GOES INTO THE FRIDGE!

1395
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,050
-The noodles out?
-Yes.

1396
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,052
-Is this the iced water?
-Yes.

1397
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,654
GRABBING THE COOKED NOODLES!

1398
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,624
-Ten minutes left.
-Ten minutes.

1399
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,427
-No!
-They're using instant rice.

1400
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,329
They're going for sweet and salty.

1401
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,497
SPREADING OUT RICE
ON THE SUSHI MAT

1402
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,732
Check out the amount of rice.

1403
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,467
Okay.

1404
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,436
THEY CONFIRM EACH OTHER

1405
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,104
The noodles look fine.

1406
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,139
They're making two dishes on both sides.

1407
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,175
The division of labor is working.

1408
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:50,280
AGAIN, HE'S CHOPPING CLUMSILY

1409
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,782
-What's he doing?
-What is that?

1410
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,884
He's deep-frying red peppers.

1411
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,219
Deep-frying red peppers?

1412
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,420
What? Yes. Deep-frying.

1413
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,656
-It's for the spicy sauce.
-He's deep-frying the peppers?

1414
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,324
-All done.
-Why is he doing that?

1415
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,226
Is it for the spicy sauce?

1416
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,162
-The original recipe needs dried ones.
-But he didn't have any.

1417
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,332
Chef Jong-won is busy cleaning the counter

1418
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,634
-when Poong makes a mess.
-Damn it. So dirty.

1419
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,137
He's spending a while cleaning up.

1420
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,140
He keeps following him and cleaning.

1421
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,309
-I'm cleaning.
-We can do this.

1422
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,445
We can do this. We can pull it off.

1423
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:25,048
-My gosh.
-What is it? No, it's okay.

1424
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,015
It's okay.

1425
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,652
-Wait, Sung-jun's omelet is burnt!
-It's burnt.

1426
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,421
-No.
-Is it burnt?

1427
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,357
-Is it burnt? Yes!
-You won!

1428
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,426
PLAY THE MUSIC, IT'S BURNT!

1429
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,061
Yes!

1430
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,196
-He throws it away.
-It's all right.

1431
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,899
It's stuck all over the pan.
It looks pretty bad.

1432
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,168
You should eat that
to make your face puffy.

1433
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,503
IT'S LIKE A PENALTY

1434
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,037
But they have to get chosen.

1435
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,205
Yes, it should be good.

1436
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:52,008
-One chef lost because his food burned.
-Eight minutes!

1437
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,476
Hey, wait.

1438
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,245
It's an emergency.

1439
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,514
-He has to try again.
-Use a lot of oil.

1440
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,682
-Scramble the eggs!
-Okay.

1441
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,184
It's an emergency.

1442
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,720
-It's an emergency here.
-Yes.

1443
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,455
Will you give up
on making a rolled omelet?

1444
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,523
I never give up.

1445
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,525
No, never.

1446
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,994
Nam-no and Sung-jun are in danger.

1447
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,595
He retries the rolled omelet.

1448
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:16,099
They're losing
quite a lot of time doing this.

1449
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,600
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

1450
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,802
Let's do one at a time.

1451
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,905
-They root for each other.
-He sweetly asked if he was okay.

1452
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,339
The ponzu.

1453
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,909
Ponzu? It's there.

1454
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,611
-Is this it? Okay.
-This one.

1455
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,879
Is the rice ready?

1456
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,548
-Do you need it? I'll grab it.
-Okay.

1457
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,283
-Here, Sung-jun.
-Okay.

1458
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,651
-Are we good?
-Yes.

1459
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,486
THE TWINS HAVE A GREAT CHEMISTRY

1460
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,488
-Just the ends.
-It looks perfect.

1461
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,623
-Work on this. I got this one.
-Okay.

1462
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,761
We can do this.

1463
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,764
-The sugar's burnt.
-It's burnt?

1464
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:50,500
-The sugar to candy the fruit.
-Is it burnt?

1465
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,169
While taunting the other team
about their burnt omelet,

1466
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,406
-they burned their own sugar.
-Oh, no.

1467
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,943
That's why you should never tease others.

1468
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,979
Can you use that much sugar,
Chef Jong-won?

1469
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,682
We can do this. We can still do this.

1470
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,051
SUNG-JUN BEGINS
TO ROLL THE SUSHI!

1471
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,586
Wait, I need the omelet.

1472
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,722
-Hey, wait.
-I'll work on it for now.

1473
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,524
-It doesn't work.
-The pan isn't smooth enough.

1474
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,160
-Just scramble it.
-What's not working?

1475
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,394
Did it fail again?

1476
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,731
-It's not my usual pan.
-Even Chef Nam-no couldn't make the egg!

1477
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,466
-Their plans changed.
-Yes.

1478
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,768
-It's scrambled now.
-It's okay.

1479
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,438
-Five minutes and 40 seconds.
-Five minutes?

1480
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,773
-Five minutes, 40 seconds!
-Wait, five minutes?

1481
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,209
-Five? Really?
-Yes, five minutes.

1482
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,612
Sung-jun begins to roll the sushi.

1483
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,313
-It's a sushi roll.
-That looks nice.

1484
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,415
They aren't using dried laver,
so it needs to be firm.

1485
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,752
It can come undone easily
if it's just rice.

1486
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,421
-They're rolling it with brisket.
-How will they cook that?

1487
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,524
-It's rolled with brisket.
-With meat?

1488
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,860
-They'll do that and deep-fry it.
-Deep-frying.

1489
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,196
-Will you have enough time?
-It's the time.

1490
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:54,430
Five minutes left!

1491
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,699
-Five minutes left.
-It's really five minutes now.

1492
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,468
This isn't easy.

1493
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,472
He's making monkfish liver sauce.

1494
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,673
-Is he?
-Yes.

1495
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,109
We don't have enough time. Wait.

1496
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,611
-Eggs.
-He's in a haste.

1497
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,947
5. MIX STARCH AND EGGS
TO MAKE FRYING BATTER

1498
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,917
-Chili oil. Sugar?
-Sugar.

1499
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:17,220
-Wait, it's turned off. Who did this?
-The heat.

1500
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,088
You have to melt the sugar.

1501
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,759
-Did you turn the heat off?
-No, it wasn't me.

1502
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,894
-Is the sushi roll coming?
-The roll is here.

1503
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,530
-You have to deep-fry it, though.
-One second.

1504
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,431
It's coming.

1505
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,766
-Wait.
-Chili oil.

1506
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:30,900
The heat is way too high.

1507
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,136
-Is that it?
-That's the chili oil.

1508
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,671
Where on earth is the chili oil?

1509
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,105
-Where?
-Here!

1510
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,740
VERY SENSITIVE

1511
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,109
The Twins are in a frenzy!

1512
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,444
MIXING CHILI OIL
WITH THE NOODLES!

1513
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,912
It's so hectic.

1514
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,248
Gosh. It's such a huge mess.

1515
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,517
OLIVE OIL, YUJA PONZU

1516
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,253
-I'll finish this up for now.
-Okay.

1517
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,788
Things are going fine.

1518
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,990
-When do we do the noodles?
-The noodles? At two minutes.

1519
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:55,892
STIR-FRYING DEEP-FRIED BEEF!

1520
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,026
It smells spicy.

1521
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:57,927
SOY SAUCE

1522
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,263
HERE COMES HIS SECRET MOVE!

1523
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,765
What do you think? Isn't this cool?

1524
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,569
-He's setting the pan on fire!
-You got this!

1525
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,871
-Look!
-He puts on a show!

1526
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,807
Is it burnt?

1527
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,109
-If Sung-jun can do it, he can too.
-It looks burnt.

1528
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,911
-It's an emergency.
-It's an emergency.

1529
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,647
He has to deep-fry this sushi roll!

1530
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,682
But you only have four minutes left!

1531
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,484
DUNK(?)

1532
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,519
A HUGE CATERPILLAR(?)

1533
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,288
You have to deep-fry the roll.

1534
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,456
It looks so…

1535
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,092
-Wait, it's not ruined.
-It's ruined!

1536
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,193
It's a mess.

1537
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,228
-Everything went wrong here!
-It didn't!

1538
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,999
-No, it's not ruined.
-Is it or isn't it?

1539
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,234
-Can you save it?
-I meant to do this.

1540
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,069
-What's that?
-The sushi roll.

1541
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,904
-He saved it.
-It's perfect.

1542
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,273
-I saved it.
-Did you save the roll?

1543
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,310
This roll looks like
stalactites in a cave.

1544
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,379
-Sung-jun, turn it over.
-Right?

1545
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:50,880
It'll make you fat instantly.

1546
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,049
-If you eat this, it'll blow your face up.
-Right away.

1547
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,350
Jae-wook might later say,

1548
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,352
"I didn't expect to get this puffy."

1549
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,255
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
LATER

1550
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,525
-This wasn't what I wanted.
-It wasn't this bad.

1551
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,027
What's he doing now?

1552
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,728
WHY IS HE USING FOIL?

1553
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:06,996
What's that?

1554
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,898
What's Chef Jong-won doing?

1555
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,967
That must be a candied fruit ring.

1556
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:11,968
TANGHULU RING

1557
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,837
What's in the foil?

1558
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,806
I'm making a <i>tanghulu</i> ring.

1559
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,942
-So this is how you candy fruit?
-<i>Tanghulu</i> ring.

1560
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,444
He's making a candied fruit ring.

1561
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,712
Like the candy ring.

1562
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,081
TANGHULU IN THE SHAPE
OF A CANDY RING

1563
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,451
He's making <i>tanghulu</i> like a ring.

1564
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,652
<i>Tanghulu.</i>

1565
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,421
-That's hot.
-What's that?

1566
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,756
-That's hot. The noodles.
-You're scaring me.

1567
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,359
The noodles. How am I going to get these?

1568
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,327
How do I get those?

1569
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,762
Bring the pot here.

1570
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,898
-What?
-Bring the whole pot here.

1571
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,434
Bring the entire pot? It's hot!

1572
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,668
It's hot!

1573
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,071
HE'S SO SILLY

1574
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,273
I need ice. That was so hot.

1575
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,340
It was too hot.

1576
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,144
The noodles. Put those in here.

1577
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,213
Put it in here.

1578
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,281
Jung-hwan!

1579
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,016
Look at Nam-no's buckwheat noodles!

1580
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,285
Is it done? It's done!

1581
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,953
Let me try the noodles.

1582
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,688
I wonder what it's like.

1583
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:06,956
-It has to be ready.
-If they lose,

1584
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,124
-It's done!
-he'll brand his own hand.

1585
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,392
I mean that it has to be good.

1586
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,626
What's it like?

1587
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,161
Will he have to burn his hand?

1588
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,664
He might have to brand one of his hands.

1589
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,234
One of the two has to brand his hands.

1590
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,870
Try it with the sauce.

1591
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,238
I didn't have it with the sauce!

1592
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:25,241
-It wasn't the finished dish.
-The monkfish liver sauce.

1593
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,676
-That looks good.
-It wasn't finished.

1594
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,111
Veggies. I need to put these in.

1595
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,446
-Veggies.
-Veggies in.

1596
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,381
-Wait.
-Let me stir-fry that.

1597
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:33,382
Work on the sauce.

1598
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:36,385
JONG-WON ALSO FINISHES
THE SPICY BEEF AND NOODLES

1599
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,954
Soy sauce.

1600
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,655
You have two minutes left.

1601
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,491
-Two minutes.
-Show me the puffiness.

1602
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:42,992
Does it work?

1603
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:44,460
120% PUFFY

1604
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:45,895
-I look puffier!
-Good!

1605
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:47,997
TRIES THE NOODLES TOO

1606
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,833
Is it okay? Is it all right?

1607
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,568
Is it good?

1608
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,570
-It's spicy.
-He says it's spicy!

1609
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,772
What about the seasoning?

1610
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,840
-It's salty.
-It's too salty?

1611
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,376
-It's spicy and salty.
-That makes you fat instantly.

1612
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,513
-Is it spicy?
-You'll ruin it with water.

1613
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,614
Starch.

1614
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,650
-Starch.
-No, that's more than enough.

1615
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,587
You have to cut that thing now.

1616
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,589
If you don't get puffy after this,
see a doctor.

1617
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,859
One minute.

1618
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:23,266
6. TOP MONKFISH LIVER NOODLES
WITH SLICED RADISH, GREEN ONION, OLIVE OIL

1619
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,467
THE DISH IS SERVED

1620
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,803

NEXT, CUTTING EXTRA-LARGE ROLL

1623
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,109
The two look happy.

1624
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,811
DANCING

1625
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,445
They're dancing with joy.

1626
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,648
-If he doesn't get fat, he's not human.
-It looks hot!

1627
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,717
-It looks so hot.
-That's massive.

1628
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,553
It looks so hot.

1629
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,887
It's so hot!

1630
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:46,823
It looks so good.

1631
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,124
-It looks good.
-It's amazing.

1632
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,659
This is insane!

1633
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,127
It looks amazing.

1634
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:52,895
-The roll looks excellent.
-Yes, it looks good.

1635
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,764
The roll looks excellent.

1636
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,699
-Hey, get the sauce.
-What?

1637
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:57,700
What sauce?

1638
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,202
-We said we'd serve this!
-This one!

1639
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,037
Please put this up there.

1640
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,872
FLUTTERING OVER TO THE FRIDGE

1641
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,775
GRABS THE CHILLED
MONKFISH LIVER BRÛLÉE

1642
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,377
FINISHING OFF WITH THE SAUCE

1643
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,746
-They're starting to serve the dish.
-It's hot.

1644
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,182
Team Son-Poong!

1645
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,852
-Nine. Eight. Seven.
-Nine. Eight. Seven.

1646
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:16,953
Ring the bell first!

1647
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,089
-Five. Four. Three.
-Ring it.

1648
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:21,958
Nine. Eight.

1649
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,960
-Should we ring it first?
-Ring the bell first.

1650
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,095
-Five. Four.
-Ring it.

1651
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,264
-Three. Two.
-Three. Two.

1652
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,999
-Two. One.
-Two. One.

1653
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,735
-Time's up!
-That's time!

1654
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,604
Sung-jun and Nam-no finish first.

1655
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,939
-Okay.
-And then Jong-won and Poong finish.

1656
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,308
AMAZED

1657
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,944
-That was chaotic.
-It was.

1658
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,814
-Four of them were out there.
-It's so hectic.

1659
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,783
THE DISHES TO MAKE HIM
PUFFY TAKE OFF

1660
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,919
-My gosh.
-These look amazing.

1661
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,122
-They look so good.
-These are high in calories.

1662
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:57,059
Both teams finished cooking
for Jae-wook's second order.

1663
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,362
THANK YOU

1664
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,797
It was such a chaotic round.

1665
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,333
What was it like to play as a team,
Jong-won and Poong?

1666
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,701
I'm quite pleased.

1667
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,804
Jong-won has
already taken his glasses off.

1668
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,273
I'm very pleased,

1669
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,841
and I even thought,

1670
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,510
"What if we opened a restaurant together?"

1671
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,646
-A collaboration?
-We had fantastic teamwork.

1672
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:19,415
-Restaurant Son-Poong?
-Yes, Son-Poong.

1673
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:22,818
Please try the Twins' dish first, H.O.T.

1674
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:27,590
BUCKWHEAT NOODLES
DRENCHED IN MONKFISH LIVER SAUCE

1675
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,993
WITH EXTRA-LARGE SUSHI ROLL
MADE OF FIVE INGREDIENTS

1676
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,364
YOON NAM-NO
& KWON SUNG-JUN'S H.O.T.

1677
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,266
One word of caution, though.

1678
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,902
You may have wanted
to be temporarily puffy,

1679
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,238
but you might remain puffy for life
after you eat that.

1680
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,907
-Please remember that.
-That's your disclaimer?

1681
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,642
He might end up like me.

1682
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,244
Watch out as you eat it.

1683
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,613
-All right.
-Only eat as much as you can handle.

1684
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,814
The noodles first?

1685
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,884
-Please have it as an appetizer.
-The noodles are the appetizer.

1686
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,320
You can have the veggies on the side
as you like.

1687
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,155
Is that monkfish liver on top?

1688
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,589
-That one.
-That's the monkfish liver.

1689
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,758
-So this is what he said he liked.
-Yes.

1690
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,660
I can't believe I can eat it like this.

1691
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:07,296
It's usually eaten with raw fish.

1692
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,532
It's unlike the usual buckwheat noodles.

1693
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:11,968
Gosh.

1694
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,002
It looks good.

1695
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,172
You're saying it yourself?

1696
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,708
He's manipulating him.

1697
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,743
-He's hilarious.
-Served with monkfish liver.

1698
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,546
A BIG BITE WITH RADISH
AND GREEN ONION!

1699
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,915
-It's so good.
-He makes it look delicious.

1700
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,951
He's starting to look happy.

1701
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,119
He's responding.

1702
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,822
-It's over.
-"It's over."

1703
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,156
WHAT NONSENSE

1704
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:35,825
The Twins are sure that they won.

1705
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:36,993
"It's over"?

1706
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,695
-Gosh.
-"Gosh"?

1707
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,697
-It must taste strong.
-What is it?

1708
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,832
-Is it strong?
-What hit you?

1709
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:43,733
A bit.

1710
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:46,502
Can you take a before picture now
just in case?

1711
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,839
<i>-They said you may not return.</i>
<i>-This used to be you.</i>

1712
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:51,407
You've hit your peak today.

1713
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,542
I've never had anything like this before,

1714
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:54,577
and it's intense.

1715
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,113
-The monkfish liver…
-Yes?

1716
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,180
CHOKING UP

1717
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:03,019
It feels like the liver has covered
my entire mouth.

1718
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,920
What is this? Radish?

1719
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,856
-Yes, it's radish.
-Right.

1720
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,991
They only add nice textures,

1721
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:12,828
-so my mouth is only full of the liver.
-The liver must be strong.

1722
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:15,031
When your face gets bloated,

1723
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:19,668
it means the salt in your system
is holding water and won't let it go.

1724
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,004
So saltiness is the best solution
to get puffy.

1725
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,942
He took two bites.

1726
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,412
-Look at him.
-It makes his eyes turn wide.

1727
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,713
He must feel that sugar rush.

1728
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,816
It's good.
This will definitely make me puffy.

1729
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,851
-It's over.
-It's over.

1730
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,354
-It's good.
-And it's good.

1731
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,556
-He keeps saying that.
-Next,

1732
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,626
-we have the sushi roll.
-It has pickled pepper, egg,

1733
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,928
salted pollack roe,
and grilled fish inside.

1734
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,731
-That's a lot.
-Then rolled with brisket and deep-fried.

1735
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,901
Too much can be far worse.

1736
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,502
Should he eat it in one bite?

1737
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,271
-We can.
-We can.

1738
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,839
It may be tough for beginners.

1739
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,407
Beginners?

1740
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:02,278
Top it with a bit of monkfish liver sauce
served on the side,

1741
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,513
as well as some green onion.

1742
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,782
-Then the seasoning will be perfect.
-Right.

1743
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:07,883
Let me try it.

1744
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,285
The sushi roll.

1745
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,521
CRUNCH

1746
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,156
What's it like?

1747
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,459
-He's getting puffy.
-What is it?

1748
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:17,960
He flinched a little.

1749
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,695
-What?
-What?

1750
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,331
-He seems a bit unsure.
-Already?

1751
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:26,368
-This has a violent flavor.
-Violent.

1752
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,537
-That's right on target!
-It's over.

1753
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,139
-That's what you wanted.
-It's too hot.

1754
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,475
It tastes so intense.

1755
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,510
And the rice was seasoned with sugar too.

1756
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,345
THEY SEASONED
RICE AND MADE SUSHI RICE

1757
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,848
-There's a problem if you don't get puffy.
-That's too much.

1758
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,083
I'm crying.

1759
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,086
Does it make you cry? Is it funny?

1760
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,888
-Does it make your eyes puffy?
-Yes.

1761
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:46,822
Is it funny?

1762
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,224
It tastes like everything.

1763
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,660
Meat, fish,
monkfish liver, salted pollack roe…

1764
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,296
The rice is sweet,
and the deep-fry is crunchy.

1765
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:55,698
SNIFFLE

1766
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,099
He's unable to articulate.

1767
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,169
-His mouth must be puffy. His tongue.
-His tongue puffed up.

1768
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,071
GOING AS PLANNED!

1769
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,941
-It's a perfect pre-labor meal.
-You had to get puffy.

1770
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,710
Does it taste like a villain?

1771
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,279
I'd be able to use
a lot of energy for quite a long time.

1772
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,881
IT'S PERFECT FOR A PLAY NIGHT!

1773
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,483
I didn't want something this bad.

1774
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,684
Shall we move on?

1775
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,020
HOT CHILI BEEF
OVER FRIED NOODLES

1776
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:21,223
SWEET AND SALTY MONKFISH
LIVER BRÛLÉE TO MAKE YOU PUFFY

1777
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,792
LASTLY, CANDIED FRUIT RINGS!

1778
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,763
KIM POONG & SON JONG-WON'S
LET'S GO, MONKFISH!

1779
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,633
First of all, it'll be a good idea
to rinse your mouth with water.

1780
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,167
In case your food has no taste?

1781
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,637
Or perhaps you should brush your teeth.

1782
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,940
Brushing your teeth is
also another recommendation.

1783
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,441
Pull out your ring first.

1784
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,710
What if you can't take it off later?

1785
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,778
-After he's swollen?
-Yes.

1786
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,648
-First, Chef Jong-won's dish.
-The monkfish liver.

1787
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:49,251
Try that fine-dining style
monkfish liver first.

1788
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,419
SNIFF

1789
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:51,754
The appetizer.

1790
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:55,124
The monkfish liver I was thinking of
look more like this one.

1791
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,425
-Yes.
-Of course.

1792
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,494
-Something like this.
-They went overboard.

1793
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,096
-Try it with the radish.
-With the radish.

1794
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:05,000
-This right here is the radish, right?
-Yes, boiled down in sauce.

1795
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,535
-The appetizer.
-It looks good.

1796
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:07,436
SNIFFING

1797
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:08,671
A BIG BITE

1798
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,375
SMILING

1799
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:15,177
SAVORING

1800
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,213
IT'S OVER!

1801
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,316
We've seen that face before.

1802
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,617
No, he didn't do that for us.

1803
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:25,020
-If it's too much, it can backfire.
-It's so good.

1804
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:28,490
-How's the texture of the radish?
-Is it not too hard?

1805
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,159
-It's perfect.
-Is it?

1806
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,294
It tastes sweet. What is this?

1807
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,096
I actually saw some cherry compote,

1808
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:37,399
so I put some on the radish
and topped it with another cherry.

1809
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,768
This is so good.

1810
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:43,772
-The liver was topped with glazed sugar.
-The monkfish liver

1811
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:46,742
got topped with glazed sugar
and made crunchy.

1812
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:50,012
-It's just how you make foie gras.
-It's a savory sweetness.

1813
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,181
-The main dish.
-This is the main dish.

1814
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,650
-My palate has been cleansed.
-This needs to make him puffy.

1815
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,152
-Let me try the meat first.
-Yes, please do that.

1816
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,989
They kept saying it was salty.

1817
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,291
-Among themselves.
-Yes, so they added water too.

1818
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,360
Did you use <i>ramyeon</i> soup base here?

1819
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,661
I used it to season the meat.

1820
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,796
But it won't stand out too much.

1821
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,066
Does it taste like <i>ramyeon?</i>

1822
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:15,037
It tastes like <i>ramyeon</i> soup base!

1823
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,305
-I knew it.
-It's good.

1824
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,506
You're such a gourmet.

1825
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,809
-Try it with the vegetables.
-That looks intense too.

1826
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,344
It looks too healthy.

1827
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,446
-With some bok choy.
-And some meat too.

1828
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,215
SLURP

1829
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,616
SLURP

1830
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,054
EYES SHUT

1831
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,390
It looks like he's having a tough time.

1832
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,225
It looks like he's getting puffy.

1833
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,326
Is it strong?

1834
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,627
It's unbelievably strong.

1835
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,562
It tastes extremely spicy,

1836
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,531
-extremely salty…
-Yes?

1837
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,500
…and the meat is extremely sweet too.

1838
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,136
Every single flavor in this dish
has been amplified.

1839
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,538
I see. It looks like
he's having a rough time.

1840
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,473
-I'm fine.
-Are you?

1841
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,276
-It's waking me up.
-A dish that wakes him up.

1842
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:55,544
-Brain puffiness.
-It's all intense.

1843
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,979
Man.

1844
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,981
I've never had
anything like this in my life.

1845
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:01,450
A VAGUE REMARK

1846
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,185
He seems to mean many things by that.

1847
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:04,787
You've had the salty dish, so…

1848
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,022
To sweetness, candied fruit!

1849
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,290
-Let's go, <i>tanghulu!</i>
-The ring.

1850
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:11,627
-Please put it on your index finger.
-Take a big bite.

1851
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,528
Thank you.

1852
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,664
He puts the ring on
and wants to look cute and puffy.

1853
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:16,999
It's to look cute and puffy.

1854
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,667
Watch your teeth.

1855
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,106
SMILING

1856
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:27,009
-He's smiling.
-He's getting a cavity.

1857
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,477
The mission wasn't to give a cavity.

1858
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:29,912
It'll make his teeth hurt.

1859
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,915
-Is it too sweet?
-That's what candied fruit tastes like.

1860
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,516
IS IT POSITIVE? OR NEGATIVE?

1861
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,585
-It's tough to read his face.
-Yes.

1862
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,020
What's it like?

1863
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,722
It's so sweet.

1864
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,759
It's so sweet.

1865
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,761
-Really? Without ethics?
-Is it that sweet?

1866
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,764
I feel like I just ate
a lump of sugar like this.

1867
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,367
He feels like he had a lump of sugar!

1868
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,202
Great work.

1869
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,970
Thank you so much.

1870
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,539
-It was a shocking experience.
-Yul can try some too.

1871
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:00,442
-Please try H.O.T. first.
-H.O.T.

1872
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,277
JONG-WON AND POONG
HAVE A BITE TOO

1873
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,714
First, the buckwheat noodles.

1874
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,183
The texture is closer to carbonara

1875
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,785
once the liver sauce is mixed in.

1876
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,121
Try the sushi roll too.

1877
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,358
OPENS HIS MOUTH
AND TAKES A BIG BITE

1878
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,728
EASY

1879
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,697
I think the buckwheat noodles

1880
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,734
will definitely make me puffy. Yep.

1881
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:27,636
And my liver puffy too.

1882
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:29,772
It'll make everything puffy.

1883
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,975
But what I really love is the sushi roll.

1884
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,576
-Really?
-The sushi roll?

1885
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,013
The ingredients already have
strong personalities,

1886
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,383
but I like how they all come together
once you put this sauce on it.

1887
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,719
Team Son-Poong,
have you tried the noodles?

1888
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:44,920
-Yes.
-And?

1889
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:45,854
It's too salty.

1890
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,959
The sushi roll was quite strong,

1891
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:54,830
but the frying batter on the outside
helped it taste a little less intense.

1892
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:58,967
I see. Next, Team Son-Poong's
Let's Go, Monkfish.

1893
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,106
It's spicy from the moment
I put it in my mouth.

1894
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,474
INTENSE

1895
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,610
That's how hot chili chicken
should taste like normally.

1896
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:11,313
-Jeez.
-But yes, of course…

1897
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,249
The order was to cook a dish
to make Jae-wook puffy.

1898
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,252
So it does have the balance
between spiciness and saltiness,

1899
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:20,923
-but they went even more intense.
-To focus on making him puffy?

1900
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,524
I'm the type who never gets bloated,

1901
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,027
but this will
definitely make me puffy too.

1902
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,629
-I feel like I'm swelling in real time.
-Really.

1903
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,832
My eyes will be too puffy
to open them in the morning.

1904
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,433
GRINNING

1905
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,937
-Even Ho-young says it's like that?
-Doesn't that mean he's dead?

1906
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,705
If you can't open your eyes…

1907
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,842
If you can't open your eyes,
doesn't that mean you're dead?

1908
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,710
Has that ever happened in the morning?

1909
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,178
It happens when you eat three bags

1910
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,181
of instant <i>jjajangmyeon</i>
and green onion kimchi.

1911
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,183
It makes you forgetful too.

1912
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,651
I'm like, "Did I get into a fight?"

1913
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:51,687
HE'S OUR GODFATHER, INDEED!

1914
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,989
Because you're puffy
like you've been beaten?

1915
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,757
THE POWER OF SPICY FRIED NOODLES

1916
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,160
That's how intense the noodles are.

1917
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,361
The ring.

1918
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:01,997
A BITE

1919
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,532
The candied fruit.

1920
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:07,135
Jae-wook said it felt
like he ate a fistful of sugar.

1921
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,504
UNSURE

1922
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:10,672
NO

1923
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,007
No?

1924
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:12,908
Two fistfuls.

1925
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,778
-Not one fistful, but two.
-Not one.

1926
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,516
-What's with you two?
-Did I look like that before too?

1927
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,051
Great job. I'm so proud of him.

1928
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:24,419
Chef Jong-won made this, right?

1929
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,289
I didn't think you were like this.

1930
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,424
I knew you were capable of it.

1931
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,693
Something must've been
pent up on the inside.

1932
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,329
-It's time for him to choose.
-It's a close fight.

1933
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:35,998
<i>Press one for H.O.T.</i>

1934
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,366
<i>Press two for Let's Go, Monkfish!</i>

1935
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:40,836
Which one did he choose?

1936
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,338
Will it be Poong and Jong-won?

1937
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,874
Or will it be Nam-no and Sung-jun?

1938
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,378
Which one is it?
Which one will make him cute and puffy?

1939
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,247
Will it be the Twins or Team Son-Poong?

1940
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,449
Let's see the result!

1941
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:56,518
The winner is?

1942
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,853
NAM-NO, SUNG-JUN WIN

1943
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,823
YOON NAM-NO & KWON SUNG-JUN'S
H.O.T. WINS

1944
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,560
-Nam-no and Sung-jun win!
-It's only natural.

1945
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:05,994
THE HIGH-CALORIE TWINS WIN!

1946
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,262
The Twins win.

1947
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,631
We won because of
the difference in weight class.

1948
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,100
You knew what it was like to get puffy.

1949
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,535
The meat was rather strong,

1950
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,804
so it would've been nicer
if the noodles were blander.

1951
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,674
Both of those had strong flavors,

1952
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,509
so I couldn't eat a lot of it.

1953
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,311
Although he's a guy who can eat a lot.

1954
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:23,946
That was the key point.

1955
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,514
-And the sushi roll.
-The sushi roll?

1956
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,851
I liked how you gave me the monkfish sauce
for me to dip as much as I wanted.

1957
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:35,190
I thought the sushi roll was
the most enjoyable, so I picked them.

1958
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,358
The sushi roll was the hero.

1959
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,494
Sadly, we don't get to see
the prince on his shoulders.

1960
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,396
-What a shame.
-It's such a shame.

1961
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,165
-I wanted to see it.
-You're right.

1962
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,933
It's quite a shame,

1963
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,668
but we'll keep working on us.

1964
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,104
Our journey begins now!

1965
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,306
TA-DA
DAY 1 STARTING TODAY

1966
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,541
Please put stars on them.

1967
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:56,144
Please put stars
on Chef Nam-no and Chef Sung-jun.

1968
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,580
-They both take their seventh win.
-Congrats!

1969
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:00,616
The Twins take their seventh victory.

1970
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:03,752
-Congratulations, Nam-no and Sung-jun!
-Thank you.

1971
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:04,886
Thank you.

1972
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,321
THEY COMFORTED THEIR SADNESS

1973
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,256
IN THE GREEN ROOM

1974
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,294
Please welcome today's fridge owners!

1975
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,896
Welcome to the show,
Kwaktube and Joo Woo-jae!

1976
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,733
-Congrats on your wedding.
-Thank you.

1977
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,302
They took my fridge
the day after my wedding.

1978
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,038
-She called me baby since we dated.
-Baby?

1979
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,239
WHAT NOW?

1980
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,041
My wife also has a job, so…

1981
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,777
-He called her his wife!
-Hey!

1982
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,312
SMELLS LIKE NEWLYWEDS

1983
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,613
CHEF ANTIMO RETURNS

1984
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,048
HERE FOR HIS SECOND STAR!

1985
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,149
I'm up for the challenge.

1986
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,283
A HUGE ITALIAN MATCH IS ON

1987
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,653
-Are you making fresh pasta?
-In just 15 minutes?

1988
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:38,754
Really?

1989
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,889
-The pasta is done.
-That's insane.

1990
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,190
That looks so good!

1991
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:43,258
So? Kwaktube?

1992
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,993
It's the taste I've been dreaming of.

1993
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,596
It's time for me to teach a lesson.

1994
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,164
-Hey, Yoon Nam-no.
-Dang it.

1995
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:50,599
Look at the octopus.

1996
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,200
-It's so plump.
-He looks confident.

1997
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,469
Learn to save on the ingredients.

1998
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:56,171
I'm going to make a sauce called ravigote.

1999
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,472
Hey, there. Mister!

2000
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,375
What? Are you telling me not to cook?
What am I supposed to do?

2001
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,277
-What's he doing?
-What is this?

2002
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,512
-It's an emergency.
-What is this?

2003
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:04,780
SUNG-JU GIVES UP ON TASTING?

2004
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,014
It feels so unpleasant!

2005
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:07,983
WHAT DID HE MAKE TO SHOCK EVERYONE?

2006
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,388
-So this is a wedding cake?
-Not a cursed cake?

2007
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,223
You're congratulating me
on my marriage, right?

2008
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,258
Of course.

2009
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:30,138
