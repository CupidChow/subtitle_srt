1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,648
Today is

2
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,818
a historical moment for <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

3
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:22,255
There has been a guest
that we wanted to invite

4
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,224
since the show began.

5
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,728
Our long wait is finally over,
because she is here today.

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,763
FINALLY!

7
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,098
Please welcome our guests today.

8
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,233
Come on out!

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,535
Here come our guests.

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,903
SUPER EXCITED

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,304
Today's fridge owners!

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,507
-Whoa!
-Welcome to the show!

13
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,208
Today's fridge owners!

14
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,744
LEE YOUNG-AE & KIM YOUNG-KWANG

15
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,846
Come on in.

16
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,348
Welcome to the show.

17
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,250
SCREEN NOT PAUSED

18
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,951
-She's radiant.
-Today's fridge owners.

19
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,921
Please welcome Lee Young-ae
and Kim Young-kwang.

20
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,589
Please take a seat.

21
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,924
STANDING UP?

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,328
-Hyun-suk stands up all of a sudden.
-Please have a seat. Yes.

23
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,431
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

24
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,599
Let me push the chair in for you.

25
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,836
-I've never seen you do that.
-You suddenly stood up to do that?

26
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,472
We waited for you for so long.

27
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,175
We're here with Lee Young-ae,
one of the most renowned Korean actors.

28
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,810
Welcome to the show.

29
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,412
All right.

30
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,815
Please greet our viewers.

31
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,216
Yes, hello.

32
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,885
Thank you for inviting me.
I'm Lee Young-ae.

33
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,020
All right!

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,256
-Her voice…
-It's beautiful.

35
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,625
-Allow me to introduce this man.
-Sure.

36
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,962
<i>A great actor with a wonderful physique,</i>
<i>the perfect Mr. Good Vibes.</i>

37
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,131
It's an honor to be in his presence.

38
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,667
-Please welcome actor Kim Young-kwang!
-Young-kwang!

39
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,469
Hello, I'm Kim Young-kwang.

40
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,770
Looking great!

41
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,406
I always wanted to
see him back here again.

42
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,109
We're so honored to have
such great guests here today.

43
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,811
And we really have Young-kwang,
whose name means "honor."

44
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,682
Since the launch of this show,

45
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:00,086
we kept saying the show is only meaningful
if we get Jang-geum to come for a taste.

46
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,154
She'd complete us.

47
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,523
I'm very satisfied
and proud of this moment.

48
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,560
We heard you enjoy watching the show.
Is this true?

49
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,431
Yes, I was so nervous last night
and couldn't sleep

50
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,000
that I watched the show
until 2:00 a.m. last night.

51
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,037
So it feels like I'm sitting here
with people I've seen on TV

52
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,240
-just moments ago.
-Oh, my.

53
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,443
That means you're all
celebrities to her, chefs.

54
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,478
LEE YOUNG-AE'S CELEBRITIES

55
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,448
Your daughter asked to get an autograph
from one of the chefs, right?

56
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,150
I hope it's me.

57
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,484
Maybe it's me.

58
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,521
I'm a fan,
but my daughter is an even bigger fan.

59
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,789
It's Chef Yoon Nam-no.

60
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,057
Really?

61
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,126
AUTOGRAPH

62
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,228
Gen Z kids love him.

63
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,963
How old is your daughter?

64
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,065
-She's 15.
-She's 15 years old.

65
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,967
Can you leave a message for her?

66
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,136
Oh, my.

67
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,338
-Why am I nervous?
-You're popular with middle school kids.

68
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,140
-Her name is Seung-bin.
-It's an honor.

69
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,475
I'm jealous.

70
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,010
-Yes.
-Her name is Su-bin.

71
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,012
-Su-bin.
-Her name's Su-bin.

72
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,747
MISCOMMUNICATED
HI, SU-BIN

73
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,550
You really have a good discerning eye.

74
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,884
What are you doing?

75
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,120
-She'll be thrilled.
-Oh, gosh.

76
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,755
I'M SO NERVOUS

77
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,457
I hope you'll always be happy. Bye!

78
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,227
-Thank you.
-There are many other great chefs here,

79
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,031
and Nam-no doesn't even have
a lot of stars right now.

80
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,332
So why him?

81
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,234
It's… I'm not so sure.

82
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,403
What do you think the reason is?

83
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,904
What could it be?

84
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,240
-Back at you.
-She's asking you instead.

85
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,841
I can tell from her question

86
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,777
that her mother isn't a fan of Nam-no.

87
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,781
She asked,
"Why do you think that's the case?"

88
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,050
-She doesn't get it.
-Doesn't get it at all.

89
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,854
We called Young-ae and Young-kwang
the chemistry that walks on thin ice.

90
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,123
-Can you tell us the reason?
-Sure.

91
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,762
Young-kwang and I star in a show
called <i>Walking on Thin Ice.</i>

92
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,332
It premieres on Saturday,

93
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,635
-September 20 at 9:20 p.m.
-I see.

94
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,438
-September 20.
-I'm an ordinary housewife

95
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,308
who obtains a bag of illegal drugs
by coincidence.

96
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,578
Then I meet a school instructor
who has two faces,

97
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:11,017
and show an uncanny yet bubbly chemistry
in a cat-and-mouse game.

98
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,486
It's a lot of fun, so please tune in.

99
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,190
It airs on Saturdays and Sundays,
so on weekends, right?

100
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,125
-At 9:20 p.m.?
-Yes.

101
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,594
-This is awkward.
-Same time…

102
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,364
-I'm sorry, but…
-We're also on air on Sundays,

103
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,032
-so we'll be rival shows.
-Wait.

104
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,735
-Really?
-We're in the same Sunday time slot.

105
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,802
NOT MAKING EYE CONTACT

106
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,271
-It's prime time.
-It's the same day.

107
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,505
ON EGGSHELLS

108
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,173
But we're cool about it.

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,144
We'll give you a chance
to promote your show.

110
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,313
Please watch us when we're on air.

111
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,382
I believe <i>Jewel in the Palace</i> reached

112
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,085
-up to 57.8% of viewer ratings in the end.
-Did you say 57%?

113
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,422
I heard other countries
welcomed you like a state guest.

114
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,191
I'm grateful that it was loved by many.

115
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,626
For example,

116
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,696
there's an International Ice
and Snow Festival in Harbin.

117
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,930
It was when I went there.

118
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,333
When prime ministers of a country visits,

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,671
they control the traffic lights
and drive nonstop, right?

120
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,140
-With police cars and all.
-Yes.

121
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,411
I remember driving nonstop
with the traffic lights under control.

122
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,613
-So you won't have to stop.
-I want to try that.

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,348
-She's like a state guest.
-In Taiwan,

124
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,485
a chef visited my hotel room

125
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,921
and cooked for me right there.

126
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,323
-In front of you?
-Yes.

127
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,957
There was a kitchen in the room.

128
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,659
What you just mentioned right now

129
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,028
can always happen whenever you want it.

130
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:35,001
-That's what you want to do.
-She's telling us her story right now.

131
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,969
Chef Jong-won, you were inspired

132
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,771
by <i>Jewel in the Palace?</i>

133
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,672
I was.

134
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,541
Korean food is a huge fad right now,

135
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:46,612
and I think it was possible because
such shows were a big hit in the past.

136
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,349
-It had a big impact on Korean cuisine.
-You're right.

137
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,118
I often said this
when I was out giving lectures.

138
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,588
"I said it tasted like ripe persimmon
because it did."

139
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,323
-That's how she answers the question.
-What?

140
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,325
-He can act.
-I use that quote in my lectures.

141
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:03,429
We'll go through Young-ae's fridge
in just a moment.

142
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,530
Can you give us a hint

143
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,866
about what you have in your fridge?

144
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,735
-Anything you'd like to reveal?
-I'm curious.

145
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,704
I've been keeping a vegetable garden.

146
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,740
-A vegetable garden?
-Yes, as food.

147
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,742
Are you talking about
the one in Yangpyeong?

148
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,877
We moved back to Seoul
from Yangpyeong now,

149
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,780
but I raised over ten different types.

150
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,015
-Over ten?
-Yes, there was a lot.

151
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:27,820
I still keep a tiny vegetable garden
on the rooftop of my house.

152
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,757
Sam had a garden
on the rooftop of his restaurant.

153
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,825
-You're right.
-That was so cool.

154
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,063
It takes more effort than you think.
It's not easy to keep.

155
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,398
You lived in Yangpyeong for a while.

156
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,234
-Yes, about eight years.
-I see.

157
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,904
Was there a special reason
why you thought you should live there?

158
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:49,008
I wanted to make
a hometown for my children.

159
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,712
If they stayed in Seoul, their hometown
would end up as an apartment complex.

160
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,280
But when I was younger,

161
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,382
-I'd go to my grandparents' place
-The countryside.

162
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,453
during summer break to hear crickets chirp
and frogs croaking in the countryside.

163
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,588
Even after many years,
those memories still linger.

164
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,689
Where's your hometown, Young-kwang?

165
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,259
Up until fourth grade,

166
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,360
I lived in the mountains.

167
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,961
-Mountain?
-The mountains?

168
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,698
It wasn't a big mountain,
but I'd pick chestnuts, climb trees,

169
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,168
and draw water from the mountain spring.

170
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,769
-So you've done that?
-Yes.

171
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,671
Yes, that's important
in someone's childhood.

172
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:23,075
Did food taste different when you cooked
with organic ingredients you grew?

173
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,110
It's on another level.

174
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,579
I'm sure the chefs would know better,

175
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,184
but carrots grown at home aren't big.
They come out to be this tiny.

176
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,486
Yet the smell of the carrot leaves

177
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,222
-was so amazing.
-I see.

178
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,058
That's why my children loved
eating vegetables.

179
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,994
That was helpful in growing my own food,
and one more thing.

180
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,965
It was green onions.
I didn't think I'd use a phrase like this,

181
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,235
but by the way they looked,
I thought they'd walk very soon.

182
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,737
-It was so…
-The green onions were walking?

183
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,774
I could even say that

184
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,410
because they looked muscular.

185
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,913
-The green onions.
-It looked so sturdy.

186
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,281
-It's…
-The green onions?

187
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,852
You probably know what I mean.
If you've seen it, you'd know.

188
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,554
It felt like they'd get up and walk soon,

189
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,823
and I would even pick it and eat it raw.

190
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,992
It tasted sweet even before it was cooked.

191
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,827
Do you have all the veggies you grew?

192
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,496
-I brought a few.
-A few.

193
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,730
Gosh.

194
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,767
You're here with Young-ae,
who's serious about organic food.

195
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,304
-It's time to open up Jang-geum's fridge.
-I'm looking forward to it.

196
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,474
So these two are Young-ae's fridges.

197
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,209
-She has two.
-She keeps two fridges.

198
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,011
-I'm curious.
-I want to see them.

199
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,313
We'll take a look
at the smaller one first.

200
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,315
It's probably from the vegetable garden.

201
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,017
She must use that one at home.

202
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,120
This is Young-ae's,
the Great Jang-geum's fridge.

203
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,889
Let us present it to you!

204
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,457
-The other side.
-It was this side.

205
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,758
EMBARRASSED

206
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,627
It was this side.

207
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,929
-All right.
-She has a lot of stuff.

208
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,465
It was this way. All right.

209
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,599
She has a lot of stuff.

210
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,402
I found something extraordinary.

211
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,404
I found this as soon as I opened it.

212
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,073
A TREE?

213
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,043
<i>I've been keeping</i>
<i>a 12-year-old blueberry tree,</i>

214
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,546
so we grow our own blueberries.

215
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,914
What's more interesting is

216
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,982
that blueberry leaves

217
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,319
change colors when fall comes.

218
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,121
If you roast the leaves,

219
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:19,392
I hear they're at least a dozen times
more nutritious than the berries.

220
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,760
So you eat the leaves?

221
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,796
I take them and brew it in hot water
like green tea leaves.

222
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,997
Oh, like tea.

223
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,899
-I didn't know that.
-It's better for your eyes.

224
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,435
When we lived in Yangpyeong,

225
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,038
<i>my kids would just pick the berries</i>
<i>and eat them,</i>

226
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,574
and they both had 20-20 vision.

227
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,076
-Blueberries are good for your eyes.
-They had 20-20 vision,

228
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,012
but it began to dwindle
after moving to Seoul,

229
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,480
staring at their phones and all.

230
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,316
EYES OPENED WIDE

231
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,084
Now, the first shelf.

232
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,287
I found a container. No, two containers.

233
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,724
These are… These are some leaves.
What are these?

234
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,125
Those are Korean melon leaves.

235
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,594
What's the purple one?

236
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,095
Purple? An eggplant flower.

237
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,530
You can eat Korean melon leaves?

238
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,998
We saw these in the photos.

239
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,402
Yes, I hear Korean melon leaves
are also edible, just like pumpkin leaves.

240
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,904
-Like pumpkin leaves?
-Yes.

241
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,205
I haven't tried it,

242
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,640
-but I heard it was edible.
-Steamed?

243
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,510
So I thought the chefs
would have an idea to make use of this.

244
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,245
There's another container.

245
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,481
Those must be pepper leaves.

246
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,783
-We often eat pepper leaves.
-We do.

247
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,554
-I'm seeing vegetables now. Eggplants.
-Eggplants.

248
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,356
-Did you grow those?
-Yes, on the rooftop.

249
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,957
-They're ripe and firm.
-All organic.

250
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,193
-I picked those yesterday.
-They're from yesterday.

251
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,929
She picked these yesterday,
these eggplants.

252
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,999
What's this? A baguette?

253
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,233
-What?
-What do you mean?

254
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,403
-What are these? Not baguettes?
-Baguettes? Come on.

255
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,638
-Mature cucumbers.
-They're good.

256
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,207
-Old cucumbers, mature cucumbers.
-Mature cucumbers.

257
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,275
Mature cucumbers.
She has more cucumbers there.

258
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,011
You do,
and you also keep mature cucumbers?

259
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:49,181
My husband doesn't like fragrant veggies
such as perilla leaves and cucumbers,

260
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,717
but he likes mature cucumbers.

261
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,219
What about your kids?

262
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,254
They don't eat it too often.

263
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,391
It probably isn't easy to cook something

264
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,893
that your husband and kids all like.

265
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,030
-That's why I'm here to learn today.
-She came to learn today.

266
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,332
-This became harder.
-I'm scared.

267
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,067
The more I listen to her speak,

268
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,837
the more it sounds like
she came to test the chefs today.

269
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,607
She's like, "Can you do this too?"

270
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,009
-I found Korean melons.
-Korean melons.

271
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,612
-Look at them.
-Are these from your rooftop too?

272
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,414
-Yes.
-They're huge.

273
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,749
I haven't washed them,
so you can still see dirt on them.

274
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,884
-You haven't washed them?
-No.

275
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,385
-How plump.
-Straight from the garden.

276
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,955
-Some chili peppers and arugula.
-The peppers are huge too.

277
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,124
-You also raise arugula?
-I do.

278
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,759
-My gosh.
-Whoa.

279
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,362
These are organic,
so a worm took a bite out.

280
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,296
It's the real deal.

281
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,299
-Are these herbs?
-Yes, mints.

282
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,501
-These are in zipper bags.
-I dried them.

283
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,670
I dried the mint

284
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,339
to have it as tea and for my foot bath.

285
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,309
It helps you relax and sleep well.

286
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,812
-I see. Because of the fragrance?
-Yes.

287
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,513
Hey.

288
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,550
-Sweet potatoes and corn.
-Whoa.

289
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,218
-You grow sweet potatoes?
-Yes.

290
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,321
The corn isn't fully ripe yet,

291
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,824
because water deer
infested my garden in Yangpyeong

292
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,660
-and began to eat them.
-Water deer?

293
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,196
-I couldn't take it.
-That's why the grains are smaller.

294
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,100
I couldn't let the deer eat everything,
so I harvested everything in a hurry,

295
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,269
so they aren't fully ripened yet.

296
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,405
The water deer knew
it was Jang-geum's place.

297
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,373
They thought the corn looked great.

298
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,743
I should raid her garden soon.

299
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,511
-The best in Yangpyeong.
-Great to eat out at.

300
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,247
What are these? Potatoes.

301
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,183
They came out kind of small.
I dug them out myself.

302
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,686
-Gosh.
-They'll taste good simmered in sauce.

303
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,721
-Do you grow garlic too?
-Yes, garlic.

304
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,958
-I grew those too.
-Are you serious? My gosh.

305
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,960
You grow just about everything.

306
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,762
-You won't need to buy food.
-It's like a market.

307
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,530
-You're right.
-These?

308
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,365
-And the sweet pumpkin?
-The pumpkin?

309
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,467
-No, not the sweet pumpkin.
-Not this.

310
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,603
I grew some last year,
but I bought that one.

311
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,239
-I see.
-But I do grow them.

312
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,107
Now, the main refrigerator.

313
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,042
This is Young-ae's main fridge.

314
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,244
Let's see it!

315
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,113
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE IN THE MAIN FRIDGE?

316
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,016
-It's completely full.
-Yes.

317
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,585
-I see some side dishes.
-Yes.

318
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,521
It must be for your family.

319
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,923
-Cucumbers?
-Mature cucumbers.

320
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,293
I seasoned it with <i>chogochujang</i>
and green plums.

321
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,828
The recipe isn't special.

322
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,497
I just add lots of green plum extract.

323
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,065
I like to make sweet and sour dishes.

324
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,702
-That's why you have the green plums.
-They're there.

325
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,539
I like dishes that are sweet and salty,

326
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,908
but I've been trying to change my palate.

327
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,478
I want to add the sweet flavor
with healthier ingredients,

328
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,779
so what else can I use?

329
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,817
Jang-geum in <i>Jewel in the Palace</i> used
ripe persimmon, so I tried that too.

330
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,718
-You actually tried it?
-Yes.

331
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,520
I like the sweet flavor,

332
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,456
so what can I use other than sugar
to add that note?

333
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,759
-For your health.
-I want to research that a little.

334
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,095
She still needs to buy tofu.

335
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,165
-Of course, she has to buy that.
-Of course, she does.

336
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,334
She doesn't have enough time to make tofu.

337
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,069
So you eat store-bought tofu?

338
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,104
I've grown bean sprouts,

339
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,507
but I haven't tried making tofu yet.

340
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,975
You grew bean sprouts?

341
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,243
That's amazing.

342
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,145
She grew bean sprouts. Do you enjoy tofu?

343
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,413
I do.

344
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,417
My son is 15 and has lots of energy,

345
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,420
so he mostly likes meat
instead of something softer.

346
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,689
-My 15-year-old son doesn't like it.
-It's the texture.

347
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,592
I see <i>mala</i> sauce. Do you like spicy food?

348
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,861
-Well…
-It must be for her kids.

349
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,731
Kids these days love everything
with <i>mala </i>sauce.

350
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,266
Why do they like it so much?

351
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,868
Right? No one hates it.

352
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,638
According to our source,
they enjoy <i>mala</i> sauce so much in Seoul

353
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,674
after eating
only organic food in Yangpyeong.

354
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,345
Right? They began to enjoy
ordering delivery food,

355
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,914
so my years of effort to feed organic food
came to nothing.

356
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,449
That's not good.

357
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,417
Your kids must be thrilled now.

358
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,387
They're like,
"This is what Seoul is all about."

359
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,089
We took both fridges today, right?

360
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,391
So they'll be like,
"Yes! We're eating <i>malatang</i> today!"

361
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,594
They begin to order food
as soon as I'm away from home.

362
00:14:55,661 --> 00:15:00,299
She spent the first seven, eight years
trying to give them only good food.

363
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,601
-Everything changed instantly.
-I see.

364
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,770
-Why do you have so much powder?
-Yes, powder.

365
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,005
Is this grain powder?

366
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,473
That's bean powder.

367
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,841
This must be black sesame.

368
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,543
Does this mean you like the nutty flavor?

369
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,546
Yes, that too, and it's good for you.

370
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,515
Health must be your biggest concern.

371
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,884
Look at these fruits.

372
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,020
-Yes.
-Watermelon and figs.

373
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,922
-Is this a peach?
-A peach.

374
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,791
What are these on this side?

375
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,361
Are these cosmetic products?
You must keep them cold in the fridge.

376
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,030
Actually,

377
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,865
I made my cosmetic line

378
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,867
after giving birth to my kids,

379
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,835
while I lived in Yangpyeong.

380
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,405
You even made cosmetic products there?

381
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,341
<i>-Yes, my research lab is there.</i>
<i>-My gosh.</i>

382
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,411
-I have a lab next to my place.
-You do a lot of stuff in Yangpyeong.

383
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,880
I'll give you some, so please try it out.

384
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,748
-I have some.
-Wait.

385
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,017
Time to check out the freezer.

386
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,153
Is this ice cream?

387
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,755
My children love red bean <i>bingsu</i>,
shaved ice,

388
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,291
and they kept the leftovers in there.

389
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,960
They're leftovers.

390
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,328
-It's hot these days.
-Yes.

391
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,964
-And these are pine nuts?
-Yes.

392
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,066
Back in Yangpyeong,

393
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,468
I used to make basil pesto.

394
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,137
I made it with basil I grew,
pine nuts, and olive oil.

395
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,173
She definitely likes the nutty flavor.

396
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,975
-Something clean and nutty.
-Yes.

397
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,311
She probably has
some key ingredients in here.

398
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,447
-What's that?
-Is this fish?

399
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,049
-It says, "Twins."
-Yes.

400
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,918
It's probably Atka mackerel.

401
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:31,290
At times, my mom sends them to me
from a business she knows well,

402
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,559
marked with the label, "Twins."

403
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,961
I'm seeing some red meat here.

404
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,763
-Brisket.
-Beef.

405
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,531
-Pork shoulder.
-She has everything.

406
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,335
-Gosh.
-Gosh, these are obviously eels.

407
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,737
WHY IS SAM SO SHOCKED?

408
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,073
We often get eels as a present,

409
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,176
but I have no idea how to cook them.

410
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,312
I still couldn't throw them out,

411
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,681
so they've been sitting in the freezer.

412
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,050
-They're as big as an anaconda.
-They are.

413
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,685
-They look wild too.
-They're huge.

414
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,887
You can feel free to use these.

415
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,890
Abalones and an octopus.

416
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,892
-She has everything expensive.
-She does.

417
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,193
What's this?

418
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,496
-Sea bream?
-It's a sea bream.

419
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,098
-My gosh.
-It's a sea bream.

420
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,434
Now, what kind of dishes

421
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,603
is Young-ae looking for today?

422
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,772
These are what the Great Jang-geum wants.

423
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,974
Show us her orders!

424
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,576
-Health walking on thin ice.
-Thin ice.

425
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,914
-<i>Walking on Thin Ice.</i>
-Your new show is <i>Walking on Thin Ice.</i>

426
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,984
During the production of the show,

427
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,287
I realized how important it was
to eat well.

428
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,324
So I've been wondering
what could help me get more energy.

429
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,628
-I have seafood and other ingredients,
-The ingredients all look great.

430
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,932
and I thought the chefs
would make something with unique recipes.

431
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,701
-That's why I asked for that.
-I see.

432
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,171
And what's the next order?

433
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,206
Do you want some naturalist dishes?

434
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,975
-Do you want some naturalist dishes?
-It must be that line.

435
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,377
Oh, right.

436
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,612
-The line from <i>One Fine Spring Day.</i>
-Yes.

437
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,649
-Right. "Do you want some <i>ramyeon?"</i>
-"Do you want some <i>ramyeon?"</i>

438
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,618
Can you read the order in that tone?
What's the order?

439
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,720
Do you want some naturalist dishes?

440
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,090
Do you want some naturalist dishes?

441
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,758
YES

442
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,893
The can't beat the original.

443
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,496
I almost had some with her just now.

444
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,464
Wow, jeez.

445
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,435
As you just saw, I grew a variety
of vegetables in my garden.

446
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,605
I thought the chefs would make
different kinds of dishes with them.

447
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,975
I want to ask for a vegetable dish
that my children would enjoy

448
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,778
as well as my husband,

449
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,514
who doesn't like to eat cucumbers.

450
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,683
When it comes to naturalist dishes…

451
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,785
-It's…
-Shouldn't you be up?

452
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,353
We have a naturalist among us.

453
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,489
-Of course, he can't hold back.
-Yes, I'll do it.

454
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,124
There's no one but Chef Sam.

455
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,359
You're finally making a naturalist dish?

456
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,028
-And he's kept a rooftop garden.
-You're right.

457
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:50,963
A commonality.

458
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,298
I'll go for "health walking on thin ice."

459
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,668
-Health walking on thin ice.
-Nutritional food.

460
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,804
As a Korean cuisine chef,

461
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,007
I always wanted to get a chance
to cook for her,

462
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,344
because <i>Jewel in the Palace</i>
inspired me greatly in my journey.

463
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,678
-You're right.
-You owe her that.

464
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,280
Anyone else?

465
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,382
-I'll go.
-Chef Eun-yeong.

466
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:14,386
Chinese cuisine is famous
for nutritional dishes

467
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,622
so I'll use that to my advantage.

468
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,623
That sounds great.

469
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,058
Chinese cuisine has invigorating dishes.

470
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,295
If you think you can beat Sam,
feel free to challenge him.

471
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,796
Not with a naturalist dish.

472
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,232
-I'll cook a naturalist dish.
-What?

473
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,302
-I'm doing it to challenge Sam.
-Just to challenge him?

474
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,305
Ho-young jumps in just to challenge Sam.

475
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,643
Then let us begin
with Jong-won and Eun-yeong's round!

476
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,911
KOREAN VS CHINESE

477
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,849
<i>This is the first battle</i>
<i>with ingredients from Young-ae's fridge.</i>

478
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,252
The round is titled,
"Health walking on thin ice."

479
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,722
The two energetic chefs are
up against each other this time.

480
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,392
A moth that isn't afraid
to jump into flames,

481
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,494
Chef Eun-yeong.

482
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,129
The strongest punch

483
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,864
and the stone-fist fighter of the show,

484
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,101
Chef Jong-won is up too.
This is their first battle.

485
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,103
She asked you to cook a healthy dish.

486
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,973
First of all, Chef Jong-won has
a strong physique.

487
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,441
-He's built well.
-He is.

488
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,212
Also, he had the strongest punch
when we had a mini contest.

489
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,847
Whoa! That was strong!

490
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,182
He gets 953 points!

491
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,518
HE BEAT AHN BO-HYUN, AN EX-BOXER, AND WON!

492
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,688
I remember Bo-hyun leaving the show
a little embarrassed.

493
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,056
-That's right.
-Yes.

494
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,991
You feel confident, don't you?

495
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,459
-I do.
-Okay.

496
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,561
I may be less experienced than him,

497
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,798
but I probably have made many more
restorative and healthy dishes than him.

498
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,901
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:
CHIVES, SHIITAKE, MATURE CUCUMBER

499
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,170
LIQUID SEASONING, SWEET PUMPKIN,
SEA BREAM, TOMATOES

500
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,339
My dish is called

501
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,908
-Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall.
-Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall!

502
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,043
-Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall?
-Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall!

503
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,578
-Yes.
-Is it Buddha Jumps Over the Wall?

504
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,846
You're right.

505
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,615
Can she do that in 15 minutes?

506
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,617
-In 15 minutes?
-It's a Chinese dish.

507
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,353
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is a dish

508
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,123
usually made with all kinds of delicacies.

509
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,362
So I'll make Buddha Jumps Over the Wall
with vegetables she grew,

510
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,763
full of energy from the earth.

511
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,964
-With vegetables?
-Yes.

512
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,766
I'll make the broth with sea bream bones

513
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,270
and create a strong flavor.

514
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,071
While I worked in Hong Kong,

515
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,806
the staff would make soup

516
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,909
with mature cucumbers
when we were feeling down.

517
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,712
-We season it and eat it cold in Korea.
-Yes.

518
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,482
So I wanted her to try it as a warm dish.

519
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,417
-That's new.
-A warm mature cucumber dish?

520
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,585
So I'll make those

521
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,955
and some fish fillet dumplings
with sea bream meat

522
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,125
to let her spend a cool summer
after eating these hot dishes.

523
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,559
Fighting fire with fire.

524
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,462
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS: CUCUMBERS,
WHITE BALSAMIC VINEGAR, OCTOPUS, ABALONE

525
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,598
KOREAN BEEF BRISKET, OMIJA, BONE BROTH,
KOREAN MELON, MALLOW, AND MORE

526
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,635
Up against her is Chef Jong-won.
What are you making?

527
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,638
Mind Your Pine Nuts.

528
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,041
-Mind Your Pine Nuts?
-Mind Your Pine Nuts?

529
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,542
Mind Your Pine Nuts.

530
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,110
THE ACTOR IS PLEASED

531
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,278
Young-ae is cracking up.

532
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,847
Mind Your Pine Nuts.

533
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,215
She's pissed.

534
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,617
HEHE, BOOHOO

535
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,720
-Mind Your Pine Nuts?
-You're only using pine nuts?

536
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,955
I want to use lots of pine nuts
because they're healthy.

537
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,092
-Pine nuts.
-I'll make a cold salad in pine nut soup.

538
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,194
I'll also use seafood and meat,

539
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,229
and she also said
that she liked the sweet flavor.

540
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,864
I saw lots of good fruit,

541
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,368
so I'll make something tasty
that will still supplement your health.

542
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,803
I see.

543
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,038
The thing about my dish today is

544
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,240
that it's inspired
by traditional noble cuisine.

545
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,742
-Traditional noble cuisine?
-It refers

546
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,278
to home-cooked dishes
noble families had back in the day.

547
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,147
-The recipes come with secret kicks.
-I see.

548
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,283
Traditional noble cuisine,
like aristocrats?

549
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,085
-Yes.
-In the Joseon era.

550
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,487
Which one of the dishes
will Young-ae choose?

551
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,658
Let us begin the round titled,
"Health walking on thin ice."

552
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,394
Chef Eun-yeong this
she'll walk on thin ice

553
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,764
and successfully take Jong-won down
on a good day like this.

554
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,501
But Mr. Vengeance here says,
"Hey, mind your own."

555
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,770
Chef Jong-won is up against her.

556
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:56,274
Which one of the two chefs
will capture Jang-geum's appetite?

557
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,678
Let the 15-minutes cook-off begin!

558
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,079
-Okay!
-Let's go.

559
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,515
You don't have much time.

560
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,584
-Begin!
-Okay!

561
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,253
You don't have much time,

562
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,789
especially so
for Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

563
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,759
-She fought against time once before,
-Right.

564
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,361
when she served half of what she wanted
instead of a full wrap.

565
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,231
She failed to make the oatmeal pancake.

566
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,132
The oatmeal disaster.

567
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,701
She made a mistake then.
She's working on the sea bream.

568
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,236
-That's a good size.
-Sea bream fillet.

569
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,871
SHE SLICES OF JUST THE MEAT

570
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,339
It's so fresh.

571
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,174
-It looks plump too.
-Yes.

572
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,643
A NEW KNIFE

573
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,280
SLAM

574
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,048
That's the tough girl.

575
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,284
THE BLOODY MS. EUN-YEONG

576
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,621
She'll deep-fry the fish bone first
to make the broth.

577
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,423
I see. Does it make it different?

578
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,459
It'll make it more savory.

579
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,995
Chef Eun-yeong has a plan.

580
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,465
WHAT WILL SON JANG-GEUM MAKE
FOR THE GREAT JANG-GEUM?

581
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,066
ROASTING GINKGO NUTS!

582
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,402
Chef Jong-won is roasting ginkgo nuts.

583
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,137
-Did you grow those?
-Yes?

584
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,072
-No, not the ginkgo nuts.
-No?

585
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:07,179
1. PARBOIL MALLOW
IN SALTED BOILING WATER

586
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,480
TIMER ON

587
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,216
He's roasting ginkgo nuts.
What's in the pot?

588
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,918
I'm cooking mallow.

589
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,020
-Mallow?
-Mallow?

590
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,621
-I see.
-Is he making mallow soup?

591
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,724
It's been a minute already.

592
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,226
2. PEEL AND REMOVE SEEDS FROM KOREAN MELON

593
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,362
Is that the Korean melon Young-ae grew?

594
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,897
Yes, she said she grew this.

595
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,834
Why did you set the timer?

596
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,102
He did that to stop cooking mallow.

597
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,904
-The time.
-In a minute and 30 seconds.

598
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,207
He set it for a minute and 30 seconds.

599
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,909
-Without going over a second.
-No.

600
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,878
Will it cause a problem
if you go over the time?

601
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,882
He always has a set time
for cooking ingredients at his restaurant.

602
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,317
By the second.

603
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,185
-He's on the dot.
-Yes.

604
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,454
CLEANING ABALONE

605
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,491
-Jong-won uses the octopus.
-The octopus.

606
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,759
-He's using that and abalones.
-You don't have much time.

607
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,595
TIMER ON

608
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,197
HIS PATENTED GOOD VIBES TURN

609
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,765
He set the timer again.

610
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,900
TIMING ABALONE AND OCTOPUS TOO!

611
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,835
WHAT ABOUT CHEF EUN-YEONG?

612
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,172
QUICKLY GETTING TOMATOES READY

613
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,440
The mature cucumber.

614
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,876
She said she'd boil and cook it.

615
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,512
2. HOLLOW IT OUT AND CHOP INTO PIECES

616
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,281
Yes, the Hong Kong style.
She's working on the mature cucumber.

617
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,352
Chef Eun-yeong is using a pressure cooker.

618
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,888
-That must be the broth.
-I don't have much time.

619
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,523
That saves a lot of time.

620
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,224
It adds lots of flavors in a short period.

621
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,527
So Eun-yeong is trying to save time.

622
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,596
-I'm done frying veggies and fish.
-Green onion, garlic, and onion.

623
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,598
They go into a pressure cooker.

624
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,667
Will it taste like
it's been boiled for a while?

625
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,971
We mostly eat mature cucumbers cold,

626
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,275
-but they're often eaten as soup in China.
-I see.

627
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,578
That's the Korean melon
she grew on the rooftop.

628
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,013
They still had dirt on them.

629
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,915
-They're organic.
-They are.

630
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,483
REMOVING THE SOFT PARTS

631
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,118
He's so detailed.

632
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,420
CUTTING INTO THE SAME-SIZED PIECES

633
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,956
NEXT, CUCUMBERS FROM YOUNG-AE'S FARM!

634
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,724
Cucumbers and Korean melons.

635
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,026
REMOVING THE SKIN

636
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,327
CHECKING ON THE GINKGO NUTS

637
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,198
GINKGO NUTS ARE OFF THE HEAT

638
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,367
BEEP

639
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,069
-Can you turn it off?
-It goes off again!

640
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,371
-Again? What is it?
-What's that alarm?

641
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,040
What's he doing?

642
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,508
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

643
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,842
His timing is immaculate.

644
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,277
Is he a robot or what?

645
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,912
He timed himself.

646
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,349
In the old days,
we used to call chefs like him

647
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,817
computer-like.

648
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,085
So he's a computer-like chef.

649
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,554
-A computer-like chef.
-A computer-like chef?

650
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,690
-Computer?
-That's right.

651
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,857
He doesn't allow any errors.

652
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,693
That means he's immaculate.

653
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,528
-That's such an ancient story.
-Yes.

654
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,497
He's talking about the 1990s.

655
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,833
-The sweet pumpkin.
-The sweet pumpkin!

656
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,036
-She's using that too?
-It takes time to cook.

657
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,404
It'll take a while.

658
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,441
-The sweet pumpkin.
-It'll take a while to cook that.

659
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,177
Wait, you're steaming that?

660
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,946
-It'd be quicker in a microwave.
-That won't get cooked.

661
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:55,847
It won't.

662
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,249
Right. You have 11 minutes now.

663
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,584
How can you cook the pumpkin?

664
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,686
-She can't.
-You only have ten minutes.

665
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,189
He's using different ingredients now.

666
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,592
-Beef brisket.
-He's using beef brisket!

667
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,796
Young-ae said she prefers meat to seafood.

668
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,499
MINCED GARLIC

669
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,004
A SUDDEN FIRE SHOW

670
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:20,905
ABLAZE

671
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,441
CLAPPING

672
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,144
THE BIGGEST FIRE YET ON THE SHOW

673
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,213
IT ALMOST REACHED HIS HAIR

674
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,516
-Did you burn your hair?
-Isn't that too big?

675
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,385
Your bangs are burnt.

676
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,786
I think he burnt his hair.

677
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,422
-That would've been more fun.
-Yes.

678
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,324
Your hair is on fire, Chef Jong-won!

679
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,825
No, go to the left.

680
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,293
Over here.

681
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,296
In Western cuisine,
there is a technique called flambé,

682
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,166
when you set the ingredients on fire
by using alcohol.

683
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:52,637
I think Chef Jong-won has begun
to add performances to his routine.

684
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,673
I see. A performance.

685
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,074
Maybe not.

686
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,642
He glared at you.

687
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,543
He glared.

688
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,379
WHAT ABOUT CHEF EUN-YEONG,
WHO LOST THEIR ATTENTION?

689
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,549
She's slicing sea bream like raw fillets.

690
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,217
TREMBLING

691
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,054
You should've borrowed my knife
if you were going to do that.

692
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,689
She's using a Chinese kitchen knife.

693
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,457
She's having a tough time.

694
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,126
She has to fillet that
as thinly as possible.

695
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,861
-She'll make dumplings with that?
-Yes.

696
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,298
Fish fillets are used as skin
for fish dumplings.

697
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,834
-I see. The fillets.
-They have to be very thin.

698
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,769
So that was the dumpling skin.

699
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,205
Chef Eun-yeong uses shiitake.

700
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,207
Shiitake.

701
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,743
5. SLICE SHIITAKE,
SEASON WITH MINCED GARLIC AND SESAME OIL

702
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,511
Do you enjoy shiitake?

703
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,714
Shiitake?

704
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,649
I try to eat it often for my health.

705
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,118
But do I like it?

706
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,087
I'm not so sure.

707
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,621
-You don't?
-Do you not like it?

708
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,824
She eats it to stay in good health.

709
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,659
-But she doesn't prefer it.
-No.

710
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,395
Chef Eun-yeong will show
how delicious shiitake can be

711
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,597
-through this dish.
-That'll be amazing.

712
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,467
-It feels like meat when prepared well.
-You're right.

713
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,302
-That's true.
-It becomes chewy.

714
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,772
She's topping sea bream fillet
with shiitake.

715
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,941
I guess those will be the dumplings.

716
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,409
What's that?

717
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,845
-She'll tie them with chives.
-Chives?

718
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,313
And keep it together.

719
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,416
He's making a nutritional dish
that noble families ate.

720
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,753
FIG

721
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,154
What's that?

722
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,789
-Pine nuts?
-Yes.

723
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,090
They're pine nuts.

724
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,692
They're crucial to his recipe.

725
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,228
He's grinding pine nuts.

726
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,063
He grinds pine nuts.

727
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,866
What's he putting the nuts in?

728
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,534
I'm going to mix it with this.

729
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,536
He ground it up
so that he can mix it all up.

730
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,305
I'll make both ground pine nuts
and pine nut juice.

731
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,107
Pine nut juice? That's bone broth.

732
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,076
-Bone broth.
-And balsamic vinegar.

733
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,111
It's white balsamic vinegar
instead of vinegar.

734
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,714
He also adds honey and soy sauce.

735
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,915
LEMON JUICE

736
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,416
-Lemon juice?
-And lemon juice.

737
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,019
That's sea bream fillet and…

738
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,188
That's such invaluable food.

739
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,490
Figs and… That'll taste nice as sauce.

740
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,993
It must be good for your body.

741
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,027
And it looks delicious.

742
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,396
And nutty. That sauce looks really good.

743
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,732
Inspired by the food
that noble families ate.

744
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,634
You have seven minutes
and ten seconds left.

745
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,169
-Seven minutes.
-Seven?

746
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,171
You have seven minutes
and ten seconds left.

747
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,039
It's an emergency.

748
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,041
You're about halfway done.

749
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,177
You only have halfway more to go.

750
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,078
TIED WITH CHIVES AND READY TO GO

751
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,647
The dumplings look pretty.

752
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,651
She just tied the dumplings with chives.

753
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,186
She made fish dumplings.

754
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,854
-Steam them.
-The sweet pumpkin…

755
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,790
-It couldn't have been cooked.
-It's still raw.

756
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,192
It's an emergency.

757
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,594
-Will it get cooked?
-You have six minutes.

758
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,596
-It's still hard.
-Right?

759
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,165
-It'll never get cooked?
-Sung-jun says never.

760
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,968
It won't get cooked
unless she makes it thinner.

761
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,304
-It'd take a while even if she boiled it.
-Chef Eun-yeong!

762
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,673
She should've steamed that too.

763
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,607
The heat is too low.

764
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,010
-Sweet pumpkins take forever to cook.
-It does.

765
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:49,347
She just showed a faint smile.
What does she mean by that?

766
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,316
-We don't know what she'll do.
-She starts a fire.

767
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,517
Is that a candle?

768
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,785
Yes, I wanted to serve it hot.

769
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,654
-You'll cook it with that?
-But that's impossible.

770
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,356
That's just a tealight.

771
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,691
Are you trying to pray?

772
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,726
-It's a tealight.
-It's to pray for her victory.

773
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,596
-She'll pray and ask to win.
-It's her prayer.

774
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,097
It's like a spell.

775
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,665
This must be hard for Eun-yeong.

776
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,300
I'm the target today.

777
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,870
We took things too far.

778
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,905
REOPENS IT TO CHECK

779
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,974
It won't get cooked
if you keep opening it!

780
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,875
It's not cooked.

781
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,776
A bit. It's almost done.

782
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,378
-It's not.
-I just need the outer layer.

783
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,347
It's cooked? It's almost cooked?

784
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,982
Like 0.2 mm of the whole thing.

785
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,583
Like 0.2 mm?

786
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,387
-He grabbed the abalone.
-Abalone.

787
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,422
He parboiled them using a timer.

788
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,825
He's making cuts in layers.

789
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,294
MAKING LAYERS IN THE ABALONE

790
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,429
Cuts in layers.
That's an advanced technique.

791
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,597
That looks great.

792
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,434
ONCE AGAIN, VERTICALLY

793
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,237
-It looks great.
-I knew it'd look good.

794
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,575
THROWING PARBOILED MALLOW INTO THE MIX

795
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,745
USING JUST THE CUCUMBER SKIN

796
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,381
Octopus. He grabs an octopus leg.

797
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,715
He's cutting in the same layers.

798
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,584
Why does he do it like that?

799
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,586
That gives it better texture.

800
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,555
-This is an advanced technique.
-It looks good.

801
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,723
BEAT WITH A KNIFE AND SOFTEN

802
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,229
This is a Korean restorative dish that
aristocrats had during the Joseon era.

803
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,698
-Sung-ju, please go out to the kitchen.
-Yes?

804
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,167
-Five minutes! Let me go out.
-Please.

805
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,436
Everything I can try is getting cooked.

806
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,738
There's nothing I can try.

807
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,740
I can only sample the Korean dish.

808
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,943
-The pine nut juice.
-Yes, the pine nut juice.

809
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,679
This is the kind of dish
Lord Kim and Lord Park had.

810
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,014
Can he tell Eun-yeong

811
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,849
to mind her own?

812
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,818
Can he tell Eun-yeong to mind her own?

813
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,688
Eun-yeong, mind your own.

814
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,523
Just mind your own.

815
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,260
If you want to win,
you have to mind your own.

816
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,461
Just mind your own.

817
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,663
-That juice is delicious.
-It's an emergency.

818
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,434
Young-ae, I think you'll love this.

819
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,236
-It tastes classy.
-It does?

820
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,805
Gosh, Jong-won!

821
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,941
-It's an emergency.
-It is.

822
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,345
You must make something
Young-ae will love.

823
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,080
The pumpkin won't get cooked.

824
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,581
She pulls it out.

825
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,185
-The sweet pumpkin!
-The big piece didn't get cooked, right?

826
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,088
There's nothing I can taste
on Chef Eun-yeong's side,

827
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,156
although she has three minutes left.

828
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,493
What's that? She's grinding the pumpkin.

829
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,163
-She's grinding that.
-It's way too little to work.

830
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,899
-You'll need liquid.
-Isn't this too little?

831
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,035
-Is it okay?
-I just need this.

832
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,406
JONG-WON BEGINS TO SERVE THE DISH!

833
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,909
5. SERVE MELON, BRISKET, ABALONE,
FIG, OCTOPUS, MALLOW, CUCUMBER

834
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:36,180
It Western cuisine, it's considered
luxurious to mix seafood with meat.

835
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,549
But many Korean dishes are like that.

836
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,952
He made the layers in the seafood

837
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,488
to let the sauce
stay on the pieces more easily.

838
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,455
He's that detailed.

839
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,558
He's serving his dish right now

840
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,861
Young-ae also likes beautiful things.

841
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,529
The Korean melon flower.

842
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,530
Pepper leaves.

843
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:56,601
-Pepper flowers.
-He's just using the flowers!

844
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,070
He's using the flowers.

845
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,239
-The pepper flowers.
-He uses them as decoration.

846
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,840
That was Jong-won's witty move.

847
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,010
Young-ae pointed out the flowers before.

848
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,446
-What are these?
-The ginkgo nuts.

849
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,381
She asked for good presentation as well.

850
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,184
FINISHING WITH PINE NUT POWDER

851
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,952
He's already done.

852
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,320
You have a minute and 40 seconds.

853
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,691
-Chef Eun-yeong's broth is done.
-It's done!

854
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,260
-It's here.
-Where's the broth?

855
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,162
She just pulled it out of the cooker.

856
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,631
It's the broth I made
by mixing it with sweet pumpkin.

857
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,300
The broth. Let me try this one.

858
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,635
This is it.

859
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,039
Can she make Young-ae jump over the wall
with Buddha Jumps Over the Wall?

860
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,074
Gosh.

861
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,310
It's a bit too bland,
but I feel reluctant to say this.

862
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,779
It's too bland for my taste.

863
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,881
That's why I'm saying this.

864
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,484
It's too bland for my taste.

865
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,087
That's why I'm saying this.

866
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,056
It tasted too bland for me.

867
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,691
-She's pouring it now.
-What about salt?

868
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,493
I seasoned it a little just now.

869
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,361
She did it. I love the color.

870
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,863
Forty-four seconds!

871
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,598
You have under a minute left.

872
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,468
Forty seconds left. Please hurry.

873
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,269
Her hands are trembling.

874
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,471
Her hands are trembling.

875
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,941
And the dumplings! They look ready.

876
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,310
Jong-won seems much more composed.

877
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,312
He's almost ready to serve that.

878
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,646
Fifteen seconds.

879
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,816
-Eun-yeong.
-Fifteen seconds.

880
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,351
-And the sea bream.
-Hurry.

881
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,687
-Ten seconds.
-The dumpling.

882
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,621
-Eight.
-Eight.

883
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,823
-Seven. Six.
-Seven. Six.

884
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,958
-Five.
-Five.

885
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,060
-Eight. Seven.
-Eight. Seven.

886
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,229
-Six. Five.
-Six. Five.

887
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,431
-Six. Five.
-Six. Five.

888
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,566
-Four. Three.
-Jong-won is done!

889
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,502
-Four. Three.
-Jong-won is done!

890
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,370
-Two. One.
-Eun-yeong is done too!

891
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,472
Eun-yeong finished as well.

892
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,508
AMAZED

893
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,609
Did it go well?

894
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,044
That was exhausting.

895
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,579
-They're coming.
-They look good.

896
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,449
And now, both dishes were made

897
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:55,520
just for Young-ae to prevent
her health from walking on thin ice.

898
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,788
Any thoughts on the cook-off?

899
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,991
It was much more magnificent in real life

900
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,893
than how it seemed on air.

901
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,628
I see.

902
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,631
-I'm glad I came.
-You are? I'm glad too.

903
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,167
Have you ever had a chance on TV

904
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,335
to officially evaluate someone's food?

905
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,071
I played the role of Jang-geum,

906
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,375
so I often got offers
from many cooking competitions

907
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,144
-to be on it as a judge.
-Of course.

908
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,114
-Of course. You're an icon.
-Yes, of course.

909
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,817
I kept declining
because it wasn't something I could do.

910
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,486
-So finally, this will be
-Finally.

911
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,588
-my first and last.
-The first and the last.

912
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,157
This is your once-in-a-lifetime chance.

913
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,091
I look forward to it.

914
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,461
First, Chef Jong-won's dish,
Mind Your Pine Nuts.

915
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,531
A HEALTHY DISH
PERFECT FOR A HOT SUMMER DAY

916
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,100
COLD PINE NUT JUICE SALAD

917
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,736
MADE WITH HOME-GROWN ORGANIC VEGETABLES,
ABALONE, OCTOPUS, AND BRISKET

918
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,640
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S MIND YOUR PINE NUTS

919
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,643
Chef Jong-won came over himself.

920
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,579
CLAPPING

921
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,681
Her work…

922
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,249
This is an artwork?

923
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,319
I wanted to make use
of her character's name in the show,

924
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,820
so I brought silverware, <i>eunsujeo.</i>

925
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,255
HER CHARACTER, EUN-SU

926
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,958
-Eun-su.
-<i>Eunsujeo.</i>

927
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,460
-He's doing his best.
-He really is.

928
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,597
-He's become a TV personality.
-He's doing his best.

929
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,266
He's getting better at this
as the season continues.

930
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,467
-May I take a photo?
-Of course.

931
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,569
I saw other people doing it.

932
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,905
The silverware isn't changing colors,

933
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,841
-so it's fine.
-Yes, it's not poisonous.

934
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,612
-He already tasted it for her.
-I did.

935
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,981
Thank you for the dish.

936
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,115
It's an honor.

937
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,484
He prepared silverware, <i>eunsujeo,</i>
for Eun-su.

938
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,954
He was inspired by the nobles' meal
and prepared this dish.

939
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,923
Where do I begin?

940
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,260
Grab everything together
with your chopsticks, including beef.

941
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,362
The Korean melon was very delicious.

942
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,330
I wonder who grew that.

943
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,533
He didn't miss a chance.

944
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,936
-You can just enjoy it.
-Okay.

945
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,105
A piece of fig.

946
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,539
All right.

947
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,541
A HISTORICAL FIRST BITE

948
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,410
The Great Jang-geum takes a bite.

949
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,379
EMBARRASSED

950
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,947
"Come here, come here."

951
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,782
MOVED

952
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,983
My gosh.

953
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,021
This is the first evaluation of her life.

954
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,922
Her first evaluation on food.

955
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,925
She is now tasting her first dish.

956
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,327
It's a historical moment.

957
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,062
-Let me try it one more time.
-Once more.

958
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,430
What does this mean?

959
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,665
She's taking her time.

960
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,267
-She's working up our anticipation.
-No, no.

961
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:27,238
I just had the beef,
so I wanted to try everything else.

962
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,340
-Of course, you can do that.
-Yes.

963
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:34,045
The fridge owner can have the dish
as much as you like.

964
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,081
-Her eyes are closed.
-She closes her eyes.

965
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,684
-Like a scene from <i>Jewel in the Palace.</i>
-Exactly.

966
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,886
The modern version of <i>Jewel in the Palace.</i>

967
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,287
It's like I'm watching TV.

968
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,856
-How is it?
-The way

969
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:50,494
all the various ingredients,
the beef, the fruit, and the seafood,

970
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,431
are dancing around in my mouth

971
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,233
lets me experience
a new kind of flavor, smell,

972
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,536
-and even texture.
-I see.

973
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,271
THANK YOU

974
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,408
It's hard to put this flavor into words.

975
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,277
She was so moved.

976
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,381
-She's never had anything like this.
-She goes back for more.

977
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,116
Does it taste like pine nuts?

978
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,617
Yes, it's quite strong.

979
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,354
But it doesn't have the raw
and bitter taste of pine nuts.

980
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,490
What did you use to add sweetness?

981
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,726
<i>Honey and fruit.</i>

982
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,329
<i>-Fruit?</i>
<i>-I didn't use sugar, but figs and melon.</i>

983
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,164
It's really delicious.

984
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,366
She says it's delicious.

985
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,800
It tastes like

986
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,304
it'll make me very healthy.

987
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,805
That's an important point.

988
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,408
She has to feel that way
after eating the dish.

989
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:41,145
It's amazing that
he made this in just 15 minutes.

990
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,680
-It must be good.
-She's enjoying it.

991
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:45,816
-It must make you go back for more.
-Yes.

992
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,386
I feel a bit embarrassed
to finish everything, so…

993
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,087
She didn't stop for a second.

994
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,690
-You can finish it.
-She wants to finish it but isn't.

995
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,960
-She keeps craving it.
-How did the chefs put these together?

996
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,695
Why are you chuckling?

997
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,264
-I'm dying to try it.
-I see.

998
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,334
I really want to give this to Young-kwang

999
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,103
-because he came down with a cold.
-Right, a cold.

1000
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,806
So I want to give it to him
and help him feel better.

1001
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:09,940
Not at all.

1002
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,842
-All right.
-It's so good.

1003
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,178
-It was so good. She begins to clap.
-Thank you.

1004
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,013
-She's clapping like a seal.
-Thank you.

1005
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,251
Next, please try Chef Eun-yeong's
Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall.

1006
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:24,622
A NUTRITIONAL CHINESE DISH
MADE IN JUST 15 MINUTES

1007
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:29,460
WITH A SIDE OF FISH DUMPLING WITH SHIITAKE

1008
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:34,365
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
JANG-GEUM JUMPS OVER THE WALL

1009
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,500
I'll open it when you're ready.

1010
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,635
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1011
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,270
Thank you. Okay.

1012
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:43,541
It looks like she's filming a video.

1013
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,077
She's filming it from the top
like a cameraman.

1014
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,014
-Ta-da.
-Oh, hello.

1015
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,284
That's Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall.

1016
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,685
That was a surprise.

1017
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,087
I must've gained energy
after eating his dish.

1018
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,622
-I got more energy.
-I see.

1019
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,791
-It was helpful.
-It worked.

1020
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:04,495
-That nice sweetness helped her feel good.
-You're right.

1021
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,598
How much more energy will she get
from Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall?

1022
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,800
Thank you for the dish.

1023
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,370
First, try a big bite of the soup

1024
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,473
with the mature cucumber and veggies.

1025
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,275
Then try the dumpling
when you're warmed up.

1026
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,679
-It was impossible to make in 15 minutes.
-Tell me about it.

1027
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,781
We were worried about the seasoning,

1028
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,916
but she may like a mild taste.

1029
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,852
THE TOMATO FIRST

1030
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,456
She doesn't like anything
that tastes too strong.

1031
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,424
A BITE OF THE MATURE CUCUMBER

1032
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,660
I wonder what the mature cucumber is like.

1033
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,629
-She served it warm.
-It's warm.

1034
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,664
-We've never tried that.
-No.

1035
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,299
Look at Chef Eun-yeong.

1036
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,802
She seems anxious to see her response.

1037
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,071
Have you ever had warm, mature cucumber?

1038
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,973
-No, never.
-Your first time? How was it?

1039
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,942
I like its soft texture,

1040
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,178
and it was wonderful for my taste.

1041
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,779
I love the color too.

1042
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,983
What did you use to add sweetness?

1043
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,552
<i>I used the vegetables</i>

1044
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,255
<i>such as the sweet pumpkin</i>
<i>and the mature cucumber.</i>

1045
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,023
<i>I didn't add anything else.</i>

1046
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,994
I could taste nature in this dish
compared to other regular dishes.

1047
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,929
The sweetness in this dish

1048
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:16,300
was different from what she made
with these ingredients.

1049
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,002
<i>That one was sweet like fruit</i>

1050
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,004
<i>-and this was sweet like veggies.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1051
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,041
But it's tough to decide
which one I liked better.

1052
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,811
-It must be hard.
-They were delicious in different ways.

1053
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:31,048
-She's nodding.
-Did that warm up your body?

1054
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,650
-Try the fish dumpling.
-Separately.

1055
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,921
She wrapped shiitake
with sea bream fillet.

1056
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:37,821
-Yes.
-Right.

1057
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,558
And?

1058
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:45,262
Her eyes turned a little wet just now.

1059
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,530
Was it too hot?

1060
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,833
-She's nodding.
-Yes.

1061
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,937
-And one more bite.
-Of the soup.

1062
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,574
How was the dumpling?

1063
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,609
It also tasted light,

1064
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,679
and I loved how chewy the shiitake was.

1065
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,215
It went well with the soft fish fillet.

1066
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,420
I think I can be on shoot all night
after eating a dish like this.

1067
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,388
A BIG SMILE

1068
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,525
-Gosh, this is really…
-I see.

1069
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,528
-You have to make a decision.
-Right.

1070
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,563
-Let's give her some time.
-Sure.

1071
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,632
Young-kwang, why don't you
get some more energy?

1072
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,802
-The mature cucumber.
-By Chef Eun-yeong.

1073
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,904
-Thank you.
-Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall.

1074
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,539
TRIES THE MATURE CUCUMBER FIRST

1075
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:32,009
Everyone has a different palate.

1076
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,043
Mmm.

1077
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,546
SLURP

1078
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,449
Young-kwang is the one
who's in need of energy right now.

1079
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,085
COMPLETELY OUT OF ENERGY

1080
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,153
I hope it makes him feel alive soon.

1081
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,755
The fish dumpling.

1082
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,757
EATS IT IN ONE BITE

1083
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,630
She wrapped shiitake
with sea bream fillet.

1084
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:53,697
Whoa.

1085
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,066
REGAINING HIS ENERGY

1086
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,002
-Yes?
-Do you like it?

1087
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,372
-The dumpling is excellent.
-The dumpling.

1088
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,073
-Does it give you energy?
-It's so good.

1089
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,509
He got a good feeling from the dumpling.

1090
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:11,181
It had a very strong smell
of both fish and shiitake.

1091
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,183
-Did they go well together?
-Did you feel the depth?

1092
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,052
They must go well together.

1093
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,654
Do you feel more energy?

1094
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,622
-Yes, I feel great.
-You do?

1095
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:22,226
His eyes seem brighter and more lively.

1096
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,361
I was dying to try these.

1097
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,630
Try Chef Jong-won's dish, chefs.

1098
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,732
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S MIND YOUR PINE NUTS

1099
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,335
A BIG BITE

1100
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,437
It's made with fruit and…

1101
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,472
-Octopus and all.
-Gosh.

1102
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,675
-What is it?
-He went, "Gosh."

1103
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,643
It's as soft as corn flakes

1104
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,214
when they get so soggy

1105
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,383
and melts into milk.

1106
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,186
-I see.
-That's a unique analogy.

1107
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,621
-Cereal.
-Yes, cereal.

1108
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,855
The tiger cereal.

1109
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,491
It's like what the cereal gets soggy

1110
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,161
-and almost melts into milk.
-Yes, it's like that.

1111
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,997
-He's right. It's like that.
-But with pine nuts.

1112
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,098
With pine nuts.

1113
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,833
He must feel as strong as that tiger.

1114
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,401
He must feel that tiger's energy.

1115
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,303
ONLY GOOD THINGS FOR YOU

1116
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,205
Roar.

1117
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,041
I'LL ROAR TOO

1118
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,177
I get what he means, though.

1119
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,879
-It's like oatmeal.
-Yes, that's right.

1120
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,083
When it's cooked for a long time,
it'll probably have this texture.

1121
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,552
It turns soft and sticky, right?

1122
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,922
But the classy flavor of pine nuts is

1123
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,357
hard to recreate with anything else.

1124
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,160
Any vegetable in this sauce

1125
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,062
would taste as classy.

1126
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,331
-The sauce was the kick of the recipe.
-I see.

1127
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,333
The pine nuts were blended
with bone broth,

1128
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,969
-so it became creamy.
-You're right.

1129
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,438
It could've tasted too oily,

1130
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,975
<i>but he added some mustard</i>

1131
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,145
-and covered up all its flaws.
-It's good.

1132
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,582
It's a smart dish.
As I said, he's a computer-like chef.

1133
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:55,285
It's finally the moment of truth.

1134
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,887
<i>Press one for Son Jong-won</i>

1135
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,789
<i>and two for Park Eun-yeong.</i>

1136
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,458
Who'll be the first one Jang-geum picks?

1137
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,993
-That's right.
-It's significant.

1138
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,995
-The Great Jang-geum's choice.
-It's historical.

1139
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,296
They'll both want to win.

1140
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,598
The first choice.

1141
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:11,635
She has never appeared
in any cooking shows to this day

1142
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:15,439
to evaluate anyone
since her days as Jang-geum.

1143
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,840
Make your decision

1144
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,542
and press the button!

1145
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,778
-Did you?
-One second.

1146
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:24,448
She hasn't pressed it yet.
The Great Jang-geum looks torn.

1147
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,383
My gosh.

1148
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,518
That's the thing.

1149
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,052
Young-kwang also tried both,

1150
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,156
but he turns a blind eye to her
when she has to choose.

1151
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,024
One will take the honor,

1152
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,294
-while the other will be disappointed.
-Disappointment indeed.

1153
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,363
She pressed the button!

1154
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,798
-Yes.
-She did.

1155
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,534
She clenched her teeth
before she pressed it.

1156
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,437
Yes, and she's unable to face the chefs.

1157
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:51,408
Now, which nutritional dish
did Young-ae like better?

1158
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,444
This is her first evaluation in history.

1159
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,014
Whose dish did you like better?

1160
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,949
Who won?

1161
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,219
Jong-won or Eun-yeong?

1162
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,720
Eun-yeong or Jong-won?

1163
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,722
PARK EUN-YEONG WINS

1164
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,691
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
JANG-GEUM JUMPS OVER THE WALL WINS

1165
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,494
Park Eun-yeong! Eun-yeong wins!

1166
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,431
It was Jang-geum Jumps Over the Wall!

1167
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,733
She beats Jong-won and wins a star!

1168
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,436
My gosh. Yes.

1169
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,771
He's in trouble.

1170
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,840
Both dishes were so good,

1171
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:28,545
and I personally like
the flavor Chef Jong-won put together.

1172
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,948
But I also like soup

1173
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,716
that tastes light and clean.

1174
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,252
-He should've served soup.
-It's the soup.

1175
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,789
Chef Jong-won should've made soup.

1176
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,123
Even nutritional dishes…

1177
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,025
-It has to be warm.
-…can be dry without soup.

1178
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,361
-I didn't mean that.
-Why didn't you provide one?

1179
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,896
They're vicious people.

1180
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:50,234
-Both dishes were delicious.
-She had a tough time deciding.

1181
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,137
It was a difficult decision,
but she chose Chef Eun-yeong.

1182
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,107
It must be disappointing, Chef Jong-won.

1183
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,210
-You worked so hard on this.
-He did.

1184
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,446
She inspired me greatly
to take this journey,

1185
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,648
so I always wanted to cook for you.

1186
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,484
-It was great.
-Thank you for letting me use

1187
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,087
-your great ingredients.
-Yes.

1188
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,555
That's the good vibes guy.

1189
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,689
He's so cool.

1190
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,725
He's happy that you evaluated his dish.

1191
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,595
Please put a star on Eun-yeong.

1192
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:22,399
This is Eun-yeong's fifth win!

1193
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,469
Chef Eun-yeong wins. Congratulations!

1194
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:27,938
Yes.

1195
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,310
<i>Let us begin the second round</i>
<i>with Young-ae's ingredients.</i>

1196
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:37,314
Who'll capture Young-ae
and her entire family's palate?

1197
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,751
"Do you want some naturalist dishes?"

1198
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,321
The expert naturalist chef, Sam Kim is

1199
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:48,492
up against the expert at wanting food,
Jung Ho-young.

1200
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,794
GIGGLING

1201
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:54,364
-The naturalist, the one who wants to eat.
-Just like her order.

1202
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,365
All right.

1203
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,367
They're perfect for this order.

1204
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,036
-Right?
-Yes.

1205
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,773
Chef Sam had done very well
in the first season,

1206
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,177
but in this season, he has only won
three times out of ten rounds.

1207
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,413
-Three times out of ten rounds?
-Yes.

1208
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,848
I'll pretend like I didn't hear that.

1209
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:16,653
He currently has the full support
of most elementary school children.

1210
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,222
If Chef Ho-young wins this round,

1211
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,691
it'd be his fifth win in a row,

1212
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,427
as well as the eighth in the season,

1213
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,596
making him the second after Hyun-suk.

1214
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,766
They fought two rounds in the past,
and Ho-young won both.

1215
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,868
Ho-young, you must think
he's an easy fight, right?

1216
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,570
That's why I picked him.

1217
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,705
EYES SHUT

1218
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:35,939
I'll cook with confidence

1219
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,241
-and become the sole second place.
-Okay.

1220
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,178
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS: CREAM CHEESE,
WHITE BALSAME VINEGAR, PARMESAN, FIG

1221
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,280
FROZEN BLUEBERRIES, ARUGULA, MINI PAPRIKA,
TOMATO, GREEK YOGURT, ALMOND, AND MORE

1222
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,415
My dish is called

1223
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,918
Up and Up… No. Eels and Eels.

1224
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,120
Eels and Eels?

1225
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,555
Yes, it's Eels and Eels.

1226
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,358
-Are you using eels?
-I am.

1227
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,460
I also did my research

1228
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,295
and found out her husband had

1229
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,763
the same name as me.

1230
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,966
So I wanted to make an eel dish
you can enjoy

1231
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,837
even with the twins,
Seung-gwon and Seung-bin.

1232
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:11,308
I, Jung Ho-young, will make that
with ingredients from your fridge.

1233
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,810
-My gosh.
-That was a good one.

1234
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:17,280
-He somehow got involved.
-He got it done.

1235
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,516
He made use of his name.

1236
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,486
This kind of incident never happens.

1237
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,920
It rarely happens.

1238
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:27,657
He points out that his dish is
practically made by her husband.

1239
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,093
Yes, I'll make something
for the whole family to enjoy.

1240
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,295
Eels usually go well
with black raspberries,

1241
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,066
but I'll mix blueberries
with balsamic sauce

1242
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,968
to make a blueberry sauce.

1243
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,605
-That sounds good.
-And I'll use figs for dessert.

1244
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:45,976
You said it was difficult
to remove the bones when you cook an eel,

1245
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,512
-She did.
-so I'll show you how it's done.

1246
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,482
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS: PARMESAN, OLIVES,
MOZZARELLA, ARUGULA, BALSAMIC VINEGAR

1247
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,618
CUCUMBER, BEEF TENDERLOIN, TOFU,
EGGPLANT FLOWER, EGGPLANT, AND MORE

1248
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,787
My dish is called

1249
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,656
The Joint Vegetable Area JMT.

1250
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,293
-JMT?
-Joint Vegetable Area?

1251
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,629
-Joint Vegetable Area?
-JMT?

1252
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:09,066
Because she starred in the film
<i>Join Security Area,</i> right?

1253
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,001
He's trying to get on her good side.

1254
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,702
Do you know what JMT means?

1255
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,171
-JMT?
-Yes.

1256
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,439
I'm not sure.

1257
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,540
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1258
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,210
JMT. So the Joint Vegetable Area
is a parody of Joint Security Area.

1259
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,878
-Do you know what JMT is?
-I do.

1260
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,380
What does it mean?

1261
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,581
Doesn't it mean "tastes freaking good"?

1262
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,984
OH, MY…

1263
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,720
It means something is very delicious.

1264
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,122
Really?

1265
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,156
Yes, JMT.

1266
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,825
I didn't know.

1267
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,195
I thought it was another area
like the Joint Security Area.

1268
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:39,963
Another area?

1269
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,365
Yes, I thought it was another area.

1270
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,067
What's your plan?

1271
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,036
It's based on Italian cuisine.

1272
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,070
There's a dish called <i>involtini,</i>

1273
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,905
-made by rolling up eggplants
-<i>Involtini.</i>

1274
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:52,008
filled with meat and cheese.

1275
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,543
Is that Italian? <i>Involtini?</i>

1276
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,546
-It means to roll.
-<i>Involtini</i> means to roll?

1277
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,349
-You can roll either meat or eggplants.
-I see.

1278
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,718
I'll also make a salad called <i>panzanella.</i>

1279
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,653
I have to use some bread to make that,

1280
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,256
-but I'll add tofu instead.
-Tofu?

1281
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,425
She said her son didn't eat that,

1282
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,961
and I'll also use
some cucumbers along with the tofu

1283
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:16,032
to find a way for her family to enjoy
food ingredients they usually don't like.

1284
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,902
-That's the recipe I prepared.
-That sounds great.

1285
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,738
And now, please get ready
for the next round,

1286
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,907
"Do you want some naturalist dishes?"

1287
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,143
He's here today

1288
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,879
to destroy Ho-young with his best moves.

1289
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,082
The godfather of naturalist cuisine,
Chef Sam Kim.

1290
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,885
But Chef Jung Ho-young is here today

1291
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,888
to win over Seung-gwon
and Seung-bin's palate

1292
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,757
and join Young-ae's family for the day.

1293
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,060
Which one of them will capture
the hearts of her family?

1294
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,830
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1295
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,000
Begin!

1296
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,701
A BIG MATCH WITH VEGGIES FROM HER GARDEN

1297
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:57,107
You must make a naturalist dish
that her entire family can enjoy.

1298
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,909
-And they must all like it.
-Yes.

1299
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,012
-The work with veggies first.
-He's roasting paprika.

1300
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,247
Yes, Ho-young roasts paprika.

1301
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,517
-And tomato.
-He's roasting paprika.

1302
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,319
BOILING WATER?

1303
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,787
POURED OVER THE EEL!

1304
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,289
That technique is called <i>yubiki.</i>

1305
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,091
That's how he removes the mucus.

1306
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,161
-Eels come with slippery mucus,
-Yes.

1307
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,629
so he got rid of that.

1308
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,566
Eels are often used in Japanese cuisine.

1309
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,367
Otherwise, it'll smell really fishy.

1310
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,070
-That's where the smell comes from?
-That's right.

1311
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,372
-That's a good tip.
-Yes.

1312
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:30,874
Is that an eggplant?

1313
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,310
-Yes.
-I guess he'll roll those up.

1314
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,279
-You grew the eggplants, right?
-She did.

1315
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,716
He's using tofu!

1316
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,818
The same tofu her children don't like!

1317
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,487
-What will he do with it?
-I wonder.

1318
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,089
He's cutting them into small pieces.

1319
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,791
-He diced it.
-Right?

1320
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:48,992
I think he'll fry them.

1321
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,394
-He's coating them with starch.
-Is he deep-frying them?

1322
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,362
That's right.

1323
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,431
-Did you coat them with starch?
-Yes.

1324
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,899
I'm using this instead of bread.

1325
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,334
-Instead of bread?
-Yes.

1326
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,537
He coated them with frying powder
and deep-fries them.

1327
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,738
Like croutons.

1328
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,841
Yes, <i>panzanella </i>is made with thick bread.

1329
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,644
So far, this is a naturalist's recipe.

1330
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,780
-Eggplants are delicious in summer.
-Yes.

1331
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,382
-Is that beef?
-It's beef.

1332
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,150
He's adding beef.

1333
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,019
How will he use that?

1334
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,624
It's unlike the usual eggplant <i>melanzane.</i>

1335
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,691
I see.

1336
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,628
Ho-young makes cuts in the eel.

1337
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,730
-Is he chopping off the bones?
-Yes.

1338
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,865
It's called <i>honegiri.</i>
Let's ask the expert.

1339
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,802
In an eel, the bones face upward,

1340
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,505
so he's doing that to break them.

1341
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,474
-He's cutting the bones.
-He's so quick.

1342
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,477
Is it okay to cut it this way
when the bones look like this?

1343
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,445
Eel bones look like this.

1344
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:43,513
I see.

1345
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,316
-The one in the middle is triangular.
-So they aren't horizontal?

1346
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,551
WHAT DO THE BONES LOOK LIKE AGAIN?

1347
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:51,121
The bones on the sides are like this.

1348
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:52,422
So he cuts it like this?

1349
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,491
So there are bones in the fillet, right?

1350
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,792
-Yes, there are.
-Right?

1351
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,627
There are tiny bones

1352
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,130
that can feel annoying,
so he's breaking everything.

1353
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:04,034
If Young-ae's family
ends up cooking eel on their day off,

1354
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,635
that's a win for our show.

1355
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,138
She kept the eels around
because she didn't use them,

1356
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,906
and they were just sitting around.

1357
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,610
It would be amazing
if her family gets to enjoy them at home.

1358
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,779
He's now steaming the eel.

1359
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:19,616
He charred the paprika
and threw them into iced water.

1360
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,952
He'll probably peel the outer layer
and use what's inside.

1361
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,990
That's something Sam always did
when he made naturalist dishes.

1362
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,526
-He did it often.
-You're right.

1363
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,261
STEALING EACH OTHER'S RECIPES!

1364
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,063
But Ho-young is using that technique.

1365
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,498
This means he just wants to win,
regardless of the show

1366
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,535
-and how new and interesting it can be.
-Yes.

1367
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,603
He thinks winning is the most important.

1368
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,372
But he's doing it so quickly.

1369
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,307
That's something… Gosh.

1370
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:49,179
He's now cooking the eggplant in oil.

1371
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,980
-He's frying it.
-I am.

1372
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,183
It turns crunchy
with a light coat of flour.

1373
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,584
-I see.
-It has too much water.

1374
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,519
Eggplants are much better in oil.

1375
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,289
You're right. Eggplants need grease.

1376
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,390
He's frying it.

1377
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:04,728
Chef Sam looks delighted
as he makes this naturalist dish.

1378
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,629
He's not showing his canine teeth today.

1379
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,498
-Not yet.
-He's not.

1380
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,599
Wait, he just did.

1381
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,267
SHOWING HIS CHARMING SIDE

1382
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,936
What's the red thing?

1383
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,671
-Tomato sauce.
-Tomato sauce?

1384
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,506
-And parmesan.
-I see.

1385
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,609
Paprika becomes really fragrant
when it's burnt and peeled.

1386
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,979
-It makes it more fragrant when burnt.
-Yes, that's right.

1387
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,180
Are those peanuts?

1388
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,482
-They're pine nuts.
-Pine nuts.

1389
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,984
-The pine nuts we've seen before.
-What's the powder? Bean powder?

1390
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,085
-Bean powder?
-No.

1391
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,588
-It's cheese.
-You're using cheese?

1392
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,022
Almonds.

1393
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,557
What's he doing?

1394
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,761
-He's making romesco.
-What's romesco?

1395
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,496
It's a thick pepper sauce.

1396
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,431
-So it's not too thin?
-No.

1397
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,899
It's like Spanish…

1398
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,401
<i>Ssamjang</i>?

1399
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,704
Ho-young makes the sauce right now.

1400
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,940
You have ten minutes now!

1401
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,977
The eggplants are ready to go.

1402
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,646
He'll roll them with the filling.

1403
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:57,981
He should straighten them.

1404
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,582
And some tomato sauce.

1405
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,984
GRILLED BEEF TENDERLOIN

1406
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:01,885
Beef.

1407
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,787
Is it because her children like meat?

1408
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:07,023
Yes, she said so,
so I wanted to mix some into my dish.

1409
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,360
Will you use many pieces to make one roll?

1410
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,997
Is he going to mix beef and tofu?

1411
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,932
BLUEBERRIES ARE UP NEXT

1412
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,267
-Blueberries?
-Blueberries?

1413
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,668
Blueberries and mirin?

1414
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:19,769
Cooking wine?

1415
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,304
-Honey?
-That's a lot!

1416
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,139
He's pouring in honey.

1417
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,041
-Gosh, the naturalist.
-It's all natural.

1418
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,344
-Honey is from nature.
-I'm sure the bees made it.

1419
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,647
-The bees must have.
-It's totally from nature.

1420
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,783
-I see. Totally from nature.
-The eels were wild-caught too.

1421
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,186
They were caught in the wild. Yes.

1422
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,654
OPEN!

1423
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,523
-The eel.
-Look at those crazy cuts.

1424
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,193
The eel is ready.

1425
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,527
He steamed it first.

1426
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:45,962
Will you fry it in a pan again?

1427
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,797
-Yes, I have to.
-I see.

1428
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,900
If you fry raw eel,

1429
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,636
it'll make the fish chewy.

1430
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,538
But if you steam it first,

1431
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,507
you can cook it very tender.

1432
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,409
The cuts are crazy.

1433
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,710
What about the seasoning?

1434
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,746
-That's it. The blueberry sauce.
-That's the seasoning?

1435
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,981
Instead of black raspberries.

1436
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,617
Is that arugula?

1437
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:11,387
Yes, the arugula she grew
in her rooftop garden.

1438
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,191
Doesn't it taste better
if you season it with salt?

1439
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:17,760
Right?

1440
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,230
Ho-young, wouldn't it be better
if you seasoned it with salt?

1441
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,232
Isn't the eel better with some salt?

1442
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,967
Yeah, sure. Okay.

1443
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,034
But…

1444
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,737
He insists until the end.

1445
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,240
I think it'll taste better.
It's not seasoned right now.

1446
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,076
Yes, some salt. I feel much better.

1447
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,178
He didn't season it at all.

1448
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,514
-It needed some salt.
-I'm relieved, now with the salt.

1449
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,350
It's been 7 minutes and 30 seconds.
You've spent half of the time.

1450
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,951
That's exactly half.

1451
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,187
BASIL FROM YOUNG-AE'S FARM

1452
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,855
Basil. He's using basil, right?

1453
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,157
-Basil and mozzarella.
-What did he put in now?

1454
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,360
-Cheese. Mozzarella.
-Mozzarella.

1455
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,294
Will he roll it now?

1456
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,563
-Mozzarella?
-Mozzarella and basil.

1457
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,798
Sam is making <i>anvoltini</i> right now.

1458
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,167
-It's <i>involtini.</i>
<i>-Involtini.</i>

1459
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,503
-He said it meant "to roll."
-To roll.

1460
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,205
It's an Italian dish called <i>involtini.</i>

1461
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,207
-Will he roll it? Just like that.
-Just like that.

1462
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,442
He added tofu to there, right?

1463
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:08,144
-And beef.
-Right.

1464
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,480
-Kids will have no idea and eat that.
-It's hidden.

1465
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,983
-They won't know if it's tofu or beef.
-They won't be able to tell.

1466
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,753
Top it with sauce
and pop it into the oven.

1467
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,989
-He tops it with the tomato sauce.
-And he'll roast it in the oven.

1468
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,691
-Is that right?
-Yes.

1469
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,059
I see.

1470
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:27,230
-Six minutes are perfect.
-Everything is already cooked.

1471
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,965
You have about six minutes left.

1472
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,267
And he… Is that cheese?

1473
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,203
Yes, I'm mixing yogurt,
cream cheese, and peanut butter.

1474
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,738
What are you making?

1475
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,607
The sauce for the figs.

1476
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,277
It should taste delicious on the figs.

1477
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,413
It's the sauce for his fig dessert.

1478
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,114
7. MIX INGREDIENTS
AND MAKE PEANUT CREAM SAUCE

1479
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,749
That sauce looks good.

1480
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,118
It looks like he's making the eel crunchy.

1481
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,154
Yes, it's better when it's crunchy.

1482
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,956
Yes, that tastes so good.

1483
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,190
Crunchy.

1484
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,627
I don't smell anything strong
in this round.

1485
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,195
HONEY, BALSAMIC VINEGAR

1486
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,997
OLIVE OIL

1487
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,933
TOMATO BALSAMIC SAUCE
WITH CHOPPED PINE NUTS!

1488
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,369
-What's that?
-Arugula.

1489
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,606
-Yes, the arugula from her garden.
-Arugula.

1490
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:10,607
Honey.

1491
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,976
TOMATO

1492
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,412
OLIVES

1493
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,582
LEMON JUICE

1494
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,717
Peach!

1495
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,151
It was a yellow peach.

1496
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,419
He's using a peach.

1497
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,023
All her vegetables were
grown in her garden.

1498
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,892
It's a cucumber. Sam uses a cucumber.

1499
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,761
Organic cucumbers. Five minutes!

1500
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,864
Five minutes, Jung-hwan. Please go on out.

1501
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:38,101
I wonder which one will capture
even her family's appetite.

1502
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,504
It's not just Young-ae.
You must capture her family's appetite.

1503
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:45,508
This kitchen smells like
it's full of naturalists today.

1504
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,143
-Is this working?
-It is.

1505
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,111
It is, right?

1506
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:51,514
-Chef Sam chops the cucumber.
-Young-ae grew them herself.

1507
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,749
I need to add sugar.

1508
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:54,617
SUGAR

1509
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:59,188
6. MAKE SALAD BY MIXING ARUGULA, SUGAR,
OLIVE OIL, AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR

1510
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,125
ARUGULA BALSAMIC SALAD

1511
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,426
Shouldn't you flip these?

1512
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,194
-I'll do that now.
-Now?

1513
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,897
The eel looks golden brown and delicious.

1514
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,298
-Yes.
-Yes.

1515
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,834
-They look very firm.
-You're right.

1516
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,637
You can probably use it as a pillow.

1517
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,573
-Can you try the blueberry sauce?
-The blueberries.

1518
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,641
Is it not sweet?

1519
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:22,378
He said he'd serve it with the eel,
so I hope they go well together.

1520
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,147
It's still kind of hot.

1521
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,716
Will it make him go up and up?

1522
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,518
Will he go up and up?

1523
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,186
Up and up?

1524
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,254
He's on a roller coaster!

1525
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,356
He's riding it all the way up!

1526
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,757
-I see.
-He's going straight up.

1527
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,325
CLIMB IT UP

1528
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,327
-Is it that good?
-It is.

1529
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:41,297
I didn't know blueberries
tasted like this when boiled.

1530
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,166
It tastes sweet, but it's natural.

1531
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,367
GOTCHA!

1532
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,768
-He used honey, right?
-Yes.

1533
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,671
I like how honey kicks in
and adds the sweetness.

1534
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,506
-Yes.
-I thought it'd be too sweet.

1535
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,675
Blueberries area already sweet,

1536
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:56,112
-but it's nice with more honey.
-The eel dish seems strong.

1537
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,313
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

1538
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,951
-Do you see the sauce over arugula?
-Try my tofu.

1539
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,586
-Wait, try what?
-This one.

1540
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,688
Chef Sam asked me to try the tofu.

1541
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,624
HE GOT THE TOFU OUT
WHILE NO ONE WAS WATCHING

1542
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,427
WIPED THE GREASE OFF,
AND THREW IT IN THE TOMATO BALSAMIC SAUCE!

1543
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,296
He's on his way up!

1544
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,101
10. TOP PEACH CUCUMBER SALAD
WITH FRIED TOFU

1545
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,902
The tofu.

1546
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,871
That's tofu?

1547
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,439
-You must feel confident.
-Sure.

1548
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,942
He needs to convince her son to eat this.

1549
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,177
Is it something kids will love?

1550
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,013
How will the children respond?

1551
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,483
WILL IT CAPTURE THEIR APPETITE,
SOMETHING JANG-GEUM FAILED TO DO?

1552
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,585
It's better than <i>mala.</i>

1553
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,288
-It's better than that?
-Kids will love this.

1554
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,890
Crunchy outside, soft inside.

1555
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,625
It's been fried perfectly.

1556
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,495
-I think this is better than bread.
-Tiny diced pieces.

1557
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:47,897
ARUGULA FROM YOUNG-AE'S FARM

1558
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,533
It'll be tough to decide
which one she likes better.

1559
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,970
Chef Sam is on a roll
as soon as he got to cook as a naturalist.

1560
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,672
11. TOP PANZANELLA
WITH CHOPPED ARUGULA STEMS

1561
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,875
STRUGGLING

1562
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,078
HE BLENDED INGREDIENTS TO MAKE ROMESCO

1563
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,914
AND IT LANDS NEXT TO THE ARUGULA SALAD

1564
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:08,351
It looks amazing.
Your fish is burning. I mean, your eel.

1565
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,585
It's okay.

1566
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,021
-The eel.
-It's fine.

1567
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,391
It'll taste too sweet
if you boil it down some more.

1568
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,726
-I turned the heat off.
-Did you?

1569
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,094
Ho-young is a good boy.

1570
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,428
I should abide right away.

1571
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:23,366
I'm sure there's sauce for the figs.

1572
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,701
-This one?
-Yes, that one.

1573
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,771
The figs were very sweet,
and the sauce looks rich too.

1574
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,307
I hope it doesn't become too sweet.

1575
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,909
Let me try this.

1576
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,045
Do you think her husband will like that?

1577
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,914
I hope it's not too sweet.

1578
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,217
It's a bit sweet.

1579
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,318
ASTONISHED

1580
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,452
Her husband…

1581
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,154
The texture on the inside…

1582
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,856
Have it with a fig.

1583
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,692
Try sharing that between you two.

1584
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,762
His mouth got shut down as soon
as he said something disadvantageous.

1585
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,097
-So?
-It's not sweet!

1586
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,367
-Gosh.
-He only used figs, but it's still sweet.

1587
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:02,438
The water in the fig
cancels out the sweetness.

1588
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,208
He had a reason for doing this.

1589
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,677
The eel is ready.

1590
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,011
The eel is done.

1591
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,418
SAM PULLS OUT THE INVOLTINI
WHILE NO ONE IS WATCHING

1592
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:18,020
HE BEGINS TO SERVE IT
WITH TOMATO AND CHEESE SAUCE

1593
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:22,158
-And he got that from the oven.
-The oven.

1594
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,193
-One minute.
-The <i>involtini </i>is ready.

1595
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,695
Yes, it's ready.

1596
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,029
It looks good.

1597
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,265
-Why is time flying today?
-It smells like nature.

1598
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,267
-Fifty seconds.
-Fifty seconds.

1599
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,369
You have under a minute left.
Fifty seconds.

1600
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,939
HE TAKES JUST THE EGGPLANT FLOWERS

1601
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,409
AND FINISHES THE DISH WITH THEM!

1602
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,846
You have to cook the eel again

1603
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:46,315
-in the sauce.
-Yes, the sauce.

1604
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,518
-Yes, the sauce. Sam finishes!
-Sam finishes first.

1605
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,922
-Sam finishes with 35 seconds left.
-The naturalist finishes first.

1606
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,724
-The eel.
-Thirty seconds!

1607
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,726
The eel.

1608
01:04:56,792 --> 01:05:00,463
I hope both her children
and her husband love it.

1609
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,866
But Young-ae looks a bit worried.

1610
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,668
Can her children eat that?

1611
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,603
-Ten seconds.
-And more sauce.

1612
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,839
-Ten seconds. Nine.
-Ten. Nine.

1613
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,908
-Eight. Seven.
-Eight. Seven.

1614
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,843
-Six.
-Hurry up, Ho-young!

1615
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,611
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1616
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,080
Three. Two. One.

1617
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,016
-Ho-young is done.
-He finishes.

1618
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,717
Ho-young finishes.

1619
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,319
-They look good.
-These are amazing.

1620
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,588
-It'll be tough to choose.
-Yes.

1621
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,657
The eel looks good.

1622
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,559
They did a great job.

1623
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,261
What did you think?

1624
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:37,800
It's a wonder how they made
such wonderful dishes with what I had.

1625
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:41,203
I began to reflect on myself,
wondering what I had made to this day.

1626
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,806
Yes, you had such great ingredients.

1627
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,976
-Yes.
-First, Joint Vegetable Area JMT.

1628
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,577
INVOLTINI MADE WITH ORGANIC EGGPLANT

1629
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:53,916
SERVED WITH PANZANELLA
MADE WITH SECRET TOFU AND CUCUMBER

1630
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:57,887
CHEF SAM KIM'S
JOINT VEGETABLE AREA JMT

1631
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,690
Joint Vegetable Area JMT.
Which one is the main dish?

1632
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:04,393
The eggplant is kind of small,
but that's the main dish.

1633
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,429
I prepared the salad as a light appetizer.

1634
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,698
-Try the tofu dish first.
-Okay.

1635
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:11,233
-Thank you for the dish.
-The one with tofu.

1636
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,971
-Have the tofu with the sauce.
-With the sauce.

1637
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:16,605
I hope your children

1638
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,809
don't notice and go, "This is tofu!"

1639
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,811
Middle school kids don't talk like that.

1640
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:22,912
THE MOMMY AGREES

1641
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,714
-Who talks like that?
-No?

1642
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,050
-They don't even speak.
-He's right.

1643
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,486
I have to take it to his room.

1644
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:33,122
They don't come out.
I have to bring it to them.

1645
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,157
A BITE OF THE SALAD

1646
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:38,694
I hope her children
return it as an empty bowl.

1647
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,162
The mother tries it first.

1648
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,200
-First, she has to like it.
-Of course.

1649
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,736
-And her family.
-Yes.

1650
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,037
It's so good.

1651
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:49,205
Mmm.

1652
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,639
Mmm.

1653
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:51,774
GASP!

1654
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,675
SURPRISED THREE TIMES

1655
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,678
-She gets surprised.
-I should learn the recipe.

1656
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,180
There must be a change in the flavor.

1657
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:02,284
All these ingredients are
running around in my mouth,

1658
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,387
and it's hard to tell
if this is made with tofu.

1659
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,822
-It's hard to tell that it's tofu?
-Yes.

1660
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,457
It feels heartbreaking

1661
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:12,161
when you see your kids pick out
just the tofu out of their dishes.

1662
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,764
-That seems impossible.
-Is that so?

1663
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:15,698
They won't know.

1664
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,633
He diced it into small pieces.

1665
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,634
You can't tell.

1666
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:22,671
I hope her kids return it as an empty bowl
after they eat it in the room.

1667
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,473
It really doesn't feel like tofu.

1668
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,675
If you coat it with frying powder,

1669
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,577
it'll make the tofu crunchier,

1670
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:32,148
and it becomes firmer
when you fry it at low temperatures.

1671
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,118
It's also easy to eat
because they're in tiny sizes.

1672
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,253
I also added cucumbers.

1673
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,188
-Cucumbers?
-Cucumbers and tofu.

1674
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:42,792
-The salad.
-There are cucumbers?

1675
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,961
I diced it with the peach,

1676
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,563
so it probably tastes like that.

1677
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,199
-I see.
-That was the sweetness.

1678
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,835
Did you chop the cucumber
into small pieces?

1679
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,070
That's why.

1680
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,039
Even Young-ae had no idea
he added cucumbers in there.

1681
01:07:57,106 --> 01:08:00,543
-No.
-Your husband won't have a problem, then.

1682
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,379
-Next, the <i>involtini,</i> right?
-<i>Involtini.</i>

1683
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,181
Is this basil?

1684
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,249
-Eggplants and basil.
-Basil.

1685
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,985
-You grew all of that, right?
-I did.

1686
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,521
There's meat inside the roll

1687
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,157
-And cheese and tomato sauce.
-and tomato sauce too?

1688
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,462
A BIG BITE

1689
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,764
-The eggplant.
-Yes.

1690
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,032
VERY ANXIOUS

1691
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,834
She takes a bite carefully.

1692
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,069
"Will my husband eat this?"

1693
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,904
-"What about my kids?"
-"What about my kids?"

1694
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,306
"Is this truly JMT?"

1695
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:31,874
"Will I make this?"

1696
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,910
"My family,
do you want some naturalist dishes?"

1697
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:38,214
-Can she really say that to them?
-Or is it not JMT?

1698
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,248
It's really good.

1699
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,851
-Two thumbs up.
-It's so good.

1700
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:46,555
This had some sweetness

1701
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,791
and helped get my appetite going,

1702
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,227
so this main dish

1703
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,663
tasted very healthy
and didn't have any trouble going down.

1704
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,932
-It felt like that.
-I see.

1705
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,602
It tasted healthy and went down easily.

1706
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,138
Will your family like it, though?

1707
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,273
-Yes.
-I see.

1708
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,108
It's really good.

1709
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,844
She says it's really good.

1710
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,981
Next, Chef Ho-young's dish.

1711
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,549
<i>Eels and Eels.</i>

1712
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,586
A MIX OF ROMESCO AND ARUGULA
WITH AN EEL COOKED IN BLUEBERRY SAUCE

1713
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,790
WITH A TOUGH OF FIG AS DESSERT,
FULL OF NATURAL SWEETNESS

1714
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:26,428
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S EELS AND EELS

1715
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,531
The eel is the key.

1716
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:32,368
The arugula you grew
had some bitterness to it,

1717
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:36,172
<i>so I made the sweet and sour sauce</i>
<i>for the eel with blueberries.</i>

1718
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,075
Try the arugula, eel, and romesco first.

1719
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,945
Then you can have the fig like dessert.

1720
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,315
-Wrap it with arugula.
-It had some bitterness to it.

1721
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,552
I hope there are no bones.

1722
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,754
-Right?
-If she finds any bones…

1723
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,923
He cooked the eel with blueberry sauce.

1724
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,593
Adults can eat fish bones,
but children will refuse to eat it.

1725
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,994
It'll be shocking.

1726
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,097
The mother will make
an objective evaluation.

1727
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,200
Romesco and…

1728
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,802
It's a nerve-racking moment.

1729
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,339
NODDING

1730
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:15,044
-It must be easy to eat.
-Yes.

1731
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,712
So there are no bones?

1732
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,515
-Not at all. I was pleasantly surprised.
-No?

1733
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,819
I've never had an eel like this.

1734
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,488
The seasoning isn't like anything

1735
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,059
I've ever had in Japanese
or Korean cuisine.

1736
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,294
-He made blueberry sauce.
-Yes.

1737
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,531
-You can't get this flavor anywhere else.
-Nowhere else.

1738
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,135
It's usually broiled over charcoal
and seasoned with gochujang.

1739
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,505
It also has the crunchiness
because he pan-fried it.

1740
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,076
<i>It was just as you said.</i>
<i>Crunchy outside, soft inside.</i>

1741
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,345
<i>The outer layer is crunchy,</i>

1742
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:53,249
and the sweetness goes well with arugula.

1743
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:57,019
At the same time, the texture of the eel

1744
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,487
wasn't diminished.

1745
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,057
The sweetness and other sauces
didn't just make it disappear.

1746
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:05,761
It shows its presence toward the end.

1747
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,464
Like, "Hey, I'm an eel."

1748
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,665
CHUCKLES

1749
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,835
-And the fig is the dessert.
-The fig.

1750
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,904
He made the sauce with nuts,

1751
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:19,508
so it had an interesting texture.

1752
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,010
You're right.

1753
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,077
It's not sweet.

1754
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,846
-It's not?
-No.

1755
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:26,582
The blueberry sauce was sweet,

1756
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,984
so if this were also sweet,
it would've been too much.

1757
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,586
But it's not.

1758
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:33,489
-I see.
-It was different with the fig.

1759
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:35,858
Hmm? Mmm.

1760
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,060
-It's good.
-I see.

1761
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,629
I've never had anything like this.

1762
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:44,767
It was the kind of flavor
even the Great Jang-geum hasn't had.

1763
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,170
-All right. Let's try some.
-Let's dig in.

1764
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,873
Let's try Chef Sam's dish.

1765
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,541
This is nice.

1766
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:55,311
WHAT'S THE EXPERT NATURALIST'S DISH LIKE?

1767
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:59,148
-I love the smell.
-The smell.

1768
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,350
Yes, it's very fragrant.

1769
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,886
-It's almost like perfume.
-Perfume?

1770
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,487
I'd use perfume like this.

1771
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,456
-Really?
-I see.

1772
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,425
It smells so fresh and delicious.

1773
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,627
I see.

1774
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,761
It tastes like

1775
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,396
a teenage rebel cure.

1776
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,699
-A cure for teenage rebels?
-Here's the thing.

1777
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,368
I've seen my nephews
never showing any response

1778
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:22,204
when their mom asked them
to come and eat the food she made.

1779
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,306
But when I had this,

1780
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,576
it had the magic
of lifting my mood automatically.

1781
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,579
I think this is something
that'll get a teenage boy talking.

1782
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,981
Something quite refreshing.

1783
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,317
I was surprised at Chef Sam's dish

1784
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:39,521
because he couldn't have made this
without enough knowledge on vegetables.

1785
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,457
He brought out the best
in each ingredient,

1786
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,092
so it was so delicious.

1787
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:45,761
Next, let's try Eel and Eel.

1788
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,831
Let's try Eel and Eel with Young-kwang.

1789
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:52,601
WHAT WILL OTHER CHEFS THINK OF THIS?

1790
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,136
Gosh. Mmm.

1791
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,771
It's really crunchy.

1792
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,140
A SMILE

1793
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,676
-I haven't found any bones.
-It's good.

1794
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,979
Young-kwang, anything good happened?
You're wearing a smile.

1795
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,915
-It was so good.
-Was it really?

1796
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,551
-It's like glazed deep-fried chicken.
-Glazed fried chicken.

1797
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:12,755
It's crunchy like that dish.

1798
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:16,892
The oil seeped into every cut he made,

1799
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,896
so it's extremely crunchy.
You can even chew on the bones.

1800
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,064
It's really good.

1801
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,234
It's the arugula.
Eels can taste a bit greasy

1802
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,302
and add unpleasant textures.

1803
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,905
But arugula cuts in
with its tasty bitterness.

1804
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:34,543
-That's why you keep going back for more.
-You're right.

1805
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,513
It's time for you to make
yet another choice.

1806
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,248
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

1807
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:42,951
It feels like we're bullying Jang-geum,

1808
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,753
so we feel kind of bad,

1809
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,755
but you came here to choose one.

1810
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,924
<i>Press one for Sam Kim,</i>

1811
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,526
<i>and two for Jung Ho-young.</i>

1812
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,363
Please make your decision
and press the button!

1813
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,466
Which dish will Young-ae choose?

1814
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,801
EYES SHUT

1815
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,537
Please make your decision.
She's still torn.

1816
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,305
Jang-geum is still torn.

1817
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,073
She must've pressed it.

1818
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,141
-I'm done.
-Did you? She did.

1819
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,744
SHE MADE HER CHOICE

1820
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,480
-I can't predict it.
-This is Jang-geum's choice. Show us!

1821
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,616
Do you want some naturalist dishes?

1822
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,652
If Ho-young wins this round,

1823
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:20,856
he'll become the sole second place
with eight victories.

1824
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:24,293
Or will Sam regain his honor

1825
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,862
as the master of naturalist dishes?

1826
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,731
Who did Jang-geum choose?

1827
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,234
A dish for her family!

1828
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,803
Who did you pick?

1829
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,672
JUNG HO-YOUNG WINS

1830
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,141
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S EEL AND EEL WINS

1831
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,777
Jung Ho-young wins!

1832
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:44,546
HO-YOUNG WITH 5 CONSECUTIVE WINS

1833
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:46,582
FEELS BAD

1834
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,851
She chose the eel dish.

1835
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,787
Was it because his name is
the same as your husband's?

1836
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,956
It had about 0.1% of influence.

1837
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,958
About 0.1%.

1838
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,860
My family would love

1839
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,262
Chef Sam's dish 100%.

1840
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,064
They'll love it.

1841
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,399
I've never made them eel before,

1842
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,868
but if I could recreate this dish,

1843
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:10,072
I can imagine my children
and husband enjoying it.

1844
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:11,573
SATISFIED

1845
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,976
Ho-young made his winning move
with the eels.

1846
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,011
And it was successful.

1847
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,147
He's wearing a huge smile on his face.

1848
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,283
-Five consecutive wins.
-Lady Luck is on his side.

1849
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,152
Thank you very much for choosing me,
and it's a great honor.

1850
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:27,389
I want to thank my grandfather,
who gave me my name.

1851
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,994
CONGRATULATIONS, JUNG HO-YOUNG…

1852
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,931
Many elementary school children are
grieving right now.

1853
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,432
CHILDREN: WE'RE ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE

1854
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,234
They're showing their support
via messages.

1855
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,738
Jang-geum chose Chef Ho-young!

1856
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,406
Please put the star on him.

1857
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,975
He is now solely in second place…

1858
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,777
-I enjoyed it.
-…with eight victories!

1859
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,446
-Congratulations, Ho-young!
-Gosh, 8 wins and 3 losses.

1860
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:53,248
Ho-young is on his way up and up.

1861
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,984
Why are you so good?
Why are you doing so well?

1862
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,320
-Your dish was really good.
-Did you try it?

1863
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,421
It was so fragrant.

1864
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,191
-May I take these and eat them?
-Of course!

1865
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:05,193
I'll take both.

1866
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,530
SHE TAKES BOTH AND LEAVES

1867
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:10,666
What is this?

1868
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,200
-Jeez.
-You look great!

1869
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,803
LOOK FOR THE CHEF & MY FRIDGE ENDING FAIRY

1870
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,471
-We present his fridge!
-His fridge!

1871
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,340
-You have lots of stuff.
-What are all these?

1872
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,541
Do you live with five others?

1873
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,610
I heard it was good for you,
so I bought it.

1874
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,946
-Is ginger good for you too?
-Yes, apparently so.

1875
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,114
He must be easy to convince.

1876
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:28,250
<i>This is their first round.</i>

1877
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,185
His identity as Cooking Maniac
is just a show.

1878
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,620
<i>"I'm the true maniac."</i>

1879
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,689
<i>-"I still got my game!"</i>
<i>-Raining down salt.</i>

1880
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,891
ANXIETY LEVEL OVER THE LIMIT

1881
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,293
-Nam-no is in an emergency.
-No!

1882
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,795
-Argh!
-Oh, my. Gosh.

1883
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,496
<i>He's so evil.</i>

1884
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,398
<i>I think I'll easily win today.</i>

1885
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,467
<i>-What is that?</i>
-No!

1886
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,936
-It'll blow up!
-Something is coming out!

1887
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,871
I'll go out twice next week,
so can you go?

1888
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,573
<i>It looks like it'll move.</i>

1889
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,175
<i>Jeez. Look at that.</i>

1890
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,177
He's trying it with a frown.

1891
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,380
WHAT'S THE DISH
THAT PLEASED YOUNG-KWANG'S PALATE?

1892
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,148
Young-kwang looks excited.

1893
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:04,786
This may ruin your palate for good.

1894
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,189
FAILED TO WORK POONG'S MAGIC?

1895
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:21,870
