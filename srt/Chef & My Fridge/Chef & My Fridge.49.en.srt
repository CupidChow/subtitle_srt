1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,548
We're here with the ladies

2
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,019
who have big appetites,
Tzuyang and Hatnim.

3
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,354
Hatnim is someone we deem

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,758
as one of the pioneers in <i>mukbang</i> content.

5
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,995
<i>She first began eating</i>
<i>in front of a camera back in 2015.</i>

6
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,164
Someone else just joined. Who are you?

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,198
I'm embarrassed.

8
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,133
HATNIM'S BABY CREATOR DAYS

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,335
-And it's now your 11th year.
-Yes.

10
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,371
The number of videos
she has uploaded as of today

11
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,341
<i>is over 3,800 in total.</i>

12
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:42,742
That's crazy.

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,813
-That's amazing.
-It's her 11th year,

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,783
so it would mean that she uploaded
at least one video every day.

15
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,718
I'm impressed by her long career,

16
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,086
but even more by her consistency.

17
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,587
That kind of dedication isn't easy.

18
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,790
The highest number of viewers

19
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,225
who joined her while she streamed live

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,227
was over 50,000 people.

21
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,664
-Wow, 50,000 people.
-That's enough people

22
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,768
to fill the entire
Seoul World Cup Stadium.

23
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,404
-Wow.
-And because so many people were watching,

24
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,973
it must've been highly scandalous
when she mistakenly said,

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,342
-"Lee Jae-myung Pizza."
-Yes, of course.

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,977
We prepared a video for you.

27
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,180
-Let's take a look.
-We're watching the clip?

28
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,314
What was the mistake?

29
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,118
It sounds like a great idea to travel
and eat things I've always wanted to try.

30
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,555
I genuinely want…

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,491
to visit Busan again,
just to eat at Lee Jae-myung Pizza.

32
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,427
RELIVING THE MEMORIES
FROM THAT DAY

33
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,695
AND SHE WAS STREAMING LIVE…

34
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,464
-That was what she said.
-It was the wrong name.

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,531
THE CHAT WAS ON FIRE

36
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,133
LEE JAE-MYUNG PIZZA?
THANKS FOR THE CLIP

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,502
-She suddenly realized it.
-Something wasn't right.

38
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,837
DROP…

39
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,840
SILENCE FILLS THE ROOM…

40
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,675
You were eating <i>hwachae</i>,
Korean fruit punch.

41
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,577
-Yes, and back then…
-What was on your mind?

42
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,579
I pretended like I didn't notice
and kept eating.

43
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,047
SHE JUST CONTINUED HER MUKBANG…

44
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,317
-It's actually called… Yes, Lee Jae Mo.
-Lee Jae Mo Pizza. Yes.

45
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,452
-It's a famous franchise in Busan.
-Yes.

46
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,455
The clip went viral
on online communities and social media,

47
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,623
so everyone knows it.

48
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,791
That's not the case at all.

49
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,793
-People were starting to forget about it,
-Right.

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,528
then you suddenly brought it back.

51
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,697
I woke up to many new texts
asking if I was okay.

52
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,133
The name of the dish
I'll make is as follows.

53
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,801
Lee Jae-myung Pizza.

54
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,269
LEE JAE-MYUNG PIZZA

55
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,338
Lee Jae-myung Pizza?

56
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,273
A PIZZA NAMED
THANKS TO HATNIM'S MISTAKE

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,708
Is it a familiar texture?

58
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,909
WIDE-EYED

59
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,844
HE EVEN SURPRISED
THE PRESIDENT WITH ITS TASTE

60
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,881
THANKS TO HIM, HER MISTAKE
RESURFACED WITH A BANG

61
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,316
-Poong brought it up again…
-Yes.

62
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,352
-I did.
-…which got people to talk about it again,

63
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,355
-and it made the news too.
-You're right.

64
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,958
-My parents called too.
-They'd be worried.

65
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,059
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,029
My apology is much belated,
but I didn't have your contact info.

67
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,798
Previously, we showed you
a clip of Tzuyang's mukbang.

68
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,635
On this episode, we'll show you

69
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,704
-what Hatnim's <i>mukbang</i> is like.
-I want to see it.

70
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,239
OPEN UP, EVERYONE

71
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,707
This is a clip from 2020.

72
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:55,875
I've seen this one.

73
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,177
24 SUSHI PIECES & 62 TUNA SLICES

74
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,444
I ordered tuna after watching this.

75
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,380
EMPTYING THE DISHES

76
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,081
You still eat a lot.

77
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,016
ALL CLEARED

78
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,817
<i>For dessert, I'll eat </i>daechang<i>.</i>

79
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,920
-That's her dessert?
-She had dessert after that?

80
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,655
You ate
grilled large intestines for dessert?

81
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,957
Isn't that a whole new meal?

82
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,091
NOT HER FIRST MEAL

83
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,760
BEGINS TO ADD FRIED RICE

84
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:14,894
<i>I ordered fried rice too.</i>

85
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,829
She's mixing fried rice with <i>daechang</i>?

86
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,698
WHAT'S THIS?

87
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,335
FRIED RICE AND JEONGOL,
WORKING ON HER 2ND DESSERT

88
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,170
-She makes it look delicious.
-She does.

89
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,972
You do make the food look really good.

90
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,974
What do you mean,
you easily get bored with food?

91
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,108
SHE DOESN'T

92
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,978
<i>I'm going to make Monte Cristo sandwiches.</i>

93
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,347
<i>I prepared the ingredients already.</i>

94
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,648
A HUGE BLOCK OF BUTTER

95
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,150
Isn't that greasy?

96
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,718
<i>It's so big.</i>

97
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,553
INTO THE POOL OF BUTTER

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,556
SANDWICHES BOILING IN BUTTER…

99
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,059
-Monte Cristo sandwiches.
-She makes it look so good.

100
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,261
-Wasn't it too greasy?
-She's enjoying it.

101
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,697
<i>This is just a quick snack.</i>

102
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,800
-It's just a quick snack.
-She enjoys everything.

103
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,768
-She's taking a break.
-That's a pretty big spoon.

104
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,237
-A break.
-A quick snack?

105
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,805
BIBIMBAP, DONE

106
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,440
-That's hilarious.
-My gosh.

107
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,841
GALBI-TANG, DONE

108
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,276
She eats so well.

109
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,345
NEXT, CUP RAMYEON

110
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,846
Is this another snack?

111
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,282
-That's like rinsing my mouth.
-Rinsing your mouth?

112
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,183
RINSING HER MOUTH?

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,218
So it's like a refreshment.

114
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,620
<i>Just some grilled chicken.</i>

115
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,954
Isn't that the same day?

116
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:15,955
ALL ON THE SAME DAY

117
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:16,990
It looks like it.

118
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,925
My mouth began to water
just by watching her.

119
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:19,993
-Right?
-I'm hungry.

120
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,061
CHICKEN, DONE

121
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>-Thanks for another delicious day.</i>
-You must love cheese.

122
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,500
Gosh. It's hot in here.

123
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,968
APPROVED

124
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,670
-This is why people love her.
-Yes.

125
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,006
You said cup <i>ramyeon</i>
was like rinsing your mouth.

126
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,040
What do you mean by that?

127
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,576
When I'm about to get bored
with greasy food,

128
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,579
I take two bites of <i>ramyeon</i>
to rinse it out.

129
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,147
Then it helps me continue to eat.

130
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,915
I CAN RELATE

131
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,651
She rinses it out.

132
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,552
After that, I can go back to <i>gopchang.</i>

133
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,521
-But still, it's too greasy.
-Isn't it?

134
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,589
That's right.

135
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,091
-Yes, because it's mostly fat.
-So you can't eat too much of it.

136
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,493
But I really love rich food.

137
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,861
-Me too.
-Yes.

138
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,062
Do you also like rich food?

139
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,064
I'm really bad with dessert.

140
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,332
-Really?
-I'm also the type

141
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,902
who can endlessly eat rich and heavy food
like <i>gopchang</i> and meat.

142
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,305
She says she's not good with dessert,

143
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,740
-but I doubt it's far from our standards.
-You're right.

144
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,542
You can still eat a whole cake, right?

145
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,244
-I've had three whole cakes.
-Three?

146
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,578
-Cake?
-What?

147
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,913
You said you were bad with dessert.

148
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,882
-You shouldn't say that, then.
-Not anymore, though.

149
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,985
-In our world, that means she's bad.
-She doesn't prefer it.

150
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,720
-Usually, one whole cake.
-Not as much as other foods.

151
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,422
She can usually eat a whole cake.

152
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,291
It looks like Hatnim and Chef Eun-yeong
have known each other

153
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,593
-for quite a while now.
-That's right.

154
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,662
She even came to a live streaming session.

155
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,300
<i>We were on another program together,</i>
<i>and we've been friends ever since.</i>

156
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,202
I heard you gave her a nickname.

157
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,537
-I did.
-What is it?

158
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,339
I call her Suc-Man.

159
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,840
-Suc-Man?
-Suc-Man.

160
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,710
She has a quirky side, doesn't she?

161
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,714
I slowly began to think
she was a maniac as I got to know her.

162
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,449
-Chef Eun-yeong?
-Really?

163
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,117
One day, my friend said,

164
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,653
"It's quite a relief
that she became a success."

165
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,121
Successful Maniac.

166
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,790
-Successful Maniac.
-Successful Maniac.

167
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,393
And we thought she was doing her best
for the sake of the show.

168
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,295
-That's how she is.
-That's her nature?

169
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,197
It must've been tough to be known

170
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,165
as the Goddess of Chinese Cuisine.

171
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,101
-I had to keep myself under control.
-Chef Suc-Man.

172
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,770
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
CHEF SUC-MAN IN ACTION

173
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,072
-We'll also call her Chef Suc-Man.
-Chef Suc-Man.

174
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,044
And now, let's take a look
at Hatnim's fridges.

175
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,479
She brought two fridges.

176
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,614
<i>When I do my </i>mukbang,
<i>I usually make my own food,</i>

177
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,851
<i>so I have to buy the ingredients</i>
<i>for the dishes I'm craving.</i>

178
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,653
And I tend to stock up on them.

179
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,589
She says she easily gets bored with food,

180
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,692
-so I'm sure there's quite a variety here.
-I think so too.

181
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,628
What kind of ingredients does she keep
and how much of them does she have?

182
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,196
Let's find out!

183
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,564
Let's find out!

184
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,799
My gosh.

185
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,634
EVERYONE SUDDENLY CLAPS?

186
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,405
PRESENTING HATNIM'S FIRST FRIDGE

187
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,241
We're so happy to have you on the show.

188
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,676
This is just one of the two.

189
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,912
Yes, there's another fridge.

190
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,580
These must be actual snacks.

191
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,182
Yes, I keep lighter snacks here.

192
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,720
I stock up on beverages
and ice cream in this fridge.

193
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,222
Wait, I see digestive drinks.
Do you take these?

194
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,993
What? You have digestive drinks?
That's really disappointing!

195
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,294
Digestive drinks.

196
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,662
And a lot of them.

197
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,532
No, those are for my guests.
You've had it.

198
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,367
She always keeps those drinks at home.

199
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,736
She serves so much food,
so I always end up needing one.

200
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,305
-These are for your guests?
-For your guests?

201
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,774
They always need one.

202
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,010
I guess you'll end up sick
if you keep up with her pace.

203
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,479
"You can't eat as much as I can,
so I prepared this."

204
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,114
That can happen when people eat with her.

205
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,716
-The top shelf has highballs.
-Cans of highball.

206
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,218
You must enjoy alcohol.

207
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,987
-I drink a lot when I have a craving.
-When she has a craving.

208
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,923
The second shelf.

209
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,591
There's milk

210
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,026
and strawberry jam.

211
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,328
The things I keep there
are usually for one meal.

212
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,763
-For one meal?
-These?

213
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,499
Yes, that's how my fridge works.

214
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,868
One compartment for one meal.

215
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,437
-A bag of bread too.
-I see two bags of bread here.

216
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,039
It's half a loaf per bag.

217
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,441
"Half a loaf."

218
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,177
Yes, they used to sell the whole loaf.

219
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,946
It's true, I guess.

220
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,781
-So this is a whole loaf?
-That's right.

221
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,549
-It used to be that long.
-She's right.

222
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,718
I see three bottles of milk.
Do they last only a day?

223
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,153
When I crave some bread,

224
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,822
I always end up drinking
at least two to three bottles of milk.

225
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,492
Two to three bottles
means two to three liters.

226
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,893
Are these cookies?

227
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,896
I've been into confectionery lately.

228
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,064
And when you crave these…

229
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,899
I can eat everything there at once.

230
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,536
You use <i>ramyeon</i> to rinse your mouth,
so are these for a quick mouthwash?

231
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,138
-Yes, when I have the munchies.
-When you have the munchies?

232
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,908
-So like a toothpick.
-Or dental floss.

233
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,444
-Cookies are like toothpicks to her.
-She must love cookies.

234
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,813
-Look at the ice cream.
-Yes.

235
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,184
Can you honestly tell us
how long these will last?

236
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,552
I've once had

237
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,520
twenty-something servings of ice cream.

238
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,322
-That's impossible.
-These?

239
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,858
-Twenty-something?
-Like these ones?

240
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,461
-What about something like this?
-That one?

241
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,662
Do you eat one tub?

242
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,331
-One tub?
-That's just a cup for her.

243
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,801
I top my brownies with a tub of those.

244
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,738
-Were they this big?
-How big were the brownies?

245
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,475
HER STANDARDS HIT DIFFERENT

246
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,377
How many tubs of these can you eat, then?

247
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,879
-I get bored, so maybe two or three.
-Two or three?

248
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,549
But ice cream is just liquid.

249
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,816
-Liquid?
-It's just liquid?

250
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,785
Do you know why this is called Together?

251
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,921
-Because people eat it together.
-We eat it together.

252
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,523
-Is that so?
-They sell this so that people can share,

253
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,925
but you can eat three tubs alone?

254
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,028
Most families would eat half a tub
and store the rest in the freezer.

255
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,264
It'll get freezer-burned,
so that's not an option. I must finish it.

256
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,933
HER PHILOSOPHY

257
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,802
-That's true.
-That's true, I guess.

258
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,438
-On to the main fridge.
-Yes.

259
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,775
-We checked out the snack fridge.
-Those were her snacks.

260
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,377
-This is the real deal.
-Right, that was the snack fridge.

261
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,547
Let's find out what she has
in the main fridge.

262
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,784
We present Hatnim's main fridge!

263
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,589
There's a lot of food.
It's full. No empty space.

264
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,959
HER FRIDGE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT

265
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,828
-Now that's what I'm talking about.
-This is amazing, Hatnim.

266
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,598
Why do I feel like I made a fortune?

267
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,233
-Look at the meat!
-Look at that pile.

268
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,635
-There's kimchi.
-Yes.

269
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,970
And the amount of veggies.

270
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,305
Do you buy your kimchi?

271
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,374
I buy some of them,

272
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,311
-but my aunt in Yeosu makes some for me.
-Kimchi from Yeosu?

273
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,881
-That one on the side is <i>seokbakji.</i>
<i>-Seokbakji?</i>

274
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,817
SEOKBAKJI (MADE BY HER AUNT)

275
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,318
-It smells good.
-It's great with <i>ramyeon.</i>

276
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,120
It smells so…

277
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,521
It smells so good.

278
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,956
I even drink the juice.

279
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,825
-My goodness.
-Does it smell good?

280
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,593
-I can smell it.
-It smells insane.

281
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,195
Get a whiff, everyone.

282
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,430
-It smells amazing.
-Go ahead and smell it.

283
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,299
This smells so good.

284
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,401
The kimchi looks good too,

285
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,937
but I've never seen so much meat.

286
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,138
Look at these.

287
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,107
And they're in the fridge,
not the freezer.

288
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,042
She has a huge pile of meat.

289
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,510
Korean beef.

290
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,579
I'm a regular
at a butcher's in Majang-dong.

291
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,315
They send me the meat
when I call and make an order.

292
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,282
They do?

293
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,486
I hear that's the ribeye
with the cap removed.

294
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,123
-Is this brisket?
-It is. It's for soup.

295
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,693
I always like to see
at least one piece of meat every scoop.

296
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,395
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN

297
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,063
How long does this last?

298
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,565
I bought those to eat during my <i>mukbang.</i>

299
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,267
-So this is for one <i>mukbang?</i>
-Yes.

300
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,535
Just these, not the brisket?

301
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,970
It's my favorite cut,

302
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,539
-so I order 4 kg at once.
-She can finish that.

303
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,408
-Yes.
-Sure, you get bored easily.

304
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,276
SHE CAN ONLY EAT 6 PACKS
(WHICH EQUALS 4 KG)

305
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,645
-She has two, four, six packs.
-Sure, you get bored.

306
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,347
-She devours it.
-Also,

307
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,383
these vegetables are up here,
not in the crisper drawer,

308
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,019
-so this must mean you'll use these soon.
-Yes, today.

309
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,988
That means this shelf is one meal for her.

310
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,557
Yes, that's for today's <i>mukbang.</i>

311
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,958
Sure, you get bored with food.

312
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,429
I see asparagus, broccoli,

313
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,065
and other vegetables you can use.

314
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,733
It looks like veggies as well.

315
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,635
I used to eat only meat,

316
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,305
but one day, I began to realize
my body was craving vegetables.

317
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,041
So I somehow began to eat more vegetables.

318
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,111
Lean duck meat and pork belly.

319
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,113
What's this? Is this fruit?

320
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,481
-Actually,
-Korean melon?

321
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,518
if I had to choose my favorite food,
it would be Korean melon.

322
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,854
-Korean melon.
-It's on the smaller side, though.

323
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,524
That's a new variety
called Korean mango melons.

324
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,626
-I've never heard of it.
-Korean Mango melons.

325
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,961
And they're really sweet.

326
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,629
-They're sweet?
-My gosh!

327
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,431
IT SMELLS AMAZING

328
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,667
The texture feels softer than a crunch.

329
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,437
-Look what Jung-hwan is doing.
-So this is a new variety.

330
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,539
BULGING

331
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,875
-We should try it.
-You know what?

332
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:23,909
It smells really sweet.

333
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,911
YOU CAN ALWAYS TRUST
WHAT HATNIM PICKS OUT

334
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:26,912
May we have one?

335
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,281
-It's because we've never seen it.
-I've never seen it either.

336
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,184
Yes, try it. Let's all try a piece.

337
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,686
I don't have a knife.

338
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,888
-I have mine here.
-I've never had it.

339
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,956
A VARIETY OF KNIVES

340
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,058
I've never seen it before.

341
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,693
Yes, and we've never had it.

342
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,228
JUNG-HWAN PEELS THE FRUIT

343
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,329
This is so new.

344
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,265
It feels different.
It feels like a mango on the outside.

345
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,368
How does he peel it
so smoothly like an apple?

346
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,669
I wanted to eat it from the top.

347
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,405
The cross section.

348
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,774
-It looks odd.
-The cross section.

349
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,942
-The seeds are bigger.
-They are.

350
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,045
-You need to pay the fee for the knife.
-Let us try this fruit.

351
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,213
Do we remove the seeds?

352
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,315
-I like to eat them, actually.
-Eat them.

353
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,651
He's a YouTuber now.

354
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,853
People do this on YouTube, right?

355
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,289
-He must watch lots of YouTube.
-People don't do that now.

356
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,424
-How do I… In one bite.
-Eat it in one bite.

357
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,659
THE HOSTS FINALLY GET A TASTE

358
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,627
MMM

359
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,761
Isn't the texture different?

360
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,862
-Isn't it good?
-I want some too!

361
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,265
-I want some!
-I want to try some too! Come on!

362
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,499
That's my knife.

363
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,434
-It melts in your mouth, right?
-Yes.

364
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,704
It almost tastes like
a well-ripened melon.

365
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,339
So that's what it's like.

366
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,874
How many of these do you eat at once?

367
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,378
I once had 24 of those during a <i>mukbang.</i>

368
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,214
-Twenty-four?
-Then the viewers said

369
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,584
they were traumatized by the color yellow
and asked me not to eat them anymore.

370
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,885
So I ate the rest after streaming.

371
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,020
My goodness.

372
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,889
There's a bit of texture
on the outer layer, isn't there?

373
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,092
-I like that, and it felt just like that.
-Yes, that's true.

374
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,094
ASMR.

375
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,598
Wait, the chefs are supposed to peel this.
Why am I doing it?

376
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,799
Have you tried this, Tzuyang?

377
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,568
-No, he didn't give it to me.
-Tzuyang…

378
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:59,438
-Why not?
-What are you doing? Why did you skip her?

379
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,740
I thought she must've had some before.

380
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,609
-She hadn't.
-I've never tried it.

381
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,045
-I'll grab one more.
-Fine. I'll share mine.

382
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,080
What do you mean, yours?

383
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,115
-I wanted to have some later.
-Goodness.

384
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,884
-Give her the entire thing.
-Thank you.

385
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,018
SHE GETS ALMOST HALF A MELON

386
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,123
SHE EATS IT IN ONE BITE

387
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,759
Tzuyang ate it at once.

388
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,029
-It smells good.
-It does.

389
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,900
-It's smooth, so you can eat lots of it.
-Compared to the original…

390
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,069
It's soft like a well-ripened melon.

391
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,304
When regular Korean melons
ripen over time,

392
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,074
-they become softer, right?
-After-ripened melons.

393
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,942
It's like after-ripened Korean melons.

394
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,143
-I'll look it up.
-Mango melon.

395
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,945
It looks like she enjoys fruit.

396
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,480
-And the freezer.
-Yes.

397
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,048
NEXT, THE FREEZER

398
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,416
-Vegetables.
-She has a lot of food.

399
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,386
It's delicious when you stir-fry
a bag of steamed veggies

400
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,288
with a lot of butter, isn't it?

401
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,124
-A bag?
-With butter?

402
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,292
-A bag?
-A bag?

403
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,828
I use up my vegetables daily,

404
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,063
so I may not have more
once I'm done with everything.

405
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,766
But there are times
when I crave veggies in the dead of night.

406
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,034
Wait.

407
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,370
-All of a sudden? At night?
-Veggies in the dead of night?

408
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,373
-I've never heard of veggie cravings.
-Do you suddenly get up and go, "Veggies"?

409
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,341
Then you go and cook that bag?

410
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,676
Most people are not like that.

411
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,780
Goodness, look at this drawer.
There's a lot of meat in here too.

412
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,716
-That's a lot.
-Yes, I use that to make <i>doenjang-jjigae.</i>

413
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,052
I like to make the stew with brisket,

414
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,454
so I throw in a pack whenever I make some.

415
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,990
-You really do like rich food.
-I do, yes.

416
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,292
Look at these.

417
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,293
HE FINDS A PILE OF WHAT?

418
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,861
Why do you have so much cheese?

419
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,630
-And butter.
-I really love cheese and butter.

420
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,799
<i>Even in the clip we watched,</i>

421
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,435
<i>we saw you grilling the toast</i>
<i>in a soup of butter.</i>

422
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,071
I use a whole block of butter
whenever I make toast.

423
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,240
-Only then is it delicious.
-Only then?

424
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,209
I don't want it to smell like butter.
It has to taste like it.

425
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,613
-Why don't you just make butter soup?
-She wants the taste of butter?

426
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,516
I actually do add butter to my soup.
It tastes good.

427
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,520
-It already sounds so greasy.
-That's how much she likes rich food.

428
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,421
Let's move on.

429
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,356
-This is all salt.
-Salt?

430
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,724
-She has a lot of salt.
-That's a lot.

431
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,827
-I like to keep different kinds of salt.
-They're all different.

432
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,562
-Real gourmets are like that.
-Yes.

433
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,130
This must be sesame oil.

434
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,200
I really love sesame oil,
so I get freshly pressed ones.

435
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,436
-I see.
-You order these?

436
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,237
-The colors…
-Are these also sesame oil?

437
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,206
I got those in the latest delivery.

438
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,276
You need a whole bottle
to make some <i>gimbap</i>, right?

439
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,546
-To make <i>gimbap?</i>
-You use a whole bottle to make <i>gimbap?</i>

440
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,947
-You give it a rub.
-Sesame oil?

441
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,782
Aren't you supposed to give it a rub?

442
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,484
<i>That's when you're rolling the </i>gimbap.

443
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,219
<i>You have to season the rice.</i>

444
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,621
<i>-I see.</i>
<i>-You first season the rice, right?</i>

445
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,589
If you pour in a bottle,

446
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,191
your <i>gimbap </i>will drip with juice.

447
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,227
Yes, the oil starts seeping out.

448
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,462
-That much?
-That was the point.

449
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,797
Rice is usually white,

450
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,601
-but it looks like brown rice later on.
-She likes sesame oil that much.

451
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,970
You'll get to work
with an amazing amount of ingredients.

452
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,638
That was all for Hatnim's fridge!

453
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,873
CHECKED OUT HATNIM'S FRIDGE

454
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,811
We looked through Hatnim's fridge
and saw the ingredients she had.

455
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,814
It's time to find out
what her orders are. Show us!

456
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,084
-So Rich That…
-Greasy Vicky.

457
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,487
-We may have some confident takers.
-…It Feels Almost Wrong.

458
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,790
I always tell my viewers that you must add
an amount that feels almost wrong.

459
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,659
You need to put in so much butter
that it feels almost wrong.

460
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,263
You need to put in so much sesame oil
that it feels almost wrong.

461
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,197
<i>Yes, you did add a lot.</i>

462
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,900
I love sesame oil and butter,

463
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,336
so please use them abundantly

464
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,606
and let me enjoy
a dopamine rush after the first bite.

465
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,941
What's the next order?

466
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,046
A Dish Even Hatnim Won't Get Bored With.

467
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,049
My boredom cycle
is becoming shorter and shorter.

468
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,550
It has become much shorter.

469
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,252
-So I…
-What do you mean?

470
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,221
-Only her hair became shorter.
-I still haven't found a dish

471
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,923
that makes me feel full
just by eating that.

472
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,325
-I see.
-A dish you won't have to switch out of?

473
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,561
-Yes.
-A dish you can keep eating.

474
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,398
I like dishes that have
different layers of flavors after a bite.

475
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,868
First, something hits me.
Then, it changes to a different texture.

476
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,904
Lastly, it finishes with a delicate touch.

477
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,472
That's my expertise.

478
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,775
I'm the expert.
Goodness. I'm the expert in that area.

479
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,645
Four of the chefs already cooked
in the previous episode,

480
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,848
so Hyun-suk, Ho-young,
Nam-no, and Eun-yeong are left.

481
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,318
First, your good friend,
Chef Eun-yeong, can choose first.

482
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,187
-She's Chef Suc-Man.
-Suc-Man.

483
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,588
The Chinese Cuisine Maniac.

484
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,523
I'll join the second round.

485
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,492
A dish she won't get bored with.

486
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,095
-We have another maniac.
-Should we give him a chance?

487
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,363
-There's a perfect order for me to fill.
-Which one?

488
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,199
So Rich That It Feels Almost Wrong.

489
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,134
-I see.
-I'm so excited.

490
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,971
I'm a chef who loses his function
if I cannot use butter.

491
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,506
He bleached his hair like butter.

492
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,241
You're right. He has butter-colored hair.

493
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,175
Two slots remain.

494
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,479
Nam-no is an easy target,
so I'll fight him.

495
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,415
Gosh, what happened to his reputation?

496
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,550
It'll be tough for you to defeat me
with this theme.

497
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,987
-My dear Nam-no! This is really bad.
-He thinks Nam-no is easier to beat.

498
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,256
Chef Hyun-suk will have to make a dish
she won't be bored with.

499
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,226
As you already know,
I often make unpredictable dishes.

500
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,061
After the first bite,
there's a certain smell.

501
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,530
And at the end,
the smell changes as you finish.

502
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,300
Also, my dishes
always showed a change on the plate,

503
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,470
-as if I were playing variations.
-Variation.

504
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,140
Nobody has said,
"I'm so bored with Chef Hyun-suk's food."

505
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,242
Many people are sick of me,

506
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,877
but never my dishes.

507
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,247
-He makes you feel fed up in the process.
-At least he knows that.

508
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,315
All right, then.
Nam-no and Ho-young are up first.

509
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,251
Let us begin the 15-minute cook-off!

510
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,619
RICHEST DISHES, COMING RIGHT UP!

511
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:20,125
<i>We're about to begin the first round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Hatnim's fridge.</i>

512
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,895
It's between two chefs who eat so much
that it feels almost wrong,

513
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,632
Chef Jung Ho-young
versus Chef Yoon Nam-no.

514
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,900
At times,

515
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,202
it seems like
they eat more than our guests.

516
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,271
-They do.
-That's right.

517
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,374
There's a rumor that we do not have
as many leftovers to throw away

518
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,110
since Chef Nam-no joined the show.

519
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,578
-That's great.
-Let us appoint you

520
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,413
as a protector of our environment.

521
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,516
-Yes, he has a role to play.
-Yes, I'll represent <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

522
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,220
It looks like Chef Ho-young feels
very confident to fight against Nam-no.

523
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,556
We received this voice recording.

524
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,591
-They keep recording us.
-"Nam-no's easy to handle."

525
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,327
"All you have to do is
give him something to eat."

526
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,596
What did you mean by this?

527
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,897
-That's true.
-There were times

528
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,034
when I considered giving him
a portion of what I was making.

529
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,770
I thought he'd become invested
in eating the food

530
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,806
and begin to neglect
what he had been working on.

531
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,241
HE HAS DONE THAT BEFORE

532
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,676
He might forget what he was doing.

533
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,780
Today, the winning chef gets a prize.

534
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,683
So that you can enjoy delicious fish
without using your stove,

535
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,052
the winner will receive

536
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,455
a gift box of ready-made grilled fish,
crunchy on the outside yet soft inside.

537
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,958
-Yes.
-I love that product.

538
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,227
-We're offering food as a prize.
-He's excited.

539
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,628
-His mouth is watering.
-He's happy.

540
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,763
-He looks happy.
-Aren't you intrigued?

541
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,033
-I'll have to win no matter what.
-Right?

542
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,802
I'm feeling competitive.

543
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,705
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS:
BUTTER, SESAME OIL, BEEF RIBS

544
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,807
RIBEYE, BRISKET, CLAM CHOWDER,
BLACK OLIVES, AND MORE

545
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,875
Here's the name of my dish.

546
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,378
Richness from Majang.

547
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,981
-Richness from Majang?
-Majang?

548
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,250
I'll use the meat she bought
from Majang-dong.

549
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,752
-Ribeye.
-And brisket.

550
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,589
And I'll use beef ribs
to make a meat hammer

551
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,026
as we've all seen in cartoons.
A huge piece of meat on the bone.

552
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,228
-Like meat from the Stone Age?
-Yes.

553
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,731
-Something you can bite on like this.
-Something like this.

554
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,468
I'll serve that with sauce made
with her favorites, sesame oil and butter.

555
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,503
I LOVE IT

556
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,872
Lastly, I'll also serve cheese fondue.

557
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,173
-Fondue?
-Fondue?

558
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,575
RICHNESS GALORE

559
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,176
As I mentioned before, this is called

560
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,878
Richness from Majang.

561
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,413
-I see.
-Richness from Majang.

562
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,349
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS:
BUTTER, SESAME OIL, PORK NECK, DUCK MEAT

563
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,418
BRISKET, CUCUMBER, BEECH MUSHROOM,
EMPEROR MUSHROOM, MILK, AND MORE

564
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,854
Up against him is Chef Ho-young.
What are you making?

565
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,722
To explain what I prepared for my dish…

566
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,491
I plan to lay Hatnim down

567
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,761
-and drench her in butter.
-She'll lie in butter?

568
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,763
I thought he said he'd wrench me.

569
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,867
I'll use brisket, pork neck, and duck meat

570
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,737
to make a Japanese-style stir-fry
with seasoned soy sauce and butter.

571
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,675
I'll also grill some mushrooms
for the side dish.

572
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,209
You had very rich sesame oil,

573
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,379
so I'll season some cucumbers
and make salad

574
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,647
with the fragrant oil.

575
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,848
-That sounds good.
-Lastly,

576
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,785
I'll make cheese sauce
for you to use as a dip

577
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,688
or pour over the meat stir-fry.

578
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,556
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT

579
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,191
We've never had this happen before.

580
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,193
She became the first fridge owner

581
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,795
who brought her own utensils.

582
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,030
SHE BROUGHT HER OWN UTENSILS

583
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:12,931
EMBARRASSED

584
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,933
-That's cool.
-This has never happened before.

585
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,736
-That's a huge difference.
-It is.

586
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,538
-The difference is quite big.
-Yes.

587
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,539
It's like a rice paddle.

588
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,408
-I just use these to eat.
-Aren't those used for cooking?

589
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:27,012
<i>-Do you use them for </i>mukbang?
<i>-Yes, and in my everyday life.</i>

590
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,514
Don't you find tiny spoons
difficult to eat with?

591
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,284
I could develop frozen shoulders
from scooping too often.

592
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,953
We call those "serving gear"
in the industry.

593
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,857
-They're often used in buffets to serve.
-Yes.

594
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,226
If you always use those,
it means you can fit it in your mouth.

595
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,594
I'm sure you all can do it.

596
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,730
-Wow.
-Wow. What was that?

597
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,031
I'm sure you can all do it.

598
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,367
You didn't even open your mouth that wide.

599
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,235
That means she has high expectations.

600
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,673
And now, these two will make the dishes,
So Rich That It Feels Almost Wrong.

601
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,944
Chef Yoon Nam-no, who eats so much
for a chef that it feels almost wrong.

602
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,880
Chef Jung Ho-young,

603
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,450
who dances so much for a chef
that it feels almost wrong.

604
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,587
Which one of the two dishes
will Hatnim choose?

605
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:12,257
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

606
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,260
You have to make rich dishes.

607
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,828
Begin!

608
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,931
You have to make rich dishes.

609
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:23,602
-Make something almost illegally rich.
-Beef ribs.

610
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,570
-He's using rib meat.
-Rib meat?

611
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,339
He removed the bone.

612
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,306
HEHE

613
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,508
Beef brisket.

614
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,511
-Is that strip loin?
-He's using ribeye.

615
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,812
CHOPPED INTO LARGE PIECES

616
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,847
That's beef brisket.

617
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,848
Beef brisket.

618
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,351
-He's going to ground it.
-He will?

619
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,720
He's using quite a lot of meat.

620
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,789
He's grinding everything.

621
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,290
Butter.

622
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,960
-Butter first.
-He begins with butter.

623
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,430
-Is that pork neck?
-It is.

624
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,764
Pork neck is already greasy,

625
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,533
-It's in butter.
-and it's in butter.

626
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,034
Pork neck isn't greasy.

627
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,602
She just said pork neck isn't greasy.

628
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,005
-Isn't it light?
-Did you say light?

629
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,239
"Isn't pork neck light?"

630
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,508
-She thinks pork neck is light?
-It has to be greasier.

631
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,577
The fat doesn't linger in your mouth.

632
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,078
It only becomes crunchy.

633
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,915
Pork neck is delicious,

634
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,552
-and he's cooking it in butter.
-It already looks good.

635
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,755
MAX FLAMES
BECAUSE OF THE GREASE

636
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,689
ANOTHER PAN WITH BUTTER!

637
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,460
Chef Ho-young mixed butter,
flour, and milk to make roux.

638
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,494
He's making roux.

639
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,729
Ho-young is busy making his food greasy.

640
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,164
I think he's making cheese sauce.

641
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,433
Why is he grinding meat?

642
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,336
He's going to stick it on the bone.

643
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,707
-Will it look like a patty on a stick?
-And he'll turn it into a meat hammer.

644
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,610
-Soy sauce, cooking wine, sugar.
-Soy sauce, cooking wine, sugar.

645
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,880
Nam-no makes the sauce.

646
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,416
The sauce will taste like <i>galbi.</i>

647
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,084
I see. He's seasoning the meat.

648
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,086
What's that? Flour?

649
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,421
-Potato starch.
-Starch?

650
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,256
He's now putting the meat on the bone.

651
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,390
Just like that?

652
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,558
MEAT ON THE BEEF RIB!

653
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,027
-Will he deep-fry that?
-I think he will.

654
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,731
HE PUTS A HEARTY AMOUNT OF MEAT
ON THE BONE

655
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,801
-It's stuck on the board.
-It has to stay on the bone.

656
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,669
IS IT NOT STICKING TO THE BONE?

657
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,137
It has to stay on the bone.

658
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,106
He didn't use a lot of starch.

659
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,975
-No?
-I'm not sure if it'll keep its shape.

660
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,009
It needs more starch.

661
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,010
BACK INTO THE BOWL!

662
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,713
-It needs more starch.
-Nam-no throws it back into the bowl!

663
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,415
-Why didn't he do that before?
-He must've forgotten.

664
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,318
-He did, but it wasn't enough.
-It could've been bad.

665
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,354
-Everyone was worried about that.
-It could've been bad.

666
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,955
Still, he listens to you

667
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,857
-because you two were a team.
-He does.

668
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,360
He adds more starch
and tries to put it back on the bone.

669
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:32,931
It's a rather large piece of meat,
so it'll take a while to cook.

670
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,533
HUP!

671
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,034
HAHAHAHA

672
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,170
HE SUCCESSFULLY MAKES A HAMMER

673
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,138
Why would you make that?

674
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,040
-It looks great.
-He's so happy about it.

675
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,009
-Why is he so happy?
-It looks smooth.

676
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,411
IT IS SMOOTH, SO SMOOTH

677
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,280
It looks like I'll win, right?

678
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,715
IT IS FLAT, SO FLAT

679
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,716
He has gone mad.

680
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,984
SO FLAT

681
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,687
What is that?

682
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,821
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

683
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,190
YOUR ORDER OF MEAT HAMMER IS READY

684
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,760
TEASING HIM AND HAVING FUN

685
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,229
OUR MAN, NAM-NO,
IS AS THRILLED AS THE FIRST CAVEMAN

686
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,464
WHO INVENTED THE HAND AX

687
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,333
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

688
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,834
ABOUT TO GO MAD(?)
FROM EXCITEMENT

689
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,002
Put it in already.

690
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,073
-The heat.
-The heat is too low.

691
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,608
-It's too low.
-No.

692
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,177
IS THE OIL NOT HOT ENOUGH?

693
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,378
No.

694
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,881
He already dropped it in the oil.

695
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,883
It's only about 140°C.

696
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,552
How can you tell
if it's 140°C by looking at it?

697
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,687
I can tell at a glance.

698
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,388
I wonder how the hammer will turn out.

699
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,257
It looks pretty light so far.

700
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,525
Is that emperor mushroom?

701
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,227
-Emperor mushroom.
-That's a delicious one.

702
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,297
She said she liked vegetables earlier.

703
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,232
I like mushrooms as much as meat.

704
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,101
She likes mushrooms as much as meat!

705
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,769
EXACTLY WHAT SHE LIKES

706
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,271
Ho-young looks relaxed.

707
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,205
REGAINS HIS COOL

708
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,574
PORK NECK IN BUTTER, OUT

709
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,976
He seems relaxed today.

710
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,110
-He's sailing smoothly.
-Yes.

711
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,712
He's so cool.

712
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,313
What's that meat?

713
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,248
-It's duck meat.
-Duck meat!

714
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,250
He's throwing in lots of butter.

715
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,152
Duck meat is also quite greasy.

716
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,921
-You're right.
-And he added butter to that.

717
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,190
-That's Lying in Butter.
-And brisket.

718
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,295
AGAIN, BUTTER!

719
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,498
MAKING HIS WAY
TO THE PINNACLE OF RICHNESS

720
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,368
-He adds butter to brisket too!
-More butter?

721
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,236
THE GUY WHO LOVES RICHNESS

722
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,138
Ho-young captures everyone's attention.

723
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,574
He stir-fried
every type of meat in butter.

724
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,442
-I see.
-More butter.

725
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,910
NAM-NO IS READY FOR GREASINESS TOO!

726
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,846
Clam chowder.

727
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,681
Clam chowder.

728
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,883
Cheese.

729
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,753
-Is that burrata?
-Yes, it's burrata.

730
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,088
What's that? Cheese?

731
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,290
-All of the cheeses went in.
-It already looks greasy.

732
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,925
He threw in everything greasy.

733
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,160
SHUDDERS

734
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,496
-It looks so good.
-My vessels feel clogged already.

735
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,597
AND HE ADDS MILK

736
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,433
-I already feel full.
-And he adds milk.

737
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,335
-Is that butter?
-Butter.

738
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,270
He's using so much butter.

739
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,272
More butter?

740
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,640
And sesame oil!

741
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,875
I GOT SESAME OIL TOO

742
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,177
Chef Nam-no pours sesame oil into the pot!

743
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,681
An entire block of butter
and a huge load of sesame oil.

744
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,149
-Butter sesame oil?
-Butter sesame oil.

745
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,417
-Butter sesame oil?
-Yes.

746
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,019
The sesame oil is making me feel dizzy.

747
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,255
WHERE WILL HE USE THIS?

748
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,791
I'm sure all the doctors watching this

749
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,894
are thinking, "Is that even allowed?"

750
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,529
They're probably tutting.

751
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,631
DOCTORS, CLOSE YOUR EYES
FOR THIS NEXT STEP

752
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,766
POURING IN SHREDDED CHEESE

753
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,667
Gosh, cheese.

754
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,369
Isn't that too much?

755
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,770
-What's he using?
-What's that?

756
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,172
-Energy drink?
-It's a highball.

757
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,473
-Highball?
-Highball!

758
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,774
WHY IS HE USING HIGHBALL?

759
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,875
-Why highball?
-Highball?

760
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,677
-He used highball?
-To add sweetness?

761
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,413
It'll give the flavor depth
as it melts the cheese.

762
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,450
He must've used it like white wine.

763
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,018
-Right?
-This is a nice tip.

764
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,120
MORE CHEESE

765
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,456
What's that? Jeez.

766
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,757
-It's cheese.
-He's using everything.

767
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,392
Isn't that too much?

768
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,894
-It'll smell too cheesy.
-I think he's making cheese fondue.

769
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,029
I guess so. More?

770
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,464
THREE, FOUR MORE SLICES

771
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,099
Ho-young! Goodness.

772
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,235
-You'll need an IV shot after eating that.
-You will.

773
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,770
Aren't you using too much cheese?

774
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,872
He has abandoned his work ethics.

775
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,007
Even Tzuyang is in shock.

776
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,343
HE HAS A WEAPON
TO FIGHT BACK THE CHEESE GUY!

777
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,879
There's the hammer!

778
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,114
The hammer is ready!

779
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,282
-Nam-no fishes out the hammer!
-It looks nice.

780
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,251
-It turned out great.
-It looks nice.

781
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,953
WHAT'S NEXT?

782
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,287
What's he using? Olives?

783
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,455
-Olives.
-Olives.

784
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,925
3. ADD CHOPPED OLIVES AND LIME JUICE
TO THE BUTTER AND SESAME OIL SAUCE

785
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,660
Will he sprinkle those on the top?

786
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,096
Will he coat the hammer with the sauce?

787
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,898
GRUNT

788
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,967
THE MEAT HAMMER GOES IN FOR THE 2ND TIME

789
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,969
RELAXED GOOD VIBES GUY

790
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,103
BRISKET, OUT

791
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,473
-How many kinds of meat is he using?
-The brisket already looks good.

792
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,777
Chef Ho-young uses
many different kinds of meat.

793
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,911
What will he do with those?

794
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,146
Look at the grease.

795
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,314
How much meat is he using?

796
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,516
That's a huge amount.

797
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:45,784
Green onion?

798
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,185
ADDS A TOUCH(?) OF GREEN ONION

799
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,653
Have you taken your blood pressure meds?

800
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,922
This morning? I have.

801
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,458
Just smelling that might raise it.

802
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,727
IN THAT CASE!

803
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,696
3. MIX EGG SOY SAUCE
AND VINEGAR TO MAKE THE SAUCE

804
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,466
-He's smashing the cucumbers.
-He's using those.

805
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,467
Smashed cucumbers.

806
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,769
Yes, she's going to need
something like cucumbers.

807
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,605
-I love cucumbers.
-She needs something refreshing.

808
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,074
Ho-young adds more greasiness.

809
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,843
It looks so good.

810
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,077
-Chef Ho-young.
-Yes?

811
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,412
Give Chef Nam-no a piece of meat.

812
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,215
It looks so good. He can't say no to that.

813
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,351
Once you give Nam-no something to eat,
it'll make him rather mellow.

814
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,586
Check the time first.

815
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,720
ALL THREE TYPES OF MEAT

816
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,422
I want a bite too.

817
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,491
You should soften him up.

818
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,792
-Nam-no.
-Whoa!

819
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,995
Get back to cooking! What are you doing?

820
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,032
A MOMENT OF CONFUSION

821
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,968
FINISHES EVERYTHING IN ONE BITE

822
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,571
SO GOOD

823
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,875
THERE WAS NO POINT,
HE FINISHED IT IN ONE BITE

824
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:44,843
He's done?

825
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,411
-He ate everything?
-Already?

826
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,146
That was way too quick.

827
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,348
-Do you want some more?
-It disappeared in a flash.

828
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,816
GIVES UP ON NAM-NO
AND CHECKS HIS CHEESE

829
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,485
-It melted nicely.
-It looks good.

830
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,355
-The fondue is perfect.
-The fondue turned out nicely.

831
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,756
A THUMBS-UP FROM TZUYANG

832
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,191
He's like a Western cuisine chef.

833
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,459
That's why he's my master.

834
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,995
-Only at times like this?
-My master.

835
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,164
Ho-young is still working on his fondue.

836
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,132
-He adds more.
-More?

837
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,001
MORE SHREDDED CHEESE

838
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,302
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP

839
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,471
Is she going to dip the meat
in the cheese?

840
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,075
On the other hand,
Chef Nam-no's cheese sauce

841
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,378
hasn't melted thoroughly
and still looks watery.

842
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,914
He used burrata,
which contains a lot of water.

843
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,849
-Yes.
-When will that start boiling?

844
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,851
His sauce looks a bit watery.

845
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,621
-Sung-ju. Please report from the kitchen.
-Yes?

846
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,323
-Try the fondue.
-There are too many greasy things.

847
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,925
Can you try the fondue?

848
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,994
I wonder what the fondue is like.

849
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,597
Does the sauce
make you want to lie in butter?

850
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,600
DOES IT MAKE YOU
WANT TO LIE IN BUTTER?

851
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,103
Man.

852
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,839
My goodness. This is

853
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,840
way too rich.

854
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,909
OVERLY RICH

855
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,176
AS IF HE'S DROWNING IN BUTTER

856
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,312
-Where's your work ethic?
-Are you serious?

857
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,148
This is extremely rich.

858
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,550
This kind of dish
is what will make you age instantly.

859
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,952
I don't think

860
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,987
the Korean Medical Association
will approve of this.

861
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,823
The fondue has layers of flavors.

862
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,626
NAM-NO FEELS ANXIOUS
AND USES HIS ULTIMATE MOVE

863
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,328
What's that?

864
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,663
WHY DOES HE NEED STRAW?

865
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,198
-Will he set it on fire?
-The straw?

866
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,867
It must be hot.

867
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,404
He's going to broil the meat hammer.

868
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,539
LET'S BROIL THIS THING!

869
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,608
ALL EYES ON NAM-NO

870
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,777
-A straw fire.
-Straw fire.

871
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,211
He's smoking the meat.

872
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,146
ABLAZE

873
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,280
He's using straw?

874
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,517
Nam-no seems very confident.
He thinks he's going to win.

875
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,453
LIKE A CAVEMAN
WHO FIRST DISCOVERED FIRE,

876
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,854
OUR MAN, NAM-NO, IS THRILLED

877
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,123
Nam-no thinks he's going to win!

878
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,391
It's over.

879
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,459
-Sung-ju.
-Yes?

880
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,394
He's using straw, so can you try some?

881
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,897
Let me just smell it.

882
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,398
HE GETS CLOSER TO SMELL THE FIRE

883
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,233
-It smells great.
-It does?

884
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,904
It's like cooking outdoors
in the countryside.

885
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,006
Isn't the meat too charred?

886
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,674
-It looks burnt.
-It's not!

887
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,009
It's not. It's the soy sauce.

888
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,911
-He added soy sauce and sugar.
-It's hot.

889
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,146
-Let me try this.
-What is that?

890
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,882
This one.
He put clam chowder in this, right?

891
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,587
Does it taste rich or not?

892
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,422
DOES IT?

893
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:12,857
Whoa!

894
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,925
It's too hot!

895
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,693
OH, MY

896
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,829
-Is it still hot?
-Oh, no.

897
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,130
But yes, it's rich!

898
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,766
Which one tastes greasier?

899
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,735
Which one tastes greasier?

900
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,237
-This one.
-Goodness.

901
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,505
It's because he used burrata.

902
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,842
This sauce has clam meat.

903
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,277
I CAN'T GO DOWN LIKE THIS!

904
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,213
-What's that?
-He's using lots of ingredients.

905
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,781
Truffle sauce.

906
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,282
Truffle sauce?

907
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,350
Is that caviar?

908
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,518
-Truffle sauce.
-It's truffle?

909
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,588
BACK ON THE FIRE WITH THE TRUFFLE SAUCE

910
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,223
Woo-hoo!

911
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,457
CHEERS TO KEEP HIS ENERGY UP

912
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,658
That looks good.

913
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,428
WHAT'S HO-YOUNG DOING?

914
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:55,233
HE'S SERVING BROILED VEGETABLES

915
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,667
-Sugar?
-Is that sugar?

916
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,403
Sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar.

917
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,437
4. MIX SUGAR, SOY SAUCE, COOKING WINE

918
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,372
A GOOD AMOUNT OF SOY-BASED SAUCE!

919
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,108
Ho-young is going all out
with the richness.

920
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,145
IT LOOKS SO GREASY
THAT IT FEELS ALMOST WRONG

921
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,213
-That'll make you age.
-It'll clog your veins.

922
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,382
You have a minute and eight seconds left.

923
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,850
LAST BIT OF CONSCIENCE, CUCUMBER SALAD

924
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,723
This is really good. It's just delicious.

925
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,458
-This is…
-Look at the meat.

926
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,927
It looks like charcoal.

927
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,796
CHECKS TO SEE IF IT'S CHARRED

928
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,197
It's okay if it tastes fine.

929
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,665
Is it not burnt?

930
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,634
-Is this all right?
-Isn't it burnt?

931
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,636
-It's so good.
-Is it?

932
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,705
-This sauce will do it.
-He had this sauce.

933
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,074
It smells so rich and greasy.

934
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:37,975
What's this smell?

935
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,245
This sauce was really greasy.

936
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,713
I didn't put butter in it.

937
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,515
You still didn't add the butter?

938
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,251
-I'm doing it now.
-You haven't added butter?

939
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,420
-Are you doing it now?
-I'm doing it now.

940
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,588
It's going on top of the meat.

941
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,324
-The meat smells so good.
-It does.

942
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,927
-My gosh. What is this?
-He adds butter!

943
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,161
My gosh! Look at the butter!

944
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,529
Isn't that too much butter?

945
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,765
DOESN'T IT FEEL WRONG?

946
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,600
My gosh! Look at the butter!

947
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,868
It's butter soup!

948
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,871
-You're putting it on top?
-Butter <i>jeongol? </i>What is this?

949
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,207
-What is this?
-Am I supposed to eat the butter?

950
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,143
-His dish seems much richer.
-What's he doing?

951
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,145
But I personally liked
Nam-no's sauce better.

952
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,948
I wonder how this round will end.

953
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,616
You have ten seconds left. Please wrap up.

954
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,952
-Wrap it up.
-Please wrap it up. Ho-young is done.

955
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,754
Nam-no is done as well.

956
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,756
-Is this it?
-Please wrap it up.

957
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,292
THE DISHES DEPART

958
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,595
They made such delicious dishes.

959
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:36,801
Two rich and greasy dishes for Hatnim
are both finished.

960
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,136
-Thank you.
-Do you like it?

961
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,837
I can already smell

962
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,906
how buttery and greasy they are,

963
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,276
so my mouth is watering.

964
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:49,213
Also, they even look so nice, I find it
hard to believe it only took 15 minutes.

965
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,449
-What is it?
-It's a popsicle.

966
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,950
-A popsicle?
-It looks like one.

967
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,053
Please try Chef Ho-young's dish first.

968
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:01,192
3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEAT LYING IN BUTTER

969
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,528
SERVED WITH CHEESE FONDUE
FOR EXTRA RICHNESS

970
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,264
AND A SIDE OF CUCUMBER SALAD
SEASONED IN SESAME OIL

971
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,101
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S
LYING IN BUTTER

972
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,238
Please melt the butter
with the heat contained in the pot.

973
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,341
It'll mix well with the soy-based sauce
once it melts.

974
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,778
Her own utensils.

975
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,214
Let's see how she uses them.

976
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,550
So I should mix everything, right?

977
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,518
It melted right away.

978
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,420
I didn't have to mix it too much.

979
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,389
You're right. You didn't have to.

980
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,925
-Is it similar to sukiyaki?
-Yes.

981
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,927
May I mix different kinds of meat?

982
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,562
DUCK MEETS BRISKET
MEETS PORK NECK

983
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,963
What's that?

984
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,398
That fork can grab a lot of food.

985
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,466
-It smells so good.
-That fork is useful.

986
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,367
She's about to try it.

987
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,802
It's quite a wonder.

988
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,437
WOW

989
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,773
I think she just ate the brisket.

990
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,274
She becomes wide-eyed.

991
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,442
WIDE-EYED

992
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,644
ENVIOUS

993
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,814
She has a knack for making the food
look delicious. Look at her mouth.

994
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,583
I can tell that it's good.

995
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,585
I wasn't sure

996
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,989
if the mix of pork and beef
would work out all right.

997
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,425
But I love
how they have different textures.

998
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,326
He used duck too.

999
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,794
It feels tender,

1000
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,295
chewy,

1001
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,897
and crunchy at the same time.

1002
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,632
-But…
-Is it not so greasy?

1003
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,467
No, it's not so bad.

1004
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,270
-It's not so bad.
-There's the sauce.

1005
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,239
-Yes, the sauce.
-You can dip it in the sauce.

1006
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,506
If that doesn't feel enough,

1007
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,474
-pour it.
-Pour it.

1008
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,277
-Pour it?
-Yes, that's why he served it with cheese.

1009
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,812
-Dip it first.
-It looks good.

1010
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,182
The meat stir-fry itself
wasn't rich enough for her.

1011
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,150
Hatnim dips it in the sauce like fondue!

1012
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,553
-Hatnim!
-Dip it all the way.

1013
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,054
Yes, it was that sauce.

1014
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,390
That cheese was way too rich.

1015
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,659
He mixed a variety of cheeses.

1016
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,428
WHAT'S THE MEAT LIKE WITH CHEESE?

1017
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,896
Isn't it still hot?

1018
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,765
She tries the meat,
the mushroom, and the cheese!

1019
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,367
HEHE

1020
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,168
-Hatnim.
-She's pleased.

1021
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,037
HER SUNNY SMILE SAYS IT ALL

1022
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,206
Hatnim shows a huge smile.

1023
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,741
She smiles like the sun.

1024
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,277
She finished it in no time.

1025
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,611
Wait.

1026
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:05,149
-Where's the acidity from?
-It's the highball from before.

1027
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:09,253
I wanted to balance out
the richness just a little bit.

1028
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,088
He kept his ethics as a chef.

1029
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:14,825
-Was it a grape highball?
-Yes, white wine highball.

1030
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,627
Was it unnecessary?

1031
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,795
Was it unnecessary?

1032
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,664
Well…

1033
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,400
Why did you put it in?

1034
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,769
You didn't have to balance it out.

1035
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:25,703
You didn't have to.

1036
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,106
-But it's unique.
-Is it?

1037
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,876
I know you wanted
to balance out the richness as a chef,

1038
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,611
but why did you do that today?

1039
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,880
You didn't have to do that for her.

1040
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,784
When the saltiness of the soy-based sauce

1041
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,253
meets the cheesy smell,

1042
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,754
it doesn't feel too rich.

1043
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,059
Just how rich does she need it to be?

1044
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,061
So it doesn't feel almost wrong?

1045
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,896
Next, please try the cucumber salad.

1046
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,832
I made it with a lot of sesame oil,

1047
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,701
-so have some with it.
-Taste the sesame oil.

1048
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,003
Most people would
pick up a piece at a time.

1049
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,705
I thought you were serving it to someone.

1050
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,276
But she can eat that in one bite.

1051
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,410
The smell of sesame oil.

1052
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,912
SMELLS LIKE NUTTY SESAME OIL

1053
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,082
CRUNCHY

1054
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,783
It must be good.

1055
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,818
IT SOUNDS AMAZING

1056
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,219
The sound does it.

1057
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,524
-It was made with vinegar, right?
-Yes.

1058
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,594
<i>-I like that tangy flavor.</i>
<i>-Soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, sesame oil.</i>

1059
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:27,264
These two go very well together.

1060
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,532
It looks so greasy.

1061
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,169
It already looks much richer
than anything we can handle.

1062
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,305
She tries just the pork.

1063
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,007
HER MUKBANG CONTINUES
WITHOUT CEASING

1064
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,410
I remember how she said
we should try her toast.

1065
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,945
She makes it look so good.

1066
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,114
I WANT SOME TOO…

1067
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,483
This is why people watch her eat.

1068
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,451
I'm hungry.

1069
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,854
ANOTHER REFRESHMENT

1070
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,123
-When it gets greasy…
-A bite of that.

1071
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,625
-Made with sesame oil.
-Cucumber salad.

1072
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,495
You should eat this while it's warm.

1073
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,431
-The same probably goes for this one.
-Yes, right.

1074
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,800
You can set it aside for now.

1075
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,270
Next, please try Chef Nam-no's dish.

1076
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,738
<i>Richness from Majang.</i>

1077
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,706
A MEAT HAMMER ON CHEESE

1078
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,911
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
RICHNESS FROM MAJANG

1079
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,346
May I give her a hand

1080
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,747
and help her eat it?

1081
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,183
-She'll manage.
-I think she'll be fine.

1082
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,351
Maybe just the sauce.

1083
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,987
-Let me help you with this.
-Are you going to pour the sauce?

1084
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,622
These are olives. It's olive sauce.

1085
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,323
OLIVE, BUTTER, AND SESAME OIL SAUCE

1086
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,958
You wanted to top it with the sauce?

1087
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,360
Butter and sesame oil.

1088
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,895
Yes, butter and sesame oil.

1089
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,129
WOW…

1090
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,398
With that much oil,

1091
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,100
you can probably fuel a car.

1092
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:38,836
It really might.

1093
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,205
-I didn't think he'd pour that on top.
-Right?

1094
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,208
-She puts on the gloves and picks it up.
-Bite on it!

1095
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,143
IT LOOKS CRAZY

1096
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,211
That'd rake in lots of views.

1097
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,679
-It would.
-The thumbnail.

1098
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,847
Yes, that's the thumbnail.

1099
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,349
-So this is how you get lots of views.
-The thumbnail.

1100
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,317
Wow.

1101
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,386
TAKES A HUGE BITE
WITHOUT HESITATING

1102
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,821
She doesn't even hesitate.

1103
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,255
FASCINATED

1104
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,790
It falls apart easily.

1105
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,861
-It doesn't.
-No?

1106
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,830
-Right here.
-It's cooked well.

1107
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:10,134
I think it's still juicy because
he used the right amount of starch.

1108
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,803
I usually prefer meat's natural texture,

1109
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,104
not that of ground meat.

1110
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,440
Because it can get dry, right?

1111
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,977
But there's none of that. It's so juicy.

1112
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,612
If it's juicy, it's a huge success.

1113
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,515
I also wondered
why you used that much truffle sauce,

1114
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,717
but it goes so well with this.
You were right.

1115
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,853
JOY, SADNESS

1116
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,357
-Nam-no is sure of his victory.
-Look at that.

1117
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:34,925
ANYONE WOULD CLICK ON THIS

1118
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,393
I want to click on this clip.

1119
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,529
-Whoa.
-That looks insane.

1120
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,164
My gosh. That's the thumbnail.

1121
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,166
A HUGE BITE

1122
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,135
GETTING SUCKED IN…

1123
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,338
You have to eat like that
to get people to watch you.

1124
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,240
You remind me of the Neolithic Age.

1125
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,509
It feels like the primitive era.

1126
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,178
Also, this sauce isn't too rich.

1127
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,713
-It's not too rich?
-No?

1128
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,148
-Why didn't you make it richer?
-It's not rich enough.

1129
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,118
If that sauce isn't rich,
Nam-no's dish wouldn't feel greasy.

1130
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,386
-Is it not rich enough?
-No.

1131
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,222
-It tastes like potato soup.
-Potato soup?

1132
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,991
-It tastes like potato soup?
-Potato soup?

1133
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,860
-Potato soup.
-But I threw in so much cheese.

1134
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,896
She's saying it tastes quite clean.

1135
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,332
ANOTHER HUGE BITE

1136
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,034
Look at her go.

1137
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,403
Nam-no made quite the thumbnail moment.

1138
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,706
It looks delicious.

1139
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,108
You can continue with the dishes.

1140
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,044
Please try
Chef Nam-no's Richness from Majang.

1141
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,346
Let's see what Tzuyang thinks.

1142
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,348
SHE PICKS UP THE WHOLE PATTY

1143
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,083
AND TAKES A BITE

1144
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,685
She eats so well.

1145
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,354
MMM

1146
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,290
She doesn't even drop it.

1147
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,692
GULP

1148
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:45,129
She swallows it right away.
It doesn't stay in her mouth for too long.

1149
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,332
She has a grinder inside, so it's fine.

1150
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,467
A CONSPIRACY
ABOUT A GRINDER IN HER STOMACH

1151
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,971
She tries just the sauce off the plate.

1152
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,172
Does it taste like cheese?

1153
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,541
-It's good.
-Right?

1154
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,810
-It's like potato soup.
-It's like potato soup.

1155
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,246
It tastes like potatoes,
which is my favorite.

1156
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,147
That's right.

1157
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,882
-It's so good.
-It tastes like potatoes.

1158
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,417
She really loves potatoes.

1159
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,985
WASN'T MY INTENTION, BUT I'M GLAD

1160
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,387
But it's a bit too rich for my taste.

1161
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,689
Does it taste rich?

1162
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,558
Yes, how can this not taste rich?

1163
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,027
It's because
she's the first-gen <i>mukbang</i> creator.

1164
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,862
-Hatnim's tougher.
-Yes, she's just tougher.

1165
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,131
She's tough with rich and greasy food.

1166
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,333
It's so good.

1167
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,234
She's finishing it.

1168
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,570
ANOTHER HUGE BITE

1169
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,939
-She finished everything so quickly.
-I can't believe it.

1170
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,742
I noticed something really nice
as I continued to eat.

1171
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,144
Every flavor is strong in this dish,
including truffles,

1172
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,846
the sauce, and the sesame oil.

1173
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:39,783
But in the end, I'm only left
with the flavor of the meat.

1174
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,352
ONLY THE MEAT FLAVOR REMAINS

1175
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,786
-You're an amazing chef.
-Very good.

1176
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,889
Tzuyang finished everything.

1177
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,993
-Next, Chef Ho-young's dish.
-Is this all grease?

1178
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,495
I'll try the duck first.

1179
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,365
-Try some.
-She tries the duck first.

1180
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,838
It's not so bad, right?
It's not too greasy.

1181
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,806
It's not greasy.

1182
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,575
She doesn't find it greasy.

1183
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,043
-The cheese?
-Wait, it's greasy.

1184
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,079
See? It is greasy.

1185
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,616
At first, the richness gets hidden
because of the sweetness,

1186
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,551
then it hits you later.

1187
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,020
And so…

1188
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,955
Yes, it's overly rich.

1189
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,425
It seems like
Hatnim has no limits for greasiness.

1190
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,962
That cheese was supposed to be a dip.
She's taking a scoop of it.

1191
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,865
It'll be too rich.

1192
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,169
-It's a lump of greasiness.
-It must be tough to eat.

1193
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,671
The alcohol.

1194
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,508
-Wow, the alcohol.
-Yes, the grape-flavored alcohol.

1195
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,777
I noticed the richness,

1196
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,612
but toward the end…

1197
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,247
-The alcohol.
-…the alcohol catches up.

1198
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,549
-It catches up to you.
-The highball?

1199
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,752
It felt like I was having a drink.

1200
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,254
Should he not have used it?

1201
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,690
I wonder what it would've been like…

1202
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,758
BITTER

1203
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,327
She wants to know
what it would've been like without it.

1204
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:58,862
She's so nice with her words.

1205
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,164
-How nice.
-She's so nice.

1206
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,566
She checks the dishes one last time.

1207
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,902
-She's into the cucumber salad.
-Yes.

1208
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,404
-This is addictive.
-She's into the salad.

1209
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,405
All right, now.

1210
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:11,141
<i>Press one to choose Yoon Nam-no.</i>

1211
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,342
<i>And two for Jung Ho-young.</i>

1212
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,280
Please make your decision
and press the button!

1213
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,181
Okay.

1214
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,882
-Did you choose one?
-I did.

1215
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,751
Let's find out the result.

1216
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,754
Which one of the two did Hatnim choose?

1217
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,990
Chef Ho-young
has been stuck on the ninth win,

1218
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,826
and he's yet to take his tenth victory.

1219
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,928
-He's stuck there.
-He has lost twice in a row.

1220
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,964
Will Nam-no stall him once again?

1221
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,568
So Rich That It Feels Almost Wrong.

1222
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,069
Who did she choose?

1223
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,805
Show us the winner!

1224
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,341
Which one was richer?

1225
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,776
It was Yoon Nam-no's dish!

1226
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,245
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S
RICHNESS FROM MAJANG

1227
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,980
Yoon Nam-no wins!

1228
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,016
Ho-young gets stalled once again.

1229
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,985
This is his third loss in a row.

1230
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,687
It's not easy to take his tenth win.

1231
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,489
What was the key difference?

1232
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,324
The cucumber salad was delicious,

1233
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,459
and this meat was perfect for my appetite.

1234
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,694
-But the grape?
-The grape.

1235
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,131
-It was the grape.
-The highball?

1236
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,999
OH, NO…

1237
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,636
And when I had Chef Nam-no's dish,

1238
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,573
I liked it, even though
I never liked ground meat.

1239
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,877
It's something else
to make someone like what they don't.

1240
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,280
But I want to thank both of you.
I enjoyed both dishes.

1241
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,915
That sounds wonderful.

1242
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,886
Hatnim decided to give the star
to Chef Nam-no!

1243
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,055
-Congratulations.
-Thank you for the food.

1244
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,891
Congratulations, Chef Nam-no!

1245
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,726
-And the fish.
-Yes, right.

1246
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:37,694
AND THE SPECIAL PRIZE

1247
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,862
Nam-no!

1248
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,665
BEFORE THE SECOND ROUND

1249
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,834
Do you still not feel full at all?

1250
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,271
-When I eat this slowly, I never get full.
-Can you keep eating?

1251
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,172
Isn't that so?

1252
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,173
I KNEW THAT'D BE THE CASE

1253
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,142
Are you eating <i>ramyeon?</i> I'm jealous.

1254
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,243
A cup <i>ramyeon?</i> Why?

1255
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,378
Are you going to eat it?

1256
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,880
I'm not eating it. I'm rinsing my mouth.

1257
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,150
-She should rinse out her mouth.
-That's why.

1258
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,052
Please don't take this the wrong way.

1259
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,521
She's rinsing her mouth.
It's not that she wants <i>ramyeon.</i>

1260
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,023
-She makes it look so good.
-A refreshment.

1261
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,825
It must cost a lot to rinse her mouth.

1262
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,295
GULP

1263
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,229
Gosh.

1264
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,097
It looks like Tzuyang wants some too.

1265
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,034
-She wants to rinse her mouth too!
-So?

1266
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,503
-May I get some kimchi?
-She's the fridge owner.

1267
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,604
Yes, sure.

1268
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,107
-You had <i>seokbakji.</i>
-She just rinsed out her mouth.

1269
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,409
She's the first guest

1270
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,778
to rinse out her mouth
before the second round.

1271
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,413
-She's so prepared.
-She's the first one.

1272
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,983
I guess no one is using <i>seokbakji</i>
as the ingredient.

1273
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,352
You have to eat it as is
for it to be tasty.

1274
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,920
-It looks good.
-Should I plate some out?

1275
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,356
You can put it on this dish.

1276
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,525
-Are you sure you didn't want some?
-I did.

1277
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,127
It's driving me crazy.
My mouth is watering.

1278
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,395
You're craving some.

1279
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,930
-I am.
-It looks milky-white.

1280
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,301
-Why are you using my fork?
-Well, it's…

1281
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,770
-He wants to grab a lot.
-It looks refreshing.

1282
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,906
-I wonder what it's like.
-It looks so refreshing.

1283
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,841
-It smelled so good before.
-Where's the dish?

1284
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,142
It doesn't use a lot of ingredients.

1285
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,544
SOMETHING JUST PASSED BY

1286
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,979
CRUNCH

1287
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,213
MMM!

1288
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,314
YUM

1289
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,652
THEY CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE

1290
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,220
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1291
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,089
I've never seen anything like this.

1292
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,390
It's so good.

1293
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,892
-It's fantastic.
-My gosh!

1294
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,693
That's what I call <i>mukbang.</i>

1295
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,229
-Is anybody using <i>seokbakji?</i>
-No.

1296
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,999
-Someone might need it.
-Just serve it on the side.

1297
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,133
MMM!

1298
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,502
-I want to rinse my mouth too.
-Should we do that?

1299
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,337
It goes really well with <i>ramyeon</i>-rinsing<i>.</i>

1300
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,238
You may begin.

1301
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,374
It hasn't matured completely,
but it's still delicious.

1302
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,441
EVERYONE IS ADDICTED

1303
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,409
It doesn't taste sour.

1304
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,444
-It's refreshing.
-I've never had anything like it.

1305
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,513
-It's really refreshing.
-It's so refreshing.

1306
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,215
It tastes perfect.

1307
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,017
That <i>ramyeon</i> looks even better.

1308
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,785
THE WAY SHE RINSES HER MOUTH
SEEMS EVEN BETTER

1309
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,820
She rinses her mouth so deliciously.

1310
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,389
-Now that's <i>mukbang.</i>
-My mouth is watering.

1311
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,591
She's rinsing out
every corner of her mouth.

1312
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,526
SHE'S READY TO EAT NEW DISHES

1313
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:54,331
<i>We're about to begin the second round</i>
<i>played with Hatnim's ingredients.</i>

1314
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,966
The Successful Maniac,

1315
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,001
Chef Park Eun-yeong, aka Suc-Man.

1316
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,737
-The Well-Aged Maniac.
-"Well-Aged"?

1317
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,640
Chef Choi Hyun-suk, aka Aged-Man.

1318
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,442
-They're both maniacs.
-Yes.

1319
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,011
I'll just be the Crazy Chef.

1320
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,713
I'll go crazy for our guests

1321
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,881
and for cooking.

1322
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,182
-I'm the Crazy Chef.
-He's mad.

1323
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,684
He surely is a maniac.

1324
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,386
-I think you're right. You are.
-Right?

1325
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,689
Chef Eun-yeong is on a roll these days.

1326
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:22,526
<i>First, she won against Chef Chinglai,</i>
<i>a man whom she thinks of like a father,</i>

1327
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,995
<i>then she taught Sung-jun,</i>
<i>our youngest chef, a lesson</i>

1328
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,130
<i>and won against him too.</i>

1329
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,800
If she wins against Chef Hyun-suk,

1330
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,568
-no one will be able to stop her.
-You're right.

1331
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,370
Someone must stop her.

1332
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,138
I think I'm at my best right now.

1333
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,873
-I've grown used to the studio…
-At her best?

1334
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,409
…so it now feels like my home
and my kitchen.

1335
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,078
There she goes again.

1336
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,045
HER CRAZY SIDE MANIFESTS

1337
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:46,083
It's been a while since we have seen
a tiny speck of humility in her.

1338
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,618
I remember something Chef Hyun-suk said.

1339
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:49,953
He once said

1340
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,356
-he really hates losing.
-You didn't want to.

1341
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,057
Do you also not want to lose today?

1342
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,293
Winning or losing isn't up to my feelings.

1343
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,962
I just do my best to cook,

1344
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,064
and the stars keep piling up.

1345
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,066
The stars keep piling up.

1346
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,901
CLEARS HER EARS WITH A SLURP

1347
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,236
I hate it when you say that.

1348
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,373
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT

1349
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,041
BOO-HOO

1350
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,478
She's not even listening
to the rest of your spiel.

1351
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,913
We heard something
that was said in the green room.

1352
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,081
A RECORDING OF HYUN-SUK

1353
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,717
He didn't even call her Chef Eun-yeong.
"Eun-yeong, that girl."

1354
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,587
"Eun-yeong, that girl."

1355
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,857
"That chef is more invested in
doing well on TV instead of cooking."

1356
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,191
Oh, my god!

1357
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,193
-He said that.
-She's more invested in the show!

1358
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,595
-He's right.
-"Eun-yeong, that girl."

1359
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,897
You can't add things I didn't say.

1360
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,399
But you said it.

1361
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,700
"Eun-yeong, that girl"?

1362
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,137
I wouldn't say that.

1363
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,205
I always use honorifics with everyone.

1364
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,041
-"Chef Eun-yeong…
-Chef Eun-yeong?

1365
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,443
…seems to come prepared
to add fun to the show."

1366
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,611
I said that

1367
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,781
because it makes the show
even more interesting.

1368
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,883
Did you call her
"the female Sung-jun" or not?

1369
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,384
-Or not?
-What?

1370
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,953
-That's the worst thing I heard all year.
-I feel offended.

1371
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,522
This is the worst.

1372
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,623
-It's the worst.
-They're mad.

1373
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:00,757
BOTH ARE DISPLEASED

1374
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,959
Eun-yeong gets mad
after being compared to Sung-jun.

1375
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:03,927
The female Sung-jun.

1376
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:04,928
ATTACKED 2 AT ONCE

1377
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,197
-I can deal with everything but that.
-It's my loss.

1378
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,833
THE SUC-MAN WON'T PUT UP WITH IT

1379
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,368
Sung-jun was offended too.

1380
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,403
A poison dart.

1381
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,339
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:
DRUMSTICKS, STICKY RICE

1382
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,408
MEDICINAL HERBS FOR BAEKSUK,
EMPEROR MUSHROOM, CABBAGE, AND MORE

1383
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,342
You must make something

1384
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,212
-she won't get bored with eating.
-Something not boring.

1385
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,082
The name of my dish is Never-Boring Jolie.

1386
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,418
Oh, gosh.

1387
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,986
Never-Boring Jolie?

1388
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:35,525
I prepared a dish Hatnim can
continue to eat without getting bored.

1389
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,761
I'll make a <i>jeongol,</i> hot pot,
with chicken.

1390
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,630
Later, you can add pesto and sticky rice

1391
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:44,000
to turn it into something like risotto

1392
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,203
-with a richer flavor.
-Risotto with sticky rice?

1393
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,004
I prepared my personal pesto.

1394
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:48,905
Your personal one?

1395
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,607
Did you prepare your personal creation?

1396
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:51,842
I'll make my personal pesto

1397
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,077
and take my personal star today.

1398
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,846
-All right.
-What's with her?

1399
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,013
This is her personal recipe.

1400
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,249
-She sounds crazy for airtime.
-Right.

1401
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,185
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS:
MANGO MELON, RIBEYE, RICOTTA

1402
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,254
EMMENTAL, PARMESAN, BREAD,
BAY SALT, MAPLE SYRUP, AND MORE

1403
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,156
Here's the name of my dish.

1404
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,458
Korean Melon

1405
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,359
Ch-lonely.

1406
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,261
-Korean Melon, How Lonely.
-Korean Melon, How Lonely.

1407
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,730
-You'll use the mango melons?
-I see.

1408
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,732
She said she loved mango melons,

1409
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,270
so I'll make mango melon gazpacho
with truffle cream cheese in the middle.

1410
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,638
At first,

1411
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,608
it'll smell like mango melon,
then it'll change into truffles.

1412
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,511
She says she wants layers of flavors.

1413
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,280
I'll also make steak

1414
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,283
with five different toppings.

1415
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,220
It's also the depiction of my life

1416
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,955
as a lonely genius

1417
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,158
who must create something new in solitude.

1418
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,093
You're just lonely
because your daughter got married.

1419
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,661
CHOI HYUN-SUK CRIES
AT HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING

1420
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,230
-You must be quite lonely.
-I'm sorry, but you're just lonely.

1421
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,132
-Yes.
-He's sitting at home alone.

1422
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,201
-His journey feels so lonely.
-So lonely.

1423
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,570
Ever since the cameras began to roll,

1424
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,272
you two have only been after me.

1425
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,874
-You're in first place.
-That's what happens.

1426
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,142
It's lonely to be at the top.

1427
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,243
The weight of the crown.

1428
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,478
I'll let you trample on me.

1429
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:02,913
Because I'll still win a star

1430
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,481
and shine brightly in confidence.

1431
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,383
That was so cool.

1432
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,151
Find a new celebration, will you?

1433
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,619
Stop doing this martial arts thing.

1434
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,922
You should switch it up.

1435
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,090
All right.

1436
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,727
Let us begin the next round,
A Dish Even Hatnim Won't Get Bored With.

1437
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:22,332
She's here to make Hyun-suk
feel fed up with her today.

1438
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:25,335
The Successful Maniac,
Chef Park Eun-yeong.

1439
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,272
People may be fed up with him,
but never with his dishes.

1440
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,776
The Well-Aged Maniac, Chef Choi Hyun-suk

1441
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:37,047
Which one of the two chefs
will make Hatnim clean out her dish?

1442
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:40,050
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1443
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,253
GOOD LUCK, MANIACS!

1444
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,523
Two chefs on the rise
are against each other.

1445
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,258
She hates that she's like me,
yet she makes risotto.

1446
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:49,426
CHUCKLES

1447
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,161
-I won't emulsify it, though.
-Okay.

1448
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,262
HOT WATER INTO STICKY RICE

1449
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,630
Is that hot water?

1450
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,265
She's blanching it with hot water.

1451
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,900
I'm going to make rice.

1452
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,168
You're making rice?

1453
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,171
-It's not risotto. It's just rice.
-You'll make risotto from scratch?

1454
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,806
She can enjoy it like porridge.

1455
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:03,840
It'll be runny.

1456
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,975
That's just watery rice.

1457
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,710
That's not risotto.

1458
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,845
-It's just wet rice.
-He's good at teasing her.

1459
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:10,814
He has begun.

1460
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,349
SO OVER IT

1461
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,318
Chef Hyun-suk grabs mango melons
as we speak.

1462
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,219
He's using them.

1463
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,255
Yes, he's peeling the fruit.

1464
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,422
Come on.

1465
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,358
You're a chef. Use a knife.

1466
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,059
"You're a chef. Use a knife."

1467
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,128
He used to.

1468
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:29,099
-He did this.
-He can't peel it clean anymore.

1469
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,068
It came with age.
He can't help it, so please understand.

1470
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,471
HIS SHOULDERS LOOK SO DAINTY

1471
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,505
NOT YOUNG AND PASSIONATE ANYMORE

1472
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,609
-He isn't as dexterous as he used to be.
-Of course not.

1473
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:40,543
It's unfortunate.

1474
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,579
-He probably hadn't done it in a while.
-No.

1475
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,448
-It's still not peeled properly.
-It's not.

1476
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,417
HERE, GO AHEAD AND BITE ME!

1477
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,887
He can't even tell if it's peeled or not.

1478
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,189
He's using lots of mango melons.

1479
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,424
Be careful.

1480
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,159
Is that mushroom?

1481
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,327
Yes, it is.

1482
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,562
-Emperor mushroom.
-Emperor mushroom.

1483
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,730
Time is flying.

1484
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,432
-It's a huge mushroom.
-It is.

1485
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,502
Jeez, I lost so much time doing this.

1486
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,103
It took him two minutes
to peel the melons.

1487
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:08,838
He lost some time.

1488
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:10,273
It takes me only a minute.

1489
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,376
You were very quick earlier.

1490
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,678
I can do it very quickly.

1491
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,879
I've always been good at it.

1492
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,614
He's now removing the seeds.

1493
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,716
-He's scraping out the seeds.
-He's not using them.

1494
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,284
He's removing the melon seeds.

1495
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,921
-He removes the seeds.
-He's making gazpacho, a cold soup.

1496
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,857
2. BLEND MANGO MELONS WITH ICE

1497
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,993
I'm seeing some meat. Is that chicken?

1498
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:31,961
-It is.
-It's chicken.

1499
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,664
-Drumsticks.
-Boneless drumsticks

1500
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,665
-and mushrooms.
-Mushrooms.

1501
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,802
She said her dish would taste like
spicy chicken soup.

1502
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,270
He's using salt.

1503
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,404
WHY SO SERIOUS?

1504
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,073
You're getting salt in my food!

1505
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,708
He's using salt.

1506
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:45,642
RIGHT ON TARGET!

1507
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,478
It's all stuck together.

1508
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,547
So he rubs it right away.

1509
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,150
He realized it was too much,
so he rubbed off the excess.

1510
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,220
Hyun-suk seasons the meat.

1511
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,489
He uses some ground black pepper too.

1512
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,958
That's ribeye he's working with.

1513
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,693
It's so good when you season it with salt.

1514
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,662
THAT'S NOT HOW I SALT MY FOOD!

1515
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,630
WOW

1516
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,065
NEVER GETS OLD

1517
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,500
3. GRILL SEASONED RIBEYE

1518
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:15,238
Hyun-suk uses the good salt
because Hatnim has a lot of it.

1519
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,873
The chicken looks delicious.

1520
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,109
I WON'T LOSE!
SNIGGERING

1521
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,277
SHE SAVES HERSELF WITH A FIRE SHOW!

1522
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:26,416
THE MANIAC WHO BECAME A SUCCESS
BEGINS TO CHOP

1523
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,718
ONION, GREEN ONION, NAPA CABBAGE

1524
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,286
EVERYTHING GOES IN WITH CRUSHED GARLIC

1525
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,721
4. STIR-FRY WITH RED PEPPER POWDER

1526
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,124
Eun-yeong is going spicy.

1527
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,726
But Hatnim doesn't like spicy food.

1528
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,628
No, I'm not so good with it.

1529
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,399
She's stir-frying napa cabbage
with red pepper powder.

1530
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,769
-She'll probably add the chicken to that.
-I see.

1531
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,338
ADDING FRAGRANT
MEDICINAL HERB BROTH

1532
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,340
MANGO MELONS

1533
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,609
EXCELLENT!

1534
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,044
-He's blending the melons very smooth.
-He blended the melons.

1535
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,414
He blended the mango melons.

1536
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,815
Is that maple syrup?

1537
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,785
-Maple syrup?
-Cream cheese, milk, and maple syrup.

1538
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,420
What's that?

1539
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,889
-Truffle sauce.
-He's using a lot of sauce.

1540
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,857
That's the truffle cream cheese
he mentioned.

1541
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,759
Is he blending everything with milk?

1542
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,994
He's blending it again.

1543
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,998
TIME TO FLIP THE MEAT

1544
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,833
But the meat…

1545
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,168
The meat…

1546
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,904
Oh, no! Why can't you flip them?

1547
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,706
-He can't flip them.
-He finally did it.

1548
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,675
-He couldn't do it.
-It wouldn't flip at once.

1549
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,777
-He has no energy to do that.
-Oh, no.

1550
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,913
-How sad.
-I'm about to cry.

1551
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,749
Jeez, Hyun-suk, my man.

1552
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,852
Those 15 stars are stars of tears.

1553
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,887
Squeeze it!

1554
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,122
Squeeze it!

1555
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,657
The melon.

1556
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,258
-That's lime.
-Lime.

1557
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,593
-That's lime.
-Lime.

1558
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,894
AND HE TEASED HYUN-SUK JUST NOW

1559
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,196
FAILING VISION

1560
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,897
-They're the same age.
-They are.

1561
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,798
That's why.

1562
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,767
-He adds lime juice.
-Lime.

1563
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,569
-It looks good.
-Mango melon and lime juice.

1564
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,736
That sounds delicious.

1565
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,071
AGAIN, TIME FOR SALT!

1566
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:55,972
He's on it!

1567
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,474
ARE YOU FED UP WITH ME?

1568
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,609
Everything spilled on the floor.

1569
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,277
NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF ME!

1570
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,146
Is he doing a dunk shot or what?

1571
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,714
-A dunk shot.
-He jumps in anger.

1572
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,082
That was a powerful shot.

1573
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,918
Hyun-suk proves
that he still got his game.

1574
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,386
He still got his game.

1575
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,856
Squeeze it!

1576
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,357
-The melon.
-That's lime.

1577
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,692
By any chance…

1578
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,327
-Never mind.
-You can have some.

1579
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,661
-May I?
-Yes.

1580
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,897
-Tzuyang needs her drinks.
-What is it?

1581
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,999
She was craving a beverage.

1582
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,400
It was about time.

1583
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,903
Eun-yeong takes the chicken off the pan.

1584
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,972
DELICIOUSLY GOLDEN BROWN

1585
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,106
It looks good.

1586
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,608
Can I have one too?

1587
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,343
-Pick anything you want.
-Really?

1588
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,844
This place is paradise.

1589
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,848
-You really love to eat.
-Thank you.

1590
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:41,017
WHAT'S TZUYANG DRINKING?

1591
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,652
He still got his game.

1592
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,587
Wait, are you really drinking

1593
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,989
that broth?

1594
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:47,957
You really do that?

1595
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,392
I love it and enjoy it.

1596
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,761
-Bone broth?
-Don't pay attention to me.

1597
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:52,929
She's drinking bone broth.

1598
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,966
As we speak,
Tzuyang began to drink broth like juice.

1599
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,836
We get to see
lots of peculiar things today.

1600
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,237
NOT PAUSED

1601
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,573
-Please don't pay attention to me.
-I've never seen anyone drink this.

1602
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,144
We used to drink just the bone broth
when we'd break a bone.

1603
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,279
It's actually <i>naengmyeon</i> broth.

1604
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,447
<i>-Naengmyeon</i> broth?
<i>-Naengmyeon?</i>

1605
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,117
-That's her mouthwash.
-It is.

1606
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,953
Wait, the chicken…

1607
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,087
It's fine if it's undercooked.

1608
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,622
It'll be boiled later anyway.

1609
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,057
So it was intentional?

1610
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,993
6. MAKE CHICKEN JEONGOL

1611
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,894
(MEDICINAL HERB BROTH)

1612
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,430
BOIL BONELESS DRUMSTICKS
AND MUSHROOM IN BROTH

1613
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:32,669
Hyun-suk cuts bread into small pieces.

1614
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,904
-He's making croutons.
-Croutons?

1615
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,307
OLIVES

1616
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,176
6. DEEP-FRY MINCED OLIVES

1617
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,179
What's in the yellow pot?

1618
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,747
The one boiling in front of Hyun-suk.

1619
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,349
GETS UP CASUALLY TO CHECK

1620
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,817
The yellow pot? It's oil.

1621
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,153
-Oil?
-He's going to fry bread in it.

1622
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,988
-Bread?
-It's to make croutons.

1623
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,157
Poong has won a few stars now,

1624
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,193
so he started to talk down to everyone.

1625
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,329
Come to think of it, I'm older.

1626
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:03,099
But it's all about the stars here.
I'm currently in second place.

1627
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,000
Yes.

1628
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,735
It was funnier that he did as he asked.

1629
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,004
Dang it. I need more stars.

1630
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,772
He checked, and said, "It's oil."

1631
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,908
RUSTLING

1632
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,244
What's she breaking right now?
Seaweed chips<i>?</i>

1633
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,779
-Seaweed <i>bugak?</i>
-Seaweed <i>bugak.</i>

1634
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,081
I think she'll grind it.

1635
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,816
-I see.
-That <i>bugak</i> is delicious.

1636
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,517
Chef Jong-won made this.

1637
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:22,952
-Really?
-Yes, he made it.

1638
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,455
It's made of shrimp and laver, actually<i>.</i>

1639
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,323
-It's really good.
-It really is.

1640
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,558
It's really good.

1641
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,692
You had it?

1642
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,828
Yes, I bought it.

1643
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,731
-I see. She's using <i>bugak.</i>
-Garlic?

1644
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,299
MACADAMIA NUTS, GARLIC

1645
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:39,335
7. GRIND SEAWEED BUGAK, MACADAMIA NUTS,
GARLIC, AND PERILLA OIL TO MAKE PESTO

1646
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,770
What are you grinding?

1647
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:44,574
I'm making pesto with seaweed <i>bugak,</i>
macadamia nuts, and perilla oil.

1648
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,011
-Macadamia nuts and perilla oil.
-That sounds delicious.

1649
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,445
Seaweed pesto. Wow.

1650
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:50,713
It's her personal pesto.

1651
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,315
-It's my personal pesto.
-Personal pesto.

1652
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,417
THE STEAKS ARE GRILLED

1653
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,887
Are the steaks overcooked? Is that okay?

1654
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,889
-He's always good with steaks.
-He is.

1655
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,924
-Where's my knife?
-What?

1656
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,893
-My knife.
-Have faith in him.

1657
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,828
-Aren't they overcooked?
-Where is it?

1658
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,031
-He won't tell me what he needs.
-My knife.

1659
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,198
Say it!

1660
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,034
-My knife. It's here.
-Just ask for it!

1661
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,237
If you can't find it,
just ask for help! Jeez!

1662
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,406
-He wasn't like this before.
-"My knife."

1663
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,442
-"My knife. Where's my knife?"
-He wasn't like this.

1664
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,278
-He couldn't find his knife.
-I suddenly feel sad.

1665
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,147
It's like looking for your phone
when it's in your hand.

1666
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,748
-Oh, no.
-It's just like that.

1667
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,116
OH, NO

1668
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,185
-Chef Hyun-suk cuts the steak.
-It's cooked nicely.

1669
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,853
NOTICES HER

1670
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,889
What are you drinking?

1671
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,090
Please don't pay attention.

1672
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,694
-Tzuyang chugs apple juice.
-Gosh, please. It's embarrassing.

1673
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,363
She must crave something
just by watching them cook.

1674
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,198
-I had nothing to eat.
-Right.

1675
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,800
She had nothing to eat.

1676
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,636
OLIVE OIL

1677
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,970
DOENJANG

1678
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,606
7. MIX OLIVE OIL AND DOENJANG
TO MAKE DOENJANG SAUCE

1679
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,177
STEAK 1: DOENJANG SAUCE

1680
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,946
<i>Doenjang.</i> Olives.

1681
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,414
I see, like that?

1682
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,683
He's making
five different flavors of steak.

1683
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,552
STEAK 2: FRIED OLIVES AND CROUTONS

1684
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:03,720
Four minutes left!

1685
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,888
-Report from the kitchen, Jung-hwan!
-Yes!

1686
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:09,258
I almost forgot to do it
while watching Tzuyang drink juice.

1687
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,195
-This doesn't look too spicy.
-This isn't ready.

1688
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,197
Hatnim doesn't like spicy food.

1689
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,100
WHAT'S THE RED SAUCE?

1690
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,202
She mixed pesto with <i>chogochujang</i>.

1691
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,436
Seaweed pesto and <i>chogochujang.</i>

1692
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:21,370
What?

1693
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,939
I added seaweed pesto.

1694
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:23,873
MIX WITH VINEGAR, PERILLA OIL

1695
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,241
ONE MORE SAUCE!

1696
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,609
SEAWEED PESTO

1697
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,346
9. MIX SEAWEED PESTO,
BASIL PESTO, AND PERILLA OIL

1698
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,716
2 SAUCES ARE READY TO GO!

1699
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,318
Balsamic vinegar.

1700
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,686
BALSAMIC VINEGAR

1701
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,721
Is that grape ice cream?

1702
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,156
The ice pop.

1703
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,290
Instead of wine.

1704
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,458
He's cooking with ice cream.

1705
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,894
9. BOIL BALSAMIC VINEGAR,
GRAPE ICE CREAM, AND BUTTER

1706
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,796
Eun-yeong adds more oil.

1707
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,432
-He's on it.
-How did he come up with that?

1708
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,768
That's not a bad idea.

1709
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,469
What are you looking for now?

1710
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,404
-Wait.
-Wait for what?

1711
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,540
-He keeps stuttering.
-What do you need?

1712
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,542
-What do you need?
-He's making me cry.

1713
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,612
-You have to make the sauce.
-He doesn't know what he's looking for!

1714
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,013
MANGO MELON GAZPACHO

1715
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,682
What do you need?
You need to add something.

1716
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,917
-The time.
-There's not much time.

1717
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,719
You have 2 minutes and 40 seconds.

1718
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,223
-He stopped.
-He keeps stuttering while he cooks.

1719
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,725
-Oh, no.
-I'm about to cry.

1720
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,161
He can't even stand upright.

1721
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,630
-He's about to slip. What's that?
-Two minutes and a half.

1722
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,166
-What's that? Are you done?
-He's serving it.

1723
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,134
10. POUR THE GAZPACHO
OVER TRUFFLE CREAM CHEESE

1724
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,005
FINISHING WITH OLIVE OIL

1725
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,340
HE STILL HAS
THREE MORE STEAKS TO GO!

1726
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,476
Tomato sauce.

1727
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,279
RICOTTA CHEESE

1728
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,916
I think he's making the Italian flag.

1729
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,018
-You're right.
-Just like that?

1730
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,619
-Red, white, green.
-You're right.

1731
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,154
That's the Italian flag.

1732
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,790
-Hyun-suk's dish looks detailed.
-Yes.

1733
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,725
Two minutes.

1734
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,160
You have two minutes left.

1735
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,496
-Is everything going well, Eun-yeong?
-Yes.

1736
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,565
She's done with the sauces too.

1737
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,900
This rice is the problem.
I hope it isn't burnt.

1738
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,602
-It's done.
-It is?

1739
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,603
-It's not burnt?
-It's not.

1740
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,371
-Is the rice done?
-I think it might be burnt.

1741
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:03,840
Butter.

1742
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,675
Throw some butter on it.

1743
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:07,677
The last one. The last sauce.

1744
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,213
-The tweezers. It must be hot.
-It's still hot.

1745
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,515
STEAK 4: GRAPE BALSAMIC SAUCE

1746
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,384
Jung-hwan, will you try
a steak piece he won't use?

1747
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,220
-Should I?
-Yes, see if it's cooked well.

1748
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,622
-Let me try it with the sauce.
-I hope it's cooked well.

1749
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,090
-This one.
-Yes.

1750
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,993
Hyun-suk's steak.

1751
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,128
So? Does it taste lonesome?

1752
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,264
Or does it taste abundant?

1753
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,066
It's not lonesome.

1754
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,435
It's not lonesome!
Hyun-suk delivers again.

1755
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,770
-The meat is perfect.
-I see.

1756
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,672
-What's that? Bread?
-Cheese.

1757
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,541
-Emmental and parmesan.
-Emmental and parmesan.

1758
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,043
-You have a minute left!
-One minute!

1759
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,212
The rice is ready.

1760
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,314
-Eun-yeong's rice!
-It's cooked well.

1761
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,551
-Is it okay? Is it burnt?
-It turned out well. Not burnt.

1762
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,820
-You said you'd make risotto.
-It's not burnt.

1763
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,321
What about the risotto?

1764
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,523
-She changed her mind.
-It's just rice.

1765
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,659
No, I said it'd be Korean-style risotto.

1766
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,628
But that's not risotto.

1767
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,097
Risotto is just rice in broth.

1768
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,431
No.

1769
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,066
-It's just watery rice.
-It's not.

1770
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,902
-That's rice.
-How is that risotto?

1771
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:06,869
THE RISOTTO(?) IS READY

1772
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:09,105
-She just made rice.
-It's just rice.

1773
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:10,973
-It's just watery rice.
-Thirty seconds.

1774
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,341
Get back to your seat.

1775
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,576
How is that risotto?

1776
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,811
In that case,
I had the wrong idea of risotto!

1777
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,980
STEAK 5: CHEESE SAUCE

1778
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,749
That is so not risotto!

1779
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,083
Hyun-suk is done.

1780
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,153
-Hyun-suk is done. Ten seconds.
-Ten seconds.

1781
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,188
EUN-YEONG SERVES THE FINAL DISH

1782
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,590
It's the last one.

1783
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,292
APPETIZING JEONGOL
IN AN EARTHEN POT

1784
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,459
It's seriously just rice.

1785
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,494
It's not.

1786
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,462
She just made rice.

1787
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,398
Chef Eun-yeong finishes too.

1788
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,400
-Gosh, that Suc-Man.
-Eun-yeong shot more poison darts.

1789
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,168
It's tough to make risotto rice.

1790
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,270
A SUDDEN CONFESSION

1791
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,805
It was your first time, right?

1792
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,976
And now, both dishes were made

1793
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:51,747
to let Hatnim continue eating
without getting bored with it. Okay.

1794
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:55,017
It seemed like you both had a rough round.

1795
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,953
Especially so for Chef Hyun-suk.

1796
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:01,490
He was going to use seaweed <i>bugak</i>
to make his dish,

1797
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,126
-but it didn't fit.
-If it was regular <i>bugak,</i>

1798
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,896
I would've used that
with sesame and perilla oil.

1799
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,598
But the product included shellfish,

1800
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,334
and I didn't think
it'd go well with the steak.

1801
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,803
-So I changed the recipe midway.
-To cheese.

1802
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,806
But later, I somehow forgot about
what I was supposed to do

1803
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,107
with the middle piece.

1804
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,309
<i>That was why I got thrown off.</i>

1805
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,411
We had no idea.

1806
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,312
I'm all right.

1807
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:24,981
You can feast on my flesh

1808
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,816
until I'm only left with bones.

1809
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,285
As long as I can finish the dish
and serve it to Hatnim,

1810
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,753
I'm fine with it.

1811
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,522
-He claps for himself.
-He's clapping.

1812
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,424
TRUE SACRIFICING MENTALITY

1813
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,828
First, please try Chef Hyun-suk's dish,
Korean Melon, How Lonely.

1814
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,930
MANGO MELON GAZPACHO

1815
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,899
AND FIVE FLAVORS OF STEAK

1816
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,136
DEEP-FRIED OLIVE AND CROUTON

1817
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:49,805
TOMATO SAUCE, RICOTTA, ARUGULA PESTO

1818
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,041
CHEESE SAUCE

1819
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,709
DOENJANG SAUCE

1820
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,078
GRAPE AND BALSAMIC SAUCE

1821
01:06:56,145 --> 01:07:00,616
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
KOREAN MELON, HOW LONELY

1822
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,451
Thank you.

1823
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:06,122
Try the soup first as an appetizer
and then go for the steak.

1824
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,423
Dip your spoon

1825
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,226
in the cream cheese a little bit,
then scoop up the soup.

1826
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,727
With that spoon,

1827
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,796
the soup will be gone in a few scoops.

1828
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,798
Four scoops, I say.

1829
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,466
With that spoon,

1830
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,403
the soup will be gone
after about two trips.

1831
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:21,704
That's made with mango melons, right?

1832
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:25,808
Yes, it's made with mango melons,
but she'll taste truffle toward the end.

1833
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,112
-Wow.
-Did it make you go wow?

1834
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:31,947
Wow.

1835
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,517
At first,

1836
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,920
you can taste the sweet, cool mango melon.

1837
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,223
After that,
the buttery cream cheese kicks in.

1838
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,759
Then it finishes off with truffles.

1839
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,194
PRECISELY

1840
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,630
It came in different levels
just as you said.

1841
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:51,734
She looks surprised.
She picks up the bowl to continue eating.

1842
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,103
-It's like <i>gukbap.</i>
-Yes, she eats it like it's <i>gukbap</i>.

1843
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:56,572
Yes.

1844
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,676
DRINKS A BEVERAGE AS SHE WATCHES

1845
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,345
It's a mix of sweetness and saltiness.

1846
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,947
You're right.

1847
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:08,651
Everyone criticized me for adding salt.

1848
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,420
But despite such criticisms
and my frozen shoulders,

1849
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,522
I had to do that to let her taste this.

1850
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,391
I had to do that to add layers.

1851
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,027
How could I not lift my arms?

1852
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,629
He returns my single remark
with ten comments.

1853
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:22,231
YES, TELL HIM

1854
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,799
He returns one remark with ten comments.

1855
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,601
SHE HITS HOME

1856
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,735
And now, the steak.

1857
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,671
That really got my appetite going.

1858
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,239
-I see.
-She's ready.

1859
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,708
-She'll begin now.
-Should she begin from the left?

1860
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,510
Yes, work your way to the right.

1861
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,879
-From the left.
-From the left.

1862
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,115
What's the topping
on the steak in the far left?

1863
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,617
<i>I deep-fried olives and breadcrumbs</i>

1864
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,953
<i>-and marinated them.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

1865
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:47,923
He grilled steak
and added five different flavors.

1866
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,626
-Mmm.
-"Mmm."

1867
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:52,528
It must be salty and delicious.

1868
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,731
She closes her eyes and savors the taste.

1869
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,433
What's it like?

1870
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,604
I could really feel the crunchiness
of the toppings.

1871
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,440
Each piece had a different flavor.

1872
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,843
One crunch on this side,
I could taste the olive.

1873
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,947
Another crunch on this side,
I could taste the toasty bread.

1874
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:16,085
And then the juicy steak
brought everything together in harmony.

1875
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,020
Every bite had a different flavor.

1876
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,156
-Each time you chewed?
-Yes.

1877
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:24,960
That's the most Italian steak,
made with cheese, tomato, and pesto.

1878
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,863
-It looks good.
-That's the second steak.

1879
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,967
What's it like?

1880
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:34,570
It tastes like I'm eating a meat pizza.

1881
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,373
-Meat pizza? Gotcha.
-Yes.

1882
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,575
-Is this just mozzarella cheese?
-Cheese?

1883
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,776
<i>It's Emmental.</i>

1884
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,612
<i>-It's a mix of Emmental and parmesan.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

1885
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,015
-The third one.
-He wanted to use seaweed chips

1886
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:47,183
but had to change his plans.

1887
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,685
He had a bit of trouble here.

1888
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,721
I hope he gets enough points
for this one too.

1889
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,390
He used cheese instead of seaweed chips.

1890
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,559
-It's… It hardened a little.
-I think she'll like it.

1891
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,260
THE CHEESE HARDENED A LITTLE

1892
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,297
The cheese must've gone cold
because I talked too much.

1893
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,399
It would've been tender
if you only said two comments.

1894
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,768
-It was his fault.
-Can't be helped.

1895
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,670
He should've just used seaweed chips.

1896
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,271
-That would've worked better.
-Yes.

1897
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,172
It was Chef Jong-won's.

1898
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,675
-It has a savory shrimp flavor.
-It would've been a nice pair.

1899
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,210
-Exactly.
-He was like,

1900
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,878
"I won't let him take the spotlight."

1901
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,580
He didn't want Jong-won to stand out.

1902
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,315
-That was why he dropped it.
-No.

1903
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,416
Trample on me all you want.

1904
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,418
I'm that shameless.

1905
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,054
PFFT

1906
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,689
She almost choked on juice!

1907
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:28,190
It could've become an accident.

1908
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:29,959
AS LONG AS THE GUESTS
ARE HAVING FUN

1909
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,527
-The fourth one.
-The fourth.

1910
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,462
<i>-I made it with </i>doenjang<i> and olive oil.</i>
<i>-</i>Doenjang<i>?</i>

1911
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,497
<i>But it's not just regular </i>doenjang.

1912
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,567
When you broil it,
it smells like something else.

1913
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,002
It'll smell like something else.

1914
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,904
It won't taste like <i>doenjang</i> to you.

1915
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,706
He says it's different when you eat it.

1916
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:44,873
It's something else.

1917
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,710
-Will it not smell burnt?
-Does it taste like black bean paste?

1918
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,044
Is it something else?

1919
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:53,148
Her eyes are shaking.

1920
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,919
She's trying to find something
that doesn't smell like <i>doenjang.</i>

1921
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,087
It smells like <i>doenjang.</i>

1922
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,456
-It smells like <i>doenjang.</i>
-Wait!

1923
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,691
-It wasn't something else.
-It's just <i>doenjang.</i>

1924
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,027
-It was just <i>doenjang.</i>
-Just <i>doenjang.</i>

1925
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,630
It wasn't something else.

1926
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,265
THE 3RD AND 4TH TOPPINGS
DIDN'T DO WELL

1927
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,867
-She had four steaks so far.
-The last one.

1928
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,335
-The last one.
-The last one.

1929
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,104
I finished it off with sweet and salty.

1930
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,473
-That's the finale.
-The one with the ice cream?

1931
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:20,442
-This is important.
-He boiled down grape ice cream.

1932
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,177
SHE'S AMAZED RIGHT AWAY

1933
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:25,147
She loves that last steak.

1934
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,716
-She'll taste the sweetness at the end.
-It'll hit her at the end.

1935
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,852
You figured out the order very wisely.

1936
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,821
<i>I understand why this was the last piece.</i>

1937
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,090
The last piece is the most important.

1938
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:37,593
<i>The acidity is stronger</i>
<i>when you just use balsamic vinegar,</i>

1939
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,763
<i>-so I used ice cream to balance it out.</i>
<i>-It was a great idea.</i>

1940
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:44,033
I wanted to end the dish on a high note
with a sweet and salty flavor.

1941
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:48,103
When you're exhausted,
sweetness feels nice in your system.

1942
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,772
I can finally go on for much longer

1943
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,940
-now that you're done.
-He's at it again.

1944
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:55,077
-He's so talkative.
-Why are geniuses lonely?

1945
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,445
Even when people try to--

1946
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,880
Please try the next one.

1947
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,548
CLEANING UP QUICKLY

1948
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:00,549
This one's going to cool.

1949
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:03,352
Even Chef Jong-won? I had my faith in you.

1950
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:07,056
I'll give you a camera after the shoot,
so do it in the green room.

1951
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,892
Next, Chef Eun-yeong's dish.

1952
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,460
<i>Never-Boring Jolie.</i>

1953
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,295
START WITH LIGHT CHICKEN JEONGOL

1954
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,466
AND SWITCH INTO RISOTTO TO NEVER GET BORED

1955
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:18,801
CHOGOCHUJANG SAUCE

1956
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:24,540
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S NEVER-BORING JOLIE

1957
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,842
-Please heat it up first.
-It has to boil.

1958
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,945
It's as good as a frozen product now.

1959
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:33,749
-She'll have to boil it.
-In that case, may I add a few more words?

1960
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,385
UNSTOPPABLE

1961
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,421
My ears are about to bleed.

1962
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:40,556
PROTECTING HIS EARDRUMS

1963
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,125
LOSING HIS EARDRUMS

1964
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,426
How should she eat this?

1965
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,195
First, heat up the <i>jeongol</i>

1966
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:50,599
and enjoy the chicken and mushrooms
with the <i>chogochujang</i> sauce.

1967
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,035
Then, you'll use the seaweed sauce I made.

1968
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,137
Put that and the rice in the pot,

1969
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,772
boil it, and then have some more.

1970
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,006
BOIL BUGAK SAUCE TO MAKE RISOTTO

1971
01:12:58,073 --> 01:12:59,074
It looks good.

1972
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,976
It looks like braised chicken.

1973
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,578
It needs to boil some more.

1974
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:03,979
It's starting to boil.

1975
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,347
<i>Chogochujang</i>.

1976
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:06,815
All right.

1977
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:08,517
She tries the chicken.

1978
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,819
It looks so delicious.

1979
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,355
SO HOT

1980
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,357
Gosh, you're making me hungry.

1981
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,360
NODS OF APPROVAL

1982
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,463
The sauce is the kick.

1983
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,965
You're right.

1984
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,033
<i>I mixed </i>chogochujang<i>, perilla oil,</i>

1985
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,002
<i>vinegar, and my personal recipe,</i>

1986
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,971
-the pesto I made.
-Her personal creation.

1987
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,640
With a little help, I can make her
into a female Hyun-suk.

1988
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,644
She dips it in the sauce again.

1989
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:37,479
She has to put the rice in, right?

1990
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,081
-May I do it now?
-How much soup do you have?

1991
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,183
May I check and do it for you?

1992
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,419
-Please come and see it first.
-Yes, thank you.

1993
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:45,788
She's preparing it for her.

1994
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,490
This is just adding rice to leftover stew.

1995
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:49,858
It's not.

1996
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,161
Everything will change
once I put this into it.

1997
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,329
-It'll change with her own pesto.
-Yes, it will.

1998
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,764
-Your personal creation.
-It's mine.

1999
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,333
-And this will look like risotto?
-Try some.

2000
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,868
-May I have it?
-One moment.

2001
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,437
It's a risotto now, right?

2002
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,739
Risotto. It's Korean risotto.

2003
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,307
-Is it like risotto?
-What's it like?

2004
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:09,211
It suddenly went from Korean cuisine

2005
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,447
-to Italian cuisine a little bit.
-Really?

2006
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,549
Her personal creation!

2007
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,150
Does it smell like seafood?

2008
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,819
DOES IT TASTE LIKE ITALY TOO?

2009
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,888
-What could it taste like?
-Well?

2010
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:20,789
Risotto…

2011
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,558
RELIEVED

2012
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,693
-It has to be good. Mamma Mia.
-It must be.

2013
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,362
I didn't know
the flavor could change this drastically

2014
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,997
with just seaweed <i>bugak.</i>

2015
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,332
SEAWEED BUGAK CHANGED EVERYTHING

2016
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,403
The taste from before adding the pesto
is completely gone now.

2017
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:39,241
It definitely tastes like risotto
that's been cooked for an hour.

2018
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,009
HAPPY

2019
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,012
-And the umami of the prawns kicks in.
-It sounds good.

2020
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,716
Also, the <i>bugak</i> maintained the crunchiness
because she just put it in.

2021
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,084
-Yes.
-Al dente.

2022
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,220
Is it more like a risotto?

2023
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,788
She goes back for more.

2024
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,591
Yes, it's a mix
of many different countries.

2025
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,658
Yes.

2026
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,494
IT'S HOT BUT HARD TO RESIST

2027
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,095
-It must be hot.
-It's hot.

2028
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,563
-It's still hot.
-Yes.

2029
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,998
It's time to decide.

2030
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,333
This is so hard.

2031
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,336

Hatnim's choice.

2041
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,423
Will Eun-yeong keep rising
as she recently has shown?

2042
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,460
Or will it be Hyun-suk,
the current first place?

2043
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,229
Will he receive his 15th star?

2044
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,566
Choi Hyun-suk versus Park Eun-yeong.

2045
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,101
The choice has been made.

2046
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,136

CHOI HYUN-SUK WINS

2050
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,144
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
KOREAN MELON, HOW LONELY WINS

2051
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,846
Choi Hyun-suk wins!

2052
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,916
Choi Hyun-suk wins! He delivers.

2053
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,317
What is this?

2054
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,619
-He changed up his celebration.
-He did.

2055
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,054
He did as I asked.

2056
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,390
-Yes, his celebration.
-It's a new one.

2057
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:02,958
What was the difference?

2058
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,694
I was already smitten
after the first bite.

2059
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,696
<i>I couldn't believe it took him 15 minutes</i>

2060
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:10,365
<i>to think of these</i>
<i>and create such layers of flavors.</i>

2061
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,035
I was in awe, actually.

2062
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,136
It was already over.

2063
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,773
You may get fed up with him,
but never his dishes.

2064
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,375
Please put a star on Chef Hyun-suk!

2065
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,344
-Thank you.
-He's unstoppable!

2066
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,912
He's moving up alone.

2067
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,948
He wins against Eun-yeong
and cuts her streak.

2068
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,849
-Congratulations!
-Thank you for the food.

2069
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,153

The grilled fish gift box!

2071
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,324
<i>After 19 long years,</i>
<i>the Eagles played in the Korean series</i>

2072
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:36,692
<i>and took second place</i>
<i>in the regular season.</i>

2073
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,427
<i>The Eagles roar back</i>

2074

please welcome Choo Choo Train,

2077
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,702
During your careers in the Major League,

2078
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,870
<i>you two have played</i>
<i>against each other just once.</i>

2079
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,172
It was unforgettable.

2080
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,140
I began to wonder,
"Will he really throw a fastball?"

2081
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,542
Did you two meet after the game?

2082
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,810
Why would we do that?

2083
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,078
DROPPING THEIR OLD MAJOR LEAGUE TEA

2084
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:58,380
<i>Your team went to the Korean Series</i>
<i>two years after your return.</i>

2085
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,515
Is there something you eat
that helps you play better?

2086
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:01,483
There is.

2087
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,219
I always ate this
on the day before I had to pitch.

2088
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,587
I don't eat this.

2089
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,855
SECRETS BEHIND THE KOREAN SERIES

2090
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,458
What will you make to capture his heart?

2091
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:10,859
Look at his amazing knife skills.

2092
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,828
-Let's go!
-That's hot.

2093
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,262
It looks hot!

2094
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,131
This is nothing
compared to Hyun-jin's pain.

2095
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,900
He's immensely enjoying his dish.

2096
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,602
Your mouth doesn't seem big on the inside.

2097
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:21,603
THE MONSTER'S TINY BITE

2098
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,838
I have a tiny mouth.

2099
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,873
You're the best, Kim Poong!

2100
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,141
ENJOYING THE LIVE PERFORMANCE

2101
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,309
That looks delicious.

2102
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:28,910
Her eyes are full of determination.

2103
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,579
-Wait. This is hot.
-That's scary.

2104
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,947
Is that <i>ramyeon </i>soup base?

2105
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,116
-Who cuts it like that?
-I've never done it!

2106
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,484
WHAT IS THAT?

2107
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,718
HOWEVER…

2108
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,087
DID POONG'S MAGIC
BEWITCH THE BASEBALL LEGENDS?

2109
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,656
I just got chills.

2110
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:41,723
This is it.

2111
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,624
CHUCKLES

2112
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,660
HAHAHAHAHAHA

2113
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,028
-Is it good?
-Why is he laughing?

2114
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:46,995
It must be good.

2115
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,063
<i>Is it making you happy?</i>

2116
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,164
<i>Why is he laughing?</i>

2117
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,066
So…
