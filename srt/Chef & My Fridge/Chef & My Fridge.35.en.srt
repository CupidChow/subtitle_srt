1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,084
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,988
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,157
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,727
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,098
-It's great to see you.
-Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,035
I heard news that
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> has become

7
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,071
elementary school students' favorite show.

8
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,639
It's mainly thanks to this man.

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,042
It's Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

10
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,678
I heard he became the kids' favorite
with his poop loaches.

11
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,180
-I'm jealous.
-It's true.

12
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,416
I get lots of DMs
from elementary school kids.

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,651
-From elementary school kids?
-They call me a genius.

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,287
They tell me that they're on my side.

15
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,089
And they always make themselves known,

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,825
telling me which grade, class,
and school they attend.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,060
They always do that.

18
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,961
Anyway, unlike Poong,

19
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,798
people always root for this chef
whenever they see him.

20
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,566
-Who is it?
-Chef Sam. What's going on?

21
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,634
Grade school kids?

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,335
I guess

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,104
they pity me a little.

24
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,839
-He's in last place.
-Look at this.

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,275
-The stars? He has no stars?
-The stars.

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,744
-Kids always side with the weak.
-Yes, that's why

27
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,145
they always root for me.

28
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,682
Sometimes they even go,
"Winning and losing isn't important."

29
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,350
-They give you advice?
-Yes.

30
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,086
-What?
-Those elementary school kids?

31
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,587
Kids know everything.

32
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,590
Is Chef Jong-won
also in a similar situation?

33
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,827
After I lost to Poong,

34
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,029
I received a message from someone.

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,799
That person said, "Stay strong.
My son is crying a river for you."

36
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,835
-It can happen.
-Kids will cry.

37
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,038
-I even received a letter.
-A handwritten letter?

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,807
-Can we take a look?
-Yes, sure.

39
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,609
-Let me see.
-Let's see.

40
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,910
"To Chef Son Jong-won."

41
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,347
It's a handwritten letter
to Chef Jong-won.

42
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,482
"Hello."

43
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,383
"I'm a fan!"

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,487
"You were so cool
on <i>Chef & My Fridge, hyeong."</i>

45
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,955
-He called you a <i>hyeong.</i>
-An older friend.

46
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,289
Yes, an older guy friend.

47
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,593
"Chef Jong-won, please stay strong."

48
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,294
"Keep up the good work!"

49
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,762
"You can do it!"

50
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,566
-Okay.
-He's rooting for you.

51
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,870
I put it on my fridge
and read it every morning.

52
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,404
It must cheer you up.

53
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,541
It's time to meet our guests.

54
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,611
They're many people's favorites.

55
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,915
Please welcome today's fridge owners.
Come on out!

56
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,186
Who are today's guests?

57
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,888
-Whoa.
-Today's fridge owners are

58
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,756
the top picks of millennials and Gen Z,

59
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,492
-Car, the Garden and Pani Bottle!
-Come on in!

60
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,793
Will you say something?

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,862
<i>But the way he talks is intuitive.</i>

62
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,230
<i>The funniest guy on YouTube,</i>

63
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,266
please welcome Car, the Garden!

64
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,668
-Welcome to the show.
-Hello.

65
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,503
He looked like a hunter,

66
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,107
making a strong first impression.

67
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,976
-Let me present the next guest.
-He doesn't have facial hair.

68
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,444
THE NUMBER 1 KOREAN TRAVEL VLOGGER

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,514
<i>He's the top Korean travel vlogger.</i>

70
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,117
<i>He's not just vlogging anymore,</i>
<i>but out everywhere in the media.</i>

71
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,252
Millennials and Gen Zs' role model,
Pani Bottle!

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,355
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

73
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,557
WELCOME

74
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,860
-I've only seen you on YouTube.
-You're on the adorable side.

75
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,762
I'll be 40 soon,

76
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,263
so it's embarrassing to hear that.

77
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,331
-Really?
-Yes.

78
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,099
-Gosh.
-He's 40?

79
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,135
I think he was born in 1987.

80
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,272
The first impression I got from them is
that they're opposites.

81
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,243
I heard that
you both love to watch our show.

82
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,513
-This feels like an honor to my family.
-Why?

83
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,415
Only the popular people are

84
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,750
-invited on this show,
-Yes.

85
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,185
but I was, well,

86
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,254
hidden under the shade.

87
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,822
SHADY(?) GARDEN

88
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,257
Don't say that.

89
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,693
I even walk like this out in the sun.

90
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,629
Anyway, it feels great
to have been invited.

91
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,598
No, the honor is ours.

92
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,435
I rarely say that
I want to be on a certain show,

93
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,339
but I really wanted to be here.
But not just anyone can be on this show.

94
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,974
So I was surprised when it happened.

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,209
Why didn't you ask Poong
to pull some strings?

96
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,712
-He did, actually. He said it often.
-He did?

97
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,181
-That's how this happened.
-Really?

98
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,350
-You did this?
-You made it happen?

99
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,018
-He's now casting people?
-It was your power?

100
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,921
Is Poong big enough
to cast someone on the show?

101
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,423
Don't you think
it got delayed because of him?

102
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,659
-I asked him a while ago, I guess.
-I see.

103
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,296
Car, the Garden is loved
by the millennials and Gen Z these days.

104
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,432
Many people may have forgotten
what his actual job is,

105
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,301
but he's a singer.

106
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,371
-He's a wonderful singer on the stage.
-That's right.

107
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,672
One of our chefs also said

108
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,907
one of your songs was their favorite

109
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,609
and was excited about your visit.

110
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,511
I love his songs so much,

111
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,113
and when I get hooked,

112
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,548
I listen to the same song
at least 1,000 times.

113
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,252
So I kept listening to his song
on my way to work and home.

114
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,588
-I see.
-You must've memorized it by heart.

115
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,923
-What was the song?
-You were hooked.

116
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,191
HE'S IN TROUBLE

117
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,128
He's the chef I admire the most.

118
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,797
-The best in Korea.
-Was it because he sang?

119
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,732
-He's truly the best chef.
-He is?

120
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,467
He gets extra points already.

121
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,202
Wait, Chef Jong-won too.

122
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,204
-I'm a huge fan too.
-I see.

123
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,173
I love "Memorize Our Night" a lot,
and recently,

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,942
I've been listening to a song
called "BIG BIRD" he sang with O3ohn.

125
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,411
I listened to it this morning too.

126
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,979
His dish already tastes good.

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,748
I already had some.

128
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,450
-I think he wants to win today.
-Wait a minute.

129
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,253
-He must be a great chef.
-You haven't had it yet.

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,121
He's worse than Hyun-suk.

131
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,790
-He won't even have to cook.
-He won't.

132
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,991
But there was a chef

133
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,861
who wondered if he should come to
the shoot today if Car, the Garden came.

134
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,963
Which one of you was it?

135
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,665
-Me.
-Sung-jun?

136
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,634
-Why? Why were you hesitant?
-It's because

137
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,903
doppelgängers aren't supposed to meet

138
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,439
because one of us is going to die.

139
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,973
When doppelgängers meet?

140
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,810
I actually have heard
that I look like him.

141
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,713
-I also noticed as soon as I saw him.
-Me too.

142
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,282
I've gained some weight
and have grown out facial hair,

143
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,917
but we have similar features.

144
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,085
I felt close to him.

145
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,586
The day after I realized that,

146
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,223
-people began to mention it to me too.
-Really?

147
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,925
We both have lots of nicknames too.

148
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,927
He has lots of nicknames
in four syllables,

149
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,129
and in my case, they're all six syllables.

150
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,497
Name My Delish Dish.

151
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,798
Natalie Portman.

152
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,300
-I see.
-Naughtiest Family.

153
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,202
Like that, I have a lot of nicknames.

154
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,269
Right.

155
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,539
But my case is much more unfortunate,

156
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,075
-so I rarely bring this up myself.
-Why not?

157
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,078
I once got to sing the National Anthem
at the Korean Series.

158
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,814
-At the Korean Series?
-It was a few years ago.

159
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,917
-It was such an honorable occasion.
-I think I remember. Yes.

160
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,221
But the caption didn't say my name,

161
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,289
but someone else's. The caption.

162
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,457
-The caption?
-On the Jumbotron?

163
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,725
It was MBC.

164
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,360
The person in charge has already left,

165
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,829
but I'll catch them someday.
I'm still pursuing them.

166
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,731
Let me make an announcement.

167
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,501
If you're watching this, I mean it.

168
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,002
-It was someone at MBC?
-Yes.

169
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,771
I'll find that person for you.

170
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,840
-I plan to use a private detective.
-No, I got this.

171
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
You should mediate this.

172
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,277
After that, people thought it was funny
and it caught on.

173
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,813
They began to use anything
that has four syllables like him.

174
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,248
-I see.
-What's your legal name?

175
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,017
-My name is Cha Jung-won.
-Cha Jung-won.

176
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,285
"Cha" means car.

177
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,220
-Car.
-"Jungwon" means garden.

178
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,823
-I see.
-Car, the Garden, so Cha Jung-won.

179
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,427
Let's find out
how serious the situation is.

180
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,961
-How many?
-Let's see it in captions.

181
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,863
-Whoa.
-That's a lot.

182
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,765
Car, the Garden. Kindergarten.

183
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,301
Thief With A Knife. A Garter Belt.

184
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,436
Please Say Goodbye.

185
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,503
Don't Care, Just Go.

186
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,405
You just wrote down random stuff.

187
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,774
-What the heck is Urinary Tract Stone?
-Urinary Tract Stone?

188
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,409
-Urinary stones hurt so much.
-Urinary.

189
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,144
There's Vuvuzela too.

190
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,146
-A Guinea Pig?
-This is…

191
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,482
-Chicken Breast Meat?
-Here's what this means.

192
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,084
-Anything works?
-The production crew is a huge mess.

193
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,486
They invited a guest

194
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,222
and chose to ridicule him
on the big screen.

195
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,659
-That's why. This is so grave.
-The situation is that serious.

196
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,862
-People used to at least make it rhyme.
-Any four syllables work.

197
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,397
But now, they just say random things.

198
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,233
-Even Coca Cola works.
-Coca Cola.

199
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,369
But in our opinion,

200
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,305
you two have one last similarity,

201
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:57,143
and it's that both of you
don't look your age.

202
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,279
-I was born in 1995, so I'm 30 now.
-Yes.

203
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,547
Some even guessed 45.

204
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,617
He's choking up. He just choked up.

205
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,486
-Ahem.
-Really? They guessed 45?

206
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,088
Car, the Garden thought Sung-jun was

207
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,823
born in 1988. Is this true?

208
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,991
SHUTTING HIS EYES

209
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,593
-That's pretty close.
-It's close.

210
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,561
-That's not a bad guess.
-It's not.

211
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,531
I thought he'd be older
because he must've trained a lot

212
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,533
-to become a great chef.
-That can be the case.

213
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,902
-I thought he probably needed more time.
-I see.

214
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,706
But Car, the Garden is
also in a similar situation.

215
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,076
We asked our chefs to take a guess

216
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,112
-on Car, the Garden's age.
-Really?

217
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,749
The average was 40.

218
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,551
-Forty?
-It was forty.

219
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,753
The highest guess was age 45.

220
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,989
-What?
-Who was it?

221
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,056
Was it me?

222
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,960
You said
you listened to his songs so many times.

223
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,428
Let me explain.

224
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,232
It's impossible for a singer to carry
this much soul and sentiment in his voice

225
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,735
over a short period of time.

226
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,136
-It's okay.
-I thought…

227
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,374
You said he looked 45 years old.

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,441
-Forty-five.
-How old are you?

229
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,477
I'm now 36.

230
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,245
-You're 36?
-Born in 1990.

231
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,180
In 1990? You were born in the 90s?

232
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,583
-Yes.
-He was born in 1990.

233
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,385
-He's the same age as Nam-no.
-Whoa.

234
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,687
Pani Bottle, did you say
you were born in 1988?

235
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,155
-In 1987.
-You were born in 1987?

236
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,990
-He's older.
-He is.

237
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,892
When I starred on his YouTube channel,

238
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,627
I naturally thought he was older

239
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,995
and treated him like one.

240
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,730
But he said he was younger,

241
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,299
so I said, "That's impossible."

242
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,633
-I was flustered.
-"Impossible"?

243
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,338
When I watched his travel vlogs at home,

244
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,943
I also naturally thought,
"That kid is good at traveling around."

245
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,612
And went, "That young kid
has such a wanderlust."

246
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,047
"How cheerful."

247
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,716
CHEERFUL OLDER GUY

248
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,818
I definitely thought he'd be younger.

249
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,787
We never doubted that once.

250
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,889
-It was a surprise.
-I see.

251
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,059
Anyway, Car, the Garden announced

252
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,395
he'll enjoy his last feast
here on the show today,

253
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,864
so he wanted something really hearty.

254
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,399
Was that your request?

255
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,002
I thought I should shed some weight,

256
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,370
so I'll enjoy the day

257
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,372
and go on a diet starting tomorrow.

258
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,040
-But you'll eat until today.
-Yes.

259
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,942
He'll start losing weight tomorrow.

260
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,045
-I wanted the best food for my last feast.
-The best dishes.

261
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,548
So please pay
extra attention today, chefs.

262
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,284
It's time to look through

263
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,319
-Car, the Garden's fridge. Let's go.
-Okay.

264
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,156
-It's not as big as I thought.
-It's small.

265
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,726
-What's that in the middle?
-Yes?

266
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,462
-Yes.
-That looks like someone's fist.

267
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,763
-Like this?
-You're right.

268
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,565
I got furious and did that.

269
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,501
-Really?
-And that fridge was right next to me,

270
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,038
so I punched it and went, "Ouch."
It made me even more furious.

271
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,207
That's a serious dent.

272
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,710
As soon as I came to the studio,
I remembered and regretted doing that.

273
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,479
-Jeez.
-It's so embarrassing.

274
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,581
You didn't notice it at home, right?

275
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,684
It must've been after he sang
the National Anthem at the Korean Series.

276
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,352
-It must've been that day.
-Now.

277
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,222
Car, the Garden is
looking to eat his last feast today.

278
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,257
-Presenting his fridge!
-His fridge!

279
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,527
-It's full.
-It's pretty full.

280
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,462
PRESENTING CAR, THE GARDEN'S FRIDGE

281
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,865
It's rather full.

282
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,402
-It's ordinary.
-It's an ordinary fridge at home.

283
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,370
Let's take a look at each one.

284
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,406
The shelf marked "Fresh Room" is

285
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,509
filled with things he ate
to stay in shape.

286
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,210
Of course, chicken breast.

287
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,247
-Crab meat. Soft tofu.
-This must be for one meal.

288
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,583
-Did you try to stay in shape?
-What I eat the most to lose weight are

289
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,086
crab meat and chicken breast.

290
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,422
-These two?
-For protein.

291
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,192
-You'll start tomorrow, right?
-Yes, I'll have to eat those.

292
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,860
This must be takeout food.

293
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,729
I think he ordered something.

294
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,365
-It's my favorite.
-Is it fried chicken?

295
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,467
I always keep that chicken at home.

296
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,469
-It's good.
-He had half and left half.

297
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,971
I always order 12 pieces,

298
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,040
leave some to have them cold the next day.

299
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,608
-It's still good cold.
-He likes chicken.

300
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,912
-How many times a week do you eat it?
-Three times a week.

301
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,747
He must like it a lot.

302
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,084
You pretty much eat it every day
because you eat leftovers the next day.

303
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,220
-So you eat it every day.
-Technically, yes.

304
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,422
-He has it more than rice.
-He orders one and eats it the next day.

305
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,857
Every day except for one.

306
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,325
What else do you like to order?

307
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,627
-I get <i>tteokbokki</i> delivered.
-<i>Tteokbokki</i>.

308
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,129
Do you like spicy food?

309
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,832
-I order that famous spicy brand often.
-This one?

310
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,333
It's the juice they give on the side.

311
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,469
-The extra-spicy <i>tteokbokki.</i>
-That one.

312
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,570
This isn't <i>tteokbokki</i>.

313
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,805
-This is red pepper powder.
-It's red pepper powder.

314
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,675
-Whoa, that's really spicy.
-He must like spicy food.

315
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,344
-I add some to <i>ramyeon.</i>
-Just to <i>ramyeon?</i>

316
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,080
You all know
that spicy <i>ramyeon</i> franchise, right?

317
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,851
Adding that Vietnamese red pepper powder
to a certain brand of <i>ramyeon</i>

318
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,487
could recreate that flavor,
so I bought that.

319
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,988
He must like spicy food.

320
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,157
Is this water?

321
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,425
That's soju.

322
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,193
-It's soju?
-Soju.

323
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,429
What do you like to eat with drinks?

324
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,531
I don't eat much when I drink,

325
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,768
but I end up binge eating the next day.

326
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,636
-To relieve a hangover.
-That makes you gain weight.

327
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,105
On a day after getting wasted,

328
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,974
I even ended up eating six meals.

329
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,542
-To relieve your hangover?
-Six?

330
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,778
It'll make me sound like a pig,

331
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,280
but let's say I had <i>bugeoguk,</i>
dried pollack soup.

332
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,517
Then I go, "I should eat Western food,"
and order fried chicken.

333
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,486
After I eat fried chicken,
I start craving the Korean flavor,

334
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,455
so I order some spicy stir-fried pork.

335
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,257
Then I'll want to take
another international trip,

336
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,893
-so I order pizza next. That's how.
-The hangover hell.

337
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,262
-Food defense game.
-That's how.

338
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,863
How much liquor can you hold?

339
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,433
I can drink
about two and a half bottles of soju.

340
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,469
You ate six meals
after two and a half bottles?

341
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,070
CHUCKLING

342
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,940
-That's not a lot.
-That should be another ordinary day.

343
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,276
HE JUST WANTED SOMETHING TASTY

344
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,112
Drinking must stimulate his appetite.

345
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,580
What's this?

346
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,183
That's curry I recently made.

347
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,084
-Curry?
-You made curry?

348
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,656
I like Korean style curry,
and not many places offer it for delivery.

349
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,124
-Right.
-They don't.

350
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,926
-So I had to make it.
-Right.

351
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,028
What's your recipe?

352
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,264
I just throw in onions, meat,

353
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,633
water, potatoes,

354
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,535
and smash in some curry powder.

355
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,538
I make it like how I cook <i>ramyeon,</i>

356
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,407
so it's pretty easy to make.

357
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,377
I left it there instead of the freezer,
so I should throw it out.

358
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,513
-Has it been a while?
-Yes, don't use that.

359
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,415
-Curry goes bad…
-Faster than you think.

360
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:13,185
Wait a second. Aren't these the same?

361
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,255
-The sauce? Different brands.
-Aren't these the same?

362
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,990
Why do you keep so many of these?

363
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,725
I forgot that I had it.

364
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,694
A TINY FRIDGE, EVEN TINIER MEMORY

365
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,230
I have lots of chicken stock
because I forgot I had some.

366
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,732
-Chicken stock. Yes.
-I have another one down there.

367
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,201
That's probably cubed chicken stock.

368
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,136
-These?
-Yes, these.

369
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,272
I keep forgetting and buying more.

370
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,541
Wait a moment.

371
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,444
This is… Is this mold?

372
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,145
-Mold in chicken stock?
-In here.

373
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,513
Stop lying. That's crazy.

374
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,882
Can chicken stock get lumpy?

375
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,517
-It doesn't happen to condiments.
-Isn't this liquid?

376
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,787
-There are lumps?
-There's something white.

377
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,923
-Something white?
-It looks like chicken breast.

378
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,058
This one?

379
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,194
This? What is this?

380
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,229
There are lumps in the sauce.

381
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,530
Is it chicken?

382
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,466
Please just throw that away.

383
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,636
This expired back in October 2024.

384
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,337
October 16, 2024.

385
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,374
I've never seen a condiment
go bad so terribly like that.

386
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,578
-I guess I couldn't let it go.
-It's about time you did.

387
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,914
-I'll throw this out.
-Please do.

388
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,716
-This hasn't happened for a while.
-To a condiment?

389
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,985
Wait, this sounds like an emergency.

390
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,322
This means we'll have to check
the expiry date on everything.

391
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,991
Chefs, please check the date
before you pick it up.

392
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,459
That's not good.

393
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,861
Is this <i>sikhye</i>?

394
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,329
You really have to throw that out.

395
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,898
-My gosh. Look at this.
-Why is it yellow?

396
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,167
Even at a glance, it looks dangerous.

397
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,635
It's a ticking bomb!

398
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,437
-It looks bad.
-It'll really blow up.

399
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,007
There's a dip at the bottom of the bottle,
but it's protruding.

400
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,876
-It's angry.
-It feels really tight.

401
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,079
-Please throw it out now.
-It seems dangerous.

402
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,381
It'll turn into a water park
if we open it.

403
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,749
A SIKHYE PARK

404
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,785
CHEF & MY FRIDGE WATER PARK, NOW OPEN

405
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,087
-Whoa.
-It'll turn into a water park.

406
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,990
We have to be careful.

407
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,792
We found spoiled <i>sikhye</i>.

408
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,695
-What about the curry?
-Please throw that out too.

409
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,897
With the container? You can reuse that.

410
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,099
Just throw it out with the container.

411
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,500
Why the container?

412
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,969
It's gone bad too.

413
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,637
You have to look carefully.

414
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,773
The veggies. Lettuce, potatoes,

415
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,344
-and cabbage.
-Blueberries.

416
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,478
Do you enjoy veggies?

417
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,981
-No, I don't.
-You don't?

418
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,016
I hate carrots and cucumbers the most.

419
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,117
Why?

420
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,353
Even the color of the carrot makes me mad.

421
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,054
-It makes you mad?
-The color?

422
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,856
And I hate how cucumbers smell.

423
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,559
Is there any other colored food ingredient
that makes you mad?

424
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,361
-Eggplants.
-Eggplants?

425
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,629
-What about it?
-The color makes you mad?

426
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,599
It makes me pissed
to see food colored purple.

427
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,134
But why?

428
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,736
Do you eat everything here?

429
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,538
-Yes, I eat lettuce and cabbage.
-Okay.

430
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,107
Now, the freezer.

431
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,509
Meat. I found meat.

432
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,878
-Beef and pork.
-Yes.

433
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,080
-Is this beef too?
-That's for soup and stew.

434
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,017
I keep beef cuts made for soup and stew
to throw into curry.

435
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,052
What's your favorite meat?

436
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:04,656
There's something I sincerely love
more than top-grade beef,

437
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,425
and it's Spam.

438
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,227
He knows what's up.

439
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,529
-Why do you have so many of these?
-I love it.

440
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,663
There's a lot of ham.

441
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,198
Look at that in the back.

442
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,768
-For restaurants.
-The big one for restaurants.

443
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,803
I didn't know it could be this big.

444
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,373
I watched a few YouTubers eat that

445
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,778
and just bought some.
I wanted to cook it whole in an air fryer.

446
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,746
-Yes, that looked delicious.
-They'd eat that

447
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,282
-with Chapagetti.
-Yes.

448
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,717
-It makes my mouth water.
-That's a good mix.

449
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,752
Do you keep these <i>ramyeon</i>
to relieve hangovers?

450
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,755
Yes, so I buy lots of spicy <i>ramyeon,</i>

451
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,291
and I like to eat those tiny cup <i>ramyeon.</i>

452
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,160
-These?
-Those?

453
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,928
-People eat that while on a diet.
-Is it for that?

454
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,230
-No, not those. The ones behind.
-These?

455
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,398
I didn't mean to get those.

456
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,367
You didn't mean to?

457
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,203
-I've once bought it by mistake.
-By mistake? Jeez.

458
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,005
I ordered them by mistake.

459
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,773
What's this?

460
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,142
-It's just the soup base for <i>ramyeon.</i>
-Yes, it was available.

461
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,211
They sell just the soup base?

462
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,846
I thought it was hot cocoa.

463
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,215
I really have it like hot cocoa
by melting it in a cup.

464
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,383
That?

465
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,285
-In a cup?
-It's better than you think,

466
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,986
-so I drink it often.
-I'll get one too.

467
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,489
-I see.
-He ate a lot.

468
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,057
Okay, then.

469
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:16,128
Today is Car, the Garden's last feast.

470
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,865
So what does he want to eat today?
Show us the orders.

471
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,601
Car, the Garden, hung over.

472
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,839
-Car, the Garden, loaded with Spam.
-Loaded with Spam.

473
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,041
Car, the Garden, hung over.
What are you looking for?

474
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,645
I love to eat a lot the day after I drink,

475
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,048
so I want to ask the chefs

476
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,750
to make something
that'll relieve my hangover,

477
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,352
but something with lots of love,

478
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,422
something that'll taste really delicious.

479
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,757
-So you can eat just one meal, not six.
-Yes, just one.

480
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,826
-The best hangover relief.
-Yes.

481
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,361
-That's hard.
-That's not easy.

482
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,230
Car, the Garden, loaded with Spam.

483
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,765
As you already saw, I love Spam a lot.

484
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,401
So feel free to make
whatever you want with that.

485
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,738
I'll be grateful if you make something
I'll love with that.

486
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,907
-You like that more than Korean beef.
-I see.

487
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,576
Now, among our chefs,
this person has many stars,

488
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,146
but she has never lost once.

489
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,114
It's Chef Ji-sun.

490
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,649
-Her win rate is 100%.
-Zero losses.

491
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,117
We have to suspend her.

492
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,920
-The hangover. It's perfect for me.
-I see.

493
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,022
-You love to drink.
-I do.

494
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,291
-The official drunkard.
-Yes.

495
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:24,163
-Chef Ji-sun.
-She takes the hangover relief round.

496
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,564
-I'll go right away.
-Take the Spam.

497
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,533
The hangover relief? No?

498
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,800
-No.
-No?

499
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,470
-Poong will go for Spam.
-Spam is something

500
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,573
I can call my soul food.

501
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,742
-Is that so?
-That sounds wonderful.

502
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,646
And that large can.
I've never worked with it before,

503
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,648
so I want to use that.

504
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,349
It has begun.

505
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,984
The devil's dance has begun.

506
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,085
I look forward to it.

507
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,554
-The Spam expert.
-Yes.

508
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,489
-The expert?
-You've had your share.

509
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,292
-He'd know since he had lots of Spam.
-That's right.

510
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,994
Poong takes the Spam round first.

511
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,031
Many of you seem hesitant. Chef Hyun-suk?

512
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,933
Not only do I like it,

513
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,437
but Spam was something
only rich kids had when I was young.

514
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,005
I'll take the Spam round.

515
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,408
Back in our day, only rich kids had them.

516
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,577
Here's how much I like it.

517
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,145
I previously had a seasonal menu

518
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,180
-called Chef-ham.
-Chef-ham?

519
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,616
It was an homage to Spam,

520
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,085
something made like pudding.

521
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,754
-I want to make a luxurious dish for him.
-You do?

522
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,323
This will be fun.

523
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,792
Okay, now. The hangover relief.

524
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,560
The hangover relief.

525
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,563
-I'll go.
-What?

526
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,765
-Jong-won, the hangover relief?
-Whoa.

527
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,500
-I'll do that.
-The hangover relief.

528
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,636
FULL OF CONFIDENCE, FULL OF ANTICIPATION

529
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,271
-All right.
-Jong-won's hangover relief.

530
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,208
Let us begin
with Jong-won and Ji-sun's round.

531
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,877
STARTING WITH THE HANGOVER RELIEF FOOD

532
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,948
<i>This is the first round of cook-off</i>
<i>with Car, the Garden's ingredients.</i>

533
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,352
It's titled, "Car, the Garden, hung over."

534
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,686
Chef Jong-won is in this round

535
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,323
-full of his good vibes,
-Good vibes.

536
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,226
up against Chef Ji-sun for the first time,

537
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,795
-the chef with great discipline.
-Yes.

538
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,664
They have the same number of stars, right?

539
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,366
-Really?
-There's a similarity.

540
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,235
They both have five stars
and are currently in third place.

541
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,938
-But their win rates are different.
-Yes.

542
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,540
-Chef Ji-sun has won all five rounds.
-All five.

543
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,843
Her win rate is 100%.

544
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,878
When will this streak break?

545
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,080
On the other hand, Chef Jong-won

546
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:25,050
has fought ten times,
won five, and lost five.

547
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,585
His win rate is 50%.

548
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,589
-That still sounds good.
-A record of the show at the moment is

549
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,125
Chef Hyun-suk's five straight wins.

550
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:37,095
-If Ji-sun wins, she'll break that record
-It'll break.

551
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,265
and become the first chef
to win six rounds in a row.

552
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,068
-Can you do it?
-I'll break the record today.

553
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,870
That's the lady with discipline.

554
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,139
I came here today

555
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,574
to suspend Chef Ji-sun's win streak.

556
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,877
STOP HER WINNING STREAK

557
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,578
-Stop!
-Stop her!

558
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,547
-Stop.
-Stop winning.

559
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,948
-Stop!
-Stop!

560
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,817
Do you have any advantages?

561
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,186
You must know your enemy
to win against them.

562
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,888
But Chef Ji-sun

563
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,257
has never tried the food I made.

564
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,428
But I've visited her restaurant before.

565
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,896
Is that so?

566
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,932
Did you think you could beat her
after trying her food?

567
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,535
GLARING

568
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,004
-You're right.
-"Is this all she can do?"

569
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,441
He tried it and went, "Is that all?"
"I can beat this."

570
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,710
-He's been waiting for this.
-"I got this."

571
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,278
"How did she win five times in a row?"

572
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,481
-Wait. Jeez.
-I get it now. Okay.

573
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,549
As he walked out, he said,

574
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,616
"It's just Chinese food."

575
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,884
JOKING

576
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,420
"What's so different?"

577
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,422
-I enjoyed it very much.
-Sure.

578
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,925
I know what she's good at,

579
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,829
-so I thought about what I'll do.
-Okay.

580
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,964
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS:
PORK NECK, MUKEUNJI, ANCHOVY BROTH PACK

581
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,066
KELP, BEEF TENDERLOIN,
LETTUCE, BROTH TABLET

582
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,236
The dish I prepared is called

583
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,939
-King, the Garden.
-King, the Garden?

584
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,073
That's a good name.

585
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,242
-King, the Garden?
-King, the Garden.

586
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,944
I'll make you feel like a king

587
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,247
-relieving your hangover.
-A feast fit for a king.

588
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,282
He has that impression, so…

589
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,718
-Why are you looking at him?
-Looks like a king.

590
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,755
-Do I have the face of a king?
-A king's features.

591
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,091
-Your facial hair makes you look like one.
-Right?

592
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,628
-He'll look like one in a hat and a robe.
-He's a king.

593
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,430
"Do I have the face of a king?"

594
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,532
You'll consider
Car, the Garden to be the king.

595
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,067
So what will you make?

596
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,236
I'm actually going to make <i>yeolguja-tang,</i>
a royal hot pot.

597
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,773
It's a dish that makes you
enjoy its taste in the mouth.

598
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,342
It's also known as <i>sinseollo.</i>

599
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,277
-<i>Sinseollo.</i>
-Actually,

600
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,879
the dish itself is called <i>sinseollo.</i>

601
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,249
Then you fill up the dish with <i>jeon</i>

602
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,217
-and other ingredients.
-I've never had it.

603
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,886
You can do that with his ingredients?

604
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,589
He has to griddle <i>jeon</i>
and make the soup too.

605
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,692
-I'm going to give it a try.
-That's crazy.

606
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,329
<i>Sinseollo</i> is sometimes made with noodles.

607
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,399
but I'll put rice inside
and help you relieve the hangover.

608
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,803
He's using rice to go easy on the stomach.

609
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,572
CHEF JI-SUN'S INGREDIENTS:
VIETNAMESE RED PEPPER POWDER, CUP RAMYEON

610
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,474
TOMATO PASTE, CABBAGE, PORK NECK,
OYSTER SAUCE, RADISH KIMCHI, POTATO

611
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,975
I prepared a dish called

612
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,977
Got Hot and Sour Soup.

613
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,446
-What?
-Got Hot and Sour Soup.

614
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,081
It's like, "Got milk?"

615
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,050
-"Got milk?"
-Got Hot and Sour Soup?

616
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,220
-I get it.
-She's making hot and sour soup.

617
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,222
This is a traditional Chinese dish

618
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,827
that includes five flavors, sour, spicy,
salty, sweet, and bitter for hangovers.

619
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,662
So I'll make this hot and sour soup.

620
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:27,299
I saw radish kimchi and tomato paste,

621
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,468
so I'll make broth by blending the two

622
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,403
and add some glass noodles as well.

623
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,472
The sourness is kimchi.

624
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,441
-She's going to blend it.
-It'll taste sour.

625
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,376
You said you liked spicy food,

626
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,712
so I'll make chili oil
with some Vietnamese pepper powder

627
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,814
to make the dish even spicier.

628
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,583
I see. Have you had hot and sour soup?

629
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,051
Yes, of course.

630
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,586
I look forward to both dishes

631
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,188
because I call something a hangover relief

632
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,823
when it makes me feel something.

633
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,258
If I suddenly

634
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,928
begin to crave another drink
as I have the dish,

635
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,699
I believe that is
a true hangover relief dish.

636
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,702
When I heard them explain their dishes,

637
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,338
-I think it'll happen with both.
-Do you crave a drink already?

638
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,807
It's <i>sinseollo</i> versus hot and sour soup.

639
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,343
-<i>Sinseollo</i> versus hot and sour soup.
-Korean versus Chinese cuisine.

640
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,280
It's time to fill the order titled,
"Car, the Garden, hung over."

641
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,681
Wow.

642
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,484
She's the first chef to attempt
to win six rounds in a row.

643
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,021
The wildcat engine of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
Chef Jung Ji-sun.

644
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,558
But he's here to suspend
Ji-sun's winning streak.

645
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,562
The hindrance among the chefs,
Chef Son Jong-won.

646
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,298
-He's the hindrance?
-I guess so.

647
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,903
Which one of them will relieve
Car, the Garden's hangover with one meal?

648
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,540
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

649
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,175
All right.

650
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,211
-Begin!
-Let's go!

651
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,345
KOREAN VS CHINESE CUISINE

652
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,948
Chef Jong-won will be quite busy.

653
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,583
-Tell me about it.
-Right?

654
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,485
He oiled three pans.

655
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,587
He oiled those. Gosh.

656
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,124
He'll have to move very quickly today.

657
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,092
The soup for <i>sinseollo</i>

658
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,128
-isn't just plain water, right?
-No.

659
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,563
-He has to make broth.
-Right?

660
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,999
-I think he's doing that.
-Is he making the broth?

661
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,669
He's moving really fast. That's amazing.

662
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,604
WHAT ABOUT THE HOT AND SOUR SOUP?

663
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,973
The Vietnamese red pepper powder.

664
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,675
GREEN ONION

665
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,944
CHEONGYANG PEPPER

666
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,512
THROWN INTO ONE BOWL

667
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,682
-Is that chili oil?
-Chili oil.

668
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,849
It's chili oil.

669
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,319
-I see.
-That's how she makes chili oil?

670
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,654
Chef Ji-sun, hot and sour soup can be made

671
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,823
either mildly or spicy.

672
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,892
But is that your base?

673
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,393
I'll make it spicy.

674
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,063
She keeps adding more oil.

675
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,665
Why do you keep refilling the oil?

676
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,068
I'm trying to extract
more flavor into the oil.

677
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,003
It's different from my chili oil.

678
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,772
-That looks rather luxurious.
-It does.

679
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,675
He has to griddle <i>jeon</i>
to put in the <i>sinseollo</i>.

680
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,544
-It'll take a long time.
-It will.

681
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,479
He's making the batter for <i>jeon</i>.

682
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,115
He's mixing eggs, flour, and water
to make batter.

683
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,852
Chef Jong-won seems to be making jeon
that'll go into the <i>sinseollo.</i>

684
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,322
He threw in some onion and pepper.
Onions, flour, eggs, and peppers.

685
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,191
WHAT'S HE CHOPPING NEXT?

686
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,093
Is he using lettuce?

687
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,728
-He's making <i>jeon.</i>
-Lettuce <i>jeon?</i>

688
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,129
-Lettuce <i>jeon?</i>
-Lettuce <i>jeon.</i>

689
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,697
-It's lettuce <i>jeon?</i>
-Lettuce <i>jeon.</i>

690
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,765
Like perilla leaf <i>jeon.</i>

691
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,635
<i>Jeon</i> is an important component
of <i>sinseollo,</i>

692
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,170
-and it's usually made of vegetables.
-Yes.

693
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,338
But he didn't have much.

694
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,274
-Lettuce <i>jeon?</i>
-I've never heard of it.

695
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,410
He doesn't like veggies.
Do you like lettuce?

696
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,612
-I do.
-He does. He likes lettuce.

697
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,215
-The lettuce <i>jeon.</i>
-Hey.

698
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,282
Lettuce.

699
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,919
His fusion Korean restaurant
also has a Michelin star, right?

700
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,221
-The Michelin star.
-Right.

701
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,324
Yes, you're right. He had a star.

702
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,825
Yes, you're right.

703
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,427
HE'LL SHOW OFF
HIS KOREAN CUISINE SKILLS

704
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,996
SEPARATING YOLKS AND WHITES!

705
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,366
BEAT BOTH AND SEASON WITH SALT

706
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,734
Are you making an egg garnish?

707
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,936
EGG GARNISH RECIPE 101!

708
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,372
HE SOAKS A KITCHEN TOWEL WITH OIL
AND COATS THE PAN

709
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,308
Chef Jong-won is making egg garnish.

710
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,643
The egg garnish.

711
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,746
That thin egg garnish is
a tough dish to make.

712
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,581
It'll bubble up if the heat is too high,

713
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:04,949
but he needs to make it smooth.

714
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,519
Many fail the cooking license test
when they make the egg garnish.

715
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,554
He failed to do it last time.

716
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,691
JONG-WON ALREADY
FACED TROUBLE BEFORE

717
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,225
Be quiet.

718
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,427
Stop bothering him.

719
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,895
WILL THE EGG GARNISH
COME OUT FINE TODAY?

720
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,164
WHAT'S JI-SUN DOING
AFTER MAKING CHILI OIL?

721
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:24,803
1. PEEL POTATOES, SLICE INTO
SMALL PIECES AND GRILL IN A PAN

722
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,038
Potatoes and…

723
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,207
It's radish kimchi.

724
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,077
She's stir-frying the vegetables
with the chili oil.

725
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,012
-I see.
-With the one she made?

726
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,681
-Look how red it is.
-It's really red.

727
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,683
-That cup <i>ramyeon.</i>
-The cup <i>ramyeon.</i>

728
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,318
The one he didn't mean to get.

729
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,088
-She's going to use those?
-The glass noodles.

730
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,290
-It's delicious and chewy.
-You're right.

731
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,691
Will she fry it?

732
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,261
BLOW UP, NOODLES

733
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,598
-Whoa.
-Whoa, what's that?

734
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,933
She's frying the noodles.

735
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,569
Chef Ji-sun captures everyone's attention.

736
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,404
-She suddenly deep-fried it?
-Yes.

737
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,339
FRYING THE GLASS NOODLES OVER HIGH HEAT

738
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,808
The noodles are dried,
so it'll blow up in the oil.

739
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,744
She put it back into iced water.

740
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,746
Everything happened so quickly.

741
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,514
Why is she doing that in iced water?

742
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,383
Five minutes are over.

743
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,385
-You have ten minutes.
-Really?

744
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,187
It's 15 minutes, no slack.

745
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,223
Is that beef?

746
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,291
-It's tenderloin.
-Tenderloin.

747
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,626
He's probably making beef <i>jeon.</i>

748
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,195
-Beef <i>jeon.</i>
-Yes, beef <i>jeon.</i>

749
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,563
It's still too thick to make <i>jeon.</i>

750
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,998
He'll probably hammer it.

751
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,834
He'll slam a hammer on it
with plastic wrap on top.

752
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,269
Like pork cutlet.

753
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,938
SLAM

754
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,608
It's his new, tough side.

755
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,675
CHUCKLING

756
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:41,613
The way his hair sways when he does that
made him look so cool.

757
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,781
The manly guy's key style.

758
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,683
I'll grow out this part too.

759
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,485
-You won't look like him.
-I know!

760
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,787
I just realized

761
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,455
the chefs bother each other a lot.

762
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,724
It's a slow day, actually.

763
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,727
-They're bothering him.
-Yes, they are.

764
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,629
He means that
other chefs bother them a lot.

765
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,098
Are you going to grind it?

766
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,200
-He's making beef <i>jeon.</i>
-Beef <i>jeon.</i>

767
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,335
-Beef <i>jeon.</i>
-Beef <i>jeon.</i>

768
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,337
Beef <i>jeon</i> is important for <i>sinseollo</i>.

769
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,507
TIME TO CHECK ON THE EGG GARNISH

770
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,476
THIS TIME, DID HE SUCCEED?

771
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,844
The color!

772
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,079
-See if it's burnt.
-It's burnt! No!

773
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,414
-It feels…
-No!

774
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,583
-Jong-won.
-No!

775
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,052
-He won't show us anyone.
-He does.

776
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,254
-It's better not to look.
-You're right.

777
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,556
It's better not to know.

778
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,891
-You're right.
-He's not forced to flip it.

779
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,860
He has to serve it with that side up.

780
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,496
THIS CHEF IS TOSSING THE PAN
WITH A HUGE FROWN

781
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,666
STIR-FRYING POTATOES
AND RADISH KIMCHI

782
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,102
She'll blend that?

783
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,170
She's blending potatoes.

784
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,040
-She said she'd blend it and make it.
-Tomato.

785
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,741
With tomato paste?

786
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,143
Is hot and sour soup made with tomato?

787
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,679
-I think so.
-Yes, it's made with tomatoes.

788
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,280
2. BLEND POTATOES, KIMCHI,
AND TOMATO PASTE

789
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,783
Chef Ji-sun made a thick soup.

790
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,219
-It's really thick.
-She made it with potatoes.

791
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,120
Yes, that's the key to the texture.

792
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,656
But is hot and sour soup
usually that thick?

793
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,758
It's because I'm making it as a meal.

794
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,560
-To help with the stomach?
-Yes.

795
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,896
Will it get cooked?

796
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,298
-That's why I stir-fried it in chili oil.
-Is that sugar?

797
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,967
-Sugar?
-Sugar.

798
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,135
You're using that much sugar?

799
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,938
She should probably make it spicier.

800
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,841
-You have 7 minutes and 40 seconds left.
-Time really flies.

801
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,443
It feels shorter in person.

802
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,779
FLIPPING THE LETTUCE JEON

803
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,248
TA-DA

804
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,317
HE FLIPPED IT WHOLE
WITHOUT BREAKING IT

805
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,752
-It looks good.
-It's a bit…

806
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,121
The <i>jeon</i> looks good. Is that <i>jeon</i> too?

807
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,923
THE BACK OF THE EGG
HE HAD BEEN HIDING

808
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,192
-Is that the yolk?
-He made a pancake.

809
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,994
It's Mars.

810
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,896
The yellow egg garnish.

811
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,397
-Shh.
-Why did he flip it?

812
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,465
Wasn't it a pancake?

813
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,967
Chef Jong-won began to cook
the egg yolk garnish.

814
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,037
-It's the yellow one.
-The yellow one.

815
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,338
That one is easier.

816
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,276
He has to cut everything
and serve it in the <i>sinseollo</i>.

817
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,144
The problem is time.

818
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,213
He seems very busy.

819
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,249
He looks really busy.

820
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,984
Yes, he has so much to do.

821
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,687
Korean cuisine involves a lot of work.

822
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,255
I'm the type

823
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,858
who'd appreciate
even a simple bowl of <i>ramyeon.</i>

824
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,927
I feel bad for making the chefs do this.

825
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,730
They're cooking
the best hangover relief dishes.

826
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,366
She's now cutting pork neck.

827
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,868
How will she use that?

828
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
3. COAT PORK WITH STARCH AND FRY

829
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,438
She coated the pork neck with starch
and began to deep-fry it.

830
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,340
Deep-fried pork neck.

831
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,908
Pork neck.

832
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,778
Those are the glass noodles
she deep-fried and soaked again.

833
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,080
They became really soft.

834
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,548
The texture returned.

835
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,583
If you deep-fry glass noodles
and soak them,

836
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,052
it'll absorb water faster.

837
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,920
INCREASED ABSORPTION

838
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,589
-It'll soak in the sauce.
-It'll absorb the sauce faster.

839
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,158
THE AIR SPACE INCREASES ABSORPTION

840
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,460
-It's a new method.
-I've never heard of it.

841
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,395
JONG-WON CONTINUES TO COOK
WITHOUT A MOMENT TO TALK

842
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,899
The beef <i>jeon</i>. That's an important part.

843
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,134
-It looks so good.
-It's a wonder.

844
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,270
HE CATCHES A BREATH, AND…

845
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,238
The soup is important too.

846
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,107
Yes, the <i>sinseollo</i> soup.

847
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,876
<i>Sinseollo</i> versus hot and sour soup.

848
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,815
The soup plays the biggest role
in hangover relief.

849
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,516
-Five minutes.
-Yes!

850
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,818
-Sung-ju.
-Yes?

851
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,754
-Please report from the kitchen.
-I'll go out now.

852
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,789
First of all, this side looks busy.

853
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,458
-Yes.
-That looks pretty.

854
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,659
It's the egg garnish.

855
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,694
This must be the soup,

856
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,696
so let me try it.

857
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,698
-The soup.
-It looks so good.

858
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,300
SLURP

859
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,168
Will it make him feel like a king?

860
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,371
Will it make him feel like a king?

861
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,406
Goodness, Your Majesty.

862
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,876
It's a little too salty, Your Majesty.

863
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,479
-Water.
-It's a bit salty.

864
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,580
Is this okay?

865
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,982
I like my food on the saltier side.

866
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,418
He must have a plan.

867
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,787
-Yes, that's it!
-That's it!

868
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,789
He's now a good listener.

869
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,360
Your Majesty, this man can
at least take a hint.

870
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:50,828
He's quick.

871
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,197
JI-SUN CALMLY CONTINUES
WITH HER RECIPE

872
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,267
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S
GOT HOT AND SOUR SOUP

873
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:01,072
4. CHOP ONION, GARLIC, AND CABBAGE

874
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,741
CHECKING THE SOUP!

875
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,810
CHILI OIL

876
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,278
I haven't seasoned it yet.

877
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,314
SHE TASTES THE SOUP
BEFORE THE ROYAL TASTER ARRIVES!

878
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,683
Gosh.

879
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,918
I DID IT!

880
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,486
Try Ji-sun's soup too.

881
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,723
-This? The hot and sour soup.
-The hot and sour soup.

882
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,091
I haven't added vinegar yet.

883
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,159
Will you do that now?

884
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,328
-She added more sourness.
-That's the sourness.

885
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,531
You have three minutes.
She continues to stir it.

886
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,199
I'm the most curious about this.

887
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,335
-The hot and sour soup.
-Hot and sour.

888
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,838
Do you want to get that hot and sour soup?

889
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,274
Do you want to get that hot and sour soup?

890
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,777
Whoa, Your Majesty!

891
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,680
She deserves a prize!

892
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,650
She deserves a prize!

893
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,286
I can see her sixth consecutive win,
Your Majesty.

894
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,889
It tastes spicy and sour.

895
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,359
This was how she already won
five rounds in a row.

896
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,228
This is really delicious.

897
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,665
-It must be good.
-What was that Hungarian soup?

898
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,234
-Goulash?
-Goulash.

899
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,937
-My mouth is watering.
-It's the potatoes.

900
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,472
What are you doing with this?

901
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,507
-This is the garnish.
-Garnish.

902
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,844
If Chef Ji-sun wins today,
it'll be her sixth consecutive win.

903
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,846
JONG-WON TAKES THE NEXT STEP
TO TURN THE GAME AROUND

904
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,049
-It's been cooked well.
-It looks delicious.

905
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,283
This round is

906
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,119
between Jong-won and Ji-sun.

907
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:25,123
Will Jong-won break
Ji-sun's winning streak?

908
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,058
But for now, he looks very busy.

909
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,826
CUTTING EGG GARNISH IN A PROPER SIZE!

910
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,394
The egg garnish.

911
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,131
Chef Jong-won cuts everything
in the same size.

912
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,665
-The same sizes.
-Yes.

913
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,536
Chef Jong-won, shouldn't you heat up rice?

914
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,338
-Two minutes.
-The rice!

915
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,907
-He has two minutes.
-That could've been bad!

916
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,108
He heats up rice.

917
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,277
-Royal taster!
-Yes?

918
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,645
Give him the death penalty!

919
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,580
You're not in your right mind.

920
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,116
-How can he not serve rice to His Majesty?
-Right?

921
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,852
Do you want to make him starve?

922
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,320
HE DESERVES A FLOGGING

923
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,923
His Majesty loves carbs!

924
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,091
That would've been awful.

925
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,960
He had a lot to drink last night.

926
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,395
A minute and 45 seconds.

927
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,230
A minute and 45 seconds.

928
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,798
What's he doing?

929
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,600
What will he do with the kimchi?

930
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,936
-It'll taste refreshing in the soup.
-He rips the kimchi

931
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,938
-and cuts it.
-It'll go into the soup too.

932
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,339
THE GARNISH IS READY

933
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,874
Are these leftovers?

934
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,142
A minute and 30 seconds.

935
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,778
Let me try the beef <i>jeon</i>, Your Majesty.

936
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,016
Can he break Ji-sun's winning streak?

937
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,651
CHEWING

938
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,588
Your Majesty, I must try another bite.

939
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,823
You just want more, don't you?

940
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,225
It must be good.

941
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,293
Your Majesty.

942
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,296
-It's delicious!
-All right!

943
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,399
The beef <i>jeon </i>is so good, Your Majesty.

944
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,168
HE PULLS OUT THE RICE
AFTER 1 MINUTE?

945
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,403
I doubt the rice is ready.

946
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,505
He'll have to boil it with soup.

947
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,940
He'll serve it in soup.

948
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,007
He's adding rice.

949
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,276
-It'll look like rice soup.
-Yes.

950
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,679
It has to be undercooked now
to eat it perfectly later.

951
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,314
THE LAST-MINUTE RUSH!

952
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,549
5. CHOP GREEN ONION,
LEAVE IT IN COLD WATER

953
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,751
You should start serving soon.

954
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,019
WHAT'S NEXT?

955
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,791
SHE SERVES THE SOAKED GLASS NOODLES

956
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:07,959
Forty-two seconds.

957
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,026
Forty seconds.

958
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,461
Forty seconds.

959
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,129
-Forty seconds.
-The garnish.

960
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,098
She's going to serve it now.

961
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,033
The hot and sour soup is ready.

962
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,768
POURING HOT AND SOUR SOUP

963
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,837
-It looks thick.
-It looks like curry.

964
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,505
-It's like curry.
-I mean its shape.

965
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,873
Jong-won still looks busy.

966
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,408
QUICKLY SERVING THE GARNISH

967
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,310
Twenty seconds.

968
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,945
You have twenty seconds left.

969
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,547
You don't have much time.

970
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,849
No, Ji-sun is almost done.

971
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,452
-Just put them in! Stash them!
-What about Jong-won?

972
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,021
-He's stacking everything.
-Just put them in!

973
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,589
Nine seconds!

974
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,991
-Eight!
-Eight!

975
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,159
-Just do it quickly!
-Seven.

976
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,895
JI-SUN FINISHES UP TOO

977
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,864
Ji-sun is almost done.

978
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,466
Ten. Nine.

979
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,567
Nine. Eight.

980
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,801
10 SECONDS LEFT

981
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,869
Nine. Eight.

982
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,771
Seven. Six.

983
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,173
-Seven. Six. Five.
-Pour it!

984
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,575
Pour it in!

985
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,543
Four. Three.

986
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,379
Two. One.

987
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,016
He finishes in the nick of time!

988
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,219
-He finished it.
-In the <i>sinseollo.</i>

989
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,722
We'll let you do this
as you're just serving the dish.

990
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,227
-I haven't seen a <i>sinseollo</i> in a while.
-It looks amazing.

991
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,129
HERE IS YOUR ROYAL FEAST,
YOUR MAJESTY

992
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,697
He needs to do that.

993
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,066
Both dishes are ready!

994
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,136
-What a stark difference.
-This is crazy.

995
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,807
-There's a big difference in their looks.
-Such a difference. His looks amazing.

996
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:34,445
Both hangover relief dishes are ready
just for Car, the Garden.

997
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,014
I appreciate your hard work.

998
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,483
BOWING

999
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,054
Car, the Garden wanted
the best hangover relief dish today.

1000
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,190
Chef Ji-sun finished cooking first,

1001
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,592
<i>so please try her hot and sour soup first.</i>

1002
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,594
SOUR, SWEET, AND SPICY HOT AND SOUR SOUP

1003
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,733
SERVED WITH FRIED AND SOAKED GLASS NOODLES
AND PORK TO HELP WITH HIS HANGOVER

1004
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,504
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S GOT HOT AND SOUR SOUP

1005
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,074
It's not the usual
hot and sour soup we know.

1006
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,776
No, it's different from what I've had.

1007
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,311
It looks like an Italian dish.

1008
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,381
It even looks like curry from here.

1009
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:14,051
When you relieve hangovers,
you have to drink soup instead of chewing.

1010
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,720
That's why I made it like that.

1011
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,054
It smells so delicious.

1012
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,289
-Does it?
-Yes.

1013
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,958
-First of all, I love the glass noodles.
-I see.

1014
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,293
Car, the Garden has many faces.

1015
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,097
He looked like he was from the Middle East
when he began to mix the soup.

1016
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,665
-Turkey.
-Right.

1017
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,734
-Please try it.
-Let me have a bite.

1018
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,669
Got Hot and Sour Soup?

1019
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,638
Scoop some soup and have it with the meat.

1020
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,706
ANOTHER BITE RIGHT AWAY

1021
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,774
Try the soup too.

1022
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,410
He wants the best hangover relief dish.

1023
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,745
My mouth is watering.

1024
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,280
A big bite.

1025
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,815
It came out quite thick.

1026
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,250
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

1027
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,120
As she mentioned,
it's both spicy and sour.

1028
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,155
Also, curry is a dish

1029
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,391
I love to eat the day after I drink,

1030
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,794
and this dish has a similar texture.

1031
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,896
-I love it.
-I see.

1032
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,499
-It seemed a bit spicy. Is it okay?
-Yes.

1033
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,636
It's just spicy enough
for everyone to enjoy.

1034
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,305
-It looks good.
-And?

1035
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,874
He grabs some noodles from the inside.

1036
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,242
It's…

1037
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,576
The noodles are great.

1038
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,979
-I see.
-Regular glass noodles

1039
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,814
-tend to be smooth.
-And chewy.

1040
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,750
But these noodles
break more softly in your mouth.

1041
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,452
But as she mentioned before,

1042
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,088
they absorbed all of the sauce.

1043
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,623
They absorbed everything.

1044
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,924
I'm hungry.

1045
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,860
-He continues to eat some more.
-This is so good.

1046
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,028
It looks like

1047
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,030
<i>tteokbokki</i> made with chewy noodles.

1048
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,232
-You're right.
-It's like <i>tteokbokki </i>sauce.

1049
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,300
You're right.

1050
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,535
This is so good.

1051
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,437
LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS

1052
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,238
I also like spicy food

1053
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:45,075
because I feel like I'm sobering up
once I sweat a little.

1054
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,011
If the situation allowed me to,

1055
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,546
I can always have another drink.

1056
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,749
-I see.
-Even as you relieve your hangover?

1057
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,318
-The hair of the dog?
-It doesn't have to be that.

1058
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,988
-It'd be a perfect bar snack.
-Is it that good?

1059
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,892
-It's very delicious.
-Is that so?

1060
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,127
Are you finished?

1061
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,895
-I want to try that too.
-I see.

1062
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,430
Remove it.

1063
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,265
He wants that now.

1064
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,969
Your Majesty,
let us serve the <i>sinseollo </i>next.

1065
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:16,774
A SINSEOLLO JUST FOR THE KING

1066
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,378
THIS HANGOVER RELIEF DISH WAS
STACKED IN THE ORDER

1067
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,915
OF YELLOW EGG, BEEF JEON, MUKEUNJI,
WHITE EGG GARNISH, AND LETTUCE JEON

1068
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,720
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S KING, THE GARDEN

1069
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,722
You should put it far away.

1070
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,090
It can burn your facial hair.

1071
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,191
WORRIED ABOUT HIS HAIR

1072
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,894
-His facial hair may burn?
-He can't burn that.

1073
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,396
HERE IS YOUR SINSEOLLO

1074
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,665
This is for you, Your Majesty.

1075
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,701
-It was always served like this.
-Yes.

1076
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,169
Jong-won the master chef.

1077
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,805
-That looks good.
-My gosh.

1078
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,274
Scoop up the rice at the bottom too.

1079
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,410
He turned into a king from the Joseon era.

1080
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,478
The <i>jeon.</i>

1081
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,714
I have to serve it like this?

1082
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,184
Yes, try the soup
and the solid ingredients.

1083
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,653
-Made by Jong-won.
-Yes.

1084
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,089
-There's rice underneath.
-Yes, there's rice.

1085
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,225
-Yes, there's rice underneath.
-Scoop it up with your spoon.

1086
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,127
-He found the rice.
-He's so serious.

1087
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,829
He's trying it with the soup.

1088
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,397
-I'll try a bite.
-Sure.

1089
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,099
My goodness.

1090
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,034
HE HAS A BITE OF BEEF JEON FIRST

1091
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,303
Gosh, this is…

1092
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,171
A BIG SMILE

1093
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,740
It was that good.

1094
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:23,974
LOVES IT AFTER THE FIRST BITE

1095
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,544
It only took him one bite.

1096
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,046
Will you please eat it like a king?

1097
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,881
Like a king.

1098
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:31,949
Hey, man.

1099
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,017
Who made this?

1100
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,320
He sounds like a thug.

1101
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,322
That's a thug, not a king.

1102
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,224
There's a thug among us.

1103
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,326
He sounds like a thug.

1104
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,495
Who's to say people in the Joseon era

1105
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,563
all used formal language?

1106
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:46,764
Old kings could've done this.

1107
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,265
"Hey, who made this?"

1108
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,101
"It's delish."

1109
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,604
I'm not sure
if I feel good or bad about that.

1110
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,373
Even in his shoes,

1111
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,876
instead of saying,
"Was this made with thy hands?"

1112
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,011
what if I asked, "Did you do this?"

1113
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,280
"It's so good."
Wouldn't it feel friendlier?

1114
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,283
That could've been the case
back in the Joseon era.

1115
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,019
-There must've been wild kings.
-Yes.

1116
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,187
That looks good.

1117
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,423
-It's actually…
-Gosh, Your Majesty.

1118
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,224
I wonder what it's like.

1119
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,527
Please chew a little for your health.

1120
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,097
You literally gulped everything down,
Your Majesty.

1121
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,199
Fine.

1122
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,102
SULKING

1123
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,905
Everything was made for you, Your Majesty.

1124
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,440
When you made <i>jeon,</i>

1125
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,009
you griddled it first, right?

1126
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,844
I liked how it was soaking.

1127
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,945
How the <i>jeon</i> was soaking.

1128
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,381
Does that make it more delicious?

1129
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,582
When you eat udon with tempura,

1130
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,719
the tempura absorbs the soup
and makes it more delicious, right?

1131
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,988
That's what happened here.

1132
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:48,225
<i>The greasiness and the smell.</i>

1133
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,527
-Please try it with the kimchi.
-What now?

1134
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,930
-Try the kimchi too.
-The kimchi.

1135
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,798
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

1136
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,767
I just had it,

1137
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,435
and it's even better with kimchi.

1138
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,737
-I see.
-It looks good.

1139
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,805
This would also go great with drinks.

1140
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,475
The balance is perfect.

1141
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,210
Who did such a great job?

1142
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,148
There must've been
many chefs in the palace.

1143
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,084
At times, I'd want to ask,
"Hey, who was in charge?"

1144
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,053
"Was it Nam-no's shift today?"

1145
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,022
I'M IN CHARGE OF TASTING

1146
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,759
He's a new chef
we recruited out on the street.

1147
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,294
-Good one.
-Do you approve of him?

1148
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,930
But he is not yet married, Your Majesty.

1149
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,399
That's his life.

1150
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,836
That's his life? It's his responsibility.

1151
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,938
-That was excellent.
-He's so funny.

1152
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,608
He begins to try both dishes in turn.

1153
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,277
His Majesty is busy eating.

1154
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,745
Mmm.

1155
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,580
-Yes.
-Your Majesty.

1156
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,750
Please compliment the chef
who made this dish too.

1157
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,185
Hey, who made this?

1158
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,890
It was Chef Ji-sun, Your Majesty.

1159
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,292
She always does an excellent job.

1160
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,996
She always does.

1161
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,832
She has won five rounds in a row.

1162
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,034
Watch it. We may lose her to the Qing.

1163
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,936
THE MOST WANTED BY THE QING

1164
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,739
-We'll make sure she stays with us.
-Be careful.

1165
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,208
-Tell them she's not around.
-She's not around.

1166
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,111
Let's try Chef Ji-sun's dish first.

1167
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,280
YUM

1168
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,284
A BIG BITE

1169
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,853
This is basically a Western dish.

1170
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,689
It'll taste good as pasta.

1171
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,257
INHALING

1172
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,492
Whoa.

1173
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,261
It seems too spicy for Pani Bottle.

1174
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,996
What's wrong?

1175
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,065
His forehead is all sweaty.

1176
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,133
Was it that spicy?

1177
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,837
It was a bit spicier
than what I could take.

1178
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:44,208
But it was delicious.
It was like spicy tomato pasta.

1179
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,709
<i>The pork was excellent.</i>

1180
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,011
<i>-I liked the crunchy deep-fried pork.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

1181
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,680
INHALE, EXHALE

1182
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,249
The level of spiciness was

1183
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,685
tailored to Car, the Garden's preference.

1184
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,955
The flavor itself included
sourness, sweetness, and spiciness,

1185
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,957
so it was too spicy for Pani Bottle,

1186
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,292
but in my case,
it'll make me sweat like a pig

1187
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,861
and help relieve my hangover.

1188
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,562
You'll sweat as you eat it.

1189
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,265
Next, King, the Garden,

1190
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,167
-made by Chef Jong-won.
-King, the Garden.

1191
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,902
SLURPING

1192
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,073
EVERYTHING IN ONE BITE

1193
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,343
DELIGHTED

1194
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,111
I love the soup.

1195
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,946
It tastes very luxurious.

1196
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:27,951
THIS TIME,
HE DEVOURS IT WITHOUT A WORD

1197
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:29,920
SLURP

1198
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,355
How did he make this?

1199
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,825
NOTICES

1200
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,628
You must like this one.

1201
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,164
Goodness, Pani Bottle.

1202
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,899
It tastes like beef and radish soup.

1203
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,066
It does.

1204
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,569
-It's subtle and delicious.
-Is it?

1205
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,771
EVERY SINGLE DROP

1206
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,508
-Kings didn't eat anything too spicy.
-It was delicious.

1207
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,912
No one would hate this flavor.
It was so good.

1208
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,982
This soup was spicy
and full of all kinds of flavors,

1209
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,785
but this soup helped us gulp it down,

1210
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,687
gentle like tai chi.

1211
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,523
It was gentle yet powerful.

1212
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,292
A taste like tai chi.

1213
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,695
He cooked the instant rice
between 30 seconds to a minute.

1214
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,597
<i>I wondered if it would've been cooked,</i>

1215
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,200
but it was cooked to al dente
after he put it in here.

1216
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,935
-That was why they were firm.
-The rice was delicious.

1217
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,370
-It was like rice soup.
-It was.

1218
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,139
I could feel every single grain.

1219
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,308
If he didn't do that,
it would've turned into porridge.

1220
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,278
-It was a part of the plan.
-You paid attention to that too?

1221
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,847
He just shut his eyes

1222
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,582
to admit that everything was planned.

1223
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:32,716
JONG-WON PLANNED EVERYTHING

1224
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,751
He's glad he recognized it.

1225
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,819
All right.

1226
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:39,756
Now, the fridge owner
must come to a decision.

1227
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:43,427
Which one was better for relieving
your hangover, Car, the Garden?

1228
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,028
<i>Press one for Son Jong-won</i>

1229
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,231
<i>and two for Jung Ji-sun.</i>

1230
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:51,235
Press the button, Your Majesty!

1231
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,237
IT'S NOT EASY FOR HIM TO CHOOSE

1232
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,838
Your Majesty!

1233
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,374
You must pick only one.

1234
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,276
I did.

1235
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,813
Did you? It wasn't easy
for His Majesty to decide.

1236
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,381
Will it be Jong-won's Korean cuisine?

1237
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,383
Or Ji-sun's Chinese cuisine?

1238
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,051
Who won? Let's find out!

1239
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,188
He wanted the best hangover relief dish.

1240
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,356
It was Car, the Garden.

1241
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,393
Will Chef Ji-sun break the record
for the longest winning streak?

1242
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,865
Or will Chef Jong-won break
Ji-sun's winning streak?

1243
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,035
Who did Car, the Garden choose?

1244
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,637
Whose dish was it?

1245
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,938
The winner is…

1246
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,707
The winner is…

1247
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:31,775
The winner…

1248
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,043
JUNG JI-SUN WINS

1249
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,646
JUNG JI-SUN'S GOT HOT AND SOUR SOUP WINS

1250
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,849
It was Ji-sun!
This is her sixth win in a row!

1251
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,317
This is her sixth win!

1252
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,519
She breaks the record.

1253
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,355
-That was crazy.
-Great work.

1254
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,090
-Yes.
-He couldn't stop her.

1255
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,759
Was there a reason, Your Majesty?

1256
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,628
The difference was like 51 to 49.

1257
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,697
-It was that slim.
-I see.

1258
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,599
People who love to drink

1259
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,235
want to keep drinking the next day,

1260
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,804
and this dish would've helped me do that.

1261
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,905
However,

1262
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,541
I thought of this
as the last hangover relief.

1263
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,109
So I wanted to sweat a little

1264
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:09,579
and eat a spicy dish,
something I usually love.

1265
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,049
So if I had to pick
a hangover relief dish,

1266
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,116
it'd be this.

1267
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,285
You both love to drink,
so you were on the same page.

1268
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,120
Drinkers need to sweat a little.

1269
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:20,390
Who's going to stop Chef Ji-sun now?

1270
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,092
-Her win rate is 100%.
-No brakes.

1271
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,495
Please put a star on Chef Ji-sun.

1272
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,130
This is her sixth victory!

1273
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,231
Congratulations.

1274
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,934
This is Ji-sun's sixth victory.
Congratulations!

1275
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,338
Her win rate is still 100%.

1276
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,472
Chef Jong-won should read

1277
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,976
-that school kid's letter again.
-You're right.

1278
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,645
I'll end up making him cry again.

1279
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,816
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with Car, the Garden's ingredients.</i>

1280
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:48,118
This is a dish for Car, the Garden,
who loves Spam

1281
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,786
more than premium Korean beef.

1282
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:53,023
The order is called,
"Car, the Garden, loaded with Spam."

1283
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,294
This next round is
between the show-off, Chef Hyun-suk

1284
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,931
and the knockoff chef, Poong.

1285
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:05,235
Poong currently sits in the second place
right after Chef Hyun-suk.

1286
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,970
People around me would ask,

1287
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,606
"Are Poong's dishes actually good?"

1288
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,241
When they ask me that,

1289
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,044
I always say, "He has a point,"
and here's what I mean.

1290
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,980
When drunk boxing was
first presented to the world,

1291
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,484
other martial artists
must've thought it was ridiculous.

1292
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,819
But when they pretend to fall over,
you must watch out

1293
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,054
because that's when they'll attack.

1294
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,589
If you look at his process…

1295
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,823
DRUNKEN BOXER, POONG

1296
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,493
…he lowers the expectation very much.

1297
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,029
-He makes the chefs lose their guard.
-You're right.

1298
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,297
-He makes the chefs lose their guard.
-You're right.

1299
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,466
Also, he has to make sure

1300
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,802
the dish is delicious,
and that there's a point.

1301
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,672
If he's the drunken boxer,
what's your specialty?

1302
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,175
There are many different kinds,

1303
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,345
-but I'll use the apricot blossom moves.
-Apricot blossom?

1304
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,647
The things I show…

1305
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,882
The things I show…

1306
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,818
CHAPTER 1: APRICOT BLOSSOM PALM BLAST!

1307
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,154
They're making a huge scene.

1308
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,156
Are we in a studio or Shaolin Temple?

1309
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,126
I'm a viewer who has watched
their rivalry for a long time.

1310
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,194
HE WATCHED THE RIVALS(?)

1311
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:09,232
One thing I loved was how Chef Hyun-suk
would always nag at Poong.

1312
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,169
But he won't listen to anything.

1313
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,771
It's the kind of dynamic I love.

1314
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,873
We got our hands on a voice recording.

1315
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,175
Poong said

1316
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,877
a Spam dish Hyun-suk will make is

1317
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,980
way too easy to guess.

1318
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,315
Is it too cliché?

1319
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,584
He'll grind it.

1320
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,453
-Will he grind it?
-Yes.

1321
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,223
He'll probably grind it
and make something like soup.

1322
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,394
It's because I've seen him do this.

1323
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,030
So there are some things I can predict.

1324
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,665
Will you grind the Spam?

1325
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,934
Well…

1326
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,170
My dish is ever-changing.

1327
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,240
I'll split it
into the smallest possible unit

1328
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,708
to reinterpret the ingredient.

1329
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,276
He's going to grind it.

1330
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,478
He will.

1331
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:57,013
-Let's find out what it's called.
-Shall we?

1332
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,482
Then we'll know what's up.

1333
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,519
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS: SPAM,
TRUFFLE POTATO SOUP, FRANKFURTER, MILK

1334
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,789
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
APPLE CINNAMON JAM, SPAM, CABBAGE

1335
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,692
My dish is called

1336
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,627
Spam-some Choi.

1337
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,462
-Spam-some Choi?
-Spam-some Choi?

1338
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,798
Are you saying you're good-looking
or was that Spam?

1339
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,834
Car, the Garden is
such a good-looking man,

1340
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,136
so I'll make a handsome dish.

1341
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,606
I want to make something and show you

1342
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,908
that this ingredient can taste luxurious.

1343
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,577
So will you grind Spam or not?

1344
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,214
I'll cut down the Spam
into tiny molecules.

1345
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,650
-Jeez.
-Jeez, he'll grind it.

1346
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,685
-Molecules?
-Tiny molecules.

1347
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,388
How are you going to reduce it?

1348
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,790
It'll look like soup,

1349
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,661
-but it's actually velouté.
-I see.

1350
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,496
Velouté is a type of soup.

1351
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,098
It's just a different word.

1352
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,466
-It's soup?
-Yes.

1353
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,034
Why did you make it sound so hard?

1354
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,937
I got scared for no reason.

1355
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,940
Also, I won't serve just one mild dish.

1356
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,410
I'm going to make Japanese-style fritters
and serve it together.

1357
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,179
-You'll grind it and deep-fry it, right?
-Yes.

1358
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,748
It was exactly what I expected.

1359
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:05,815
He's so predictable.

1360
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,384
-Yes.
-You can read him like a book.

1361
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,786
Let me make a prediction on Poong's dish.

1362
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,489
-I know he'll deep-fry it.
-I see.

1363
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,591
What are you making, Poong?

1364
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,027
My dish is titled

1365
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,696
Spam Mail.

1366
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,332
-Spam Mail.
-I want to block him.

1367
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:25,001
-Nice name.
-I'll block him right away.

1368
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,037
In my case,

1369
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,572
it's different from his prediction.

1370
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,107
I'll coat it with starch

1371
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:34,177
and fuse it with some cooking oil.

1372
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,546
That's a new kind of recipe.

1373
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:40,016
I'd like to create a new kind of texture.

1374
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,751
-It'll seem different.
-Sure.

1375
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,955
Anyone can deep-fry Spam,
so how do you qualify as a Spam expert?

1376
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,790
Do you have a secret?

1377
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,858
-Yes?
-It'll taste almost like Chinese food.

1378
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,961
-Like Chinese food?
-Yes.

1379
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,096
He'll make chili oil again.

1380
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,599
If I had to make a comparison,
it's like crispy sweet and sour pork.

1381
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,734
-Crispy sweet and sour pork.
-It might be similar.

1382
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,637
Not only will it have
a different kind of texture,

1383
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,706
but it'll also be salty enough,

1384
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:05,408
so I'm sure he'll like it
more than fresh meat.

1385
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,711
You're always within predictions.

1386
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,813
I know all about your moves too.

1387
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,281
Break it off.

1388
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:14,484
The 15 minutes will begin soon.

1389
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,519
He's a culinary expert
of canned food recipes,

1390
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,623
Spam expert, Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

1391
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,459
But this man wants
to report Poong as spam mail.

1392
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,628
Chef Choi Hyun-suk is up.

1393
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,231
Which one of them will show
the fanciest makeover for Spam?

1394
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,201
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1395
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,004
Begin!

1396
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,575
He's using the huge can of Spam.

1397
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,877
-He's really using the big one.
-He is.

1398
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,112
That's the old opener.

1399
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,647
Like how it is in the army?

1400
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:44,881
-Whoa.
-Yes, I know.

1401
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,117
If it breaks in the middle,
it'll be troublesome.

1402
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,918
That used to be how we opened Spam.

1403
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,254
-It's a huge problem if it breaks.
-True.

1404
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,322
It's so hard to open.

1405
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,791
It'll take up a lot of time too.

1406
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:55,859
Roll it carefully.

1407
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:59,162
How big is that? I didn't check it.

1408
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,897
It's been a minute already.

1409
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,332
Thirty seconds.

1410
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,700
I lost a minute already?

1411
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:04,901
Dang it.

1412
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:05,935
"Dang it."

1413
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,637
IT TAKES FOREVER
TO OPEN THE HUGE CAN

1414
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,040
Spam for restaurants is huge.

1415
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,508
He did it.

1416
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,777
GET READY TO SEE IT

1417
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,514
IMPOSING

1418
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,782
That's what I'm talking about.

1419
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,884
-It's like a high-rise apartment.
-It is?

1420
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,552
That was shocking.

1421
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,120
-It's like a loaf of bread.
-Yes.

1422
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,723
What will he do with it?

1423
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,793
-Just the center.
-I think he'll scoop it out.

1424
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,095
-Will you scoop out the center?
-I will.

1425
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,664
He might use it as a bowl later.

1426
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,367
I have a feeling he'll do just that.

1427
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,669
It's as if he's scooping out watermelon.

1428
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,104
He's doing something weird again.

1429
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,473
Low-key, it's giving off bowl vibes.

1430
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,008
"Giving off bowl vibes."

1431
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,244
Everyone thinks
it'll obviously turn into a bowl.

1432
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,946
I saw a bunch of influencers do this,

1433
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,381
and I always wanted to try it.

1434
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,384
Why won't anyone watch me chop?

1435
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,819
He's chopping an onion.

1436
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,921
Well, this round is…

1437
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,990
-Poong was way too out there.
-He was.

1438
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,626
Seeing him scooping out Spam is more fun.

1439
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,428
IN THAT WHILE,
HYUN-SUK CHOPPED GREEN ONION

1440
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,597
AND SOME ONION TOO

1441
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,798
HE ALSO OPENED A CAN OF SPAM

1442
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,633
AND MADE LONG SLICES

1443
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,336
THE END OF HIS AIRTIME

1444
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,339
-Why is this taking so long?
-Jeez.

1445
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:21,611
There's so much Spam on the inside.
It's taking a while to scoop it out.

1446
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,079
It looks like a ship.

1447
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,248
-It does.
-It'll be over if he ruins that.

1448
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,649
IS HE BUILDING A SHIP?

1449
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,518
Will the Spam you scooped out
turn into fries?

1450
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:29,586
Yes.

1451
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,321
That's a lot.

1452
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,189
So that Spam will be the bowl.

1453
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,493
There's a rip on one side.

1454
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,994
-There's a hole.
-Yes.

1455
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,863
-Poor construction.
-Yes.

1456
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,831
It's starting to fall apart.

1457
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,801
He dug up the loaf of Spam

1458
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:47,504
-and puts the bowl…
-Into the oven?

1459
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,739
He'll bake it and use it as a bowl.

1460
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,875
HE'LL BAKE IT AND TURN IT INTO A BOWL!

1461
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:52,942
FRANKFURTER

1462
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,444
REMOVING THE STICK

1463
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,646
Chef Hyun-suk is now…

1464
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:57,914
He doesn't grind anything yet.

1465
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,083
Will he fry it in oil?

1466
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,885
He'll probably stir-fry them first
before grinding them.

1467
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,319
-Will he?
-Yes.

1468
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,954
STIR-FRYING

1469
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,025
What did you put in?

1470
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,094
I saw potato soup, so I'm putting that in.

1471
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,530
-Potato soup?
-Potato soup.

1472
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,866
Chef Hyun-suk put in potato soup,

1473
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,368
and that method is called potage.

1474
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,237
It's usually made with bacon
instead of sausage and Spam.

1475
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,039
I think he's making cream soup with Spam.

1476
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,974
I see. That looks good.

1477
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,644
-Spam, milk, and…
-Potato soup.

1478
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,711
And milk.

1479
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,280
ARE YOU WATCHING ME?

1480
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,750
Hyun-suk is about to grind everything.

1481
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,084
Spam went in.

1482
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,655
He's going to grind it and use it.

1483
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,523
What's this huge sound?

1484
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,659
2. REDUCE THE SPAM POTATO SOUP
INTO THE SIZE OF ITS MOLECULES

1485
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,461
The soup is grinding loudly.

1486
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:48,598
Will Webtoon Artist Poong really make
crispy sweet and sour pork?

1487
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,934
3. MIX STARCH AND WATER
TO COAT SPAM WITH BATTER

1488
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,669
He's coating it with starch.

1489
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,571
-Is it usually so watery?
-It's too watery.

1490
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,805
Isn't it too thin?

1491
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,507
What's he doing? He'll fry those?

1492
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,675
It looks a bit too thin.

1493
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,344
-He needs more starch.
-Add more starch.

1494
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,613
Add more starch, Poong!

1495
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,983
-It looks like watermelon <i>hwachae</i>.
-<i>Hwachae?</i>

1496
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,451
Will it turn into the crispy fries?

1497
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,353
The crispy fried pork pieces.

1498
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,855
INTO THE OIL!

1499
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,023
Okay. Good.

1500
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:15,992
4. FUSE SPAM AND BATTER WITH OIL

1501
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,828
He coated Spam with starch
and began to deep-fry it.

1502
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,230
The starch was too…

1503
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,297
WORRIED

1504
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:24,667
The batter was too watery,
so it'll stick to each other.

1505
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,203
-Isn't the batter too thin?
-It looks too watery.

1506
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,271
They'll stick to each other.

1507
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,106
-Right?
-He won't budge.

1508
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,242
-Chef Ji-sun makes a point.
-He won't listen.

1509
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,676
The fries will get stuck.

1510
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,812
It looks too watery.

1511
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,447
The batter still looks too thin.

1512
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,549
I think he has a plan.

1513
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,918
He wants to make the batter
as thin as possible.

1514
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,119
He had a reason?

1515
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,388
He must have a reason
to have made the batter thin.

1516
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:49,459
Chef Hyun-suk is also using starch.

1517
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,060
He's making the batter.

1518
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,464
He'll deep-fry that.

1519
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,665
-Will he?
-Yes.

1520
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,969
THE SPAM MIX IS DOWN TO ITS MOLECULES

1521
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,238
-Whoa.
-The Spam soup.

1522
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,807
He ground the Spam,
and it turned out like porridge.

1523
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,109
Whoa.

1524
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,477
Hey.

1525
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,779
-It looks like my cat's snack.
-Spam turned into porridge.

1526
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,281
SCRATCHED

1527
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:12,916
The cat snack…

1528
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,951
I have to push it out like this.

1529
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,185
Cat snack?

1530
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:17,554
Is that Spam porridge?

1531
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,556
It really is like a cat snack.

1532
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,824
It looks like strawberry yogurt.

1533
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,992
Strawberry yogurt?

1534
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,294
It looks like that too.

1535
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,728
The color is a bit…

1536
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,397
A DEEPLY CONCERNED SIGH

1537
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,135
-You don't like the color?
-It's a cat snack.

1538
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,070
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

1539
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:38,741
4. STRAIN THE HAM PURÉE AND BOIL AGAIN

1540
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,512
Let's look at Poong's fried Spam.

1541
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,846
What?

1542
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,515
What's that?

1543
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,685
Everything is stuck together!

1544
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,720
It was just as Ji-sun warned!

1545
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,856
It doesn't look right.
They all became one.

1546
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,125
-You should just do it over.
-The Spam pieces became one.

1547
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:59,362
-No, I got this.
-Poong looks flustered.

1548
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,130
I have no idea what he's making.

1549
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,600
Do you remember that I have to eat it?

1550
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,269
Please don't forget.

1551
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,106
Chef Ji-sun's warning became a reality.

1552
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,208
I thought the fried pieces
would look like sweet and sour pork.

1553
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,277
What?

1554
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,012
It looks like
deep-fried pink fish meat sausages.

1555
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,313
It does.

1556
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,881
-That's hot!
-It's hot!

1557
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,287
Why didn't he add more starch?

1558
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:25,388
A SCRAPER

1559
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,623
INTO BOILING OIL?

1560
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,558
ARE YOU WATCHING ME?

1561
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,626
-Huh?
-Huh?

1562
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,294
-He heats it up in the oil.
-What's he doing?

1563
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,329
He's just asking for attention.

1564
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,664
Really? No reason?

1565
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,266
DID YOU SEE THAT?

1566
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,368
I didn't.

1567
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,472
HE SHAPES IT BEAUTIFULLY…

1568
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:45,475
AND INTO THE OIL!

1569
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:49,479
WHAT DOES IT TAKE
FOR ME TO GET YOUR ATTENTION?

1570
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,582
NOT EVEN THIS?

1571
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,952
WHAT IF I ADORN IT IMPRESSIVELY?

1572
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,055
-Chef Hyun-suk is also flickering stuff.
-Yes.

1573
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,257
ALL ATTENTION ON HIM

1574
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,459
-All right.
-Wait!

1575
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:07,897
YOU'RE LIKE A DANCING APRICOT TREE

1576
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,966
The apricot tree skills.

1577
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,368
I'm making crunchy batter bits.

1578
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,003
I'M THE CRUDE MUSIC NEXT TO YOU

1579
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,071
Come on!

1580
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,440
-He screams out.
-What is this?

1581
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,441
The previous round

1582
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,577
<i>seemed like two veteran chefs were</i>
<i>cooking for the king.</i>

1583
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:22,712
But now, it's as if the king went,

1584
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,715
"Hey, you two. Start a cook-off."

1585
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,918
So it feels more like
a cooking competition.

1586
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,286
"Make it funny."

1587
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,354
HIS SKILLS ONLY LEFT A MESS

1588
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,389
-This is a close fight.
-The apricot blossom skills.

1589
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,091
Hyun-suk's apricot blossom skills.

1590
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,859
Hyun-suk's apricot blossom skills.

1591
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,562
THESE WERE JUST MOVES
UNTIL YOU NOTICED ME

1592
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,030
Come on!

1593
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:46,736
5. DEEP-FRY THE HAM
AND VEGETABLE MIX

1594
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:51,441
What's he doing now?
He's adding something else

1595
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,942
-into the Spam purée.
-It was milk.

1596
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,010
I added milk.

1597
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,611
MIX THE PURÉE WITH MILK
AND MAKE SPAM VELOUTÉ

1598
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,750
POONG BEGINS TO MAKE THE SAUCE

1599
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,387
-Is that water?
-Yes, it's water.

1600
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,888
-Starch?
-And jam.

1601
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,157
He mixed water, starch, and apple jam.

1602
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,960
Pork and apple jam are
a great mix in Western cuisine.

1603
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,462
He's using apple jam?

1604
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,163
That's fine dining style.

1605
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,598
Oh, is it?

1606
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,700
-It's really far from anything fine.
-That's fine dining?

1607
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,302
-How so?
-Just that mix.

1608
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:22,071
-Look, sugar.
-He added sugar after starch?

1609
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,706
-Is that vinegar?
-Yes.

1610
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,576
-It looks really weird.
-He's putting in everything.

1611
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,911
-Is that soy sauce?
-He adds soy sauce too.

1612
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,079
It's different.

1613
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,614
I'm sorry to say this,

1614
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,583
but may I leave you with this?

1615
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,151
I get the feeling that I've been had.

1616
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,520
Shouldn't he add starch later?

1617
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,555
He hasn't heated it up yet.

1618
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:42,325
He's trying to control the consistency,

1619
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,061
-and we put everything in but the starch.
-We still have time.

1620
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,229
I think that's what he wanted.

1621
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:47,997
You have only 6 minutes and 30 seconds.

1622
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,666
-Fry those once again.
-Once again.

1623
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,435
-It's still thin.
-It still is.

1624
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,804
-It's too thin.
-Add more starch.

1625
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:58,141
-Is that it?
-Anyone can see that it's too thin.

1626
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,277
-No, that won't work.
-Try it again.

1627
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:02,712
-It's too thin.
-Come on!

1628
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,747
Stop telling me what to do!

1629
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,517
He must have a reason
for keeping the batter thin.

1630
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,985
The color looks weird.

1631
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,420
The color… Wait.

1632
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,488
That's just raw meat.

1633
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,357
-Right?
-You're right.

1634
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,592
-Five minutes.
-There are five minutes left.

1635
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,427
-Please go to the kitchen, Jung-hwan!
-Sure.

1636
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,830
Let me report back from the kitchen.

1637
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,666
Chef Hyun-suk is using
his apricot blossom skills.

1638
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,067
He's currently our top chef.

1639
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,003
Something smells good.

1640
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,038
I don't know what, but it smells good.

1641
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,374
Try that. The Spam purée.

1642
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,809
The boiling soup.

1643
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,844
I don't know if I'll like this.

1644
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,179
Why not?

1645
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,147
The color doesn't look as bad.

1646
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,649
Why do you look so gloomy?

1647
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,751
No, I'm fine. No.

1648
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,953
Did I look gloomy just now?

1649
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,389
-Jung-hwan!
-Let me try this.

1650
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:49,125
-Sure.
-It's the Spam purée soup.

1651
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,594
It must taste strong. So?

1652
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,496
It looks good.

1653
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,730
What's it like?

1654
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,200
Does it taste handsome?

1655
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,135
It tastes like bacon.

1656
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,304
Bacon?

1657
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,340
It tastes like grilled,
no, deep-fried bacon.

1658
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,109
9. TOP SPAM VELOUTÉ WITH EGG YOLK

1659
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,177
Now, cameraman.

1660
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,712
-Please get a shot of this.
-Sure.

1661
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,380
Why does it look like this?

1662
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,916
He's shaking it around.

1663
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,585
Whoa, it's a swirl.

1664
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,320
-It's an egg yolk.
-Yes.

1665
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,222
The shape is changing.

1666
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,823
-Whoa.
-That's cool.

1667
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,158
It's tai chi.

1668
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,926
-It was a plus sign.
-I feel dizzy.

1669
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,828
It must be the apricot blossom skill.

1670
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,332
-Hey, Hyun-suk.
-This looks very pretty.

1671
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:33,135
-Are those veggie fritters?
-He's going to double fry those.

1672
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,470
He double fries those.

1673
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,305
Poong is doing the same thing.

1674
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:43,079
6. COAT THE FRIED SPAM
WITH ANOTHER LAYER OF BATTER AND DEEP-FRY

1675
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:44,981
The fries are turning pale.

1676
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,384
-Is that so?
-I'm glad he didn't use too much starch.

1677
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,186
-I get it.
-There it is.

1678
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:54,891
It looked odd just before,
but it looks more like crispy pork fries.

1679
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,894
-Cabbage?
-He's chopping cabbage.

1680
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,063
I'm dying to see what's in here,
the whole Spam.

1681
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,698
Right?

1682
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,734
It's shedding lots of sweat.

1683
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,136
It's losing the grease.

1684
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,472
Anyway, what's this again?

1685
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,208
-The sauce for the fried Spam.
-Fried Spam sauce.

1686
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,977
HE QUIETLY FINISHES
FRYING THEM THE 2ND TIME

1687
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:19,548
AND SERVES IT CAREFULLY ON A DISH

1688
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,384
-Is that the sauce?
-Yes.

1689
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,985
Chef Hyun-suk is done!

1690
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,288
Chef Hyun-suk is already done.

1691
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,856
You have two minutes.

1692
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,658
May I try this sauce?

1693
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,426
Yes, that sauce is important.

1694
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:34,997
-It looks like crispy fried pork.
-It should look like it.

1695
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,732
-The fried pork looks good.
-Nice color.

1696
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,534
What's in this sauce again?

1697
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,504
Apple jam, soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar.

1698
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,774
Will it be a Spam Mail?

1699
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,909
The sauce is very important.

1700
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,678
What does it taste like?

1701
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,446
What's it like?

1702
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,815
Car, the Garden!

1703
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,718
-You should be glad you're here today.
-Really?

1704
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,054
You shouldn't regret it. It's good!

1705
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,789
THE DRUNKEN BOXER DID IT!

1706
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:00,856
It's good.

1707
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,692
THE WHOLE SPAM SHOWS UP

1708
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,360
-All done. Okay.
-You're done.

1709
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,861
The dish is made of Spam.

1710
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,830
The apple jam made the sauce delicious.

1711
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,399
-The bowl is ready.
-It's too hot!

1712
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,268
HE MOVES IT HERE AND THERE

1713
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:13,703
BUT IT'S STILL HOT

1714
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:16,806
It's way too hot. What now?

1715
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,207
No, it's too hot.

1716
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,375
Let me pull this out.

1717
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,577
That's hot! It's freaking hot!

1718
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,647
-Use this.
-You have a minute.

1719
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,982
-A spatula.
-Lift it.

1720
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,217
-I got this.
-Drop it.

1721
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,953
-All done. Thank you.
-What else?

1722
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,121
Darn it. This is so hot!

1723
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,093
AS ALWAYS, IT'S ANOTHER CHAOS

1724
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,728
-Okay.
-Lay out some cabbage.

1725
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,397
-In the Spam bowl.
-You have 40 seconds.

1726
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,966
-The sauce. Will you pour it later?
-Yes.

1727
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,868
Let me hold my ear for a moment.

1728
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,136
-It was too hot.
-That's good.

1729
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,637
-Poong, you too.
-Car, the Garden looks pleased.

1730
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,406
-I love it.
-All right.

1731
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,342
-Pour the sauce on the Spam.
-The sauce!

1732
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,744
POURING THE APPLE CINNAMON SAUCE!

1733
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,145
-It looks good.
-Twenty-five seconds.

1734
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:57,213
Yes, it looks good.

1735
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,115
HE DID THIS?

1736
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,883
-Twenty seconds!
-Twenty seconds.

1737
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,352
-You have to finish up!
-He can't eat all that.

1738
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:04,420
What's that? The sauce?

1739
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,822
-Extra sauce?
-Yes, in the dish.

1740
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,524
He may want more.

1741
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,959
You now have ten seconds!

1742
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,995
-Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.
-Nine. Eight. Seven.

1743
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:16,565
-Six. Five. Four.
-Look at his face!

1744
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,267
A BIG SMILE

1745
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,636
Four. Three.

1746
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,904
He's done!

1747
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,907
Did I have a stern look on my face?

1748
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:28,377
-That was legendary.
-That's how he'll use that?

1749
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:31,447
-The batter was perfect.
-I wasn't disappointed with that round.

1750
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,982
-You're the best.
-It looks good.

1751
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,484
Has anyone ever said,
"It's freaking hot" before?

1752
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,890
Both Spam dishes were made
just for Car, the Garden.

1753
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,325
I'm curious, so I want to try them now.

1754
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,928
First, Spam-some Choi.

1755
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,765
FRIED SPAM AND VEGGIES
SERVED WITH SPAM VELOUTÉ

1756
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,537
A MEAL FILLED ONLY WITH SPAM

1757
01:07:55,871 --> 01:08:00,042
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S SPAM-SOME CHOI

1758
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,244
How should he eat this?

1759
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:05,014
Top the fritter on the soup…

1760
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,682
No, I mean, velouté,

1761
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,717
and enjoy them together.

1762
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,619
It's velouté, not soup.

1763
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,687
All the way?

1764
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,756
Yes, put it in, break it with a spoon,
and eat it together.

1765
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,224
I see. That sounds good.

1766
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,060
-It's…
-It breaks easily.

1767
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,096
Spam will taste luxurious.

1768
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:21,931
CURIOUS

1769
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:26,302
Spam soup, I mean, velouté, and fritters.

1770
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,139
WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE?

1771
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,740
It's good.

1772
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,078
-Why did you stutter?
-What just happened?

1773
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,848
-He froze up.
-His face doesn't look good.

1774
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,983
It's as if I'm in high… No, middle school.

1775
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,751
It feels like my mom knew
my favorite food was Spam,

1776
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,487
so in the morning,

1777
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,889
she decided to blend it
to tell me to chug it.

1778
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,092
"Drink this! You like Spam!"

1779
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,961
Just like how she'd make apple juice.

1780
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:55,064
As he said, I could sense the flavor
filling up my mouth.

1781
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,500
CAR, THE GARDEN

1782
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,934
EATS VERY WELL

1783
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,103
-Try it with the fritter.
-Nice.

1784
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,005
Does it taste classy?

1785
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,541
-It tastes like smoked bacon.
-Right?

1786
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,444
-It has a strong taste of smoked bacon.
-It's a wonder.

1787
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,646
When I eat it with the fritter,

1788
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:15,251
it almost feels like the main dish,
although it's soup.

1789
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,586
I've never seen a better gourmet than him.

1790
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:18,487
I see.

1791
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,023
It was my wish
to turn it into the main dish,

1792
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,391
and you noticed.

1793
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,526
I'm happy for the day.

1794
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,561
You don't have to win a star?

1795
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,196
This is very good.

1796
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,665
It begins with Spam and ends with Spam.

1797
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,601
-This is probably a perfect Spam soup.
-I see.

1798
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,437
-Thank you.
-It smells like smoked bacon.

1799
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,541
Next, Webtoon Artist Poong's dish.

1800
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,309
-Spam Mail.
-It looks like a loaf of bread.

1801
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:44,113
A BOWL MADE OF A HUGE LUMP OF SPAM

1802
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,918
FILLED WITH SWEET AND SOUR SPAM

1803
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,591
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S SPAM MAIL

1804
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,594
Here's how this dish feels.

1805
01:09:58,661 --> 01:09:59,662
It's as if Poong said,

1806
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,231
"Did you say you liked Spam that much?"

1807
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:05,134
"Go ahead and take this, then."
It feels like that.

1808
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,603
-That was my impression.
-I see.

1809
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,972
Do you think it's too much?

1810
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,707
It was the same for both dishes,

1811
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,410
but this one wasn't too much
when I tried it.

1812
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,313
Poong made Spam
look like crispy sweet and sour pork.

1813
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,949
-It looks good.
-It does.

1814
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,284
The sauce had a nice flavor.

1815
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,486
-It'll go well with the apple.
-The jam?

1816
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:26,488
-Right.
-Yes?

1817
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,990
It must taste good.

1818
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,892
-He likes it.
-It has to be too salty.

1819
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,928
I understand why JTBC

1820
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,664
pays Poong for starring in this show.

1821
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,032
TRANSLATION: WORTH THE MONEY

1822
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:40,035
-It sounds like a compliment.
-Capitalism is impartial.

1823
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:41,670
-The sauce is so good.
-Is it?

1824
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,006
-It was nice.
-I see.

1825
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,509
If I want to,
I can even eat this part, right?

1826
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,644
By destroying the wall?

1827
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,347
-Yes, you're right. You can do that.
-He's now destroying the bowl.

1828
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,749
Is the texture similar
to the crispy sweet and sour pork?

1829
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:57,019
The batter had a perfect texture
just like the crispy pork.

1830
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,988
Does it not taste too much like Spam?

1831
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,523
-No.
-I see.

1832
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,027
-No, it's Spam.
-It is?

1833
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,862
It'll taste like Spam as you chew.

1834
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,931
-There was cabbage too.
-You can mix them.

1835
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,700
I put out some cabbage
for you to neutralize the flavor.

1836
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,669
Yes, he put some cabbage at the bottom.

1837
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,871
This sauce is really good.

1838
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,273
It was.

1839
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,675
CLEANSING HIS PALATE WITH CABBAGE

1840
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,811
You knew he didn't like vegetables.
Why did you add cabbage?

1841
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:24,480
But if I didn't have cabbage…

1842
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,550
It's like he's desperately
grasping at straws.

1843
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,219
-His last drop of conscience.
-Thank you.

1844
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,588
-Can you take a bite of the bowl?
-Shall I?

1845
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,523
-Can you do that?
-Like this?

1846
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,226
Now, you can even eat it like this.

1847
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,329
I think his face is getting bloated
because of excessive sodium.

1848
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,832
I had one last bite and realized

1849
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,970
they filled my order exactly as I asked.

1850
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:50,639
<i>-Spam has a strong smell and flavor,</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1851
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:54,376
so it's a wonder how they did this.

1852
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,645
Now, we'll try

1853
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,914
Chef Hyun-suk's Spam-some Choi first.

1854
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,549
It's Spam-some Choi.

1855
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,152
ENJOYING

1856
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:07,523
It also tastes like
nutty ground chickpeas.

1857
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:08,857
When they're ground up.

1858
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,327
-Like hummus?
-Yes, like that.

1859
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:15,464
-The color reminds me of foie gras.
-Yes, foie gras pâté.

1860
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,666
It's very intense.

1861
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,368
I'm craving a glass of kaoliang.

1862
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,337
-Right.
-Kaoliang.

1863
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:24,306
There's a French dish called rillettes,
a meat spread.

1864
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,308
It tastes like a watery version of that.

1865
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:30,946
I thought it'd be delicious
if I got some bread and dipped it in this.

1866
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,817
Next, Webtoon Artist Poong's Spam Mail.

1867
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,587
-Let's open up this one.
-Okay.

1868
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,490
CRUNCH

1869
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,892
The batter tastes so good.

1870
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,627
AMAZED…

1871
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,730
If I didn't know this was Spam,

1872
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,165
I would've thought it was made with pork.

1873
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,633
It's so good.

1874
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,135
I love the chewy texture too.

1875
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,671
It has everything,
including nuttiness and sweetness.

1876
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,740
Spam is salty,

1877
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:00,042
so the batter on the outside…

1878
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,177
-Makes it taste perfect.
-Yes, the seasoning is perfect.

1879
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,514
He scooped it out with a spoon
instead of cutting it out with a knife,

1880
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,349
so the frying batter coated it thoroughly.

1881
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,650
You must've enjoyed it.

1882
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,619
-Are you finished with it?
-Yes.

1883
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:11,787
May I have another one?

1884
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,923
Look at Pani Bottle.

1885
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,492
He wants more.

1886
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,262
A mix of pork, apple, and cinnamon is
often used in French cuisine.

1887
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:23,165
It's like a mix
you'd find in fine dining dishes.

1888
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,201
I was surprised
that it tasted very classy.

1889
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,737
-We must ask Chef Ji-sun to know for sure.
-Yes.

1890
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:29,805
What do you think?

1891
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,907
The process made me really nervous,

1892
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,275
but this is well-made.

1893
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:37,780
<i>I was worried</i>
<i>he used too much starch in the sauce</i>

1894
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:41,083
<i>and too little starch in the batter.</i>

1895
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,786
-But it's in great quality.
-Right?

1896
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,354
She was quite worried.

1897
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,857
When we make crispy sweet and sour pork,
we fry the pork in the batter many times.

1898
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,926
Did you do that intentionally?

1899
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,761
-You do that many times?
-Yes.

1900
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:55,531
That's how you create layers
and make it chewy.

1901
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,267
<i>So it was the right decision</i>
<i>to fry it twice.</i>

1902
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,402
-But you didn't know? No?
-I didn't.

1903
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:03,205
-I thought I ruined it.
-I see.

1904
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,373
But you were right.

1905
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,875
<i>Press one for Choi Hyun-suk</i>

1906
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,378
<i>and two for Kim Poong.</i>

1907
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:13,081
Please make your decision
and press the button!

1908
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,318
He already knows.

1909
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,353
-I pressed one.
-All right.

1910
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,255
This is Car, the Garden's decision.

1911
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:24,293
I wonder which one he liked better.
Let's find out.

1912
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,360
I can't tell.

1913
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:27,763
Car, the Garden, loaded with Spam.

1914
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,467
A new way of cooking with Spam.
Who'll be the winner? Poong or Hyun-suk?

1915
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:35,103
Will Poong finally win against Hyun-suk,
whom he has rarely beaten?

1916
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:40,175
Or will Hyun-suk secure his position
as the champion of the show?

1917
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,611
Poong versus Hyun-suk.

1918
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:43,879
Who won?

1919
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,681
Who's the winner?

1920
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,316
Who's the winner?

1921
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,984
Car, the Garden's choice!

1922
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,919
KIM POONG WINS

1923
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,754
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S SPAM MAIL WINS

1924
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,490
Poong wins!

1925
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:56,792
-The winner is Poong!
-The drunken boxer levels up.

1926
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,027
My gosh. Poong wins.

1927
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:02,498
STAGGERING

1928
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,732
The drunken boxer wins.

1929
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,667
How long has it been since this happened?

1930
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,437
This is his first victory
against Poong in the new season.

1931
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,772
Poong wins today.

1932
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,708
-He caught a big fish.
-He did.

1933
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,377
It was such an honor

1934
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,513
to have you two cook for me,

1935
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,348
someone I have always admired.

1936
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:23,852
I craved some rice or bread
to eat with this soup,

1937
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:26,722
but I could eat Poong's dish as is.

1938
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:30,926
That was the tiny little factor
that helped me choose this.

1939
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,863
Poong showed off his talent
worthy of the second place of the show

1940
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,299
and stopped the first place from winning.

1941
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,302
Don't you think you should brush up

1942
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,870
your martial arts skills some more?

1943
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,406
-Chef Hyun-suk?
-Right.

1944
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,708
-I saw through his moves.
-I see.

1945
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,011
Please put a star on Webtoon Artist Poong!

1946
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,782
My gosh. Poong won against Hyun-suk.

1947
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,785
-Thank you for the dish.
-Poong reclaims

1948
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,454
his spot as the second place of the show,
Congratulations!

1949
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,390
Congratulations!

1950
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,527
He's the top travel vlogger in Korea.

1951
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,396
I've visited 71 countries.

1952
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,565
Those are dates I got in Dubai.

1953
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,766
Sardines from Portugal.

1954
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,501
I got that when I went to Singapore.

1955
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,702
What are these?

1956
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,737
They sold space rations.

1957
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:16,838
Can they use this?

1958
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,373
It's the craziest yet.

1959
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,008
-It's a duty free store.
-Can we open it?

1960
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,343
Feel free to use everything.

1961
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,111
It's been a while,
so I wanted to binge eat.

1962
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,480
I'll show you how I ended up this big.

1963
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:26,882
<i>Their skills come from their sizes.</i>

1964
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,518
<i>-This will make you fat.</i>
<i>-It has to be good.</i>

1965
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,619
That looks so good.

1966
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,254
The kitchen looks full.

1967
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,388
Can you move to the side?

1968
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,957
They're tussling!

1969
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,124
THE KITCHEN IS FULL

1970
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,492
Let us begin

1971
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,761
the 15-minute cook-off for Pani Bottle!

1972
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,431
-<i>Ramyeon?</i>
-He'll do anything now.

1973
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:43,832
He uses everything boldly.

1974
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,400
He's making meringue!

1975
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:46,535
ARGH

1976
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,703
He must want to win badly.

1977
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,271
-Whoa.
-It's really something.

1978
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,739
Sung-jun keeps shaking it.

1979
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,107
Today will be a drinking party.

1980
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,809
So you're all after popping the bottle?

1981
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,148
We'll change your name
to Poppin' Bottle today.

1982
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:01,583
The guy who pops bottles.

1983
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,365
