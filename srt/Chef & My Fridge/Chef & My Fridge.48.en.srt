1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,251
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:21,721
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,890
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,360
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,497
WELCOME TO THE SHOW

6
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,999
Last week must've been
quite a journey for everyone.

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,468
You all got whipped by that fridge.

8
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,404
THE WORST FRIDGE HAS WHIPPED(?) THEM

9
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,472
-It was rough.
-Right?

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,473
DEEPLY SORRY

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,342
Woo-jae left these words with us.

12
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,210
If the chefs become complacent

13
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,279
-or lose their spark,
-In those times.

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,582
-he offered to return to the show.
-Please don't.

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,317
-Do not lose your spark.
-How scary.

16
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,054
Allow me to announce
that the fridges this week

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,156
-are completely different
-You're right.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,857
-There's a lot of stuff.
-from the previous episode.

19
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,758
Look forward to it.

20
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,493
-It's like a supermarket.
-That's right.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,063
Our two guests today

22
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,866
are the two biggest
<i>mukbang</i> creators in Korea.

23
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,401
Isn't that us?

24
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,803
Among the chefs, yes.

25
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,205
Please welcome today's fridge owners!

26
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,473
Come on out.

27
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,175
Today's guests.

28
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,209
-Who is it?
-I'm excited.

29
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,377
CURIOUS

30
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,412
The ladies with great appetites!

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,315
They're here!
The ladies with great appetites!

32
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,551
-Hello.
-Please welcome Tzuyang and Hatnim!

33
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,186
Welcome.

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,356
<i>She cultivated</i>

35
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,393
<i>12.6 million subscribers</i>
<i>just by doing </i>mukbang<i> shows.</i>

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,463
-And she now has the Diamond Button.
-Diamond?

37
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,797
Slaying the <i>mukbang</i> industry,

38
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,133
Tzuyang is here with us!

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,968
WELCOME

40
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,737
Hello. I'm a <i>mukbang </i>creator…

41
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,040
I eat… How do I say this?

42
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,308
You eat <i>mukbang?</i>

43
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,843
Well, you did eat the industry.

44
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,479
-The entire industry.
-She's nervous.

45
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,747
I'm here on an empty stomach.

46
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,648
She hasn't eaten.

47
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,817
-She hasn't eaten? That's frightening.
-That's big trouble.

48
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,786
I'm Tzuyang, a <i>mukbang</i> creator.

49
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,188
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU

50
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,756
Allow me to introduce the next guest.

51
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,726
<i>She gets easily bored with food,</i>
<i>but her </i>mukbang<i> career never got boring.</i>

52
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,528
This old lady eats a lot, right?

53
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,664
A <i>mukbang</i> creator of ten years,
the sunshine of the industry,

54
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,267
-please welcome Hatnim!
-Hello!

55
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,370
-It's great to have you.
-Hello.

56
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,073
I'm Kim Mi-kyung,
also known as Hatnim, the easily bored.

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,474
-Hello.
-Welcome to the show.

58
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,578
I hear this is the first time
you two are on a show together.

59
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,514
-Yes, it's the first time.
-Really?

60
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,383
It's a rare opportunity
to watch their <i>mukbang</i> simultaneously.

61
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,484
That's the thumbnail.

62
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,385
COMING RIGHT UP

63
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,857
A HISTORICAL RENDEZVOUS
OF THE TWO BIG EATERS

64
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,859
-I'm excited.
-Many people must be too.

65
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,594
-I have a question.
-Yes?

66
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,564
-Why the name "Hatnim, the easily bored"?
-I've been curious too.

67
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,833
I have trouble filling myself
with one kind of food.

68
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,867
I get bored easily.

69
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,103
The moment I get sick of it,
I can't eat more of it.

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,772
How much do you eat
before a type of food gets old?

71
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,176
Recently, about seven bags of <i>ramyeon</i>
seems enough to make me sick of it.

72
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,278
-Seven bags?
-Yes.

73
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,481
-Before, I used to be able to eat 16 bags.
-Did you say 16 bags?

74
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,383
-Sixteen?
-You could eat that much?

75
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,784
You ate 16 bags of <i>ramyeon?</i>

76
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,320
I said I get bored easily,
not that I have a small appetite.

77
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,290
-That's true.
-You did.

78
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,624
What about you, Tzuyang?

79
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,527
I've had up to 20 bags of <i>ramyeon.</i>

80
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,129
-Twenty?
-In one sitting.

81
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,730
HER RAMYEON MUKBANG IS ON ANOTHER SCALE

82
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,898
<i>That's the entire box.</i>

83
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,366
<i>She eats a whole box of</i> ramyeon.

84
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,168
She eats <i>ramyeon</i> by the box.

85
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,537
It must be so nice
not to get bored with one kind of food.

86
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,639
Just last year, Tzuyang here

87
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,242
accumulated ten million subscribers

88
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,779
and received the Diamond Button.

89
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,682
-Not many in Korea have one.
-Barely anyone.

90
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>The views amount to 3.4 billion.</i>

91
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,320
SHOCKED

92
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,189
We picked out a few memorable episodes.

93
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,691
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

94
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,858
What are you eating?

95
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,360
-<i>Gopchang</i>.
-Three pans?

96
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,996
-Wait, that's how she's eating it?
-Like that?

97
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,197
You didn't even cut it.

98
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,300
-That's so crazy.
-It looks delicious.

99
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,835
And you ordered <i>jeongol</i> too?

100
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,303
That looks good.

101
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,705
How does that fit in your stomach?

102
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,140
I had about 50 servings that day.

103
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,109
-Fifty servings?
-Around that number.

104
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,110
EXACTLY 40 SERVINGS

105
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,179
<i>This is her sushi </i>mukbang<i>.</i>

106
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,915
-Look at the dishes piling up.
-She eats so much.

107
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,683
She eats as much as an entire sports team.

108
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,318
LOSING HIS MIND

109
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,987
Someone your size can eat that much?

110
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,188
She's done now.

111
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,223
-She had 113 dishes.
-113 dishes.

112
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,891
AMAZED…

113
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,394
I can never eat like that.

114
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,596
I get too bored. I can't.

115
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,766
-Hatnim can't do that.
-She gets bored easily compared to her.

116
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,202
If that's how you eat on camera,
what about in everyday life?

117
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,038
I eat much more than that
in my everyday life.

118
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,173
SHE'S OUT OF THIS WORLD

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,241
That's true.

120
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,110
-It's true.
-On camera,

121
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,645
I dine for three to four hours.

122
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,247
-"Three to four"?
-From an hour to three, four hours.

123
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,750
But when I eat off camera,
I eat for about six hours.

124
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,351
-Six hours?
-You eat for six hours?

125
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,420
I usually eat for four to six hours.

126
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,122
Even when I'm done with <i>mukbang,</i>

127
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,257
I always go home
and make some <i>ramyeon</i> for myself.

128
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,059
How much did you starve in your past life?

129
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,396
You would've starved to death
if you were born in the Joseon era.

130
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,499
You would've had a whole mammoth
if you were born in the Stone Age.

131
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,567
WE'RE GLAD IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY

132
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,870
I have a question.
Have you suffered from indigestion?

133
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,905
Have you ever had your hand
pricked for relief?

134
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,573
-For indigestion.
-Yes, feeling sick.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,677
-Have you ever taken antacids?
-People turn pale with bad indigestion.

136
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,911
Have you ever had indigestion?

137
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,314
Unlike other episodes,

138
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,082
this one can just be a Q&A session.

139
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,252
-We have so many questions.
-It's such a wonder.

140
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,788
-They're not ordinary humans.
-Like <i>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</i>

141
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,855
If it is okay with you,

142
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,058
can you disclose your current weight?

143
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,393
I've dropped a lot of weight, actually.

144
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,928
You lost weight?

145
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,964
-I'm probably 44 kg right now.
-In the forties?

146
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,534
-About 45 kg after a meal.
-You're so light.

147
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,102
I'm 2.5 times heavier than her.

148
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,403
Do you weigh 100 kg?

149
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,771
Hundred Nam-no.

150
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,807
I've gone past 100 kg ages ago.

151
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,942
Let's say you had 2 kg of food.

152
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,179
Do you go from 44 kg to 46 kg?

153
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,715
Actually, I once did <i>mukbang</i>
while weighing myself.

154
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,917
<i>And yes, I did put on the weight.</i>

155
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,085
WEIGHT AFTER EATING

156
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,753
But while the camera was off

157
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,390
-and I was on standby, it went down.
-How?

158
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,326
-Where does the food go?
-It must've vaporized.

159
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,262
Does the energy in your body
evaporate everything?

160
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,064
Do you have a higher body temperature?

161
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,799
Is it the heat?

162
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,336
-The food has to go somewhere.
-Yes, in the form of sweat or whatever.

163
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,406
I tend to digest food very quickly.

164
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,741
-Right away?
-I see.

165
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,743
And the process is really loud,

166
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,078
that it sounds like the roll of thunder.

167
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,514
When I have my friends come over,

168
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,816
they sometimes respond, thinking I spoke.

169
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,418
They respond to your stomach growls?

170
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,820
It'd rumble, and they'd go, "What?"

171
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,255
ABLE TO TALK TO TZUYANG'S ORGANS

172
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,024
You must go to the restroom often
if you eat that much.

173
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,025
Yes.

174
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,427
-How many… You do?
-Many trips.

175
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,129
-Yes, I do.
-She makes many trips.

176
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,830
-I see.
-I do go often,

177
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,132
and I flush many times too.

178
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,368
Someone recently saw me in the restroom
at a highway rest stop.

179
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,172
She wanted to take a picture,
so she waited in front of the stall

180
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,840
and heard me flush seven times.

181
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,811
She said, "I didn't expect
you to flush seven times."

182
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,746
She was there listening to it?

183
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,948
And counting like this.

184
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,584
-This is a tip-off from a civilian.
-It is.

185
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:02,722
How much do you spend on food in a month?

186
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,957
-About ten million won.
-Just on food?

187
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,860
I spend over three million won
just on a food delivery app,

188
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,695
and I buy lots of groceries too.

189
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,230
That's why I have

190
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,565
four fridges.

191
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,300
-Four?
-Four fridges?

192
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,969
-I also have a pantry for my snacks.
-For your snacks.

193
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,838
A restaurant with four fridges

194
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,007
is usually one at a capacity
of 100 seats or more.

195
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,476
-The size?
-A restaurant for 100 or more.

196
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,379
<i>We couldn't bring the entire pantry,</i>
<i>so we only have some items here.</i>

197
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,215
We're in for a treat today.
Now, let us begin.

198
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,985
Let's take a look at Tzuyang's fridge,
someone who has to spend

199
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,655
-over ten million won a month on food.
-That's astronomical.

200
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,691
We just took a short break

201
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,493
before opening the fridge.

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,396
In that while, Tzuyang ate something.

203
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,998
-I saw <i>gimbap</i> in the green room.
-We have some there.

204
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,500
DURING THE BREAK

205
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,968
<i>Let's take ten.</i>

206
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,137
<i>Tzuyang, your fridge…</i>

207
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,205
<i>What are you eating?</i>

208
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,407
<i>-</i>Gimbap<i>.</i>
<i>-</i>Gimbap<i>?</i>

209
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,075
<i>I saw it in the green room.</i>

210
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,076
Just one?

211
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,778
CHEWING

212
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,546
There were probably about four rolls.

213
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,948
-There were three.
-Three?

214
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,149
They underestimated her.

215
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,051
-So I finished them quickly.
-Quickly?

216
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,352
Is it hard to hold back?

217
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,321
It's hard for me to resist eating.

218
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,156
It's just like breathing,
so you're asking her

219
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,424
-Yes.
-to hold her breath.

220
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
-It's like air.
-That's really rough.

221
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,127
If Poong stopped talking,

222
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,496
it means he stopped breathing.

223
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,831
If Hyun-suk isn't acting smug,

224
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,166
it means he stopped breathing.

225
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,434
SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND

226
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,302
-That makes it easy to understand.
-Do you get it?

227
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,905
…CHUCKLE

228
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,141
Tzuyang, you said you had four fridges,

229
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,843
but we only have two right now.

230
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,112
I brought about half of all I had.

231
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
It's probably not even half.

232
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,115
<i>I have way too much food at home.</i>

233
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,019
<i>And once I get hooked on a meal kit,</i>
<i>I stock up on that one thing.</i>

234
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,787
I have a lot of the same things,

235
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,123
so I brought
less than half of what I have.

236
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,826
So these are from your pantry.

237
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,728
She definitely likes <i>ramyeon.</i>

238
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,563
She doesn't keep just one kind.

239
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,632
-There's a wide variety.
-They're all different.

240
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,601
What is this? I thought it was her study.

241
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,869
(LOTS OF) BUGEOGUK, POLLACK SOUP

242
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,070
You're right.

243
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,573
It's like a collection
of <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</i>

244
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,175
HER COMPLETE BUGEOGUK COLLECTION

245
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,977
Let me read the fifth volume.

246
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,579
CHOOSE WHICH ONE TO EAT

247
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,180
She has so many boxes of instant soup.

248
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,348
You must love this.

249
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,150
I use that for everything.

250
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,053
Like when I'm making <i>ramyeon,</i>
fish cake soup, and so on.

251
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,888
I use it as the base for all soups.

252
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,558
-Dried pollack base.
-As the broth.

253
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,393
-I see a collection of instant curry too.
-Yes.

254
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,661
-Curry and…
-<i>Jjajang</i> sauce

255
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,329
-and curry.
-And curry.

256
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,564
She has a whole collection.

257
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,166
These are all instant foods, right?

258
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,769
When I get food delivered
or am in the middle of cooking,

259
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,638
there are 10 to 20 minutes
of time in between, right?

260
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,440
That's when I quickly snack on one.

261
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:35,975
While she waits?

262
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,476
SHE USES THE WAIT AS A CHANCE TO EAT

263
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,879
-We usually just look at our phones.
-So it's a snack.

264
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,814
But you use that time to eat some more.

265
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,783
-How professional.
-She's always working.

266
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,652
-You eat some more while you wait a while.
-I do.

267
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,722
I also see a box of potatoes.

268
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,923
You must like potatoes.

269
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,558
When I was younger,

270
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,796
I'd go around telling everyone
that I'd marry a potato.

271
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:57,997
You'd marry a potato?

272
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,832
I really love potatoes.

273
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,133
So you like potatoes.

274
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,235
<i>I like the fluffy ones</i>
<i>that melt in your mouth.</i>

275
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,438
<i>-Fluffy ones.</i>
<i>-The ones that melt away.</i>

276
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,608
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT MAKES HER HAPPY

277
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,044
-Okay. That was her pantry.
-Time to open the fridge.

278
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,146
This must be the main fridge.

279
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,115
I'm looking forward to this.

280
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,784
-We present Tzuyang's fridge!
-Tzuyang's fridge!

281
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,920
SCREAMING

282
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,155
PRESENTING TZUYANG'S FRIDGE

283
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,091
-My gosh.
-Yes!

284
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,627
That's a lot.

285
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,363
There's so much food.

286
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,464
It's a lot.

287
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,599
That's how a fridge should be.

288
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,468
How big is this?

289
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,569
Why do you have

290
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,537
all these bags of <i>gochugaru</i>?

291
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,572
There's another one.

292
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,806
This is all <i>gochugaru</i>.

293
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,408
-Does she make kimchi?
-And she keeps

294
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,745
such big portions, as you can see
with all the different <i>jangs</i>.

295
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,346
-Those are for commercial use.
-They are.

296
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,682
And a huge pack of wasabi.

297
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,384
Do you really need all these condiments?

298
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,088
There are times when food I get delivered
isn't seasoned the way I like it.

299
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,058
So I often use those to improve the taste
almost every single day.

300
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,794
Also, I tend to get more views

301
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,697
when the food I eat has red soup.

302
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,600
-I see.
-That's why I buy those in bulk.

303
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,201
EAT IN BULK, BUY IN BULK

304
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,837
I see some <i>jeotgal,</i> salted seafood.

305
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,508
I love the flavor of <i>jeotgal,</i>
something strong and savory.

306
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,710
You must like strong flavors.

307
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,178
-Right.
-Something intense.

308
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,713
This one looks like kimchi.

309
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,948
This is kimchi, and this too.

310
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,216
These are all kimchi.

311
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,219
-This one isn't. What is it?
-Seasoning for commercial use.

312
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,988
Is this some kind of sauce?

313
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:29,955
Is it <i>chogochujang?</i>

314
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,324
That was a secret

315
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,261
I didn't want to share with anyone,

316
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,696
so I even pulled off the label.

317
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,265
Yes, she ripped off the label.

318
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,499
-You did that?
-I did.

319
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,400
Why?

320
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,668
Which brand is it?

321
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,003
By any chance,

322
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,805
-Do you know?
-is it by so-and-so brand?

323
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,740
You're right!

324
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,576
-I model for the brand.
-You do?

325
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,478
She ripped it out to hide it,

326
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,046
-but the model was here.
-I did.

327
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,147
I know.

328
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,350
-It makes kimchi <i>jjigae</i> magically good.
-Yes.

329
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,420
After just ten minutes,
it tastes like it's been simmered

330
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,588
-for two hours.
-Really?

331
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,223
I knew she'd have a secret.

332
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,759
-I knew we'd see something like this.
-I'm intrigued.

333
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,894
-This is what we want to know.
-It's so good.

334
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,597
-Thank you.
-It was a secret, but the model was here.

335
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,598
-The yellow one.
-It's cheese.

336
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,499
It's cheese.

337
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,168
-These are all cheese.
-Yes, I love cheese.

338
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,938
I brought those from Istanbul.

339
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,740
-Türkiye?
-Yes, Istanbul, Türkiye.

340
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,675
I got lots of cheese from there.

341
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,678
-Please use them as much as you like.
-She loves cheese.

342
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,446
-They look good.
-She's into cheese.

343
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,781
What's down here?

344
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,449
-Fresh vegetables.
-Veggies.

345
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,151
Do you not like veggies?

346
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,620
I consider myself a carnivore.

347
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,590
I rarely ever eat vegetables.

348
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,826
At times, I put salt-based seasoning
on cabbage and eat that.

349
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,728
The only thing she eats is cabbage.

350
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,764
On to the freezer.

351
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,333
All right. What is this?

352
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,770
-Snow crab! This is a lot.
-Snow crab leg meat.

353
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,138
Roasted eel.

354
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,440
-Rockfish fillet. Lobster.
-Lobster.

355
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,243
-These are all seafood.
-Cutlassfish.

356
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,078
Lobster?

357
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,579
It's like a fish market.

358
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,047
This side has meat.

359
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,950
Premium lamb.
Beef brisket for shabu-shabu.

360
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,187
-Sirloin and pork belly.
-How many packages are there?

361
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,189
We found a tomahawk steak
inside the home fridge.

362
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,124
-What? Why?
-Tomahawk steak?

363
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,794
She has more <i>gopchang</i> here.

364
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,896
<i>Gopchang</i>, <i>daechang</i>.

365
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,165
We're pretty much at the meat market.

366
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,466
THIS SIDE, THE MEAT MARKET

367
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,635
-The fish market, the meat market.
-Yes, the meat.

368
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,869
-Fish on the left.
-You eat it all.

369
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,705
How many servings of meat
do you eat per meal?

370
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,308
I eat about 3 kg during my <i>mukbang.</i>

371
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,243
-What? 3 kg?
-Did you say 3 kg?

372
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,211
By kilograms?

373
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,114
-She counts by kilograms, not servings.
-By kilograms.

374
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,615
NOT SURPRISED AT ALL

375
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,184
I tend to eat 3 kg when I'm on air.

376
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,820
I can probably eat an endless amount
when it comes to meat.

377
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,054
THE BIG GUYS ARE SHOCKED

378
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,491
Looks like you'll have
more than enough ingredients.

379
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,625
That's just one?

380
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,128
-Yes, we have one more.
-There's another one.

381
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,197
What's this fridge for?

382
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,265
It's for all the beverages.

383
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,500
-Beverages?
-Beverage fridge.

384
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,769
Let's take a look. One, two, three.

385
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,805
AMAZED

386
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,941
It's her beverage fridge.

387
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,677
I guess you like to drink
a variety of beverages.

388
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,946
-I drink five liters a meal.
-Five liters a meal?

389
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,981
EVEN HATNIM IS ASTONISHED

390
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,916
-So around 15 liters a day?
-Around 15 liters?

391
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,251
Did you say 15 liters?

392
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,420
It's different every day,
but I do drink a lot.

393
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,423
We hear you're also nicknamed
Tzuyang Gas Station.

394
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,091
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Tzuyang Gas Station.</i>

395
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,760
<i>I like to pour my beverage in a huge cup,</i>

396
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,263
<i>and people say</i>
<i>it looks like I'm filling up on gas.</i>

397
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,234
-So yes, I drink lots of beverages.
-"Fill up the tank, please."

398
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,569
Look at this bulk iced tea.

399
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,106
Shouldn't this huge bag
last you a few days?

400
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,641
I drink it in one sitting.

401
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,675
This whole thing?

402
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,244
-The entire bag?
-This thing?

403
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,779
TOO SHOCKED TO EVEN REACT

404
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,148
-Where does everything go?
-I wonder.

405
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,484
Why do you have broth
<i>for chogye-guksu,</i> cold chicken noodles?

406
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,086
-As a beverage?
-And beef bone broth.

407
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,320
-I…
-The broth?

408
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,355
Is this used as a beverage?

409
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,690
-Yes, because I love <i>naengmyeon.</i>
-Like dessert.

410
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:52,658
-This?
-As dessert.

411
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,861
I just squeeze it out of the bag
during my meals.

412
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,831
She drinks these as beverages.

413
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,134
It's not for noodles, but her beverage.

414
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:06,639
What's in here? <i>Tteokbokki,</i>
rice balls, and other such foods.

415
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:07,706
When do you eat this?

416
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,175
As my in-between meal
while I wait for the next delivery.

417
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,577
WHAT'S AN "IN-BETWEEN MEAL"?

418
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,711
-As you wait?
-Yes.

419
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,980
During the time you wait
for the next delivery?

420
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,082
Does it drive you crazy
to just sit and wait?

421
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,418
It's just breathing to her.

422
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,087
I understand now why you flushed
seven times at the rest area.

423
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,156
IS IT BECAUSE I EAT TOO MUCH?

424
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,626
That was all for Tzuyang's fridge!

425
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,761
FRIDGE CHECK, DONE

426
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,563
I'm sure our chefs will

427
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,433
cook up something very delicious,

428
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,869
thanks to the amount
of ingredients you have.

429
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,338
Please show us her orders!

430
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,372
The first one.

431
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,276
Noodles to Make 12 Million Press Like.

432
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,813
-Yes, people love noodles.
-It's a noodle dish.

433
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,083
-I should make the noodles, right?
-Noodles to please 12 million people.

434
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,953
As I mentioned before,
soup dishes are comfort food to me.

435
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,187
I want a soup dish,

436
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:59,591
which I love, combined with noodles,
which my subscribers love.

437
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,627
The problem is this.

438
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,662
You said you can eat 20 bags of <i>ramyeon.</i>

439
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,332
-So how much do you need?
-How many servings?

440
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,233
I guess the quantity is important,

441
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,735
but what's more important is this.

442
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,537
Make sure you find out what she likes

443
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,205
to make the best dish for her.

444
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,474
He's just like how he is on TV.

445
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,377
A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS THE SAME…

446
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,779
Well, if you give me a lot in quantity,

447
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,750
-it can become a factor in my decision.
-So extra points?

448
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,386
-You get extra points.
-We have to make a lot?

449
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,254
-It's not like that.
-Make a huge pot.

450
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,057
-We need a noodle press.
-You have to make a lot, period.

451
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,426
-You heard her.
-If you make too little, it's over.

452
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,528
-It can be a factor,
-I never make a lot.

453
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,764
but I'll mostly decide on the flavor.

454
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,100
If they're both good, it's the quantity.

455
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,768
-It can tip the scales.
-Yes.

456
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,069
So extra points.

457
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,738
And her second order.

458
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,274
-All Done with Potatoes.
-All Done with Potatoes.

459
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,877
-All Done with Potatoes.
-A potato dish.

460
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:57,383
I'm someone who loves potatoes so much
that I said I wanted to marry one.

461
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,619
But all I did was steam them
and make them the ordinary way,

462
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,189
so I want to try
a new kind of potato dish today.

463
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:08,093
Four of you are going to cook
with ingredients from Tzuyang's fridge.

464
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,994
HAND RAISED

465
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,363
Poong, the webtoon artist, is up first.

466
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,731
Frankly speaking,

467
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:18,070
I probably have the most views
when it comes to <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

468
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,973
-The clips do very well when I'm in them.
-He's the expert.

469
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,442
-The numbers speak for themselves.
-They do.

470
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,212
I'll choose
Noodles to Make 12 Million Press Like.

471
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,881
-The noodle dish.
-Okay.

472
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,815
Poong will go with

473
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,351
Noodles to Make 12 Million Press Like.

474
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,522
Then who'll go against him?
His BFF, Chef Jong-won can go next.

475
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,524
From my experience,

476
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,225
while it's always fun to join him,

477
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,228
I was a little happier
when I took a step away from him.

478
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,064
-I'll do All Done with Potatoes.
-Potatoes.

479
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,834
So Poong and Jong-won have split up.

480
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,369
"Split up?"

481
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,471
We need someone else
to take the potatoes round.

482
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,273
-Anyone?
-I'll go.

483
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,774
SAM CHOOSES ALL DONE WITH POTATOES

484
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,476
-Potatoes?
-Yes, the potatoes.

485
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,912
You look like an Idaho potato.
They're long.

486
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,246
FROM IDAHO, USA
LOOKS LIKE SAM

487
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,082
-The ones used in Italian cuisine.
-Italian?

488
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,017
He does resemble a potato, I guess.

489
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,621
I also eat potatoes often,
and I even had some this morning.

490
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,759
Sam takes the potato dish.

491
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,928
-I'll go.
-Sung-jun?

492
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,896
I'd like to go against Poong once again.

493
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,698
HE CHALLENGES POONG

494
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,766
-Are you sure?
-I am.

495
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,669
Then Poong and Sung-jun are up first.

496
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,571
Let their 15-minute cook-off begin!

497
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,245
<i>This is the first round played</i>
<i>with ingredients from Tzuyang's fridge.</i>

498
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,214
A madman birthed by the showbiz,

499
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,783
the monstrous Chef Sung-jun
is up for the challenge.

500
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,218
He is a madman.

501
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,753
A madman birthed by <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>

502
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,089
Webtoon Artist Poong is also up.

503
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,290
-Another madman?
-Yes.

504
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,359
Sung-jun is such a madman for TV.

505
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,627
Once again,

506
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,529
he will change his master.

507
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,930
-Really?
-Who's left?

508
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,031
Is there anyone left?

509
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,600
There's a chef I really look up to.

510
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,769
It's Chef Jung Ho-young.

511
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,271
-Me?
-Ho-young? That was random.

512
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,273
He's preying on Ho-young today.

513
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,541
Congrats.

514
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,943
Actually, I was a regular
at his restaurant.

515
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,412
-Really?
-I went to his udon joint very often.

516
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,915
Then I began to want to take

517
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,617
the same journey as this man.

518
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,719
I wish to be his pupil starting today.

519
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,621
-I see.
-You got a new master again?

520
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,623
He makes amazing noodles.

521
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,558
Yes, I'm confident at noodles.

522
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,993
Feel free to ask me questions.

523
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,427
Yes, sir.

524
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,497
He'll do that during the round. All right.

525
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,699
Poong, why is your pot so big?

526
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,101
-For noodles.
-Like a <i>gomtang</i> place.

527
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,403
-It's like my restaurant.
-It's extraordinary.

528
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,339
The fact that I came equipped
with this huge pot says

529
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,508
I already know how YouTube works.

530
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,578
On YouTube, whatever you do,

531
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,680
-you have to go big.
-It's performative.

532
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,981
That's where it all begins.

533
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,883
Yes, people are already intrigued by you.

534
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,385
-Exactly.
-Yes.

535
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,955
But nothing is out of the ordinary
on Chef Sung-jun's side.

536
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,157
The greats
never care about the tools they use.

537
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,626
He blames other people instead.

538
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,794
IS THAT SO?

539
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,197
-Never the tools, but people.
-Wait.

540
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,831
Will he blame his master?

541
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,400
He doesn't blame his tools.

542
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,668
The master is to blame.

543
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,569
YES, PRECISELY

544
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,471
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: SHRIMP,
FEMALE BLUE CRAB, LOBSTER TAIL MEAT

545
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,574
SNOW CRAB LEG MEAT, SMOKED OYSTER CAN,
BRISKET, BEEF DAECHANG, AND MORE

546
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,776
I named today's dish

547
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,911
by including some of my master's energy.

548
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:13,812
What could it be?

549
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,948
I was inspired
by his Su-Su-Su-Super Udon, so I'll make

550
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,916
-Su-Su-Su-Superb Udon from scratch.
-From scratch?

551
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,484
You're making it from scratch?

552
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,587
She'll need to slurp the noodles
to get more views,

553
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,055
so I'll make fresh noodles.

554
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,624
I also plan to make noodles with fish cake

555
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,260
as a topping she can also slurp.

556
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,297
So she'll be able to enjoy
two kinds of noodles at once.

557
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,166
-Like fish cake udon?
-I'll also use

558
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,936
many different ingredients as toppings
to lure in more views from the audience.

559
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,606
Udon is my personal favorite
among noodle dishes.

560
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,674
I'm really looking forward to this.

561
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,010
HE ALREADY KNEW WHAT SHE LIKED

562
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,879
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
NAENGMYEON NOODLES, BEEF GOPCHANG

563
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,015
BEEF BRISKET, SURF CLAM, DOUBANJIANG,
TUNA SAUCE, OYSTER SAUCE, AND MORE

564
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,284
What are you making, Webtoon Artist Poong?

565
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,019
YouTubers with the Diamond Button

566
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:58,056
have a whole different character
compared to those with the Gold Button.

567
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,491
So her subscribers will appreciate

568
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,027
a new twist in something familiar.

569
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,631
I'm going to serve
<i>naengmyeon</i> noodles in hot soup.

570
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,766
-I see.
-Not cold noodles, but hot noodles!

571
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,569
I'm going to serve hot <i>naengmyeon.</i>

572
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,205
There must be a reason
why those noodles are served cold.

573
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,740
If it's served hot,

574
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,708
-Look at her face.
-it might start falling apart.

575
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,111
There are other noodles similar to these.

576
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,913
Taiwan is famous
for their flour-rice noodles,

577
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,884
<i>The noodles are so soft that</i>
<i>you almost have to eat it with a spoon.</i>

578
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,887
It's rather rich
because starch melts into the broth.

579
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,956
-I see.
-So you can think of that.

580
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,160
An aspect I really loved
while watching her YouTube channel

581
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,796
was that she likes to pile up
her empty bowls.

582
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,531
It's a nice shot for the video.

583
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,800
It sounds like
you're making more than one bowl.

584
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,236
I'll start with six bowls.

585
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,071
-Six bowls?
-Yes.

586
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,041
-I'll let her keep piling the bowls.
-That sounds great.

587
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,810
They'll now start cooking for Tzuyang

588
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:56,014
and make noodles that'll make
12 million press the like button.

589
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,251
I can't believe I'm seeing this in person.
Like I'm watching TV.

590
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,387
The clout chaser of YouTube,
Chef Kwon Sung-jun.

591
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,791
IF I WIN, IT'S MY DOING,
BUT IF I LOSE, IT'S THE MASTER'S FAULT

592
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,492
Just an attention seeker,

593
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,528
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

594
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,998
Which of them will receive
a big like from Tzuyang?

595
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,702
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

596
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,204
You're going to make noodles.

597
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,873
THE ROUND BEGINS
FOR TWO DESPERATE FOR ATTENTION

598
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,608
You're going to make noodles.

599
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,810
What are they both doing?

600
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,478
Can you peel the shrimp?

601
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,213
-All of these?
-Yes.

602
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,748
What are you doing? Get moving.

603
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,016
There's…

604
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,951
-There's beef between us.
-What?

605
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,152
I don't want to help him.

606
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,120
Me neither.

607
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,988
BUT THEY STILL HELP HIM

608
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
WHY IS HE SO HAPPY?

609
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,460
I'm only helping him
because Tzuyang is here.

610
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,161
-I need help too.
-He needs help.

611
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,796
Can you loosen the noodles?

612
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,531
-We have to loosen these.
-These?

613
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,600
They need help
because of the sheer quantity.

614
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,537
They're going to make a lot of food,
so please do understand.

615
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,872
WHAT'S POONG'S FIRST STEP?

616
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,875
There's no episode
where Poong skips making chili oil.

617
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,812
You added
a lot of red pepper powder today.

618
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,780
-It's a lot.
-I must.

619
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,983
What's he doing? Making chili oil?

620
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,984
WHAT'S SUNG-JUN UP TO?

621
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,521
You're making noodles,
so please keep this in mind.

622
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,757
Whoever finishes first
will have an advantage.

623
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,726
You have to finish first
for her to try your dish first.

624
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,029
WHAT'S ON THE GREEN ONION?

625
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,097
What's he doing?

626
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,532
Is that fish cake?

627
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:21,967
<i>Daechang</i>.

628
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,602
Sung-jun, what are you doing?

629
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,103
-Green onion.
-<i>Daechang</i>.

630
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,673
He put green onion
into a piece of <i>daechang</i>.

631
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,909
-And it goes on the grill.
-That looks so good.

632
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,011
Is that for udon?

633
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,246
It's a topping.

634
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,148
-It looks good.
-A topping.

635
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,251
There's an udon dish
that has <i>daechang</i> or <i>gopchang</i> in it.

636
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,219
It's made by deep-frying
at low temperatures

637
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,155
to bring out more savory flavors.

638
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,089
I see.

639
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,690
AMAZED

640
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,526
SHE CAN'T TAKE HER EYES OFF HIM

641
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,295
That can be big on YouTube.

642
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,229
It's creative.

643
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,433
Tzuyang keeps watching him in amazement.

644
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,801
I'm starting to wonder

645
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,669
if I should decide just on the flavor

646
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,673
or if I should choose something
that'll bring in more views.

647
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,707
After all, my order…

648
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,509
That's important, but consider the dish…

649
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,877
Onion!

650
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,546
I'll add lots of chopped onions!

651
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,116
THE ATTENTION SEEKER BOOSTER IS ON

652
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,952
He's desperate for attention.

653
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,921
Is he streaming live?

654
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,589
Is he doing this live?

655
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,124
He's just an attention seeker.

656
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,593
CHAT: IS THIS THE NOISE POLLUTION ASMR?
HE WOKE MY BABY UP

657
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,930
-He's using a lot of water.
-That's a lot of food.

658
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,499
There's a difference
in making food in bulk.

659
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,836
Even if the recipe is simple,
it's much harder to cook that much.

660
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:31,736
Of course.

661
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,672
These are lots of noodles.

662
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,173
Isn't it too much?

663
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,675
-Does he need all of this?
-Yes.

664
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,410
ASKING THE SAME QUESTION

665
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,811
He needs it all.

666
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,047
I don't know why,
but I don't want to help him.

667
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,583
SHE CONTINUES TO FEEL DISPLEASED

668
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,117
DOESN'T CARE, MAKING BROTH

669
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,486
The soup is very important.

670
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,221
-Soy sauce.
-Cooking wine.

671
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,589
Soy sauce and cooking wine.

672
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,590
BLUE CRAB, SOUP BASE, COOKING WINE

673
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,858
AND BROILED VEGETABLES

674
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,326
Did he just add some smokiness?

675
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,727
He's making broth.

676
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,363
He puts some meat on top too.

677
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't videos that show
food cooked over fire get lots of views?

678
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,736
Yes, that process is eye-catching.

679
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,905
That's a great moment.

680
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,174
Is all of that going to be toppings?

681
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,342
Yes.

682
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,643
I want it to be abundant.

683
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,911
When will you make the noodles?

684
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,613
Where's the dough?
Will you use just shrimp?

685
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm doing it now.

686
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,649
HE BEGINS TO KNEAD THE DOUGH

687
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,152
MAKING SU-SU-SU-SUPERB UDON DOUGH

688
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,723
What's he doing? Judging by the color,
I think he mixed flour and starch.

689
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,958
-I added starch.
-It's to make it chewy.

690
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,195
As he mentioned,
he's making udon from scratch.

691
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,964
The dough looks kind of dry,
but I'm not so sure.

692
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,599
That way, it'll be chewy.

693
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,034
WHAT'S POONG UP TO?

694
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,170
1. STIR-FRY DOUBANJIANG,
RED PEPPER POWDER, AND CRUSHED GARLIC

695
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,739
POURING BEEF BRISKET IN

696
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,807
He's cooking beef in chili oil?

697
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,110
Not just chili oil.
I'm stir-frying it in <i>doubanjiang</i> and oil.

698
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,946
-Oh, <i>doubanjiang.</i>
-It's <i>doubanjiang</i> chili oil.

699
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,448
It's important
for him to make an ample quantity,

700
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,084
-but it's hard to season that much food.
-You're right.

701
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,252
The shrimp.

702
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,587
Okay. Good.

703
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,788
TEAM SUNG-JUN IS DONE

704
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,057
Chef Sung-jun, are you peeling lobsters?

705
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,459
-Yes, these are lobsters.
-That's the second one.

706
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,395
-The meat looks solid.
-Two tails.

707
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,665
LOTS OF SHELLFISH MEAT

708
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,366
He's using more than 30 shrimps.

709
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,735
It'll have fantastic texture.

710
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,672
-It looks so good.
-And served with meat and <i>daechang</i>.

711
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,007
That's my boy.

712
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,209
-That's my pupil.
-Of course.

713
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,744
-I'm proud.
-I'm a strategist.

714
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,913
THE ORIGINAL ATTENTION SEEKER
LOST ALL ATTENTION

715
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,015
HE MUST TAKE DRASTIC MEASURES!

716
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,384
Is Poong using <i>daechang</i>?

717
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,219
-It's <i>gopchang</i>. Yes.
-<i>Gopchang</i>?

718
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,988
-It's <i>gopchang</i>. Yes.
-<i>Gopchang</i>?

719
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,156
INTERESTED

720
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,759
Isn't that too much? What's it for?

721
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,127
These are all for the soup.

722
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,697
-The soup?
-It'll taste like <i>gopchang jeongol.</i>

723
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,498
That sounds good.

724
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,001
You have ten minutes left.

725
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,936
We had to loosen these for five minutes.

726
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,239
Those are <i>naengmyeon</i> noodles.

727
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,209
Wouldn't it melt in hot soup?

728
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,877
HE STARTS MAKING FISH CAKE!

729
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,313
You have ten minutes left.

730
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,481
4. GRIND SHELLFISH, EGG, STARCH

731
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,649
It's stuck.

732
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,151
You'll lose if the blender doesn't work.

733
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,320
He said he'd make noodles with that.

734
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,724
-Noodles made out of fish cake.
-Like that?

735
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,892
He probably needs more water.

736
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,194
Grind.

737
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,930
Ho-young once tried to do that and failed.

738
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,498
The shrimp.

739
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:18,136
-It's the deadly ditch we all fall into.
-Is that so?

740
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,305
AS THEY SPEAK!

741
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,573
Poong adds smoky flavor!

742
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,008
A SURPRISE FIRE SHOW

743
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,543
ADDING SMOKINESS

744
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,312
I can see the view count rising!

745
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,213
That red flavor looks great.

746
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,314
THE SOUND OF HER SUBSCRIBERS GROWING

747
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,117
-That'll draw in view counts.
-Yes.

748
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,520
Also, don't people like it more
when he cooks with that frown?

749
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,988
I got it under control.

750
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,457
A small mishap.

751
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,159
Wait, you can't see it from there.

752
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,228
FEELING AWKWARD

753
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,330
What's the pot in front of the pan?

754
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,299
-It's to cook the noodles in.
-For the noodles.

755
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,934
What's this?

756
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,503
-It's…
-This is his soup?

757
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,004
-That's the soup.
-What's that?

758
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,139
-He poured it in.
-The soup?

759
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,642
POURING EVERYTHING IN

760
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,344
THE YOUTUBERS ARE INTRIGUED

761
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,613
I thought that was
for cooking the noodles.

762
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,884
That's a lot of soup,
so I wonder how he'll season that.

763
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,219
He'll need to use
the entire bottle of oyster sauce.

764
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:09,688
STIR-FRIES THE GOPCHANG

765
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,222
Does he need the entire bottle?

766
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,624
GRAB

767
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,793
Is he adding crab meat?

768
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,528
That's ruined.

769
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,164
The blender is having a rough time.

770
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,032
-Help him shake it.
-Are you okay, Sung-jun?

771
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,267
-You got it!
-The blender stops.

772
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,469
-You got this, Sung-jun!
-It's not okay.

773
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,771
Let me shake it for you.

774
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,706
It won't grind.

775
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,810
HIS BIG TWIN BROTHER
TAKES THE MOUND TO HELP

776
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,678
It's almost done.

777
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,080
-Okay?
-Okay. That's good.

778
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,414
-Ho-young.
-Yes?

779
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,750
Udon noodles are thick.
How long does it take to cook?

780
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,453
Thick noodles are cooked
for 13 minutes and 40 seconds.

781
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,654
-Okay.
-Check for time.

782
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,356
He needs 13 minutes and 40 seconds
to cook the noodles,

783
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,525
-but he has 7 minutes.
-You have 7 minutes left.

784
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,028
-Tzuyang, by any chance,
-That's too thick.

785
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,062
do you enjoy firm noodles?

786
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,665
No, I like them cooked through.

787
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,867
Sung-jun doesn't have enough time.

788
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,702
This isn't pasta.

789
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,304
I've seen that tool before.

790
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,338
It's like pasta noodles.

791
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,806
Thin udon noodles?

792
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,175
SPINNING

793
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,445
Yes, he has to keep repeating that.

794
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,280
-I have a feeling
-You're doing good.

795
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,882
she'll eat undercooked noodles.

796
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,584
You don't have enough time.

797
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,653
He's using a pasta maker.

798
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,355
You have 6 minutes and 30 seconds.

799
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,256
Will it get cooked?

800
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,859
He can drag it out on purpose

801
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,062
to let the noodles cook a little longer

802
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,663
while she tries the first dish.

803
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,532
-There are the noodles.
-The noodles.

804
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,567
-There are the noodles.
-The noodles.

805
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,703
The noodles are ready. It looks great.

806
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,539
-The noodles are thinner.
-He needs to hurry.

807
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,941
-That'll take 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
-That's quick.

808
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,443
-Really?
-The thickness?

809
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,012
-Two minutes and thirty seconds.
-That's not udon. It's soba.

810
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,715
-He called it udon,
-It turned out well.

811
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,784
-but it came out like soba.
-Good job.

812
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,919
It'll blow up as it gets cooked.

813
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,487
It'll turn chewy.

814
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,855
I'm serious.

815
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,657
He's practically a con man now.

816
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,058
The show biz made him mad.

817
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,794
-That's…
-It'll become noodles.

818
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,797
-It will?
-Made with lobster, shrimp, and blue crab.

819
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,098
-And blue crab?
-A piping bag.

820
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,332
THE SHORTER MAN'S TURN

821
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,268
-Gosh.
-It'll cook.

822
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,302
-He'll fry it?
-Like that?

823
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,971
-He'll deep-fry it into noodles.
-I see.

824
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,706
That was a clever move.

825
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,842
It'll fall apart if he cooks it in water,

826
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,311
but it'll maintain some shape
when deep-fried.

827
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,214
Chili oil.

828
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,983
Are you stir-frying the <i>gopchang</i>
in chili oil?

829
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,952
Yes, I'm adding a smoky flavor

830
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,154
to the stir-fried <i>gopchang</i>.

831
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,690
How much more does he need to throw in

832
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,960
to make a whole big pot of soup?

833
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,164
It's tough to season the dish perfectly
when you cook in bulk.

834
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,432
You're right.

835
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,202
Five minutes left, Sung-ju.
Please report from the kitchen.

836
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,170
-Not much time left.
-Let me check the kitchen.

837
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,905
Both sides are in some trouble.

838
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,707
TWO GENEROUS SPLASHES OF VINEGAR

839
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,244
I wonder if Poong's pot of soup
is seasoned well right now.

840
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,545
Keep pouring in more.

841
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,814
It looks overly big up close.

842
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,917
How are you going to season this?

843
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,219
How many servings is this?

844
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,320
One.

845
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,754
One serving for Tzuyang.

846
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,224
IF YOU EAT IT ALONE, IT'S 1 SERVING

847
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,627
Does it taste like the Diamond Button?
Or does it make you want to die?

848
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,863
DIAMOND FLAVOR?

849
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,098
DYING FLAVOR?

850
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,366
ANSWERS WITH HIS FACE FIRST

851
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,401
-It makes me want to die.
-Die?

852
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,404
THIS SOUP DIED

853
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,740
-It's way too bland.
-Is it?

854
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,877
-You have to be way bolder.
-Throw everything in.

855
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,411
Add more.

856
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,379
COME ALIVE, NOODS DIA

857
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,515
GIVING CPR WITH MANY CONDIMENTS

858
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,085
He can finish it up with salt later.

859
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,152
WILL IT COME BACK ALIVE?

860
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,621
HOW'S SUNG-JUN DOING?

861
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,223
-This is…
-What is that?

862
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,391
They're stuck together.

863
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,026
-What's that?
-What is that?

864
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,594
They're stuck together.

865
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,296
-Churros.
-Did he make churros?

866
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,598
Is this okay? They're stuck.

867
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,333
-It looks good.
-Sure.

868
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,102
COMPLIMENTS IT HIMSELF

869
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,737
IT'S VISUALLY INTRIGUING

870
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,139
-It looks so good.
-What is that?

871
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,440
EVEN HE FINDS IT FUNNY

872
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,643
Put the whole thing on top.
It'll look cool.

873
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,677
GRUNT

874
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,481
5. STRAIN BROTH OVER A CLOTH

875
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,382
The broth?

876
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,651
Let me fish out just one noodle.

877
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,120
I want to see how well it's cooked.

878
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,521
How are the noodles?

879
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,123
Will people press the like button?

880
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,059
WILL IT GET 12 MILLION LIKES?

881
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,763
The noodles are fine. They're done.

882
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,299
I was worried,
but the noodles are finished.

883
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,802
-They seem chewy.
-Be careful.

884
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,437
It's okay.

885
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,006
Are those <i>naengmyeon</i> noodles or what?

886
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,410
It looks like Poong is about to cook
the <i>naengmyeon</i> noodles.

887
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,278
Are these going in here?

888
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,113
The water is simmering.

889
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,115
He adds the noodles!

890
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,985
He said he'd turn it into hot noodles.

891
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,187
Will it maintain its shape?

892
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,022
-Two minutes.
-Two minutes and twenty seconds.

893
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,257
My gosh.

894
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,360
Did he make churros?

895
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,429
-Is that churros?
-It looks so good.

896
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,430
-It does.
-It looks amazing.

897
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,465
TRYING TO PLANT FALSE IDEAS

898
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,467
-What is that?
-It looks like churros.

899
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,937
-It looks amazing.
-How will this work?

900
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,172
I have no idea either.

901
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,007
But it smells really good.

902
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,542
-It'll be good.
-It smells good.

903
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,711
-You have 1 minute and 54 seconds.
-A minute?

904
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,946
-A minute? Wait.
-Let me try Poong's soup.

905
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,748
-Let me check his soup again.
-All right.

906
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,950
Did it turn into diamond?

907
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,919
Or is it still dead?

908
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,820
Is it still dead?

909
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,022
Well, I…

910
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,125
POURING CHILI OIL IN

911
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,727
Good one!

912
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,795
It has to be spicier for Tzuyang.

913
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,698
It's still a bit bland.

914
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,735
-A minute and a half.
-A minute and a half.

915
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,204
5. BOIL BROTH, UDON SOUP BASE,
SMOKED OYSTER, COLD CHICKEN SOUP

916
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,039
What's this?

917
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,108
-It's the soup.
-The soup.

918
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,344
-It shouldn't be bland.
-You have a minute left now.

919
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,279
SERVING MORE NOODLES ON A PLATE

920
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,180
It's okay.

921
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,448
READY TO SERVE HIS NOODLES

922
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,183
-He grabs four bowls.
-Fifty seconds.

923
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,219
He grabs four bowls. Fifty seconds left.

924
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,553
You don't have much time.

925
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,889
Will you two be okay?
He strains the noodles.

926
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,224
He strains the noodles.

927
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,726
IT'S TOO HOT…

928
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,361
SO FUN TO WATCH IT LIVE

929
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,664
-Are you doing okay, Poong?
-I can do this. I got this.

930
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,333
Thirty-five seconds.

931
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,769
-He can't pour the soup.
-You have to hurry.

932
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,872
You have to finish first, Sung-jun.
His noodles will turn into gruel.

933
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,307
-It'll fall apart.
-Thirty-five seconds.

934
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,409
DAECHANG AND BRISKET!

935
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,411
You have to hurry too!

936
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,679
-You have 30 seconds left.
-It looks so good.

937
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,049
The churros turned into <i>gopchang</i>.

938
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,650
You have 30 seconds left.

939
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,785
PORTIONING THE NOODLES

940
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,653
He gets the noodles out first.

941
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,722
He had promised to make six servings,

942
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,058
but it looks to be
about four to five servings.

943
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,392
Just one more.

944
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,560
Fifteen seconds!

945
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,429
-Fifteen seconds.
-Damn it.

946
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,831
-He says, "Damn it."
-"Damn it."

947
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,466
-"Damn it."
-There goes "Damn it."

948
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,535
-Eight. Seven.
-Oh, no.

949
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,136

-Eight. Seven.
-Eight. Seven.

951
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,840
I'll just pour it.

952
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,742

958
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,285

959
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,654
-Ring the bell first.
-Sung-jun finishes first.

960
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,989
HE'S BUSY MAKING THE NOODLES HOT

961
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,324
ON HIS SECOND BOWL

962
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,225
It's over.

963
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,894
Time's up. Please ring the bell.

964
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:00,098
-Poong finishes too.
-Great job.

965
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:01,499
AMAZED

966
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,800
That was incredible.

967
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,469
-Put this out there.
-Serve the pot.

968
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,837
Yes, the pot needs to go there.

969
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,004
The pot?

970
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,873
LIKE A CAFETERIA

971
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,576
He's serving it in the pot.

972
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,944
That's crazy.

973
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,545
This is what we call the Poong style.

974
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,646
Is this for a team dinner?

975
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,814
THE BIGGEST AMOUNT OF FOOD EVER

976
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,984
Still, he kept his promise
and served six bowls.

977
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,185
He served six bowls.

978
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,455
-Look at this.
-How did they do this in 15 minutes?

979
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,723
-This is awesome.
-How?

980
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:31,462
And now, both dishes are served.

They seemed to have a rough time,
so I felt bad.

985
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,172
Thank you so much.

986

00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,829
Tzuyang ties her hair first.

994
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,964
She rolls her sleeves up.

995
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,300
Look how thin her arms are.

996
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,869
-My gosh.
-Where does all the food go?

997
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,471
It's such a wonder.

998

-She tries the soup.
-Thank you for the food.

999

-Yes?
-What is it?

1004
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,116
-Is there a ladle I can use?
-Sorry?

1005
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,517
-A ladle?
-A ladle.

1006
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,885
-A ladle?
-Why do you need it?

1007
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,886
It must be good.

1008
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,189
She loves soup,
so she wants to have it with a ladle.

1009
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,024
It was still bland when I tried it.

00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,599
-Tzuyang, wants a ladle.
-Thank you.

1015
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,067
May I eat with this?

1016
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,402
Yes, as you wish.

1017
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,137
Yes, of course.

1018
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,772
-My gosh.
-There's more soup, too.

1019
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,073
She goes for the noodles.

1020
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,475
-It looks amazing, doesn't it?
-It was made from scratch.

1021

It will be.

1022
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,578
Good job with the noodles.

1023
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,682
He did do a good job.
It was so chewy even when I tried it.

1024
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,684
She dips the noodles in the soup

1025
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,918
and tries a bite.

1026
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,186
SLURP

She's like a vacuum cleaner.

1029
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,092
So this is how she eats.

1030
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,296
-No way.
-She doesn't chew it that much.

1031
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,532
The smokiness seeped into the soup

1032
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,934
-as if it was boiled over fire.
-You're right.

1033
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,670
I broiled onion, green onion,
pepper, and garlic on a grill

1034
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,505
<i>-before I put them in.</i>
<i>-You broiled those.</i>

1035
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,406
<i>I see.</i>

1036
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,543
Also, it's not just smoky.
It's the smokiness of seafood.

1037
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,845
It tasted so savory
as soon as I took a sip,

1038
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,113
and it's seasoned perfectly.

1039
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,718
The noodles are very chewy,
and it doesn't taste anything like flour.

1040
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,186
You're such a gourmet.

1041
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,955
ANOTHER BITE OF THE NOODLES

1042
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,390
She eats so well.

1043
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,592
She's faster than my vacuum cleaner.

1044
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,261
-And the meat.
-Meat.

1045
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,562
He grilled it over fire.

1046
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,597
The beef.

1047
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,368
SAVORING

1048
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,469
NODS OF APPROVAL

1049
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:52,770
It looks good.

1050
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,607
It comes with the burnt flavor you get
when you grill meat over fire.

1051
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:00,244
It doesn't taste like a dish he made
in just 15 minutes.

1052
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,213
-Is that so?
-Yes, it's so good.

1053
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,081
-How can this be?
-The fish cake.

1054
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:07,218
-I've been wondering about this.
-Deep-fried fish cake.

1055
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,853
I'M SO CURIOUS

1056
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,894
-She eats so well.
-She doesn't even chew that much.

1057
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,596
-One more bite.
-She keeps eating.

1058
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,764
FINISHING WITH SOUP

1059
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,999
AMAZED

1060
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,101
ANTICIPATION

1061
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,004
When you have lobster or shrimp bisque,

1062
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,840
it has the unique smoky flavor

1063
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,942
with the rich shellfish smell, right?

1064
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,611
It tastes just like that.

1065
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,179
It has such a rich flavor.

1066
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:39,383
I'd buy this
if it were available in the market.

1067
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,219
I had such a great result,
thanks to my wonderful master.

1068
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,821
<i>I knew it. He's my pupil.</i>

1069
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,090
HAS HE FOUND HIS FOREVER MASTER?

1070
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:47,758
The <i>daechang</i>.

1071
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,028
The <i>daechang</i>,
the one he skewered with green onion.

1072
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,197
-Do I eat it with the green onion?
-Yes.

1073
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,701
I wanted to eliminate
the fatty smell with that.

1074
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:57,868
It's probably too tough.

1075
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,371
-Yes, it must be.
-You don't have to eat it.

1076
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,572
He caves in right away.

1077
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,640
It's too much to hope for.

1078
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,575
That looks good.

1079
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,678
The green onion's tough.

1080
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,046
It's probably tough.

1081
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:09,947
The green onion!

1082
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,082
SHE CAN'T CUT IT

1083
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,416
You'll ruin your teeth.

1084
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,352
He faces trouble here!

1085
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,287
-Are you in pain?
-Are you?

1086
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,756
A lot of pain?

1087
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,725
You don't have to eat that.

1088
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,893
She still managed to eat it.

1089
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,261
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

1090
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,429
<i>Daechang</i>…

1091
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,064
GULP

1092
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,633
…doesn't have a tough outside

1093
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,036
when you make it crunchy
as if it were deep-fried.

1094
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,139
-But to have this whole, it's…
-It's a bit tough.

1095
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,507
THE DAECHANG IS ALSO TOUGH

1096
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,542
It must be tough like a rubber band.

1097
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,578
My mistake.

1098
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,513
ANNOYINGLY HIGH CONFIDENCE

1099
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,348
CONTINUES TO DEVOUR THE NOODLES

1100
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,351
EVERYONE IS AMAZED

1101
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,253
She doesn't even chew much.

1102
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,655
I think she's swallowing it down
with some soup.

1103
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,359
I found myself cheering as she eats
as if I were watching a sports game.

1104
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,594
AGREED

1105
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,796
This is why people are crazy about her.

1106
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,098
HER MUKBANG IS SO ADDICTIVE

1107
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,833
The noodles can fall apart.

1108
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,168
She makes it look so good.

1109
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,069
WOW

1110
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,938
Where does it all go? See if there's
a hole in her back somewhere.

1111
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,509
-Does it leak out?
-It either leaks out or something.

1112
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,444
-The <i>naengmyeon</i> is getting soggy!
-She's compressing.

1113
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,813
Well, she's not the type who eats fast.

1114
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,415
He looks so anxious.

1115
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,017
She's almost done with the noodles.

1116
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,519
It's so good.

1117
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,520
DOESN'T NOTICE POONG

1118
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,922
SHOWING OFF THE FISH CAKE NOODLES

1119
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,590
How long is it?

1120
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,692
PLEASE PUT IT IN MY MOUTH

1121
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,862
Maybe he made it look like
<i>gopchang</i> on purpose.

1122
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,030
SAVORING

1123
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,332
What's she doing right now?

1124
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,034
My gosh.

1125
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,470
SHE CONTINUES TO EAT AND EAT

1126
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,939
The fish cake noodles look great.

1127
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,541
She keeps eating more and more.

1128
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,910
FINISHES THE SOUP

1129
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,578
She's almost done.

1130
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,613
YUM

1131
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,815
You can take your time.

1132
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,516
-Take your time.
-Please do.

1133
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,151
Take your time and hurry up.

1134
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,085
MY NAENGMYEON MIGHT DIE

1135
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,454
Don't mind him.

1136
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,788
He feels antsy, but we're fine.

1137
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,790
It's fun for us just to see you eat.

1138
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,426
Then may I come back to this
after trying that one?

1139
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,727
Of course.

1140
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,696
-You can compare them.
-I have to try it quickly.

1141
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,898
Next, Webtoon Artist Poong's dish,
Noods Dia.

1142
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,936
A HUGE AMOUNT OF NOODLES
PERFECT FOR TZUYANG

1143
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,807
RED SOUP AND LOTS OF MEAT AND GOPCHANG
TO CAPTURE THE VIEWERS

1144
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,611
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S NOODS DIA

1145
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,581
-It looks just like what he claimed.
-I'm curious.

1146
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,649
I've had the flour-rice noodles in Taiwan,

1147
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:29,553
and the meat and noodles here
remind me of that.

1148
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,455
I wonder what the noodles will be like.

1149
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,858
She just had some chewy noodles, so…

1150
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:34,758
It's breaking apart.

1151
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,560
-It's breaking apart.
-Yes.

1152
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,128
The texture will be comparable.

1153
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,997
Yes. It's falling apart.

1154
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,966
-It looks like the Taiwanese noodles.
-It slips off.

1155
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,034
You can just use a spoon.

1156
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,636
-Really?
-She can't slurp the noodles.

1157
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,138
Really? Now, her first bite.

1158
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,341
Noods Dia.

1159
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:51,942
MMM!

1160
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,210
What? "Mmm"?

1161
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,145
-He's in danger.
-It's an emergency.

1162
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,413
SLURP

1163
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,148
The soup didn't taste too rich before.

1164
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,084
That must be much easier to eat.

1165
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,354
-But it's not fun to watch.
-It definitely tastes foreign.

1166
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,655
-I see.
-"Foreign"?

1167
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,790
Poong's dishes never taste familiar.

1168
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,691
ONE MORE BITE

1169
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,194
It's seasoned perfectly too.

1170
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,428
How about the noodles?

1171
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,630
The noodles.

1172
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,200
Actually, I personally prefer
chewy noodles,

1173
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,703
but these noodles melt in my mouth
without having to chew.

1174
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,772
-It must fall apart.
-It melts in my mouth,

1175
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,807
but it's not so bad.

1176
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,009
You can eat even more.

1177
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,444
It tastes similar
to the Taiwanese flour-rice noodles.

1178
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,314
NOT JUST THE WAY IT LOOKS,
BUT THE TASTE TOO!

1179
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,617
Also, the soup has
a very rich and distinct meat flavor.

1180
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,853
-Meaty flavor?
-With the <i>gopchang</i> and meat.

1181
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,955
Is it better than the Taiwanese noodles?

1182
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,089
Give me a second.

1183
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,859
All right. We think we know the answer.

1184
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,027
LAUGHING

1185
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,128
Right.

1186
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,262
Huh?

1187
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,163
This might be better.

1188
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,631
-This?
-This?

1189
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,567
This tastes better
than the Taiwanese noodles!

1190
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,467
It's an emergency.

1191
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,970
The darkness creeps in yet again.

1192
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,573
May I continue to eat this
while you try some?

1193
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,274
-Of course.
-Sure.

1194
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,977
-You can relax and enjoy your food.
-These are both good.

1195
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,345
ADDING MORE NOODLES TO THE BOWL

1196
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,949
Let's try Chef Sung-jun's dish first.

1197
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:08,218
Let's try the udon he made from scratch.

1198
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,587
He did a great job.

1199
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,157
SHE ENJOYS THE FISH CAKE NOODLES

1200
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:15,993
MMM

1201
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,798
EVERYONE IS ADDICTED TO THE NOODLES

1202
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,704
-Great job.
-It tastes like dried fish snacks.

1203
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,038
I can feel

1204
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,408
the chewy texture of fish cake
just as it is.

1205
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,345
It's the best fish cake I've ever had.

1206
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,113
-I mean it.
-It's made with lobster.

1207
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,284
It's made only with shellfish, isn't it?

1208
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,686
-You must have a great master.
-He did as he learned.

1209
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,221
You never taught him anything.

1210
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,422
Right?

1211
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,958
The soup is so good.

1212
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,861
-She finished the extra noodles too.
-It's so smoky.

1213
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,129
Look at Hatnim.

1214
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,465
SHE GETS BORED EASILY,
BUT SHE SURE CAN EAT A LOT

1215
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,066
Look at Hatnim.

1216
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,036
She's amazing too.

1217
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,804
It's probably about 300 g of noodles.

1218
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,575
She'll live long.
She hasn't cut the noodles yet.

1219
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,111
Don't make her laugh.

1220
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,912
I'm so sorry.

1221
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,449
Of all the dishes Sung-jun made
since he joined the show,

1222
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,785
this is the best one yet.

1223
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,453
Should I make Japanese cuisine now?

1224
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,490
-You could even sell this somewhere.
-Please do.

1225
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,059
It's like the signature dish
of a very famous restaurant.

1226
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,627
He made it from scratch too.

1227
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,029
I'll sell it.

1228
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,897
She's eating more because it's that good.

1229
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,333
Excellent job, Sung-jun. It was good.

1230
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,102
-She finished the extra serving too.
-She finished everything.

1231
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,237
Thank you.

1232
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,872
ANOTHER SERVING OF NOODS DIA

1233
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,106
GASP

1234
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,041
Wow.

1235
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:40,077
Next, Webtoon Artist Kim Poong's dish,

1236
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,679
Noods Dia.

1237
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,981
-It tastes like Taiwanese noodles?
-Noods Dia.

1238
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,851
I'm not sure about how
the <i>naengmyeon</i> noodles turned out.

1239
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,386
It really tastes like I'm in Taiwan.

1240
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,788
I can't believe this.

1241
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,722
LIKE IT'S HER FIRST BOWL

1242
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,124
This is pretty addictive.

1243
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,326
-Goodness.
-The noodles are so peculiar.

1244
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,262
I didn't think it'd go well, but it does.

1245
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,965
I love how it doesn't taste too spicy.

1246
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,768
I feel like I'm eating something
that helps me gain more stamina,

1247
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,037
made with meat broth
that has been simmered for a while.

1248
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,173
It reminds me of chicken <i>kal-guksu</i> too.

1249
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,141
EVERYONE IS ADDICTED TO NOODS DIA

1250
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,111
When you go to a bulgogi place,

1251
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:17,147
-they add <i>naengmyeon</i> noodles to the soup
-The potato noodles.

1252
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,582
and let you eat it hot.

1253
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,017
I think he thought of that.

1254
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:21,785
EVEN HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS INTENTION

1255
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,822
-He quietly takes Poong's side.
-Does he have something on you?

1256
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,690
He must have something on him.

1257
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:31,662
-You have to choose now.
-Only you get to make the decision.

1258
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,596
It must be so hard.

1259
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,665
Hatnim, you can continue to enjoy it.

1260
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,767
<i>Press one for Kwon Sung-jun.</i>

1261
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,736
<i>Press two for Kim Poong.</i>

1262
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:39,937
JEEZ…

1263
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,472
Both noodles were so good.

1264
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,007
-It's really hard to choose.
-Yes, it was so good.

1265
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,409
What do I do?

1266
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,311
Yes, it's unfortunate for the loser.

1267
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,278
One second.

1268
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,314
She tries the soup once again.

1269
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,083
Tzuyang tastes the soups one last time.

1270
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,520
The soup will have a say
in the final decision.

1271
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,255
I'm sorry to ask, but are you just hungry?

1272
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,892
-You have to choose now.
-It's so hard.

1273
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,026
Please make your decision

1274
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,195
and press the button!

1275
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,131
Tzuyang!

1276
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,500
-Press it!
-I'm so sorry!

1277
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,101
She pressed it.

1278
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,371
She looked at somebody and said sorry.

1279
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,340
-It was this side.
-Her eyes were shut.

1280
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,275
Which one did she choose?

1281
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,244
Let's find out. Show us!

1282
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,146
Which noodle dish did Tzuyang choose?

1283
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,348
One has beaten the other two times so far.

1284
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,749
Who's going to take the lead?

1285
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,718
They both did a great job,

1286
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,621
but which one did Tzuyang choose?

1287
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:31,722
Who is it?

1288
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,491
KIM POONG VS KWON SUNG-JUN

1289
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,560
KWON SUNG-JUN WINS

1290
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,562
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S
SU-SU-SU-SUPERB UDON WINS

1291
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,365
Sung-jun wins! She chose Sung-jun.

1292
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,699
I thought I'd lose.

1293
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,601
Great job, Sung-jun.

1294
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,437
My subscribers love it
when I slurp on noodles.

1295
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:52,709
His noodles didn't break apart
and were more appropriate in that way.

1296
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,312
But both tasted equally great.

1297
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,715
I'll have to mention my master,
Chef Jung Ho-young.

1298
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,151
-I'm here today because of his teaching.
-Sure.

1299
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,421
-And may I leave a word with Chef Nam-no?
-Sure.

1300
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,789
This is how you do it.

1301
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,791
WHY DO YOU KEEP LOSING AGAINST HIM?

1302
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,161
Tzuyang chose Chef Sung-jun!
Please put a star on him.

1303
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,162
-Thank you.
-Congrats!

1304
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,699
Sung-jun seizes his eighth victory!

1305
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,668
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

1306
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,703
Tzuyang chose Sung-jun.

1307
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:25,175
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Tzuyang's fridge.</i>

1308
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:29,179
Tzuyang ordered dishes made
with her favorite ingredient, potatoes,

1309
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,715
titled "All Done with Potatoes."

1310
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,417
And two of our most popular chefs

1311
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,186
stepped up for the challenge today.

1312
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,590
Chef Son Jong-won,
the chef who brings in fans,

1313
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:42,459
versus the man with scary canine teeth,

1314
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,728
Chef Sam Kim.

1315
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,196
THE FAMOUS CANINE TEETH!

1316
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,632
-The teeth guy already lost.
-He lost already.

1317
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,835
<i>This is already</i>
<i>their third battle in this season.</i>

1318
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,638
<i>The first round</i>
<i>was with Jang Won-young's ingredients,</i>

1319
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,608
and the second
was when Jung Jae-hyung was here.

1320
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,676
I fought him when Won-young was here.

1321
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,279
-Did you fight Jong-won?
-No, you fought me.

1322
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,249
IT WASN'T JONG-WON,
BUT SUNG-JUN VS HYUN-SUK

1323
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,252
-You fought me.
-I thought it was him. I'm sorry.

1324
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,288
-Jeez.
-I can see why you were confused.

1325
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,624
What do you mean?
What are you talking about? Be quiet!

1326
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,893
-It's understandable.
-Don't make me angry.

1327
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,896
Sadly,

1328
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,498
one person won both rounds.

1329
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,699
<i>Jong-won won twice,</i>

1330
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,269
<i>while Sam lost twice.</i>

1331
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,372
Recently, I had
an elementary school student

1332
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,506
visit my restaurant.

1333
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,110
After the meal, the child left
a hand-written letter for me.

1334
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,679
And toward the end, it said,

1335
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,714
"Please win against Chef Son Jong-won."

1336
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,485
She wants you to win against Jong-won!

1337
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,921
-"Destroy Jong-won."
-She put you up for this.

1338
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,123
<i>-A grade school child?</i>
<i>-Yes, by a grade school kid.</i>

1339
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,258
<i>-It's the wish of the young girl.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1340
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,762
You can see his canine teeth
shining even more brightly today.

1341
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,698
Jong-won, is it okay
for you to fight him today?

1342
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,200
I've been receiving
lots of fan mail these days.

1343
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,704
And most of them are from
elementary schools and kindergartens.

1344
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,472
While I was in a losing streak,

1345
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,408
-a kindergarten girl
-Kindergarten?

1346
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,410
named Ji-yul sent me this letter.

1347
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,178
-A shoutout?
-Ji-yul said what?

1348
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,847
<i>"Winning and losing isn't important."</i>

1349
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,216
<i>"What's important is that you have fun."</i>

1350
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,085
-A kindergarten girl?
-A kindergarten girl?

1351
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,320
How does she know that?

1352
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,722
Then you can just enjoy the journey.

1353
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,991
But the parents
who visit my restaurant with them said

1354
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,393
their kids would cry a lot when I lose.

1355
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,594
-Right.
-Oh, no.

1356
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:28,131
I can't continue to make them cry,

1357
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,668
so I can't continue to lose forever.

1358
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,237
-Kids all cry as they watch the show.
-They all cry.

1359
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,906
There are also many grade school kids

1360
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,975
who'll be devastated if I lose.

1361
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,076
He'll make kids cry too.

1362
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,110
Oh, no.

1363
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,179
THE CHILDREN ARE TORN
TEAM JONG-WON VS TEAM SAM

1364
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,681
-Someone will end up crying.
-Right.

1365
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:45,615
Goodness, little ones.

1366
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,250
Good for you.

1367
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,287
When I played soccer, kids would go,
"Why did you miss that chance?"

1368
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,556
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY SOCCER

1369
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,624
"Is that how you're going
to keep playing?"

1370
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,994
"Is that all you can do?"

1371
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,195
"You should've curled the ball."

1372
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,063
They'd go, "Why did you miss that chance?"

1373
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,498
Man, they're different.

1374
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,001
-I should've been a chef instead.
-Chefs have it the best.

1375
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,304
The worlds of cooking
and sports are very different.

1376
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,173
CHEF SAM'S INGREDIENTS: POTATO, BACON,
LAMB CHOP, MOZZARELLA, NAENGMYEON BROTH

1377
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,309
TOMATO JJAMPPONG MEAL KIT, BARBECUE SAUCE,
PARMESAN POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, AND MORE

1378
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,879
My dish is called Thank You, Tater.

1379
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,315
-Thank You, Tater.
-Thank You, Tater.

1380
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,150
-Thank You, Tater.
-Thank You, Tater.

1381
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,185
-It rhymes.
-Thank You, Tater.

1382
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,154
I have a feeling she'll give me a star

1383
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,990
for my tater dish,
so I wanted to thank her now.

1384
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,658
He wants to thank you in advance.

1385
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,127
-Thanks in advance.
-Tater thanks.

1386
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,862
-Thanks in advance.
-In advance.

1387
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,231
I'm going to make a potato pie for you.

1388
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,766
It's called "shepherd's pie."

1389
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:38,902
It's usually made with lamb in the UK,

1390
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,270
and you actually have some.

1391
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,773
First, I'll stir-fry it and make ragu.

1392
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,809
Also, you said you loved
the fluffy texture of potato,

1393
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,078
so I'll cover the top
with mashed potatoes.

1394
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,213
Potato truly is the main ingredient.

1395
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,384
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS: POTATO,
CABBAGE, SCALLOP, FEMALE BLUE CRAB,

1396
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,486
MOZZARELLA, GRUYERE, PARMESAN POWDER,
2 TTEOKBOKKI MEAL KITS, SAKE, AND MORE

1397
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,789
The name of my dish today

1398
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:02,292
came from a saying that helps me
stay strong in times of trouble.

1399
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,594
It's something said by someone I like.

1400
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,830
The name of my dish is this.

1401
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,932
Totally Gnocchi Vicky.

1402
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,569
Totally Gnocchi Vicky?

1403
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,971
I'm reminded of Won-young.

1404
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,140
-I'm totally lucky Vicky.
-Totally Gnocchi Vicky.

1405
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,308
WON-YOUNG'S FAMOUS LINE

1406
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,744
-Gnocchi Vicky.
-He's making gnocchi.

1407
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,512
<i>-Good job copying her.</i>
<i>-How cute.</i>

1408
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,783
-I suddenly remembered that day.
-Using Won-young's catchphrase.

1409
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,052
I'll make gnocchi with potatoes.

1410
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,787
You seemed to love <i>tteokbokki</i> a lot.

1411
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,623
So I'll use the <i>tteokbokki </i>sauce
but add gnocchi instead of rice cake.

1412
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,159
Gnocchi also takes a long time to make.

1413
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,527
I'll also make fish cake soup.

1414
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,595
Fish cake soup.

1415
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,764
Will he have enough time?
Gnocchi already takes a while.

1416
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,266
I'll also make a beverage
if I have time to spare.

1417
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,336
-It's a whole meal.
-You can't make a huge quantity, then.

1418
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,305
I kept wondering what I should do

1419
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,840
and thought of the viewers as well.

1420
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,209
People have
already seen you eat a lot, right?

1421
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,910
But never eating just a little.

1422
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,912
MAGICAL LOGIC

1423
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,447
It'll be a new experience for her.

1424
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,416
JONG-WON, YOU

1425
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,251
UNSURE

1426
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,953
He's a TV personality now.

1427
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,254
No one wants to see that.

1428
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,389
-The two are in fine dining,
-You'll make a little?

1429
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,627
so he decides to choose
quality over quantity.

1430
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,263
Let us begin the round.

1431
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,632
The dream and hope of children,

1432
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,468
the grade school kids' favorite,
Chef Son Jong-won.

1433
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,238
The Genie who'll make
the little girl's wish come true,

1434
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,773
Daddy-Long-Legs of the show,

1435
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,076
-Chef Sam Kim.
-"Daddy-Long-Legs"?

1436
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,780
Which chef will Tzuyang choose
for his best potato dish?

1437
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,817
-Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!
-Let's go!

1438
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,187
-Begin!
-Let's go!

1439
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,156
CHILDREN'S TEARDROPS ARE AT STAKE!

1440
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,690
It takes a lot of work.

1441
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,559
Potatoes first.

1442
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,728
They both work with their potatoes first.

1443
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,530
They aren't cooked yet, right?

1444
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,064
-They're raw.
-They're still raw.

1445
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,467
How long does it take
to cook a raw potato?

1446
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,836
-Over 15 minutes in water.
-Really?

1447
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,238
They'll have to use the microwave.

1448
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,575
-Yes, it's going into the microwave.
-Yes, I'm using it.

1449
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,678
-That's much quicker.
-He must steam the potatoes first.

1450
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,680
-He has to.
-The texture she likes

1451
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,783
-is that of steamed potatoes, not fried.
-You're right.

1452
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,552
She doesn't like it too firm.

1453
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,188
-He's boiling it.
-Chef Jong-won is boiling the potatoes.

1454
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,756
He's doing it in a different way.

1455
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,258
But it soaks in too much water
if you slice it too thin

1456
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,726
-in an attempt to cook it fast.
-Yes.

1457
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,896
Gnocchi has a better texture
with less water.

1458
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,131
IT MIGHT BE TOO WET

1459
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,600
BLENDER

1460
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,268
-Lamb chops?
-Yes.

1461
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,703
Sam is working with lamb.

1462
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,705
I think he'll grind it.

1463
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,075
-I guess so. It's going into a blender.
-He'll grind the meat.

1464
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,412
2. CHOP LAMB AND GRIND

1465
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,180
There's not enough meat.

1466
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,082
Sam grinds some lamb.

1467
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:42,052
-She can finish that in one bite.
-It's one bite.

1468
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,921
-It's just a tiny meatball, bite-sized.
-Yes, like a meatball.

1469
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,990
-Like a nugget.
-A nugget.

1470
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,792
GRUYERE

1471
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,927
-He's grating cheese.
-Okay.

1472
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,663
-Jong-won is using lots of cheese.
-She likes cheese.

1473
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,066
Are those the ones
you brought from Türkiye?

1474
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,335
They are.
It'll be my first time trying them.

1475
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,370
-Egg yolk.
-She hasn't tried them yet.

1476
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,738
CHEESE, FLOUR, EGG YOLK FOR GNOCCHI

1477
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,641
-Blue crab?
-She had crabs too?

1478
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,542
BLUE CRAB!

1479
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,110
-Blue crab.
-That's amazing.

1480
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,813
It's a female crab,
so it should be delicious.

1481
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,348
Blue crab <i>tteokbokki?</i>

1482
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,850
-Seafood <i>tteokbokki?</i>
-Or maybe it's for the broth.

1483
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,786
-It must be for the fish cake soup.
-The soup broth?

1484
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,255
THAT'S RIGHT!

1485
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,289
Yes, he's making soup.

1486
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,358
I love blue crab in my fish cake soup.

1487
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,593
SHE WILL LOVE THIS

1488
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,562
Jong-won just got some extra points.

1489
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,365
You have to throw one in
to make fish cake soup.

1490
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,534
-Scallops go in.
-Scallops? Yes.

1491
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,103
AND?

1492
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,170
What's that?

1493
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,407
Alcohol? Was it liquor?

1494
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,677
-What's Jong-won doing?
-He just added liquor.

1495
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:41,711
Liquor?

1496
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,748
She had Japanese liquor,
so I did it to eliminate the fishy smell.

1497
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:47,984
What's that?

1498
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,686
Instant <i>bugeoguk.</i>

1499
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,621
-The dried pollack soup.
-<i>Bugeoguk!</i>

1500
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,824
WAIT, HE'S USING INSTANT SOUP?

1501
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,393
-I love that.
-Wait.

1502
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,062
Chef Jong-won isn't usually like this!

1503
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,964
He's turning into Poong.

1504
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:01,865
I knew it!

1505
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,868
I love that move!

1506
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:05,869
THERE'S POONG IN HIM

1507
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,104
He remembered what she said earlier.

1508
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,940
-Yes, I do that with fish cake soup.
-He gets a thumbs-up.

1509
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,677
She hasn't tried it yet,
but he already got a thumbs-up.

1510
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,679
SAM USES HER FAVORITE BEVERAGE(?)
TO CATCH UP

1511
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,281
POT 1: NAENGMYEON BROTH

1512
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:19,749
Butter and…

1513
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,318
-Parmesan.
-It's parmesan.

1514
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,220
It tastes much richer with some butter.

1515
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,089
-For a richer taste.
-To make it rich.

1516
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,691
ONION

1517
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,593
FINELY CHOPS THE ONION

1518
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,697
POT 2: ONION

1519
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,066
What are you making now, Sam?

1520
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:40,270
It's for the mashed potatoes.

1521
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,105
I'll add the steamed potatoes here later.

1522
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,973
POT 2: ONION, PEPPER, GARLIC FOR LAMB RAGU

1523
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,874
GROUND LAMB

1524
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,511
What's he doing now?

1525
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,480
He added butter to flour.

1526
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,949
-Are you making roux?
-I am.

1527
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,519
A heart shape?

1528
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,054
-With the potato?
-Hearts.

1529
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,556
-He's punching out hearts.
-Hearts?

1530
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:00,590
He's flirting again.

1531
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,660
-He's making heart shapes.
-It's an emergency.

1532
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,729
She said she wanted to marry a potato.

1533
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,797
She said she wanted to marry a potato.

1534
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,801
IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

1535
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,870
-She's falling for him.
-He's throwing out hearts.

1536
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:14,771
Potato hearts.

1537
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,575
He often adds those detailed touches.

1538
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,677
Sam, do you have heart shapes?

1539
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,746
-You have to do something.
-I don't.

1540
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:23,646
Potato hearts.

1541
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,482
Show her your canine teeth, then.

1542
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,283
Make one with your fingers.

1543
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,284
The finger heart.

1544
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,419
LIKE THIS?

1545
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,788
-The finger.
-Show your canine teeth!

1546
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,156
Make a finger heart.

1547
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,824
GETS HIS TEETH READY

1548
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,892
AND A HEART!

1549
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,029
CUTESY SAM

1550
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,132
He had to do that.

1551
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,100
He's doing it for the children.

1552
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,435
-Of course.
-Yes.

1553
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,204
3. STIR-FRY ONION, PEPPER,
GARLIC, AND GROUND LAMB

1554
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,140
CABBAGE

1555
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:54,010
Chef Jong-won is throwing in
everything that Tzuyang loves.

1556
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,312
He is. She said she likes cabbage.

1557
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,548
5. STIR-FRY CABBAGE AND CRUSHED GARLIC
IN OLIVE OIL

1558
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,551
-Are you cooking lamb right now?
-Yes, it's lamb.

1559
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:02,452
-Lamb.
-Yes.

1560
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,554
I hope it doesn't smell.

1561
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,990
I also love black pepper a lot.

1562
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,559
-Black pepper. She loves black pepper.
-She likes black pepper.

1563
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,727
That thing.

1564
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,628
-This?
-Yes.

1565
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,531
-Add some more.
-Pour it in.

1566
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,199
-More?
-Yes.

1567
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,400
ADDING MORE BLACK PEPPER

1568
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,804
OH, DEAR… WHAT MADE SAM LIKE THIS?

1569
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,406
You never added more when we asked you to!

1570
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,941
You've changed a lot.

1571
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,543
-What's that?
-He's changed.

1572
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,645
-Onion powder? Garlic powder?
-Onion powder.

1573
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,447
-Garlic.
-Garlic powder.

1574
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,615
-Is that garlic powder?
-Garlic and onion powder.

1575
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:35,518
AND GROUND PEPPER

1576
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:39,722
PAN 3: THE SAUCE IS DONE!

1577
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,492
WHAT'S THIS ALARM?

1578
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,626
What's that sound?

1579
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,229
Are the potatoes done?

1580
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,498
THE POTATOES FOR THE GNOCCHI ARE DONE!

1581
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,101
-The potatoes are done.
-Already.

1582
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:56,072
6. MASH BOILED POTATO
INTO CHEESE, FLOUR, AND YOLK MIXTURE

1583
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,007
She doesn't like them firm.

1584
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,043
Chef Jong-won,
are the potatoes cooked well?

1585
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,644
-Let me check.
-Are they?

1586
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,646
Sam's potatoes are ready too.

1587
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,981
-Are they done?
-Yes.

1588
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,116
-There's too much water!
-There's still water!

1589
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,452
-It's all right.
-Shouldn't you drain the water?

1590
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,487
It's for mashed potatoes.

1591
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,389
-He'll add butter and more as it dries.
-He's right.

1592
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,325
IT'S TO MAINTAIN THE FLUFFINESS!

1593
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,459
He doesn't drain the water.

1594
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,995
RED SAUCE

1595
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,831
He's using <i>tteokbokki</i> sauce,

1596
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:25,001
but he's using gnocchi
instead of rice cake.

1597
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,471
-Gnocchi.
-He said he'd use gnocchi instead.

1598
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:29,639
AMAZED

1599
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,609
So he's making <i>tteokbokki</i>
and fish cake soup.

1600
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,143
But made with gnocchi.

1601
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,446
-It'll taste quite classy.
-Gnocchi <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1602
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,717
Don't you have to cook it again
after shaping the dough?

1603
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,418
-It cooks in a flash.
-It does?

1604
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,920
The potato was already cooked.

1605
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,389
-Right.
-So it'll cook very quickly.

1606
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,724
Seven minutes and ten seconds.

1607
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,892
Less than half the time left.

1608
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,827
It's a mix of cheese, egg yolk,

1609
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,795
and boiled potatoes.

1610
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,764
He just made the gnocchi dough.

1611
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,366
Jong-won makes the gnocchi dough.

1612
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,169
It's deep yellow,
so it should taste savory and delicious.

1613
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:03,306
The dough he made was more than that,

1614
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,841
but he's using only a small portion.

1615
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,176
He must really want to see
Tzuyang eating just a little.

1616
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,847
Isn't that bullying?

1617
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,949
Yes, you should just use it all.

1618
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,918
He's making the shape with a fork.

1619
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,753
He's doing it like that?

1620
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:17,987
How sweet of him.

1621
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,489
-With a fork?
-That's some detail.

1622
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,326
He never does anything half-heartedly,
no matter what the situation is.

1623
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,961
EXCELLENT COMMENT

1624
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,462
GOOD ONE, EH?

1625
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,732
That way, the sauce will

1626
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,935
-easily seep into those marks.
-It sounds good.

1627
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,037
I don't think I've ever had gnocchi

1628
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,705
that was as good as potatoes.

1629
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,708
-I see. 5 minutes and 40 seconds.
-You'll have one today.

1630
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,144
NAENGMYEON BROTH, BUTTER, CHEESE

1631
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:42,946
ADDING THE STEAMED POTATOES!

1632
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:46,883
5. MIX NAENGMYEON BROTH, BUTTER, CHEESE
WITH MASHED POTATOES

1633
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:49,752
What's that?

1634
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,554
-It's like tomato sauce.
-What is he doing?

1635
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,656
-What's that?
-Tomato sauce?

1636
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,292
-Tomato sauce?
-She had that?

1637
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,927
She did, actually.

1638
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,362
-Barbecue sauce.
-Barbecue sauce.

1639
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,296
POT 2: LAMB RAGU

1640
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,166
AND SOME POTATO AND NAENGMYEON BROTH MIX

1641
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,934
What's that?

1642
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,369
What's he doing?

1643
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,704
-What is that?
-That's…

1644
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,406
-You like spicy food, right?
-It's my favorite <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1645
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:11,307
POURING IN

1646
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,310
-Her favorite <i>tteokbokki</i>!
-<i>Tteokbokki </i>sauce powder?

1647
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,379
-I love that brand.
-You must love spicy food.

1648
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,315
-It's… Yes, that crazy spicy one.
-The crazy spicy one?

1649
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,583
-Chef Jong-won is using
-Wait.

1650
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,220
-lots of MSG today.
-He's…

1651
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,056
He must've learned a lot from me
when we teamed up last time.

1652
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,524
I knew it.

1653
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:32,095
That's why I like that guy.

1654
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:36,165
-He'll now do anything to win.
-Indeed.

1655
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,700
Five minutes.

1656
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,136
-Your turn, Jung-hwan.
-Five minutes.

1657
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:41,871
Only five minutes left?

1658
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,206
POTATO

1659
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,107
Watch your hand.

1660
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,475
Is that a potato?

1661
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,809
Waffle fries?

1662
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,046
What are you grating?

1663
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,114
It's a potato!

1664
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,316
-It turns out like waffles.
-Is he making potato chips?

1665
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,618
There are holes in the shapes.

1666
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:56,786
It's like a net.

1667
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,388
He'll deep-fry them.

1668
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,889
He's deep-frying them.

1669
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,124
I love it so much.

1670
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,693
-It's an interesting shape.
-The gnocchi are done.

1671
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,361
-Will they be crispy?
-You're frying them?

1672
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,764
-Wow.
-He's frying the gnocchi.

1673
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,233
I could just eat that off the pan.

1674
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,036
10. DRAIN BOILED GNOCCHI
AND FRY IN OLIVE OIL

1675
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,737
Once they're deep-fried,

1676
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,174
it'll have the fluffy texture
just how she likes it.

1677
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,842
It'll taste delicious.

1678
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,378
But the time.

1679
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,846
Butter.

1680
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,715
You're fry the gnocchi first.

1681
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,984
-He said he'd make a beverage too.
-He did.

1682
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,585
I wanted to present different textures.

1683
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,587
And the fish cake soup.
What about the fish cake?

1684
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,190
-He has to make the soup and the drink.
-The soup.

1685
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,259
ADDS BUTTER TO NAENGMYEON
BROTH AND POTATO

1686
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,727
PARMESAN

1687
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:38,961
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

1688
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,763
Do you see Sam's mashed potatoes?

1689
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,533
-Can you see if it's fluffy?
-The mashed potatoes.

1690
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,334
Let me try it.

1691
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,736
-That one.
-Yes.

1692
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,640
All right, now.

1693
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,242
Do you want to say thanks or no thanks?

1694
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,412
Thank you so much!

1695
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,513
WHOA!

1696
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,816
-It's very good!
-Thank you so much!

1697
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:03,720
The smell of cheese
mixed with the potato is excellent.

1698
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,188
The flavor is fascinating.

1699
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,491
-That must have a big impact.
-He must've added lots of parmesan.

1700
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,759
It's very good.

1701
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:10,793
Three minutes left!

1702
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,895
A shepherd's pie is
supposed to be roasted in the oven.

1703
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,365
-I think he's getting it ready.
-It has to go into the oven.

1704
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,267
WHAT'S JONG-WON DOING?

1705
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,435
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

1706
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,204
Do you see that <i>tteokbokki </i>sauce?

1707
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,238
-This one?
-Yes!

1708
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,207
The sauce looks really rich.

1709
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,109
-It's really red.
-It is.

1710
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,544
That's the <i>tteokbokki</i> sauce.

1711
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,047
How spicy is it?

1712
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:35,451
Will it be all done by the potatoes?
Or is it gone?

1713
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,621
Will it be all done by the potatoes?
Or is it gone?

1714
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,757
It's great, but it's too spicy for me.

1715
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:45,394
But it's probably good for Tzuyang.

1716
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,396
-It's spicy.
-It's too spicy for Jung-hwan.

1717
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,165
It's very spicy. I'm bad with spicy food.

1718
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,467
-It must be quite spicy.
-It's very rich.

1719
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:52,368
-It's spicy.
-It is?

1720
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,903
SPICINESS LEVEL TO TZUYANG'S TASTE!

1721
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,672
You have two minutes left.

1722
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:57,740
Mozzarella.

1723
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,275
Do you have enough time to bake it?

1724
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,643
-No.
-You don't?

1725
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,812
-So you'll serve it as is?
-As is.

1726
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,514
Chef Sam is almost done.

1727
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,516
ADDING HINTS OF TOMATO SAUCE
IN THE CORNERS

1728
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:11,854
6. PILE IN THE ORDER OF RAGU,
MOZZARELLA, AND MASHED POTATO

1729
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:16,058
HE CHOOSES THE MICROWAVE
INSTEAD OF AN OVEN

1730
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,227
NAENGMYEON BROTH AND ROUX

1731
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,164
That sauce Sam made looks so good.

1732
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,100
HE PLATES THE SAUCE FIRST

1733
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,302
-A minute and a half.
-A minute and a half.

1734
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:27,236
ALREADY?

1735
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:28,871
MAKING THE BEVERAGE!

1736
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,507
ICED TEA, ORANGE JUICE

1737
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,042
ORANGE, APPLE

1738
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,877
He's adding an apple.

1739
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,779
An apple? For dessert?

1740
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,414
12. MIX ICED TEA, JUICE, APPLE, ORANGE

1741
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,916
-The juice?
-Is there ice?

1742
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,018
-The beverage.
-I wonder what the juice is like.

1743
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,387
He's making a beverage.

1744
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,321
IN A DAZE

1745
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,923
What? When did he do that?

1746
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,492
AND THE WAFFLE CHIPS!

1747
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,896
IT LOOKS EXCELLENT!

1748
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,299
He's making <i>tteokbokki,</i>
fish cake soup, and a beverage.

1749
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,466
One minute left!

1750
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,935
One minute.

1751
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,736
-The torch.
-The torch.

1752
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:02,438
Use the torch.

1753
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,106
A torch.

1754
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,641
7. SEAR THE TOP WITH A TORCH

1755
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,410
-It looks good.
-He's searing it with a torch.

1756
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,079
-Wow. The torch.
-That looks so good.

1757
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,881
It smells smoky too.

1758
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,717
-Forty seconds.
-Forty seconds.

1759
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,252
WHAT'S NEXT?

1760
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,255
-It's almost over.
-Sam is done!

1761
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,756
-Sam is finished.
-The fish cake soup.

1762
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:22,859
ONLY SON JONG-WON'S BEVERAGE IS DONE

1763
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,994
You're serving her this tiny bowl?

1764
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,028
TINY LITTLE SOUP BOWL

1765
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,296
His hands are shaking.

1766
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,166
-They aren't.
-His hands are shaking! Twenty seconds.

1767
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,201
-What? They're shaking violently.
-Twenty seconds.

1768
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,204
-They're shaking, but he denies it.
-Counting down.

1769
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,772
-Fourteen.
-<i>Tteokbokki.</i>

1770
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,308
-Tteokbokki.
-It'll look so nice.

1771
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,777
-Ten seconds. Nine.
-Nine.

1772
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,247
ANXIOUS

1773
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,382
-Six. Five.
-It's so red.

1774
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,585
-Four. Three. Two.
-It looks really spicy.

1775
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,854
-One. He's done.
-He's done.

1776
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,422
-He's done.
-It smells good.

1777
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,425
It seems quite spicy.

1778
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:57,560
A SPICY SCENT FILLS THE AIR

1779
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,896
-It looks good.
-With potato chips.

1780
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,932
They both look so pretty.

1781
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,200
BOTH DISHES LOOK LOVELY

1782
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,737
AMAZED

1783
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:12,975
Both potato dishes are served.
All Done with Potatoes.

1784
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,145
Chef Sam's dish, Thank you, Tater.

1785
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,381
SAUCE TO ADD MORE SAVORY FLAVOR

1786
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,350
SERVED WITH SOFT SHEPHERD'S PIE

1787
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:26,355
CHEF SAM KIM'S THANK YOU, TATER

1788
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,090
I've never seen her eat so little.

1789
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:29,525
What about this sauce?

1790
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,661
-Should she pour it?
-Pour it on the side.

1791
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:32,995
-On the side?
-Yes.

1792
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,431
It might get too salty
if you pour it all at once.

1793
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:38,501
I'll pour just a little over here.

1794
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,469
Take a big bite with the meat.

1795
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,571
I'll get a bite from the middle first

1796
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:43,940
-without the sauce.
-It looks soft.

1797
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,108
-It looks good.
-And fluffy.

1798
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:51,180
-It's the best dish for potato lovers.
-Did he bring out her favorite texture?

1799
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,616
There's lamb at the bottom

1800
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:54,984
with melted cheese.

1801
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,954
There's so much juice at the bottom

1802
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,588
mixed with fat. It looks so good.

1803
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:00,756
-Thank you.
-I see.

1804
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,792
-It looks hot.
-Careful. It's still hot.

1805
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:03,693
It must be hot.

1806
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,629
A BIG BITE

1807
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,831
All Done with Potatoes.

1808
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,133
It must be good.

1809
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,835
MMM

1810
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,538
-Thank you, Tater.
-It must be good.

1811
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,174
She shows a big smile.

1812
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,508
It has to be good, though.

1813
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:23,179
-I only know that song about potatoes.
-Wait.

1814
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,047
You didn't chew, did you?

1815
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,351
-I didn't have to.
-It just melted in your mouth.

1816
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,619
You had to chew the lamb, though.

1817
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,855
The lamb was already ground,

1818
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:35,491
-so it's soft and moist.
-He ground the meat.

1819
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,960
I barely had to chew.

1820
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,262
It definitely smells like lamb,

1821
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,431
but it goes so well with the potato.

1822
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:48,004
And the potato was made perfectly
to the creamy texture that I love.

1823
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,108
-Let me try it with the sauce.
-The sauce.

1824
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,310
-She tried it without sauce.
-What?

1825
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,879
-What's the red sauce?
-There's red sauce here.

1826
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,849
You had tomato <i>jjamppong,</i>
so I boiled that down.

1827
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,250
Tomato <i>jjamppong?</i>

1828
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,519
That's new.

1829
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,455
MMM

1830
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,557
JEALOUS

1831
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:12,261
It almost tastes like pizza.

1832
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:15,364
-Because of the tomato sauce.
-Tomatoes and potatoes.

1833
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,266
Yes, it's usually that and meat.

1834
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,937
-Thumbs up.
-Two thumbs up.

1835
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:24,774
It has to be all done by potatoes, though.

1836
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,609
Not by the sauce.

1837
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,546
-It looks good.
-This is the essence of potatoes.

1838
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,917
May I grab a beverage from my fridge?

1839
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,385
-Yes, of course.
-Sure.

1840
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:39,522
-She said she has beverages as she eats.
-Yes.

1841
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,458
-She looks so happy.
-I'm craving something carbonated.

1842
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:44,560
It's as if she's shopping
at a convenience store.

1843
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,029
-The grape-flavored soda.
-Yes.

1844
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,065
-This one.
-It'll go so well with the pie.

1845
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,300
-I love having potatoes with soda.
-Yes.

1846
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,335
-Potatoes and soda.
-She likes to eat it like this.

1847
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,305
GAS STATION OPEN FOR BUSINESS

1848
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,574
-I can't believe it.
-It's like she's chugging beer.

1849
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,744
-Doesn't it hurt your throat?
-Will she finish the can?

1850
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,712
You can't burp here.

1851
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,748
-What?
-It's gone.

1852
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,417
-She's done with it.
-I mean…

1853
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,853
I've been craving something to drink,

1854
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,954
but I had to hold back.

1855
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,022
HER SHOCKED PEER

1856
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:17,026
-You can't usually chug soda.
-You can't swallow it fast.

1857
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,095
The fizz stops you from chugging.

1858
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:19,995
Is it even better?

1859
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,398
THE MUKBANG ARTIST WON'T STOP

1860
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,866
It's like watching her <i>mukbang.</i>

1861
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,835
We can't ask her to stop here.

1862
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,903
-It must be so good.
-It must be nice

1863
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,305
if a guest like her shows up, chefs.

1864
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,407
-You'd say, "Thank you, Tater."
-Yes.

1865
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,777
THIS TIME, SHE POURS THE SAUCE

1866
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,245
She suddenly pours the sauce.

1867
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,681
I want to mix it with everything.

1868
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,349
If you watch her videos,

1869
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:45,554
the chefs always come out
to shake hands with a big smile.

1870
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,889
This is why.

1871
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,492
She's someone
who finishes everything on the plate.

1872
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,393
-They'd love that.
-They would.

1873
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,928
All Done with Potatoes.

1874
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,230
A BIG BITE WITH THE SAUCE

1875
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,464
What?

1876
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:58,968
It tastes a lot like tomatoes
after I mixed everything.

1877
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,536
-It's so good.
-I see.

1878
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,739
Tomatoes have a strong flavor.

1879
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,307
She eats so well.

1880
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,509
IN HER ZONE

1881
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:10,479
Would you like to leave some behind,
try that one, and come back to it?

1882
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:14,016
Yes, I don't want it to get cold.

1883
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,853
REFRESHING ICED TEA WITH FRUIT,

1884
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,626
SEAFOOD FISH CAKE SOUP,
AND GNOCCHI TTEOKBOKKI

1885
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:29,064
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S TOTALLY GNOCCHI VICKY

1886
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:31,934
ONE MORE BITE

1887
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,369
She took one more bite just now.

1888
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,870
Would you like another beverage?

1889
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,773
-The same thing?
-He served a beverage.

1890
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,808
Right. He made some for her.

1891
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,645
-Chef Jong-won made a beverage.
-The glass is too small.

1892
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,915
-Wait, that glass is not big enough.
-It's tiny.

1893
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,585
-I don't need the glass.
-She doesn't need it.

1894
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,821
-She didn't even consider using it.
-She'd rather not use it.

1895
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,958
-She'll just drink it out of the pitcher.
-She didn't even consider it.

1896
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:56,892
Chef Jong-won.

1897
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,094
You should've gotten
a glass big enough for her.

1898
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,964
-Thank you.
-Tzuyang Gas Station.

1899
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,900
Let's see how she drinks her beverage.

1900
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,535
She doesn't need a glass.

1901
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:10,339
Not a lot of people
drink it straight from the pitcher.

1902
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,374
Isn't it cold?

1903
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,310
She might get a headache.

1904
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,111
-How's the beverage?
-Is it good?

1905
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,546
I LIKE IT

1906
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,548
-It's so good!
-What's it like?

1907
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,917
I taste some iced tea

1908
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,420
-and some orange juice.
-Did he mix those?

1909
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:28,090
And I can taste a lot of fruit in this.

1910
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,291
-Does it taste richer?
-Artificial flavor?

1911
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:32,228
-It's very rich and tropical.
-I see. That's nice.

1912
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:33,862
It's real iced tea.

1913
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:35,598
She can drink that first, right?

1914
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,266
Actually, it was for her to drink

1915
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,235
-when the food got too spicy.
-Really?

1916
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,270
But you can have it first.

1917
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,438
What should I begin with?

1918
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,307
-Please try the gnocchi <i>tteokbokki</i> first.
-Gnocchi.

1919
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,776
You'll find potatoes
that come in many different textures.

1920
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:52,214
I hope she likes
the spiciness of the dish.

1921
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,983
-It was overly spicy for me.
-Right.

1922
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:54,883
A BITE

1923
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,120
HUH?

1924
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:01,824
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER BITE

1925
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:04,193
-He made the gnocchi with potatoes.
-Is it like gnocchi?

1926
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,128
How do I put it?

1927
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,263
THE THIRD BITE

1928
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,765
He deep-fried the potato too, right?

1929
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,367
QUIETLY TAKES THE FOURTH BITE

1930
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,668
It must be good, though.

1931
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,537
I wouldn't say this is <i>tteokbokki.</i>

1932
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:16,872
It's like the sauce you'd eat

1933
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,775
-with braised pollack or cutlassfish.
-Braised cutlassfish.

1934
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,844
He used seafood broth, didn't he?

1935
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,480
<i>-He used seafood broth.</i>
<i>-It was seafood broth.</i>

1936
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,715
<i>-It has a strong flavor.</i>
<i>-Potatoes with seafood.</i>

1937
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,953
But it should taste all right
if it goes well with the potato.

1938
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,322
What about the spiciness? Is it okay?

1939
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,058
-It's perfect for me.
-Is it?

1940
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,660
Please have some soup too.

1941
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:40,462
Also, these chips are so crunchy.

1942
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:43,832
They're much better
than store-bought chips.

1943
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,801
Better than store-bought chips.

1944
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,203
It's not easy to beat those.

1945
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,773
She's almost done already.

1946
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,608
Waffle-shaped potato chips.

1947
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:55,911
I mixed gnocchi
with regular fluffy, boiled potatoes.

1948
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,713
Try the soup too.

1949
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,449
-The soup. Try the soup.
-The fish cake soup.

1950
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,084
Anything about the soup?

1951
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,353
If you stir the soup,

1952
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,621
you'll see the potato hearts.

1953
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,423
Look at the color. It looks so good.

1954
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,658
-It's not working.
-"Hearts? Whatever."

1955
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,427
-It's the soup.
-It's not working.

1956
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,228
She's immune to it.

1957
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,432
He thought she'd go,
"Look at these potato hearts!"

1958
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,367
She's like,
"The amount of food is too little."

1959
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,037
BOTTOMS UP WITH THE SOUP

1960
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,872
She finishes everything at once.

1961
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,909
-She had everything at one bite.
-It's as if she's having <i>makgeolli.</i>

1962
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,279
-It's so good. Is there more?
-Is there more?

1963
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,449
-It was way too little.
-She needs one more bowl.

1964
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,717
He wasn't expecting this.

1965
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:36,785
-I do have some more.
-You do?

1966
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,254
She doesn't care for those hearts.

1967
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,423
-She only wants something delicious.
-It didn't work.

1968
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,659
I guess my operation failed.

1969
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,094
She eats so well.

1970
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,229
She's done with Chef Son's dishes.

1971
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,264
She returns to Sam's dish once again.

1972
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,471
I think I have a feeling.

1973
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:59,108
It's even more delicious
after you eat something spicy.

1974
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:02,344
These two should come as a set.

1975
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,746
EYES SHUT

1976
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,081
Her eyes are shut tightly.

1977
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,817
-She gets yet another bowl.
-It must be good when it's warm.

1978
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,552
The soup is still hot.

1979
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:13,055
It'll taste great with hot soup.

1980
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,491
-These two work well together.
-They both did great.

1981
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,860
ENVIOUS

1982
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:21,163
-She seems to love liquids.
-She does.

1983
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,631
MAN

1984
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,333
Listen to her.

1985
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,769
-Is that a drink?
-You can't drink Jong-won's soup

1986
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,804
after eating Sam's dish.

1987
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,939
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you not see the potato hearts?

1988
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,709
Don't just mention the soup.
He made little hearts.

1989
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,644
-I'm sorry. Hey!
-He made potato hearts.

1990
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:36,545
FINALLY FOUND ONE

1991
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:39,415
-She finally saw it!
-It's to make your heart race.

1992
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,517
-We kept talking about it.
-We kept saying it.

1993
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,819
-They were way too small.
-I added like four of those.

1994
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,189
-Yes, it's right here.
-It didn't work.

1995
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,825
She eats it before looking at it,
so of course, she didn't notice.

1996
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:53,328
-Thank you.
-She has no time for that. She needs soup.

1997
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,230
Why didn't you make those bigger?

1998
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:58,133
-I'm sorry.
-It wasn't big enough for her.

1999
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,702
She finished two bowls.

2000
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,172
-Watching her makes me hungry.
-Yes, just by watching her.

2001
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,274
So this is why people watch <i>mukbang</i>.

2002
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,708
I have a question.

2003
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,510
Can you try this in the glass too?

2004
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,479
This? In here?

2005
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,815
-I want to see what it's like.
-In here?

2006
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,585
-What?
-The gas station.

2007
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:20,522
IS THAT A BLACK HOLE?

2008
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,724
-It's gone.
-You should savor it.

2009
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,493
It's faster than just pouring it out.

2010
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,994
-Did it go in?
-It just drops.

2011
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,796
Please try to savor it.

2012
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,065
She's trying.

2013
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,600
CHUG

2014
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,204
Just closing your eyes
doesn't mean you're savoring it.

2015
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,207
You have to keep it in your mouth
and enjoy the taste.

2016
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:41,310
-I can't stop midway.
-She can't do that.

2017
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:43,812
-She can't just hold it in.
-I guess so.

2018
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,214
It's hard for her.

2019
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:47,749
She eats fast.

2020
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,852
-There's nothing more to eat.
-She's done.

2021
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,220
All cleared.

2022
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,855
She eats so well.

2023
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,890
HER MUKBANG MADE EVERYONE HAPPY

2024
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,758
-It's time to decide.
-Yes.

2025
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,094
-It's so hard.
-It's the moment of truth.

2026
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,062
The decision.

2027
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,498
<i>Press one for Son Jong-won</i>

2028
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,066
<i>and two for Sam Kim.</i>

2029
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,602
Make your decision

2030
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,270
and press the button.

2031
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:11,073
-I'm sorry.
-She apologizes.

2032
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,175
-She keeps saying sorry.
-All right.

2033
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:14,076
-Did you push it?
-Yes.

2034
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,111
Let's find out the result.

2035
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,716
This was the third fight
between Sam and Jong-won.

2036
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,118
Jong-won had won two previous rounds.

2037
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,321
But which one of them did Tzuyang choose?

2038
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,991
All Done with Potatoes.

2039
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,292
Who won this round?

2040
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,194
Show us the result!

2041
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,462
Who did Tzuyang choose?

2042
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,163
SAM KIM WINS

2043
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:36,565
THANK YOU, TATER WINS

2044
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,033
Sam Kim wins!

2045
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,968
-It's different from before.
-Sam wins.

2046
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,104
SAM WINS FOR THE FIRST TIME
AGAINST JONG-WON

2047
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:45,173
I can hear grade school kids crying.

2048
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,010
-They must be wailing.
-They're crying.

2049
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,945
I'm sorry, Ji-yul.

2050
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,780
Little kids are crying.

2051
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,616
I'M SORRY, KIDS

2052
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,785
What made the difference?

2053
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,754
Chef Jong-won's dishes

2054
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,523
were more of a personal favorite

2055
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,358
because I love flour-based foods.

2056
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:06,028
Also, I have fish cake soup
every single day.

2057
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,764
It's a part of how I start my day.

2058
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,698
But the thing is,

2059
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,633
what I love the most is fluffy potatoes.

2060
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,403
-She mentioned the plumpness.
-Yes.

2061
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,705
-"Plumpness"?
-Fluffiness.

2062
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,073
Piglets are plump, not potatoes.

2063
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,342
The difference was in the fluffiness.

2064
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,779
Please put a star on Chef Sam, Tzuyang.

2065
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:24,980
Congratulations!

2066
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,848
Sam Kim!

2067
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,884
-Sam takes yet another star.
-Thank you.

2068
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:30,552
Congratulations on your sixth victory!

2069
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:31,687
It was so good.

2070
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:32,921
CONGRATULATIONS

2071
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,857
IT'S NOT OVER YET

2072
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,328
THE 2ND EPISODE OF THE BIG EATERS

2073
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,296
She brought her own utensils.

2074
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,397
BROUGHT HER OWN

2075
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:43,865
I get tired of food easily,

2076
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,567
so I never stock up on one thing.

2077
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:48,937
-I ate 24 Korean melons on camera.
-You ate 24?

2078
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,873
-You need a whole bottle for bibimbap.
-Sesame oil?

2079
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:52,841
NO WAY

2080
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:53,875
Sure, you get bored easily.

2081
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,410
MAKE A DISH SHE'LL KEEP CRAVING

2082
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,112
FOR THE EASILY BORED HATNIM

2083
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,281
-This looks really good.
-It looks good.

2084
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,583
Just watching them cook
makes her crave beverages.

2085
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,085
We get to see lots of new things today.

2086
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,387
She makes it look so good.
It already looks delicious.

2087
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,122
-Mmm!
-She's definitely enjoying it.

2088
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,124
I think I can keep eating this.

2089
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:10,959
The first time on the show.

2090
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,528
The dishes I had before are long gone now.

2091
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,130
Look at the oil.

2092
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,265
How much meat are you using?

2093
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:18,300
Isn't that too much?

2094
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,935
That's so crazy.

2095
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,637
TRY SOME(?)

2096
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,840
-Hey, get cooking! What are you doing?
-Nam-no!

2097
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,074
FEISTY MUKBANG

2098
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,075
That's what I call <i>mukbang.</i>

2099
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,477
ASTONISHED

2100
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,212
The view count keeps rising.

2101
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,914
WHICH DISH CAPTURED HER APPETITE?

2102
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,183
That one made Hatnim show a big smile.

2103
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,020
Can I have one too?

2104
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,287
Pick anything you want.

2105
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,757
This place is a paradise.

2106
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,693
-You really love to eat.
-Thank you.

2107
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:59,174
