1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,984
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,855
The best chefs in Korea
will turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,957
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,593
-<i>Chef & My Fridge!</i>
-<i>My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,664
-Welcome to the show, everyone.
-Welcome.

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:36,436
There's a saying, "May our days
always be abundant like Chuseok."

7
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,371
It's the holiday season again.

8
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,974
And to celebrate
the biggest Korean holiday of the year,

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,878
we prepared a very special episode.

10
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,081
I've worked with numerous guests,

11
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,216
but I never expected to see them here.

12
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,286
-It was unimaginable.
-It was.

13
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,488
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> is on a roll.

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,758
-Can you pinch me?
-Why? Does it not feel real?

15
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,327
It's true. We're in the real world.

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,730
-I can't believe this is happening.
-It is.

17
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,765
TODAY'S GUESTS WAIT BEHIND THE LED SCREEN

18
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,468
Suck in your stomach all the way.

19
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,136
-Your tummy.
-Jeez.

20
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,971
Speak for yourself.

21
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,508
Don't stick out your neck
like this, honey. Okay?

22
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,211
Don't stick out your neck like this.
Don't do that.

23
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,312
You keep joking around.

24
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,615
Let us present

25
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,752
the guests
for our special Chuseok episode!

26
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,153
Come on out!

27
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,758
-Who could it be?
-I'm curious.

28
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:43,970
Please welcome President Lee Jae-myung
and First Lady Kim Hea-kyung!

29
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,372
-Hello. It's great to meet you. This way.
-Hello.

30
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,008
-Nice to meet you.
-We're honored to have you here.

31
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,610
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

32
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,947
I would like to say hello
to all these famous people.

33
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,381
-Nice to meet you.
-He should meet them.

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,816
Nice to meet you.

35
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,785
GREETING HIM THE ITALIAN WAY(?)

36
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,453
Hello, Ji-sun.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,422
-This way, please.
-It's nice to meet you.

38
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,291
ABSOLUTELY NERVOUS

39
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,594
CHUCKLING

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,362
BROKEN AND CHUCKLING!

41
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,396
ALL HE CAN DO IS LAUGH

42
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,634
There's no need for us
to present these two guests.

43
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,570
The President and the First Lady of Korea

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,307
have visited <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> today.

45
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:25,411
Isn't this your first time on a TV program
after your inauguration?

46
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,280
-Come to think of it, yes.
-Isn't that so?

47
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,549
And a variety show, no less.

48
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,952
-Our viewers must be surprised.
-They must be.

49
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,423
Why don't you greet the people
as we celebrate the Chuseok holiday?

50
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,093
Hello, it's great to be here.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,462
It's been way too long,

52
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,863
so I feel quite awkward.

53
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,801
Abundance is the first word that
comes to mind when thinking of Chuseok,

54
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,470
so may your holidays be abundant.

55
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,806
I hope you enjoy your Chuseok holiday.

56
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,577
I hope you enjoy great food
with your entire family

57
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,012
as we celebrate Chuseok,

58
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,614
and have a great time together.

59
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,717
Also, tune in to <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> too.

60
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,387
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

61
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,222
You came practiced.

62
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,157
BLUSH

63
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,559
Thank you.

64
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,697
The first question I have for you
is if you have watched our show before.

65
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,334
Of course, I have.
I'm a huge fan of the chefs.

66
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,770
-Thank you.
-They must feel familiar to you.

67
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,738
They're already very famous,

68
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,007
so I'm very nervous right now.

69
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,678
She really watches many cooking programs.

70
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,213
You must be interested.

71
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,281
-I came with ulterior motives.
-You did?

72
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,317
Thank you. All right.

73
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,521
Many people must be curious
why you decided to visit us today.

74
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,856
Food is very important

75
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,859
-during the Chuseok holiday.
-Of course.

76
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,062
Our country isn't abundant in resources,

77
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,897
so culture is our greatest asset.

78
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,999
K-pop and TV shows are important,

79
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,202
but I believe food
is the true key of our culture.

80
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,837
<i>Food can be timeless.</i>

81
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,207
<i>Once the food grows on you,</i>
<i>it's hard to forget.</i>

82
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,575
-It can last.
-Lasting.

83
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,445
It is an industry
that can greatly benefit our economy

84
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,581
if we successfully export
Korean food culture.

85
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,517
Also, I hear this program
is quite popular.

86
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,852
That's true.

87
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,354
HELLO, WORLD, ARE YOU WATCHING?

88
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,790
Our program is currently available
on one of the global OTT platforms,

89
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,727
so the whole world can watch it now.

90
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:25,164
I also think it's quite significant that
the President and the First Lady are here.

91
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:29,535
I was a mother
who had to cook at home, right?

92
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,372
I saw that chefs on this show

93
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,477
create many new kinds of dishes
with their fascinating ideas.

94
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,647
So whenever their creativity surprises me,

95
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:44,684
I think that Korean cuisine has
such huge potential for development.

96
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,120
It's both the reason why I watch the show

97
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,423
-and why we came to visit you today.
-Very well.

98
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,327
Everything you just said
is the overall vision of our show.

99
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,795
You saw right through us.

100
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,697
-It's our essence.
-Yes.

101
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,668
Was there any content
that recently caught your attention?

102
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,504
My son recommended

103
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,372
<i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> to me.

104
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,309
-Oh, you've watched it?
-At first,

105
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,345
I thought I'd watch for five minutes
because our people were interested.

106
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,580
But I ended up finishing the show.

107
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,385
My favorite scene was

108
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,120
-the Saja Boys.
-Saja Boys.

109
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,522
They posed like this, right?

110
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,956
THIS SCENE?

111
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,993
I heard that the Korean diaspora
were most touched

112
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,764
by the scene where Huntrix
chows on <i>gimbap,</i>

113
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,500
because many of them
had been previously criticized

114
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,736
when their moms made them <i>gimbap</i>
for lunch at school.

115
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,472
I got into so many fights with Italians.

116
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,474
For smelling like garlic.

117
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,343
-Gosh.
-But my Italian friends

118
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,746
-always ask me for bulgogi these days.
-Right? They're crazy for it.

119
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,881
I also believe

120
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,884
the First Lady has earned a nickname
as the K-food evangelist

121
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,821
because of many endeavors
she made for our food culture.

122
00:05:54,887 --> 00:06:00,993
I once made <i>gimbap</i> with children
in New York at an event.

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,895
-And you made it yourself?
-I did.

124
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,531
And that was the first time
I saw frozen <i>gimbap.</i>

125
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,633
-Frozen <i>gimbap?</i>
-Yes, that's huge now.

126
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,736
-It's good.
-I've had it, and it was good.

127
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,271
You can get it in Italy too.

128
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,808
<i>Gimbap</i> used to be called sushi, remember?

129
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,178
But these days,
we get to call it what it is, <i>gimbap.</i>

130
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,446
How the times have changed.

131
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,816
Chefs, do you also see the potential
in K-food? What do you think?

132
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,586
I went to Singapore
for the first time a decade or so ago,

133
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,155
and there weren't many Korean restaurants.

134
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,624
But now, there are streets
of Korean restaurants

135
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,926
like a Koreatown,

136
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,695
and when people ask me for a photo,

137
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,165
they even ask me to pose like this,
like I'm sprinkling salt.

138
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,734
I'm sure <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>
plays a huge part.

139
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,736
I went to Hong Kong,

140
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,839
and I saw one of the locals waiting.

141
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,207
As soon as that person saw me,

142
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,443
the person handed me something,

143
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,879
and I brought it here
because it was interesting.

144
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,281
-Did you get those from Hong Kong?
-Yes.

145
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,384
These are animated moments
from <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

146
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,120
-From a Hong Kong local?
-Yes, I got it there.

147
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,455
Wait, is that me?

148
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,924
-I'm there too.
-It's not just one or two.

149
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,094
Your faces, names,
and the kinds of food you make

150
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,463
all come with a competitive edge,

151
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,633
so I believe we should
turn them into products and an industry.

152
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,401
You should start a business later.

153
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,104
-A business.
-Me?

154
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,572
A food business.

155
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,340
-I'm not a chef.
-He's a webtoon artist.

156
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm a webtoon artist.

157
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,811
-You'll do a great job. You can draw too.
-Me?

158
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,814
Well, I guess I'll start something.

159
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,483
-I guess I will.
-He has run a business before.

160
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,952
Today, remember that
you're representing the country.

161
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,554
-The country?
-Be prepared.

162
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,055
You must feel a lot of pressure.

163
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,859
-Yes, there's so much pressure.
-He's putting a lot of pressure on us.

164
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,594
It's a bit burdensome.

165
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,829
We now have duties.

166
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:43,963
Have you all been

167
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,198
cooking as a joke?

168
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,467
Just keep doing what you have been doing.

169
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,636
-Let's do our best just as we always have.
-With a sense of duty. Okay?

170
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,672
-All right.
-Do pay extra attention today.

171
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,042
According to our research,

172
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,011
the First Lady had published
a recipe book.

173
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:04,083
There are many excellent chefs out there
who can't publish recipe books.

174
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,152
My family enjoys

175
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,855
the food I make at home,

176
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,724
-so I took courage and published that.
-I see.

177
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,160
-It's embarrassing in front of the chefs.
-It's not easy.

178
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,296
And I'm the guy
who's honored to eat her food.

179
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,866
Let me ask you a question.

180
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,636
Out of all the food your wife makes,

181
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,072
what is the one dish
you wanted to show off to everyone?

182
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,307
-There are so many of them.
-Okay.

183
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,777
The one I love the most
is braised mackerel with <i>siraegi.</i>

184
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,614
Braised mackerel with <i>siraegi,</i>
dried radish greens.

185
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,515
-That's such a good dish.
-It's a good one.

186
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,050
-Seafood?
-A braised dish made

187
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,020
-with tender <i>siraegi</i> and mackerel.
-Is it because of the mackerel or <i>siraegi?</i>

188
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,788
-I love both.
-Both.

189
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,824
-They're a great combination.
-Yes.

190
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,193
-What's in second place?
-For second place…

191
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,362
One day, she suddenly gave me

192
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,465
a huge load of stir-fried vegetables,
something I had never seen before.

193
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,433
-Stir-fried vegetables?
-Yes.

194
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,637
It was made by stir-frying tomatoes
and other things,

195
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,805
-so I asked her for the name.
-Okay.

196
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,507
-Rata…
-Ratatouille.

197
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,577
-Ratatouille?
-The vegetable dish.

198
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,513
-Is that a French dish? Ratatouille.
-That's right.

199
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,582
I really love vegetables,

200
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,319
and that stir-fried dish tasted excellent.

201
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,955
I heard something amazing
about the First Lady.

202
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,958
The President never ate Western cuisine.

203
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,160
-That's right.
-He only liked to eat Korean cuisine,

204
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,130
but he began to eat
more Western dishes after ratatouille.

205
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,000
-It wasn't widely available long ago…
-It wasn't.

206
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,002
…and it didn't feel familiar,

207
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,804
so I never particularly enjoyed it.

208
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,408
But after that, I told her,
"Was Western cuisine always this good?"

209
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,244
What's the first Western dish
you ever had?

210
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,613
I had it for the first time in college.

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,115
Back then, we had pork cutlet
when we met for group blind dates.

212
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,252
You've been on a group blind date
at a pork cutlet place?

213
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,955
-I've done it a few times.
-I see.

214
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,991
It was either pork cutlet
or hamburger steak.

215
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,594
Was it one-on-one or a group date?

216
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,030
-You're really prying into this.
-I don't think I can say it.

217
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,699
-Should I stop?
-Stop teasing him.

218
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,733
PAT

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,701
Please calm down.

220
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,169
-You're being mean.
-Enough!

221
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,138
-You're so silly.
-After all, this is a variety show.

222
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,240
-What if she stops making ratatouille?
-All right.

223
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,143
You shouldn't cause trouble
in the family during the holidays.

224
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,946
Exactly! We're trying
to enjoy the holidays.

225
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,215
All right. Goodness.

226
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,216
THAT'S ENOUGH NOW…

227
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,485
So I didn't eat Western cuisine often
after those days.

228
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,021
One day, we went
to Children's Grand Park with our kids,

229
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,123
-and I had pizza for the first time.
-Pizza.

230
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,726
-Pizza? With your family?
-Yes.

231
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,894
It was my first time,
so I ended up overeating

232
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,763
and fell sick from indigestion.

233
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,264
-With an upset stomach?
-Yes.

234
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,133
You must've had a lot
because you liked it.

235
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,068
I thought, "This is pretty good."

236
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,404
We received intel
from our production crew.

237
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,874
Even when you two are in a fight,

238
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,477
you don't forget
to eat your meal in the middle.

239
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,245
You call a truce during your fight,

240
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,114
eat your meal,
and then go back to the fight.

241
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,849
-Back at it?
-You make sure you eat

242
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,651
even when you're in a fight.

243
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,919
We hear that you two
are this serious about food…

244
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,022
-That's so new.
-…and eating meals.

245
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,023
-It is new.
-Is it true?

246
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,692
-We--
-If we continue to fight<i>…</i>

247
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,028
<i>…</i>and skip meals altogether,

248
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,230
we later forget why the fight began

249
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,933
-and end up fighting over not eating.
-Right! I get it.

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,269
So yes, we do eat,
and I don't forget to keep him fed.

251
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,906
-She throws the bowls down.
-Yes, of course.

252
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,876
-She isn't happy with you.
-Like how bars slide beer at you.

253
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,978
-In containers.
-She just throws them down.

254
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,547
I serve the side dishes
in their containers, not on a dish.

255
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,249
WE'RE ALL ALIKE

256
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,284
We've all been there.

257
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,454
Since our younger days,

258
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,523
he got into the habit

259
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,592
of writing a letter after our fights.

260
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,527
That's sweet.

261
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,662
-He'd write me long letters…
-Long letters?

262
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,631
…and slide them to me quietly.

263
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,400
It's easier to jot down how you feel
instead of saying it in words.

264
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,169
-Letters are effective.
-Are they?

265
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,905
-They were mostly written apologies.
-Of course.

266
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,875
-Well, since I'm mostly at fault.
-I see. All right.

267
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,778
It seemed like, today especially,

268
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,782
you wanted to share Korean food culture
with the rest of the world,

269
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,887
so we plan to give a proper presentation
of Korean food ingredients.

270
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,924
-I hope to see an abundance on Chuseok.
-Yes.

271
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,928
That's why we'll present
the ingredients we eat the most

272
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,598
-in this particular time of the year.
-The food in season.

273
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,633
<i>If you're watching us from abroad,</i>

274
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,304
<i>this is what you want to eat</i>
<i>when you visit Korea around this time.</i>

275
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,907
However, the rule for winning a star

276
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,042
cannot be changed.

277
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,512
No matter how nice the dishes are,
they can't win it if you don't like it.

278
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,380
-We can't help it.
-Rules are rules.

279
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,416
Try to adjust to her palate if you can.

280
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,520
I don't have much power in home politics.

281
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,355
-That was an important tip.
-Yes.

282
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,659
Let us present
the Korean ingredients in season!

283
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,195
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

284
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,731
Very well, then.

285
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,500
Look at that. Quite a stock we have here.

286
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,502
-A good harvest.
-This is what Chuseok should be like.

287
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,971
May our days
always be abundant like Chuseok.

288
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,507
This is the time of the year
when ingredients are in abundance.

289
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,809
Those apples are
as big as a person's head.

290
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,311
If there are ingredients
you like in particular

291
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,814
or those that carry special memories,

292
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,750
please let us know when they come up.

293
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,720
-It'll be helpful for the chefs.
-Right.

294
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,088
What's this?

295
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,990
That's taro.

296
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,192
-Taro.
-This is Taro.

297
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,028
-Is this <i>deodeok?</i>
-<i>Deodeok.</i>

298
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,496
-Ginseng, lotus root.
-Lotus root.

299
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,397
Sweet potatoes.

300
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,833
-I want to point out <i>deodeok.</i>
-<i>Deodeok?</i>

301
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,601
-He singles out <i>deodeok.</i>
-Yes.

302
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,637
I used to dig them up and eat them often.

303
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,872
-You dug it up?
-Yes.

304
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,175
I used to dig up all kinds
of ingredients from the mountains.

305
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:33,012
<i>Deodeok</i> was readily available,
and it smells wonderful too.

306
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,714
Back then, you probably
didn't eat it for your health.

307
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,751
-You were hungry, and it was edible.
-Because it was edible.

308
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,687
-It turned out to be good for you too.
-Yes.

309
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,191
I can still tell what <i>deodeok </i>is
when I go hiking these days.

310
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,860
You can tell
just by looking at the stems.

311
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,362
Next, <i>pyogo</i> and pine mushrooms.

312
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:55,701
We used to keep a bag of <i>pyogo</i>
at all times in our fridge,

313
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,504
<i>so I used to use the mushroom often</i>

314
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,240
<i>for vegetable stir-fries,</i>
<i>bulgogi, and other dishes.</i>

315
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,443
But we had way too many of them at home.

316
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,646
Why did you keep so many?

317
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,249
Please be honest as we browse

318
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,587
and let us know if there are ingredients
you don't like or are allergic to.

319
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,622
If you tell us you don't like something…

320
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,258
-Please don't use too much <i>pyogo</i>.
-Not too much <i>pyogo</i>!

321
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,893
-<i>Pyogo</i>?
-Not too much <i>pyogo</i>.

322
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,829
I must've used them too often.

323
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,198
You want to ask them to hold back
just for today.

324
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,399
-Right.
-That's important.

325
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,502
-And next. Yes.
-The basics, napa cabbage and radish.

326
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,638
Napa cabbage is such a great ingredient.

327
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,273
You can eat it raw with <i>doenjang</i>

328
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,175
-and you can cook it and make rice wraps.
-Yes.

329
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,145
-Also, there's my favorite, cabbage <i>jeon.</i>
-Cabbage <i>jeon.</i>

330
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,182
-It's delicious as <i>jeon,</i> fritters.
-Those two are very handy.

331
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,384
-And of course, they're for kimchi.
-Yes.

332
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,720
-This is dried bracken.
-Bracken.

333
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,555
-And <i>siraegi.</i>
-This is <i>siraegi.</i>

334
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,359
This is the main ingredient
for braised mackerel with <i>siraegi.</i>

335
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,461
Why do you like <i>siraegi</i> so much?

336
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,263
It tastes great.

337
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,797
-It has great texture.
-Yes.

338
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,701
I found out much later,
but it's healthy with lots of vitamins.

339
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,971
This is the kind of ingredient
people could've thrown away.

340
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,508
It was the part people usually threw away
after making kimchi in fall,

341
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,344
<i>but people thought it was a shame</i>
<i>and began to dry it…</i>

342
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,013
-<i>Yes.</i>
-<i>…to eat in winter, right?</i>

343
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,283
But these days,
people even grow radish to eat <i>siraegi,</i>

344
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,951
so it comes in great quality now.

345
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,487
It's not easy to cook with dried <i>siraegi.</i>

346
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,088
-It's not.
-No.

347
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,025
But they come out
easy to cook with these days.

348
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,160
You can make soup with it, stir-fry it,

349
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,895
or even boil it down in sauce.

350
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,064
-Let's take a look down here.
-Grains.

351
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,166
Mung beans, bean flour,
pine nuts, and sesame.

352
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,469
-My mother-in-law used bean flour.
-Bean flour.

353
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,138
When I visited her after marrying him,

354
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,407
I saw her cooking with bean flour.

355
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,343
-Really?
-My family never cooked with bean flour,

356
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,345
so I've never had anything like it.

357
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,213
But she used raw bean flour

358
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,384
and made bean sprout soup
without adding anything else,

359
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,187
and the entire family enjoyed it so much.

360
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,390
<i>At first, I didn't understand</i>
<i>the flavor and appeal of the soup,</i>

361
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,025
<i>but after about 30 to 40 years,</i>

362
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,494
I finally understood the taste.

363
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,698
<i>It has a light, refreshing flavor.</i>
<i>It's also good for extra protein.</i>

364
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,266
I've never heard of it.

365
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,302
People in North Gyeongsang Province
often eat it like that.

366
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,971
INTRIGUED

367
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,640
Are there seasons for nuts?

368
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,176
Fall is mostly when they're in season.

369
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,646
Pine nuts from Gapyeong are harvested
and shipped out in the fall.

370
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,382
So pine nuts are better in the fall?

371
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,919
Chestnuts are always better in fall
because they're bigger,

372
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
and dates taste a lot sweeter.

373
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,590
There are many other fruits,
such as pears, apples, and grapes.

374
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,992
-And figs.
-And figs.

375
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,393
-What are these? Shrimp?
-Shrimp.

376
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,161
-Tiny dried shrimp.
-Tiny dried shrimp?

377
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,565
These are the ingredients you want
when visiting Korea this time of the year.

378
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,801
And now, these will
most likely become the main ingredients.

379
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,803
-Beef.
-This must be Korean beef.

380
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,138
Korean pig.

381
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,540
-There's chicken as well.
-Yes, chicken too.

382
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,042
They're very tender.

383
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,610
-Seasonal seafood.
-Seafood.

384
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,281
Gizzard shad, blue crab,
and this is Spanish mackerel.

385
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,250
-Do you enjoy seafood?
-Of course.

386
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,452
When I cook with fish,

387
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,423
the President debones it all
like a professional.

388
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,458
-Isn't it hard to believe?
-Really?

389
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,327
You take out all the spines for her?

390
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,096
-Do you know why?
-Why?

391
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,933
Because the way I do it
is too messy and inefficient.

392
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,468
She ends up throwing away a lot.

393
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:21,273
I always take an anatomical approach
when we eat fish.

394
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,375
I thought it was out of love.

395
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,644
-That's not it.
-Of course, there's love as well.

396
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,312
I'm sure that's a part of it.

397
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:32,684
This is the season when Korea has
the most abundant seasonal ingredients.

398
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,788
It's time to find out what dishes

399
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,291
the President and the First Lady ordered.
Please show us!

400
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,960
What do you want to eat?

401
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,863
-K-food for the world.
-For the world.

402
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,633
-Yes, K-food for the world.
-For the world.

403
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:52,271
The entire world is slowly becoming
more and more familiar with our culture.

404
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,107
So we wanted to eat something

405
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,844
that can naturally catch
the interest of people around the globe

406
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,213
and invite them to try our food.

407
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,249
Goodness.

408
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,250
It sounds hard.

409
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,488
-Jeez.
-Well…

410
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,457
That's a lot of pressure.

411
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,760
-You're all in trouble today.
-We are. We're in trouble.

412
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,262
Show us their second order.

413
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,131
The second order of the Chuseok special.

414
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,533
K-ingredient for the world,

415
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,469
-and among them, <i>siraegi.</i>
-<i>Siraegi.</i>

416
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,572
-You singled this out.
-<i>Siraegi.</i>

417
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,906
<i>Siraegi</i>?

418
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,274
RESPONDING WITH A LAUGH

419
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,009
The President should elaborate a bit.

420
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,445
-<i>Siraegi</i> sounds difficult to work with.
-It does.

421
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,982
It's the food
my mother often used to cook.

422
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,918
And a hearty bowl
of <i>doenjang</i> soup with <i>siraegi</i>

423
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,322
warms you up in cold winter
with the contrasting temperature.

424
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,324
-The Punchbowl, right?
-Yes, Yanggu.

425
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,328
-Siraegi <i>from Haean-myeon is quite famous.</i>
-<i>Yanggu</i> siraegi.

426
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,297
I thought it'd be nice

427
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,934
to let the world enjoy <i>siraegi</i> dishes.

428
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,871
-By adding that it originated from Korea…
-Of course.

429
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,340
-…we can probably start exporting them.
-I see.

430
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,776
-It has a meat-like texture, actually.
-You're right. It does.

431
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,146
-And it's full of nutrients.
-It is.

432
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,114
-A healthy ingredient.
-It's healthy.

433
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,384
The future of Korean food culture
is in your dishes.

434
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,753
-Even the future?
-Yes, the future.

435
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,823
-You can play a big role in exportation.
-Contribution for exportation?

436
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,225
-Become an export powerhouse.
-What?

437
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,362
-We don't even have a drop of natural gas.
-Wait, I can't do this.

438
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,430
So have a sense of responsibility.

439
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,534
-The world is watching right now.
-Of course.

440
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,135
We invited seven chefs today,

441
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,138
but only four of you can compete.

442
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,642
When it comes to the number of stars,
Hyun-suk is still in first place.

443
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,611
Yes, we get it. He has 12 stars.

444
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,780
-Shouldn't you join the fight?
-Yes.

445
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,150
I'll take the order
"K-food for the world."

446
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,485
-K-food.
-All right.

447
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,687
I must take on the challenge. Who else?

448
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,624
HIS BLUFFING
IS EVEN MORE EMBARRASSING TODAY

449
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,594
-He should join.
-He's in. He decided to join the fight.

450
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,665
Now, we have a Michelin-star chef
in Korean cuisine among us.

451
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,866
Jong-won?

452
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,503
-He was the 25th best restaurant in Asia.
-The 25th.

453
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,437
Oh, you're aware.

454
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,207
I'll also take the challenge
and make K-food for the world.

455
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,209
I knew it.

456
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,277
Okay, you two are up against each other.

457
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:16,348
Jong-won and my round
is probably the main event,

458
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,050
-but we're going first.
-What?

459
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,851
WHAT A GRAND OPENING…

460
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,288
It'll probably be the best performance
you can see on <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

461
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,656
-Sure.
-Goodness.

462
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,227
-The main chefs shall open it up…
-The opening show.

463
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,562
All we have now is the <i>siraegi</i> round.

464
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,131
You have to cook with <i>siraegi.</i>

465
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,099
So who--

466
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,234
JI-SUN BOLDLY STEPS IN

467
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,501
Chef Ji-sun.

468
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,804
-Are you in?
-My <i>siraegi basi</i> became a big moment

469
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,039
on the cooking survival program before.

470
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,808
That's right. She used <i>siraegi.</i>

471
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,311
As someone who's already famous
for making <i>siraegi basi,</i>

472
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,881
I'd like to join the round
and make a new kind of <i>siraegi</i> dish.

473
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,484
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Sure.

474
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,953
She just received a round of applause.

475
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,156
-It's the last chance.
-We have one spot open.

476
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,491
One last spot.

477
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,194
(ME)

478
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,496
HE TIMIDLY RAISES HIS HAND

479
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,430
Are you dropping out?

480
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,865
JEEZ…

481
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,800
I think I should participate.

482
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,168
Are you sure?

483
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,536
I'm a little worried.

484
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,138
GOODNESS…

485
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,674
-Yes, right.
-Aren't you worried?

486
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,042
This may be a variety show,

487
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,877
but it's also a national thing.

488
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,145
That's why I'm doing this.

489
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,680
-You can do this.
-Thank you.

490
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,416
Actually, I'm rather fond of <i>siraegi.</i>

491
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,318
I must do this as the backbone of the show

492
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,153
and as an industry powerhouse.

493
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,757
I somehow became
a major industry exporter.

494
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,158
Do you have an idea?

495
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:37,062
I'll join the round and promote <i>siraegi,</i>
the Korean ingredient.

496
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,032
All right, then. Poong joins the round.

497
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,501
WHAT KIND OF SIRAEGI DISHES
WILL THEY MAKE?

498
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:46,104
Which one of them will become
the Korean export industry powerhouse?

499
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,808
-Let the 15-minute cook-offs begin!
-Let it begin!

500
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,477
EXCITED

501
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:56,448
<i>This is the long-awaited first round</i>
<i>of the special Chuseok episode</i>

502
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,319
between two most popular chefs
we want the whole world to know of.

503
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,621
The original star of the show,
Choi Hyun-suk,

504
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,591
versus the rising star of the show,
Son Jong-won.

505
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,495
Some call them
Old Hyun-suk and New Jong-won.

506
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,066
-I'd like to correct one error.
-What error?

507
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,636
I'm not Old Hyun-suk,
but Current Hyun-suk.

508
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,271
He's not old, he's still current.

509
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,574
This is actually their third match.

510
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,242
<i>Their first round</i>
<i>was for Jang Keun-suk, the Asian Prince,</i>

511
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,345
<i>and the second was for Jin of BTS.</i>

512
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,981
<i>Hyun-suk had won both rounds.</i>

513
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,483
I won twice?

514
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,486
-I do not remember the outcomes.
-You'd remember.

515
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,555
All I remember is our battles,

516
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,490
so I didn't know I won twice.

517
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,625
CHUCKLING

518
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,095
The President

519
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,330
could not help but let out a dry chuckle.

520
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,899
He's at the age
when he slowly fails to remember.

521
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,635
He claims
that the outcome isn't important.

522
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,838
-Jong-won said something like this.
-Yes?

523
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,141
"I will not lose this round."

524
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,444
-"I will bring Old Hyun-suk down."
-I see.

525
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,147
As someone who runs a Korean restaurant,

526
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,750
I must do my best
and be worthy of my reputation.

527
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,319
He's someone who works very hard.

528
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,623
He visits the masters of Korean cuisine
on his days off

529
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,726
<i>to learn more about Korean cuisine</i>
<i>and royal court cuisine.</i>

530
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,862
He even learned to make <i>yakgwa</i>,
a traditional cookie.

531
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,363
What else have you learned?

532
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,600
I've been studying <i>hangwa</i>,
Korean confections.

533
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,137
I believe <i>namul,</i> seasoned vegetables,
is an important part, so that as well.

534
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,139
I recently began to learn how to make

535
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,608
-traditional wedding food.
-Even traditional wedding food?

536
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,277
-Even traditional wedding food?
-That takes a lot of work.

537
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,513
I'm growing fond of him already.

538
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,281
He's more fond of Jong-won already.

539
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,182
GULP

540
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,485
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS: CHICKEN,
INSTANT STICKY RICE, GINSENG, DATES

541
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,554
ROASTED CHESTNUTS, PINE NUTS, GINKGO NUTS,
CHICKEN STOCK, SPARKLING WATER

542
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,123
The name of my dish is

543
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,293
-Hybrid Chicken.
-Hybrid Chicken?

544
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,561
I'm making <i>samgyetang</i>.

545
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,896
<i>Samgyetang.</i>

546
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:55,500
Some people tend to dislike
how the skin feels mushy.

547
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,437
But everyone in this world
loves fried chicken,

548
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,138
and the skin is the whole point.

549
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,241
That's why I want to make <i>samgyetang</i>
with crunchy skin.

550
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,744
I'll mix the strengths of two dishes

551
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,614
and make <i>samgyetang</i>, chicken soup,
everyone in this world can enjoy.

552
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,516
HOW WILL CRUNCHY SAMGYETANG TURN OUT?

553
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,919
Crunchy <i>samgyetang</i>?

554
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,021
I'll add lots of seasonal ingredients,

555
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,990
such as dates, pine nuts,
ginkgo nuts, ginseng,

556
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,092
-as well as other nuts.
-It sounds like a healthy dish.

557
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,727
-That sounds good.
-Yes.

558
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,163
-Chef Hyun-suk is making <i>samgyetang.</i>
-<i>Samgyetang.</i>

559
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,099
CHEF JONG-WON'S INGREDIENTS: PINE NUTS,
TINY DRIED SHRIMP, GREEN YUJA, DEODEOK

560
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,168
MILK, HONEY, YUJA CHEONG, STARCH SYRUP,
PINE NUT POWDER, BEAN POWDER, AND MORE

561
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,171
Contending against Hyun-suk is Jong-won.
What are you making?

562
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,140
I'm going to use
many season Korean ingredients,

563
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:39,077
such as <i>yuja,</i> tiny dried shrimp,
and <i>deodeok,</i>

564
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,414
-but my key ingredient is pine nuts.
-I see.

565
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,517
I'm going to make four snacks
by using pine nuts.

566
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,520
-Tell us what the four are.
-The first one

567
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,889
is <i>tarak-juk,</i>
milk porridge with pine nuts.

568
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,123
Next, shrimp <i>gangjeong,</i> brittle.

569
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,693
And there's something
called <i>seopsansam</i> made with <i>deodeok.</i>

570
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,862
Lastly, <i>dasik,</i> pressed cookie,
made with bean powder.

571
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,363
Will he have enough time?

572
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,198
-It'll take a lot of work.
-In 15 minutes?

573
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:04,436
These are the kind of dishes
people used to have for enjoyment.

574
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,874
I wanted to wish that Korean cuisine
would become more global,

575
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,977
so I named it Go, Pine Nuts.

576
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,745
-Go, Pine Nuts.
-Go, Pine Nuts.

577
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,747
LOVES THE TITLE

578
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,350
It looks like
Jong-won has the lead with the name,

579
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,118
and they seem to like him better.

580
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,588
-May I revise the name?
-Go for it.

581
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,257
-Do you want to change it?
-Yes.

582
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,359
Go, Hybrid Chicken!

583
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,660
I'm sorry.

584
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,362
A BAD MOVE OUT OF ANXIETY

585
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:34,633
-Please don't try too hard.
-He tried too hard.

586
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,268
As a chef of Korean cuisine,

587
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:40,238
I continue to wonder what I can do
to make it more known around the world.

588
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,542
In a way, I concluded that
what's most Korean is the most universal.

589
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,477
-Yes.
-So instead of making modifications,

590
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,747
I wanted to show
how it's done traditionally

591
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,083
and let our international viewers
try the recipe themselves.

592
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,185
That was my intention.

593
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,687
But it won't be easy.

594
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,089
-May I add one more thing?
-What are you trying to add?

595
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,126
What's important
in promoting Korean cuisine is,

596
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,827
just as Chef Jong-won is doing,

597
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,797
-showing them what is traditional.
-Of course.

598
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,434
On the other hand,
the experience can be made easier

599
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,436
with reinterpreted dishes just like mine.

600
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:16,541
I believe both methods are appropriate
in promoting our food culture.

601
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,710
Please judge the dishes fairly.

602
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,245
AND SHOW INTEREST IN HYBRID CHICKEN

603
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,380
He thought he was falling behind.

604
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,150
-They don't hold any prejudice.
-No.

605
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,485
Don't feel too much pressure.

606
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,386
All right, then.

607
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:33,792
The world has its eyes on this round,
K-food for the world.

608
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,227
He's here to present
hybrid Korean cuisine.

609
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,197
The best of <i>Chef & My Fridge,</i>
Chef Choi Hyun-suk.

610
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,600
Up against him is a man
who'll make traditional Korean food.

611
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,136
The best Korean cuisine chef on the show,
Chef Son Jong-won.

612
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,305
Which one of them will capture
the hearts of the world

613
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,474
as the best K-chef?

614
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,345
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

615
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,981
Begin!

616
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,351
THE INDUSTRY POWERHOUSES BEGIN

617
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,952
The clock begins to tick.

618
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,220
BEGINS WITH INSTANT STICKY RICE

619
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,521
Oh, it's sticky rice.

620
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,924
He's using instant sticky rice.

621
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,792
-I see, he's using instant rice.
-Indeed.

622
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,594
-<i>Samgyetang</i> needs rice.
-You need it.

623
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,932
People usually think making <i>samgyetang</i>
is hard and time-consuming.

624
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,069
But if I can make it in 15 minutes,
people around the world will try it.

625
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,971
-It's true.
-How will he do it in 15 minutes?

626
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,407
It's not easy to make <i>samgyetang</i>
in just 15 minutes.

627
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,242
It's important for a dish to taste good,

628
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,845
but it's just as important
to lower the entry barrier

629
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,179
for people to get familiar.

630
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,649
He's adding dates into the rice.

631
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,218
And ginkgo nuts.

632
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,820
That must be the filling for the chicken.

633
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,155
It goes into the chicken.

634
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,958
-Yes.
-Jong-won, what are you cooking?

635
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,793
I'm making <i>gangjeong</i> right now.

636
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,995
<i>Gangjeong.</i> He said
he was going to make that.

637
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,431
-Dried shrimp <i>gangjeong.</i>
-Yes, dried shrimp <i>gangjeong.</i>

638
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,700
He must be making dried shrimp <i>gangjeong.</i>

639
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,737
-I'm using <i>yuja</i> from Goheung.
-<i>Yuja.</i>

640
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,606
-Are you making it sweet?
-You're right.

641
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,141
You can make <i>gangjeong</i> with shrimp?

642
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,510
He's making sweet brittle with shrimp.

643
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:04,282
That's new. Small dried shrimp
and pine nuts to make it sweet and salty.

644
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,752
It'll have the texture of <i>gangjeong,</i>
but I can't imagine what it'd taste like.

645
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,854
-But shrimp?
-Shrimp <i>gangjeong </i>is a first.

646
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,656
-I've never seen it.
-It's the first time.

647
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,992
-It'll have an interesting texture.
-Tiny dried shrimp <i>gangjeong</i>.

648
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,895
-I think I can smell it from here.
-Can you?

649
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,798
-I can smell the <i>gangjeong.</i>
-On this side. The smell of a fresh batch.

650
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,466
They like the smell from Jong-won's side.

651
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,102
-Green <i>yuja.</i>
-Something smells refreshing.

652
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,637
Pick it up a little, Chef Hyun-suk.

653
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,740
Is there anything you can do
to make it smell good?

654
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,376
We aren't smelling much from that side.

655
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,244
That's not chicken, is it?

656
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,646
It is.

657
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,314
-Is that chicken fillet?
-Chicken fillet.

658
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,950
He's working on a whole chicken.
In just 15 minutes?

659
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,618
NEXT, PREPARING A WHOLE CHICKEN

660
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,855
-He's using just the skin.
-He said the skin will be crunchy.

661
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,323
He's removing the skin.

662
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,794
-Non-Koreans dislike that mushy skin.
-You're right.

663
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,098
-He said he'd deep-fry that.
-He's using the skin separately.

664
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,933
What's that? Chicken fillet?

665
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,335
-Chicken meat and skin.
-The meat.

666
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,339
He separated the meat and skin,
and then put the meat back on it.

667
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,074
-He won't fry it whole.
-Right.

668
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,177
It's different
from the usual <i>samgyetang </i>recipe.

669
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,414
Meanwhile, what's Jong-won doing?

670
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,782
SPREADING THE GANGJEONG

671
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,251
WHILE WATCHING JONG-WON…

672
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,519
SHIFTING ATTENTION

673
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,221
GAZE SHIFTS

674
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,256
It's a performance!

675
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,060
LOOK AT ME

676
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,197
THE VIPS ARE FLUSTERED

677
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,167
MAKING RICE BALLS
WHILE SPLATTERING RICE EVERYWHERE

678
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,335
He's making a ball.

679
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:34,939
The camera almost shifted toward Jong-won,
but Hyun-suk keeps stealing the moment.

680
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,175
-He holds him in check.
-He keeps performing.

681
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:41,479
-He does it the Hyun-suk way over there.
-Yes.

682
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,183
-Jong-won is using a mold to do something.
-He's making it square…

683
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,086
-It's a <i>gangjeong</i> mold.
-…like the usual <i>gangjeong</i> we know.

684
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,255
The green <i>yuja</i> smells so good
on this side.

685
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,857
-<i>Yuja?</i> Green <i>yuja.</i>
-Green <i>yuja.</i>

686
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:53,825
It smells so good.

687
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,960
HYUN-SUK MOVES ON TO THE NEXT STAGE!

688
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,630
3. WRAP FILLING WITH CHICKEN SKIN
AND FIX WITH STICKS

689
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,232
He's sealing it up with toothpicks.

690
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,534
Into a ball.

691
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,370
It's different from the shape
of <i>samgyetang</i> that we know.

692
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,473
-It looks like a pouch.
-Yes, you're right.

693
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,675
It's not the appearance
of traditional <i>samgyetang.</i>

694
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,244
-Will he steam that or fry that?
-I guess he'll deep-fry that.

695
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,746
-Will you deep-fry it?
-Will you?

696
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,948
-Not like this.
-Not like that?

697
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,116
Then how will you do it?

698
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,951
I need to give it more texture.

699
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,487
Sparkling water?

700
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,189
He's using sparkling water.

701
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,024
To make it crunchy.

702
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,593
That looks like frying batter.

703
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,595
The batter is made with flour.

704
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,064
-He's deep-frying it right away.
-He's using a fry batter.

705
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,501
Otherwise, the rice will soak up the oil.

706
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,804
He's deep-frying the chicken
that'll go into the <i>samgyetang.</i>

707
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,006
It's been four minutes.

708
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,108
JONG-WON MOVES ON TO THE SECOND DISH!

709
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,011
-Is that milk?
-Milk and pine nuts.

710
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,081
Milk and pine nuts
to make <i>tarak-juk,</i> milk porridge.

711
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,418
Along with rice.
It's like cold pine nut porridge.

712
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,019
SECOND DISH, COLD TARAK-JUK

713
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,388
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT DISH RIGHT AWAY!

714
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,224
He's using <i>deodeok.</i>

715
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,626
-Jong-won's using <i>deodeok</i> now.
-<i>Deodeok.</i>

716
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,497
We usually use a hammer to pound
on the <i>deodeok</i>,

717
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,766
but he's using a rolling pin instead.

718
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,269
This way he can keep the shape.

719
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,938
-It's to keep the shape.
-He wants to keep them.

720
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,075
<i>Deodeok </i>was an ingredient
the President dug up from the mountains.

721
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,843
-He has fond memories.
-Yes, memories.

722
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,945
He's using quite a lot of rice.

723
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,248
-He is.
-He's using lots of rice.

724
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:27,552
-Chef Hyun-suk uses ginseng, not <i>deodeok.</i>
-Ginseng.

725
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,221
You can't leave out ginseng
in Korean cuisine.

726
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,759
But he has more memories of <i>deodeok</i>
compared to ginseng.

727
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,996
I wonder if the ginseng will be effective.

728
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:42,967
Our guest may like it
if I used <i>deodeok</i> for <i>samgyetang</i>,

729
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,235
but I want to promote the dish.

730
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,805
<i>Sam</i> of <i>samgyetang</i> is for <i>insam</i>, ginseng.
Otherwise, it'd be <i>deokgyetang</i>, right?

731
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,275
So the guest's palate isn't important?

732
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,743
-The guest's--
-It's for the world.

733
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,313
Our guests do have their preferences,

734
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,249
-but they love Korean cuisine more.
-Of course.

735
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:02,086
I want to humor their hopes
more than their palate.

736
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:03,788
DEEPLY TOUCHED

737
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,723
He hopes you'll vote
with the big picture in mind.

738
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,460
To vote in an official capacity
rather than based on personal preference?

739
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,596
I'm suddenly quite fond of him.

740
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,032
-I'm suddenly quite fond of him.
-He's suddenly fond of you!

741
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,166
Your ratings are going up!

742
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,935
I'm suddenly quite fond of him.

743
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,770
FINALLY!

744
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,671
YOU UNDERSTAND ME!

745
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,340
It's the salt performance.

746
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:23,908
THE LEFT

747
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,443
THE RIGHT

748
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,845
SALTING LEFT AND RIGHT

749
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,381
WOW!

750
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,650
He's sprinkling salt all over the place.

751
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,820
HE REMAINS IMPARTIAL
AND SALTS BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT

752
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,690
-Did you see that?
-You have nine minutes left.

753
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,425
You have nine minutes left.

754
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,827
His name tag is about to fall off.

755
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,464
Hyun-suk recovers from moping
and begins to dance.

756
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,066
Even with his frozen shoulders,

757
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,401
he's raising both arms to throw salt.

758
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,203
THANKS FOR THE BIG LAUGH

759
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,807
Yes, considering his position,
he has to have the public opinion in mind.

760
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,308
-That's important.
-That's right.

761
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,143
HOW WILL JONG-WON FIGHT BACK?

762
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,945
Is that starch?

763
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,747
-Sticky rice powder.
-Sticky rice powder.

764
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,583
He's deep-frying <i>deodeok</i> that's been
coated with sticky rice powder.

765
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,419
-I see, he's deep-frying powdered <i>deodeok.</i>
-Yes.

766
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,622
THE BLENDED TARAK-JUK IS READY TO GO OUT

767
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,024
3. STRAIN, CHILL OVER ICED WATER

768
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,059
-He's done with three now.
-Simultaneously.

769
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,461
His <i>tarak-juk</i> is ready too.

770
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,763
His shrimp <i>gangjeong </i>is done too.

771
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,764
Bean flour and honey.

772
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,533
He grabs bean flour and… Is that honey?

773
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,269
It's honey. I'm making <i>dasik</i> now.

774
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,238
I'll add powdered pine nuts too.

775
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,640
-Even powdered pine nuts?
-I see.

776
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,643
I'm mixing the powder with honey
and turning it into a sort of batter.

777
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,911
Do you enjoy sweets?

778
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,580
-I enjoy it.
-You do?

779
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,217
He's adding honey right now.
How much should he use?

780
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:43,021
-But <i>dasik </i>itself is never too sweet.
-No.

781
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,289
Please don't make it too sweet, Jong-won.

782
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,991
WHAT'S HYUN-SUK DOING NEXT?

783
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,695
He's using the green part of green onion.

784
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,397
Is he using just green onion?

785
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,434
-What's that? Green onion and oil?
-He's blending green onion and oil.

786
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,570
He's making green onion oil.

787
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,872
-Really?
-Green onion oil.

788
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,307
He's blending just green onion and oil.

789
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,544
He is blending just the tops
of the green onion with some oil.

790
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,179
You have eight minutes left.

791
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,416
Eight minutes left.
How will he use that to make <i>samgyetang?</i>

792
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,052
-The fried chicken is out. It's ready.
-Yes.

793
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,187
LOOK AT THIS

794
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,489
HE'S DOING IT AGAIN

795
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,857
SHOWING OFF HIS CHICKEN

796
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,060
He pulls out the fried chicken
as we speak.

797
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,162
He deep-fried it so well.

798
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,631
He's going to turn that into <i>samgyetang.</i>

799
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,466
You can tell it's crispy
just by the look of it.

800
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,502
-Look at that soup.
-He's going to blend that?

801
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,838
-It looks like <i>samgyetang</i> soup.
-He'll make it creamy.

802
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,641
-He decided to blend it in.
-I know.

803
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,176
He's saving on time.

804
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,344
MAKING PORRIDGE-LIKE TEXTURE IN A FLASH

805
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,647
What's that?

806
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,249
It's a traditional <i>dasik</i> mold.

807
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,885
-That's a <i>dasik </i>mold.
-Is that a <i>dasik</i> mold?

808
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,554
He's putting it in the mold.

809
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,590
I have a <i>dasik</i> mold
I got from my mother-in-law at home.

810
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,860
It's very pretty, although it's quite old.

811
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,729
-So you have one at home?
-Yes.

812
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,700
She mentioned
her mother-in-law's <i>dasik</i> mold

813
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,470
as old memories came back to her.

814
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,306
-Then…
-She might end up shedding tears.

815
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,807
-Just like earlier.
-Jong-won does it again.

816
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,710
He's making <i>dasik</i> with bean flour.

817
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,546
Where's the pot I used? Oh, over here.

818
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,814
HE'S GETTING ANXIOUS…

819
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,750
SMOOTHLY BLENDED GINSENG AND STICKY RICE

820
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,419
It turned out like porridge.

821
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,422
-I can smell it.
-It looks like <i>samgyetang</i> porridge.

822
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,691
-Hyun-suk doesn't cease to amaze.
-That's fascinating.

823
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,826
-I smell it.
-He never lets us down.

824
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,394
He very carefully…

825
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,597
PERFECT
JUST THE RIGHT THICKNESS

826
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,899
A LEGEND WHO ALWAYS COMPLIMENTS HIMSELF

827
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,236
-That thickness is insane!
-He checks the thickness.

828
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,171
He very carefully…

829
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,407
NOT TOO THICK, NOT TOO WATERY

830
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,409
TASTE TESTING BY HIMSELF

831
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,611
Is it okay? What's it like?

832
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,212
OF COURSE, IT'S GOOD

833
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,347
He says it tastes good.

834
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,581
FASCINATED BY HIM

835
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,785
MORE SALT!

836
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,687
GIVING HIM ATTENTION GIVES HIM WINGS!

837
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,958
Again, he can't help but chuckle.

838
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,193
OW, MY HEAD…

839
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,897
I'm not sure
if that was positive or negative.

840
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,633
-But he's laughing out loud.
-We'll know by the result.

841
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,436
Mr. President,
do you like your food seasoned strong?

842
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,639
-No.
-We don't like it if it's too salty.

843
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,973
Nothing too salty.

844
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,241
SCAN

845
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,843
He's adding more water.

846
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,212
-He's adding water!
-It must be salty.

847
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,081
-He added too much salt before.
-He added a lot of salt.

848
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,517
-I knew you put in too much.
-No.

849
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,987
I wonder if it'll taste rich.
What if it just tastes watery?

850
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,223
-They have under five minutes, Jung-hwan.
-Yes?

851
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,293
-Please report from the kitchen.
-Where's the camera? Okay.

852
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,130
Which chef will become the one
to promote Korean cuisine?

853
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,033
-The fried <i>deodeok </i>is ready.
-It's ready.

854
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,504
He's rubbing honey on the fried <i>deodeok</i>.

855
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,873
And he's coating it with pine nut powder.

856
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,742
-After he fried them?
-Yes, after frying.

857
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,077
And brushing on honey.

858
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,246
-This takes a lot of work.
-It does.

859
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,851
Jung-hwan is going out there
to help out the chefs

860
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,954
by tasting their food.

861
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,156
He'll have the sauce underneath…

862
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,259
-On top of that soup?
-…topped with the green onion oil.

863
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,195
-Additionally, it'll add a scent.
-Exactly.

864
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,631
This… My, the mold looks pretty.

865
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,700
This is the tiny dried shrimp <i>gangjeong</i>.

866
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,969
-This is the <i>deodeok gangjeong</i>.
-Yes.

867
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,870
Hey, look at this one.

868
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,839
Hey, look at this one.

869
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,775
-They're about done!
-They need to have a nice shape.

870
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,410
WILL THEY LOOK OKAY?

871
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,045
They need to look nice.

872
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,381
-They have to look good.
-Flip them around.

873
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,749
HE FLIPS IT AROUND…

874
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,019
-Okay!
-They look great!

875
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,355
PERFECT

876
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,291
THEY LOOK JUST LIKE THE MOLD

877
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,859
Everyone's applauding.

878
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,261
HONEY

879
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,597
Chef Jong-won…

880
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,232
makes everything so quickly.

881
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,501
Yes, he needs to be quick with his hands.

882
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,971
QUICK HANDS APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT

883
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,706
Everyone's applauding for Jong-won.

884
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,508
This is the shrimp <i>gangjeong</i>.

885
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:01,212
-They look great!
-They do. They look really great.

886
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,780
You have four minutes left.

887
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,882
-Jung-hwan!
-Yes?

888
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,118
-Can you try the porridge?
-I'll try it.

889
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,154
He'll check the porridge
with 3 minutes and 35 seconds left.

890
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,856
TRY THIS

891
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,524
THE SHOWMANSHIP DOESN'T END

892
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,326
-Wait.
-I hope it tastes good.

893
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,461
They don't like it
if it tastes too strong.

894
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,097
-I hope it's like <i>samgyetang.</i>
-He tries the porridge!

895
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,099
Will it go high or low?

896
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,101
Will it go high or low?

897
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,603
It'll rise high.

898
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,005
-Is it all right?
-It's just like <i>samgyetang.</i>

899
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,709
I think people will book a flight
to come and have <i>samgyetang</i>.

900
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,411
-I see.
-From all over the world.

901
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,413
He can definitely promote Korean food.

902
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,782
He topped the porridge
with the fried chicken.

903
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,217
<i>Samgyetang</i> is usually topped
with green onion,

904
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,420
so I made a smooth green onion oil.

905
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,321
Green onion oil.

906
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,289
-What a pretty color.
-Made by blending green onion.

907
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,524
He's topping it with the oil.

908
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,392
LOOKS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
WESTERN AND KOREAN CUISINE

909
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,593
So that's what he intended.

910
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,895
JONG-WON BEGINS PLATING

911
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,264
Chef Jong-won begins to serve the dish.

912
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,599
-Already?
-Hyun-suk is done.

913
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,136
CHOI HYUN-SUK FINISHES

914
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,872
He is already done
with 2 minutes and 30 seconds left.

915
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,175
-Oh, no.
-You still have lots of time.

916
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,411
-Jong-won can use the rest of the time.
-Doing good.

917
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,614
-There's no need to rush now.
-It looks pretty.

918
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,052
-He decided to make something complicated.
-Yes, it's complicated.

919
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,688
-The first one is ready.
-The bean flour <i>dasik</i> is ready.

920
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,724
-Bean flour <i>dasik</i>.
-It's so pretty.

921
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,792
That must be tiny dried shrimp <i>gangjeong.</i>

922
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,096
-I've never seen shrimp <i>gangjeong</i> before.
-Neither have I.

923
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,565
We usually stir-fry it as a side dish,

924
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,000
but I've never seen it as <i>gangjeong</i>.

925
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,802
What do you think about the <i>gangjeong</i>?

926
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,838
-It's a creative dish.
-I see.

927
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,540
Chef Jong-won, the future
of Korean cuisine is on our shoulders.

928
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:37,975
SO MUCH PRESSURE

929
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,379
You're an export powerhouse
of the Korean food industry.

930
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,514
-You got this!
-Excuse me, Chef Hyun-suk.

931
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,884
You're going to lose points.
They like to keep things fair.

932
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,519
I think that was a bit much.

933
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,021
-It was too much.
-Do you see any crumbs, Jung-hwan?

934
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,624
-Should I pick up some bean flour?
-Yes, anything at all.

935
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,626
Pick up some of those crumbs.

936
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:56,961
SWIPE

937
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,063
I will try the <i>gangjeong</i>.

938
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,632
-Why are you tasting that?
-Tell us what it's like.

939
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,967
I've never had this before.

940
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,402
Try it, Jung-hwan.

941
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,736
EXCUSE MOI

942
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,071
What does it taste like?

943
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,174
MEANWHILE JONG-WON POURS THE TARAK-JUK

944
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,611
Go, Pine Nuts!
Does it give you more energy?

945
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,946
-It does!
-Does it?

946
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,615
It's seasoned perfectly.

947
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,384
The pine nuts add
a nice touch to the <i>gangjeong.</i>

948
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,485
Is it sweet and salty?

949
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,054
I love the sweetness
and the balance of the flavor.

950
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,357
-Yes?
-But it's not crunchy.

951
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,026
NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING

952
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,529
RETREATS SATISFIED
AFTER LANDING A BLOW

953
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,465
<i>Gangjeong</i> isn't completely crunchy.
It's just nutty when you chew on it.

954
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,567
Fresh <i>gangjeong</i> is good

955
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,702
-because it's not crunchy and hard.
-Exactly.

956
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,471
-That's how it should be.
-Forty seconds left.

957
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,573
Jong-won is a guy who usually stays quiet,

958
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,341
but he has a comeback

959
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,544
-for Hyun-suk's attack.
-Don't let him get to you.

960
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,813
-Thirty seconds.
-You have thirty seconds.

961
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,915
-Time's almost up. Wrap it up, Jong-won.
-Oh, no.

962
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,250
-He can do it.
-He's garnishing it with pine nuts.

963
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,886
He needs to serve 4 different dishes,
and he has 20 seconds left.

964
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,488
-Oh, no.
-Twenty seconds.

965
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,557
It looks like the <i>dasik</i>
and <i>gangjeong</i> are ready.

966
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,059
He's still working on the<i> tarak-juk</i>
and <i>seopsansam.</i>

967
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,494
-His hand trembles.
-The last one.

968
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,763
-Hurry up.
-Jong-won's hands are trembling!

969
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,865
-Ten seconds! Nine!
-Eight!

970
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,600
-Ten seconds!
-He can't grab the pine nut.

971
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,769
-Eight. Seven.
-Oh, no.

972
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,038
-Eight. Seven.
-Seven.

973
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,706
-Six. Five.
-My gosh.

974
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,241
-Four.
-Four.

975
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,244
AMAZED

976
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,513
You cannot add anything else.

977
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,814
You must serve it as is.

978
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,116
-They both have quick hands.
-Yes.

979
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,286
They're very fast. In just 15 minutes.

980
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,856
Fifteen minutes flew by
like fifteen seconds.

981
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,858
-It flies by.
-Yes.

982
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,693
THE DISHES DEPART

983
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,495
-Slowly.
-Please send the dishes over.

984
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,799
AMAZED ONCE AGAIN

985
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,901
They made everything in just 15 minutes.

986
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,202
They are incredible.

987
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,937
MMM

988
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,305
She smells the dishes first.

989
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,307
-I can smell them.
-You can, right?

990
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:55,045
All dishes of K-food for the world
have been finished.

991
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:58,782
I never imagined it was possible
to make <i>samgyetang</i> in 15 minutes,

992
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,251
and it happened.

993
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,485
It boggles my mind

994
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,188
that he made <i>samgyetang </i>in this form.

995
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,890
It was such a shock.

996
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,859
I think this is why
people love <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

997
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,195
You're right about that.

998
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,232
-They're talking about <i>samgyetang</i> a lot.
-No, that's not it.

999
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,635
-That dish is just too far away from me.
-This one's closer.

1000
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,336
It seems a little unfair.

1001
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,305
I guess the location is like that.

1002
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,541
-We'll have to taste it.
-That's what's important.

1003
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,376
-The taste is important.
-That's right.

1004
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,280
So you chose to serve
just one of this, right?

1005
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,849
If I were to serve it separately,

1006
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,352
I could've made
two smaller pieces much quicker.

1007
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,354
But Korean cuisine is all about sharing,

1008
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,356
and I find harmony in this.

1009
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,426
I wanted them to share it
like how a family always shares food.

1010
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,961
Please think of it that way.

1011
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,696
OH, SUCH PROFOUND MEANING

1012
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,399
He's such a smooth talker.

1013
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,101
That's what we call good articulation.

1014
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,937
-Yes.
-He's good at making up stuff.

1015
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,271
K-SMART ALECK

1016
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,106
This is called Hybrid Chicken.

1017
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,743
A CRUNCHY SAMGYETANG FOR THE WORLD

1018
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:04,915
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S HYBRID CHICKEN

1019
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,585
-Should I serve it for you?
-Yourself? Okay.

1020
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,920
You will be trying Hybrid Chicken first.

1021
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,257
He fried the chicken skin
to get rid of the mushiness.

1022
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,259
I think that's the biggest change.

1023
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,395
-He cut it down the middle.
-Thank you.

1024
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,797
My gosh.

1025
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,800
-It's a shame I have to eat it.
-Yes, but we have to try this.

1026
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,102
<i>Samgyetang</i> is usually soft,

1027
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:29,373
but you'll get to taste <i>samgyetang</i>
while enjoying the crispy texture.

1028
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,808
They're about to try it now.

1029
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,877
This is an important moment.

1030
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,314
They're trying the dish on their own.

1031
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,049
THE SOUP FIRST

1032
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,486
I can't believe
he made this in just 15 minutes.

1033
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:46,557
-There's depth to the flavor.
-There's depth? I see.

1034
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,393
I was worried it'd taste bland
like plain water.

1035
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,995
He thought it'd taste like water,

1036
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,130
-but it's rather thick too.
-Yes.

1037
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,598
He can eat it with the chicken now.

1038
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,468
-This is delicious.
-First, the soup is important.

1039
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,404
The problem
is if the chicken is fried well.

1040
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,139
What's in the chicken?

1041
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,742
Ginseng, dates, pine nuts, ginkgo nuts,

1042
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,444
-and chestnuts.
-Even chestnuts?

1043
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,247
-You can eat it together or separately.
-When the filling is out,

1044
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,217
it looks like <i>samgyetang</i> porridge.

1045
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,719
IS THE MEAT COOKED WELL?

1046
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,355
Well, I hope the chicken is cooked well.

1047
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,991
-It's fully cooked.
-The meat is fully cooked.

1048
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,060
I will try the skin first.

1049
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,163
They're probably thinking

1050
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,132
if people around the world
would love this.

1051
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,134
It feels like I'm eating fried chicken.

1052
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,469
Hybrid Chicken.

1053
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,104
-It truly is.
-Hybrid Chicken.

1054
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:38,809
Will the fried skin taste good
when it's soaked in the soup?

1055
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,178
-The crunchiness is still there.
-Is it?

1056
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,714
It mostly gets soggy
when it soaks in the soup.

1057
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:49,019
-It's the texture of scorched rice soup.
-Yes, that's it.

1058
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,389
-It had that exact texture.
-So that was his technique.

1059
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,258
It smells like green onion,

1060
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:58,862
so it's like <i>samgyetang</i> with green onion
when it turns into porridge.

1061
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,832
-It tastes just like that.
-It has that rich flavor.

1062
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,035
-It feels like I had a bowl of <i>samgyetang.</i>
-I see.

1063
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,707
FINISHING THE SOUP WHILE SHE'S TALKING

1064
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:13,477
The President had been
doubting the soup the whole time.

1065
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,715
He didn't think it'd taste rich,
thinking it'd be like plain water.

1066
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:21,051
But he's hooked
and keeps going back to the soup.

1067
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,487
-It's delicious. It has a rich flavor.
-I see.

1068
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,955
Actually…

1069
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,356
he added some chicken stock too.

1070
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,525
THE SECRET(?) TO THE RICH FLAVOR

1071
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,993
-Off-the-shelf stock?
-Yes.

1072
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,229
-He added some chicken stock.
-Did you add some?

1073
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,932
-I wanted to make Korean food easy…
-Right.

1074
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,501
-…so I kept the recipe very simple.
-Of course.

1075
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,936
-Absolutely.
-I understand.

1076
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,573
Chicken stock is made
by well-educated people, isn't it?

1077
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,342
-They seem to have different preferences.
-They do.

1078
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,077
-He's the soup guy…
-Yes, you're right.

1079
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,847
-…while she prefers the fried chicken.
-That seems to be the case.

1080
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,750
Next, Chef Jong-won's Go, Pine Nuts!

1081
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,252
TARAK-JUK MADE WITH PINE NUTS

1082
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,388
SEOPSANSAM MADE WITH POWDERED PINE NUTS

1083
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,725
TINY DRIED SHRIMP GANGJEONG

1084
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,763
BEAN FLOUR DASIK

1085
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,967
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S GO, PINE NUTS!

1086
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,269
Let me put these away
and bring something else.

1087
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,604
SWOOSH

1088
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,206
He's throwing away
the chopsticks and spoons

1089
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,408
they used to eat Chef Hyun-suk's food.

1090
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,610
ERASING TRACES OF HYUN-SUK

1091
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,913
He's trying to make them forget Hyun-suk.

1092
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,651
I wanted to add Korean beauty
to the utensils I use to serve these.

1093
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,620
-He's so detailed.
-Of course.

1094
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:32,289
-Korean food is all about the heart.
-How adorable.

1095
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,592
These are the four dishes
of Go, Pine Nuts!

1096
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,095
You can see how considerate he is.

1097
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,563
Look at the <i>tarak-juk.</i>

1098
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,099
-Chef Hyun-suk would've served one bowl.
-Yes.

1099
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,468
-He brought two for two.
-He served two bowls.

1100
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,303
-How considerate.
-Indeed.

1101
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,571
It looks pretty too.

1102
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,473
Yes, it looks pretty too.

1103
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,343
His hands trembled violently
as he tried to make them look that way.

1104
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,212
He didn't want it to go wrong.

1105
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,682
Everything is in season,
including the pine nuts.

1106
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,285
-I'm sure it tastes very nutty.
-You're right.

1107
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,553
This is really good.

1108
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,488
IMMEDIATE REACTION

1109
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,790
-He says it's really good.
-"It's really good."

1110
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,927
He already found
<i>tarak-juk,</i> milk porridge, delicious.

1111
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,596
-Pine nuts are good for you, aren't they?
-It's really good.

1112
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,364
How did you make this?

1113
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,500
If you think about it,
the ingredients are simple.

1114
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,002
-<i>I used pine nuts, milk…</i>
-<i>Did you blend the pine nuts?</i>

1115
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,038
-<i>…sticky rice, and honey.</i>
-<i>And just use a blender?</i>

1116
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,806
<i>Yes, I used a blender.</i>

1117
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,142
Everything tastes smooth, nutty,

1118
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,844
and there are a whole bunch
of other flavors.

1119
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,579
Anyhow, it's all delicious.

1120
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:29,813
A whole bunch of other flavors?

1121
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,682
HAPPY

1122
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,550
It must explode with nuttiness

1123
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,719
if it's made with both pine nuts and milk.

1124
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,455
A TASTE YOU CAN'T STOP FOR

1125
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,456
Nutty and sweet.

1126
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,824
-Pine nuts.
-Just a bit of honey.

1127
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,492
TO THE LAST DROP

1128
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,761
How come you finished it all already?

1129
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,698
It was just so good.

1130
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,634
It's something
you can finish in just one bite.

1131
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,736
It's nutty and sweet.

1132
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:53,871
-Nutty and sweet.
-What's the sweetness?

1133
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,672
THE PRESIDENT CLEANS IT UP

1134
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,474
-Just enough honey for a hint of sweet.
-Some honey. I see.

1135
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,744
I've had lots of soup to this day,

1136
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,614
but this was the most
delicious one of all.

1137
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,683
THE HIGHEST PRAISE

1138
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,552
THE PRESIDENT'S LOVE

1139
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:09,953
-He's giving you his love.
-These hearts.

1140
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,189
He said it was the best soup he ever had,

1141
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,391
but I'm sure there are chefs
in the Blue House…

1142
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,293
-Isn't that so?
-You're right.

1143
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,695
Oh, my. That was my mistake.

1144
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,631
They're going to tune in!

1145
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,634
-That was your mistake.
-They're all going to see this.

1146
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,304
There must be many chefs
who suddenly feel a pang of defeat.

1147
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,206
It's a shame
that I can't share this flavor

1148
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,409
-through the video on the screen.
-Is it that good?

1149
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,378
-Next, try the shrimp <i>gangjeong.</i>
-Shrimp <i>gangjeong.</i>

1150
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,280
I'm dying to know what that's like.

1151
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,248
It's hard to imagine
what shrimp <i>gangjeong</i> is like.

1152
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,652
PICKING IT UP WITH THE SKEWERS

1153
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,488
A BITE OF GANGJEONG

1154
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,391
Would it go well together?
Shrimp and <i>gangjeong?</i>

1155
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,325
I wonder.

1156
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:51,361
DOES TINY SHRIMP PAIR WELL WITH GANGJEONG?

1157
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,097
-This works very well.
-Does it?

1158
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:58,402
You can get sick of snacks
if it's too salty or too sweet

1159
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,003
-but you can enjoy it the most…
-You're right.

1160
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,306
-…when it's salty and sweet.
-It's salty and sweet.

1161
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:06,743
Come to think of it, we eat
stir-fried tiny shrimp as a side dish.

1162
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,079
It must be something like that.

1163
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,081
The savory flavor of the shrimp

1164
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,151
brings out the sweetness of <i>gangjeong.</i>

1165
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,653
-The shrimp plays an important part.
-It's savory.

1166
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,223
-The saltiness works up my appetite too.
-I'm sure.

1167
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,459
It's a shame to eat this alone.

1168
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,462
Feel free to enjoy it as much as you want.

1169
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,664
Next, please try the <i>seopsansam.</i>

1170
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,232
-Made with <i>deodeok.</i>
-<i>Deodeok</i>.

1171
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,868
Yes, the ingredient
from his childhood memories.

1172
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:36,073
-He dug it up in the mountains.
-When he used to be a child.

1173
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,442
It's been coated
with rice powder and deep-fried.

1174
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,745
Even today, he can still
tell apart <i>deodeok</i> when he sees it.

1175
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,613
-Because I can smell it.
-Yes, you can smell it.

1176
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,581
And the leaves are unique.

1177
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,752
-The <i>deodeok</i> is still crisp.
-Is it?

1178
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,721
-The <i>deodeok</i> is still crisp.
-It's still crisp.

1179
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,389
CRUNCH

1180
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,459
Other Asian countries use <i>deodeok</i>
for medicinal purposes

1181
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,894
or just keep it as a plant.

1182
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,564
Korea is the only country
that eats the root plant.

1183
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,167
-You're right.
-So it truly is a Korean ingredient.

1184
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,437
What do you think? Is it quite different
from the <i>deodeok</i> of your childhood?

1185
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:09,940
To be honest,

1186
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,176
the smell of <i>deodeok</i> is more pronounced
when it isn't seasoned.

1187
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:17,414
Its distinctive scent is
mostly hidden in this dish.

1188
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,083
I think it still smells rather strong.

1189
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,120
-I have a bad sense of smell.
-Their opinions differ.

1190
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,654
Since we have such an expert here.

1191
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:28,158
He loses some points
because of the <i>deodeok.</i>

1192
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,093
No, I don't think
a deduction is necessary.

1193
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,197
-There are other better flavors.
-Better flavors.

1194
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:37,200
-It's nutty and sweet.
-But the smell isn't as strong.

1195
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,937
All right.
Next up, bean flour and pine nut <i>dasik.</i>

1196
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,006
-It's a work of art.
-It is.

1197
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:48,512
I learned to make <i>dasik </i>by using the mold
before my mother-in-law passed away.

1198
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:52,015
And it really isn't easy
to shape it beautifully in this.

1199
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,185
But he managed
to shape it beautifully in one go.

1200
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,453
PERFECTLY-FORMED DASIK

1201
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,956
Ours was passed down to my mother
from her great-grandmother-in-law.

1202
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,925
It's been passed down for generations.

1203
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,026
UNBELIEVABLE

1204
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,795
It's a family heirloom.

1205
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:10,600
-I feel bad for eating this in one bite.
-Right? It's just one bite.

1206
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:15,072
It's amazing how he managed
to make four dishes in such a short time.

1207
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,841
He made this <i>dasik</i> in just 15 minutes.

1208
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,277
This is delicious too.

1209
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:25,482
If <i>dasik</i> isn't made properly,
it tends to stick to your teeth,

1210
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,583
but this isn't like that.

1211
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,151
I didn't want to make it soggy,

1212
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,454
<i>so I made fresh dough</i>
<i>and pressed it right away.</i>

1213
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,156
<i>I also dabbed the bottom with bean flour.</i>

1214
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,059
-They have memories of bean flour too.
-Yes, of course.

1215
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,794
The bean flour soup.

1216
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,564
<i>Dasik</i> can be made

1217
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,733
-with pine flower powder…
-Pine flower powder, bean flour,

1218
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,001
and many more.

1219
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:48,672
-It can be made with green tea and sesame.
-Yes, sesame as well.

1220
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,974
We're here with guests

1221
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,711
-who have some expertise in <i>dasik.</i>
-Expertise?

1222
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,848
They've been making <i>dasik</i>
since their great-grandmother.

1223
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,718
And now, it's the moment of truth.

1224
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,654
-This is the toughest moment.
-It must be tough.

1225
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,289
One of them will get a star,

1226
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,992
and the other will get hurt.

1227
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,695
-You were so happy while you were eating.
-I was.

1228
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:12,896
It'd be great if we stop now.

1229
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,398
-Can we stop here and leave?
-No, you can't.

1230
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,136
It doesn't matter if you choose
officially or personally.

1231
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,471
-But you can't dine and dash.
-Absolutely not.

1232
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,573
-You can't dash. You must choose one.
-You can't.

1233
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,743
-You can't do that.
-You must choose one before you leave.

1234
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,480
The fans of the show all around the world
have their eyes on you right now.

1235
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,617
Who will be chosen
by the President and the First Lady?

1236
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:36,653
-This will be interesting.
-What a decision.

1237
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,388
<i>Please press one for Son Jong-won</i>

1238
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,090
<i>and two for Choi Hyun-suk.</i>

1239
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,325
Please do not discuss
and choose individually.

1240
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,362
We love it when you choose one
without showing it to the other.

1241
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,030
-Yes.
-We love it when you hide it.

1242
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:50,100
-We hold secret ballots in our country.
-We do.

1243
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,035
Please don't discuss your opinions.

1244
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:55,305
Please make your decision
and press the button!

1245
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,441
Press one for Jong-won, two for Hyun-suk.

1246
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,278
They look back and forth at the two chefs.

1247
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,647
THINKING UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE

1248
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,815
-How will it go?
-Did you press it?

1249
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,017
-It can be two to zero.
-Did you?

1250
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,952
-You can't ask. I won't tell.
-It's still a secret.

1251
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,289
She asked if he pressed the button.

1252
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,591
They both pressed the button.
We have the result.

1253
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,860
-You already pressed it. You did.
-Yes.

1254
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,629
What do we do?

1255
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,531
-Their choices…
-Your choices.

1256
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,933
…were not the same.

1257
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,335
-Really?
-It was one to one.

1258
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,337
-One to one?
-They differed.

1259
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,639
One of them picked Hyun-suk,
the other picked Jong-won.

1260
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,308
They must have a discussion now.

1261
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:36,112
Please have a discussion
and settle on one person.

1262
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,448
We'll give you time to chat.

1263
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,717
-Do we do it here?
-We can't do it while you watch.

1264
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,153
-Why don't we talk about something else?
-Let's all start chatting.

1265
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,955
DOING THEIR BEST TO NOT LISTEN

1266
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:49,492
I didn't think
the result would be one to one.

1267
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,429
-How did he make four dishes?
-Right?

1268
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:55,265
It's not easy to make
4 snacks in 15 minutes.

1269
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,800
They had different opinions.

1270
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,301
-We've decided. Yes!
-Did you?

1271
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,703
They made a decision.

1272
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,572
Who's going to hold the remote control?

1273
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,374
-Only one person gets to choose?
-Only one.

1274
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,743
-You can press the button.
-Should I press it?

1275
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,812
He always makes me do the tough things.

1276
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,916
Only one person will press the button
on their final decision.

1277
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:17,087
-The result is in.
-Is it?

1278
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,156
-It's in. What's wrong?
-It's in.

1279
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,493
-Why are you dropping your heads?
-My gosh.

1280
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,097
Who is the winner?
Who's going to win the star?

1281
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,798
Let's find out. Show us!

1282
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,968
K-food for the world.

1283
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,871
The President and the First Lady
made their choice.

1284
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,806
Will Jong-won get his revenge?

1285
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:40,877
Or will Hyun-suk rise again
as the best chef of the show?

1286
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,980
Let's find out!

1287
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,782
They must be so nervous.

1288
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,652
Who did they choose?

1289
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,552
Show us!

1290
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,656
Whose K-food is better for the world…

1291
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,524
SON JONG-WON WINS

1292
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,161
CHEF SON JONG-WON'S GO, PINE NUTS! WINS

1293
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,965
-Jong-won was chosen!
-I knew I'd lose.

1294
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,934
Jong-won gets his revenge.

1295
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,837
-That was tough.
-It was originally one to one.

1296
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,473
They both can't face the chefs.

1297
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,008
It was initially one to one,

1298
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,444
and they settled on Jong-won later.

1299
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:18,548
When I meet many people overseas,

1300
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:24,487
they used to love Korean food
catered more to their palate before,

1301
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,157
but these days, what they look for

1302
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,492
is authentic Korean.

1303
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,595
But of course, this hybrid…

1304
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,800
<i>…</i>kind of reinterpretation is
necessary, as well as traditional cooking.

1305
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,703
We thought we should promote
what's more traditional from now on

1306
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:43,239
to turn what's authentically Korean
to what's truly global.

1307
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,342
CLAPPING

1308
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:47,310
-She's right on point.
-She is.

1309
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,478
Wait, everyone.

1310
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,581
There was a twist to what she said.

1311
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,749
-Why?
-Yes.

1312
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,517
During the initial vote…

1313
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,219
-Yes?
-What?

1314
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,422
-…the First Lady chose Hyun-suk.
-She did?

1315
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,259
-You can't reveal the secret ballot.
-Why did you expose me?

1316
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,362
-You can't do that.
-That's true.

1317
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,930
It was a secret ballot.

1318
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,765
I didn't want Hyun-suk to mope forever.

1319
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,200
I've always been a fan.

1320
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,870
-Please don't take it the wrong way.
-Please don't.

1321
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,639
He seemed like the type who'd go
with the First Lady's opinion,

1322
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,908
-but this time, it was his opinion.
-Not this time.

1323
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,777
Which should we choose?

1324
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:25,749
Go with the Korean dish.
The authentic one.

1325
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,152
All right.

1326
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,422
THEY HAD A LOVEY-DOVEY DISCUSSION

1327
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,292
Hybrid Chicken was a wonderful dish,

1328
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,162
<i>but this was more Korean,</i>
<i>and it had more potential.</i>

1329
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,631
-It's easier to store.
-Right.

1330
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,167
-You can store it for much longer.
-Yes, of course.

1331
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,469
-We can ship it on a vessel.
-Yes, right.

1332
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,872
It'll be easier to export.

1333
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,774
I thought I should start studying this.

1334
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,544
-He chose the potential export powerhouse.
-You've been chosen.

1335
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,845
He's the export powerhouse now!

1336
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,314
-He's taking it straight to export.
-Yes.

1337
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,283
Chef Hyun-suk's dish was more domestic.

1338
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,384
It was domestic.

1339
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,686
-That one is for export.
-For export.

1340
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,289
-You must be disappointed, Hyun-suk.
-No.

1341
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,391
I'm very satisfied with my dish.

1342
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,860
It's just that Chef Jong-won
made something

1343
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,996
that surpassed my wonderful dish.

1344
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,097
As for Chef Jong-won,

1345
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:17,434
we may as well
just export Chef Jong-won himself,

1346
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,537
so let's send him abroad
starting next week and empty his seat.

1347
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,472
You're trying to deport him!

1348
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,874
That's not exportation, but deportation!

1349
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,775
Right, sure.

1350
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:29,679
Ms. First Lady,
please put a star on Jong-won.

1351
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:33,650
-It was like a movie.
-They have chosen Jong-won's dish!

1352
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,852
Go, Pine Nuts! Yes!

1353
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,555
-Congratulations.
-Worthy of exporting.

1354
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,256
-Thank you.
-Jong-won.

1355
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,892
-It breaks my heart, Chef Hyun-suk.
-Thank you.

1356
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,594
Not at all. Thank you.

1357
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,763
Look at how excited she is.

1358
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,764
HEHE

1359
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,969
<i>We're about to begin the second round</i>
<i>of the Chuseok cook-off.</i>

1360
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,939
The queen of Chinese cuisine
we want the world to know,

1361
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,808
Chef Jung Ji-sun is in this round.

1362
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,178
Also in this round is someone
we aren't sure if the world is ready for.

1363
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,351
The king of knockoff chefs,
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong.

1364
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,954
-I'm not sure how this is going to go.
-It's nerve-racking.

1365
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,790
For your information,
Chef Ji-sun had seven rounds

1366
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:16,659
and won all seven rounds.

1367
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,528
-Is that so?
-She has the highest win rate.

1368
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:19,996
A RECORD TO RESPECT

1369
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,899
But Poong, you also have seven stars,
don't you?

1370
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,133
LET'S SEE

1371
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,702
-Eight.
-Eight stars.

1372
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,270
He has eight stars, but--

1373
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,438
Did he make those stars himself?

1374
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,906
No, no.

1375
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:33,042
-We don't do anything like that here.
-That'd be lying.

1376
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,578
We don't go that far. Gosh, Poong.

1377
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,846
JUST KIDDING

1378
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,282
Another important fact to note.

1379
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,150
Ji-sun took her first victory

1380
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,786
against Poong.

1381
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,155
So he's her first
and currently last opponent.

1382
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,726
-That's why I wish to put an end to this.
-An end?

1383
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,760
I should do that.

1384
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,097
I'm going to slam on the brakes
and stop her winning streak

1385
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,233
-and park that car too.
-All right.

1386
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,068
You're up against Webtoon Artist Poong

1387
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,504
in this important moment in time.

1388
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,239
He doesn't concern me at all.

1389
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,607
-You aren't concerned?
-No.

1390
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,142
I'll take my eighth victory.

1391
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,677
We also believe

1392
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,446
the theme must be
more advantageous for you, Ji-sun.

1393
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:15,285
<i>You created</i> siraegi basi
<i>on </i>Culinary Class Wars,

1394
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,888
and some even began to call her
the queen of <i>siraegi.</i>

1395
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,624
<i>Siraegi basi</i> became such a big thing

1396
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:25,128
<i>that I've shown it abroad</i>
<i>in Taiwan and Hong Kong,</i>

1397
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:29,332
<i>so I believe it was a great opportunity</i>
<i>to introduce this Korean ingredient.</i>

1398
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,633
ACKNOWLEDGED

1399
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,901
Chef Ji-sun

1400
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,203
isn't looking at Poong right now.

1401
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,073
-Her eyes are on the world.
-She's looking at the world.

1402
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,410
Poong, have you sold <i>siraegi</i> sandwich

1403
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,744
-at your old café?
-That's right.

1404
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,248
I made it with bulgogi and some <i>siraegi</i>,

1405
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,850
because it pairs well with meat.

1406
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,452
And my customers loved it.

1407
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,220
Do you still run that café?

1408
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,690
-What happened to that café?
-So?

1409
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,791
OOPS…

1410
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,993
-That's all we'll hear from him.
-All right.

1411
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,261
SHORT STORY: HE CLOSED DOWN

1412
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,164
CHEF JI-SUN'S INGREDIENTS:
SIRAEGI, RADISH, PYOGO, SIRLOIN

1413
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,266
RICE POWDER, DATES,
DRIED PERSIMMONS, PINE NEEDLES

1414
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,001
The dish I prepared is called

1415
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,603
<i>Siraegi Tteok</i> to the Moon.

1416
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,438
-What?
-<i>Siraegi Tteok </i>to the Moon.

1417
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,740
-To the moon?
-<i>Siraegi Tteok</i> to the Moon.

1418
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:14,210
-Isn't that stock market jargon?
-Right.

1419
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,878
It has many different meanings.

1420
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,948
May <i>siraegi</i> go to the moon worldwide.

1421
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:22,051
-It may definitely go to the moon.
-Yes.

1422
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,355
On Chuseok, we always eat <i>songpyeon,</i>
half-moon shaped rice cake.

1423
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,291
I'm going to make that by using <i>siraegi.</i>

1424
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,761
I'm going to mix rice powder
and <i>siraegi</i> to make the dough,

1425
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:36,399
so that you can see the greens
on the outside of the <i>tteok,</i> rice cake.

1426
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:40,103
I'll also steam<i> siraegi</i>,
radish, and Korean beef

1427
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:44,073
and griddle it too.
So I'll serve two types of <i>tteok</i> today.

1428
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,541
Very well.

1429
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,910
She'll make an entire meal of <i>tteok.</i>

1430
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,612
-Yes.
-I'm looking forward to it.

1431
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:52,548
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
SIRAEGI, BRACKEN, LOTUS ROOT, BEET

1432
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,617
OYSTER SAUCE, PERILLA OIL, PERILLA POWDER,
ANCHOVY SAUCE, CHICKEN STOCK

1433
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,152
Poong is the problem.

1434
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,687
THE PROBLEM IS THE KNOCKOFF CHEF

1435
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,288
I'm very curious.

1436
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,623
Things have been great so far.

1437
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,693
The name of the dish
I'll make is as follows.

1438
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:08,231
Lee Jae-myung Pizza.

1439
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,832
Lee Jae-myung Pizza?

1440
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,502
-Pizza?
-Did he say pizza?

1441
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,871
Wait a second.

1442
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,372
LET'S HEAR HIM OUT

1443
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:17,974
-I'm going to make a pizza.
-Okay.

1444
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,843
By any chance, do you know a pizza place
called Lee Jae-mo Pizza in Busan?

1445
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:26,182
It's actually exists.
Lee Jae-mo Pizza is huge in Busan.

1446
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,451
-Lee Jae-mo Pizza?
-Yes.

1447
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,220
-It's a famous place.
-And you want to promote that?

1448
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,789
I get it.

1449
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:37,326
But using the President's name
in the name of your dish…

1450
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,862
-Wait.
-…seems kind of risky.

1451
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,297
Are you sure?

1452
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,298
Well…

1453
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,499
-Well, you know.
-Yes?

1454
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,034
The meaning is different.

1455
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:46,969
IN DISBELIEF

1456
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,772
The <i>Jae</i> of my dish means fortune.

1457
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,742
-It means fortune? Is that so?
-Yes, that's the case.

1458
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,679
Should he modify the name?
What do you think, sir?

1459
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,881
-He should go ahead.
-Should he?

1460
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,651
It may turn out to be a masterpiece.

1461
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,220
-Of course.
-That would be great.

1462
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,924
I got the inspiration
from what he said today.

1463
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:12,161
He told us that story
of how he got sick after eating pizza.

1464
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,465
So I suddenly began to think
he would've loved it even more

1465
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:19,035
if he had pizza made with <i>siraegi.</i>

1466
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,004
I'm going to griddle some scorched rice

1467
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,006
and turn it into the crunchy dough.

1468
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:28,511
And if I steam <i>siraegi</i>
and bracken for a long time,

1469
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:34,016
I feel like it turns into meaty texture,
like pulled pork.

1470
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,718
I'm going to make that,

1471
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,621
deep-fry pieces of lotus root
colored with beet juice

1472
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,356
and use them

1473
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,725
-like pepperoni pieces.
-What's he saying?

1474
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,627
THE GUY WHO SCOFFED

1475
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,362
Don't laugh at him.

1476
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,065
-As a topping?
-Did you just laugh at me?

1477
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,166
He's laughing.

1478
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,136
He has never described his dish
in such length before.

1479
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,371
I'M JUST THAT ANXIOUS…

1480
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,573
That's what I'm going to do.

1481
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,542
-You're in for a surprise.
-Are we?

1482
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,643
It's a new kind of pizza.

1483
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,079
-Will it be the best pizza of his life?
-Yes.

1484
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:05,348
You must be quite nervous.

1485
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,850
Well, I am, now that I'm up here.

1486
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,721
Are you regretting your decision?

1487
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,790
Please start rooting for me.

1488
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,892
-Everyone, root for me.
-Sure.

1489
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,128
-Let's believe in his magic once again.
-That's right.

1490
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,431
Before we begin, may we make a suggestion?

1491
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:26,636
By any chance, Ms. First Lady,
can you join me in the kitchen

1492
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,038
-during the five-minute check?
-It would be an honor.

1493
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,873
-Is that all right? Very good.
-Yes.

1494
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,577
And now, let us begin the cook-off.

1495
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,846
Chef Jung Ji-sun is here

1496
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:40,016
to make her life go to the moon
with this <i>siraegi </i>dish today.

1497
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,551
YOU CAN DO IT!

1498
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,886
Also, Webtoon Artist Poong

1499
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:49,158
will make the best pizza for the President
and want to be set up for life.

1500
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,328
Who will be
the export powerhouse of <i>siraegi</i>?

1501
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,598
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1502
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:57,600
Begin!

1503
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,635
THE SIRAEGI BATTLE
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE!

1504
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,470
I WILL BE THE EXPORT POWERHOUSE OF SIRAEGI

1505
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,173
<i>Siraegi</i> needs to shine in your dishes.

1506
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,610
Artist Poong is working on a beet first.

1507
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,046
Chef Ji-sun is already working
on the <i>siraegi.</i>

1508
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,848
-She's dicing it.
-Yes.

1509
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,784
-It's already been soaked in water.
-Yes.

1510
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,419
-He'll blend those right away.
-The beet?

1511
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,188
He's going to blend the beet immediately.

1512
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,557
I guess he's using that for color.

1513
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,326
1. ADD WATER TO THE BEET AND BLEND

1514
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:27,463
Beets can smell like dirt
when it's undercooked.

1515
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,965
-That's true.
-And so,

1516
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,566
as I always say,

1517
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,534
I'm worried.

1518
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,337
INSTANT RICE

1519
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,639
-Poong is using some rice.
-I am.

1520
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,841
Is he going to make scorched rice?

1521
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,879
He said he'll use scorched rice
as the pizza dough.

1522
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,614
-That's the pizza dough.
-Yes.

1523
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,383
He's going to griddle it on the pan.

1524
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:51,220
By any chance, do you like your dough
with some handprints?

1525
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,955
It's covered in handprints.

1526
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,091
-That's what you call "handmade" pizza.
-Sure.

1527
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,492
-He's using his hands.
-Handmade, indeed.

1528
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,029
He failed to use the right amount
and had to fill up the holes.

1529
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,099
WILSON PIZZA?

1530
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,467
SHE'S DONE PREPARING SIRAEGI

1531
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,003
Ji-sun slices radish.

1532
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,537
USING A SLICER TO SLICE RADISH!

1533
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,073
THE RHYTHMICAL CHOPPING SOUND!

1534
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,808
SINGING ALONG

1535
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,243
She's working with radish.

1536
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,680
-Are those radish slices for the <i>tteok?</i>
-Yes.

1537
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:21,183
I see. I wonder why you're adding
radish slices to <i>tteok?</i>

1538
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,419
Rice? Rice powder?

1539
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,721
-Sticky rice?
-It's regular rice powder.

1540
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:26,756
AND!

1541
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,159
-And she's…
-<i>Pyogo</i>!

1542
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,528
-…is that <i>pyogo</i> mushroom?
-He asked to--

1543
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,263
-I'll add just a little.
-Just a little.

1544
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,299
He has to eat it tomorrow too.

1545
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,601
He wanted you to hold back on it today.

1546
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,237
-He often eats it when he's home.
-Yes.

1547
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:42,471
PULLS OUT KOREAN BEEF

1548
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,840
SHE PICKS OUT A LEAN CUT

1549
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:47,376
AND MAKES THIN SLICES!

1550
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,578
-Are you slicing beef?
-Yes.

1551
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,514
-She's using Korean beef.
-Right.

1552
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,383
MINCED GARLIC, SIRLOIN

1553
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,952
Garlic. Minced garlic.

1554
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,187
-Minced garlic.
-Minced garlic and soy sauce.

1555
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,455
-Sugar.
-Sugar.

1556
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:00,656
Is she making <i>tteokgalbi</i>?

1557
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,358
-<i>Tteokgalbi</i>?
-That's bulgogi marinade.

1558
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,928
BULGOGI MADE WITH KOREAN BEEF
GOES INTO THE PAN

1559
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:09,832
5. STIR-FRY MUSHROOM BULGOGI
IN AN OILED PAN

1560
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,469
POURING COOKING OIL ON THE EDGE!

1561
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,871
He's pouring cooking oil
to the scorched rice.

1562
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:16,973
-Oil?
-Oil?

1563
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,775
-To make it crunchy?
-He needs some oil to make it

1564
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,510
much crunchier, and it cooks faster.

1565
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,980
-And it happens much faster.
-Faster.

1566
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,148
Wouldn't it be greasy? Is that okay?

1567
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,617
-It's fine. It'll be okay.
-Really? I see.

1568
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,286
THE MAIN INGREDIENT, SIRAEGI!

1569
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:34,156
Poong prepares the <i>siraegi</i> now.

1570
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,092
What's he doing?

1571
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,860
-He'll smash it.
-Will he smash it?

1572
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,429
To make it tender,
which will make it cook better.

1573
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,697
He's trying to make it tender.

1574
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,965
NEXT UP IS BRACKEN

1575
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,368
CHOPPING BRACKEN THE POONG WAY

1576
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:49,205
He's mashing everything together.

1577
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,272
Bracken and <i>siraegi.</i>

1578
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,575
I've never seen anyone do that.

1579
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:53,776
-Poong!
-Yes?

1580
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:58,014
The President has never seen anyone
smash <i>siraegi</i> like that before.

1581
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,416
This will give it a tender
and well-cooked texture.

1582
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,018
And it'll cook faster.

1583
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,121
It'll feel much more tender
like pulled pork.

1584
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,123
-It won't be as tough.
-I see.

1585
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,624
Butter?

1586
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,559
He's using scorched rice,
<i>siraegi,</i> and butter.

1587
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,495
The butter? I'm going to fry it in butter.

1588
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,031
-In butter?
-Will you stir-fry that and then top it

1589
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,033
-on the scorched rice?
-Butter and <i>siraegi?</i>

1590
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,235
<i>Siraegi</i> is supposed to be
cooked in perilla oil.

1591
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,903
AHHHH!

1592
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,106
<i>Siraegi</i> is supposed to be
cooked in perilla oil.

1593
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,609
-Is that okay?
-You're doing it in butter.

1594
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,444
Shouldn't you cook it in perilla oil?

1595
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,745
I'll…

1596
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,081
I'll add<i>…</i>

1597
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,315
perilla oil later.

1598
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,450
-You'll add some later?
-Yes.

1599
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,419
It's a groundbreaking idea.

1600
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:40,623
He'll cook it in butter first,
and then use some perilla oil too.

1601
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,259
You have ten minutes left.
Five minutes have gone by.

1602
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,460
PERILLA OIL?

1603
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,561
I'M USING SESAME OIL!

1604
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,129
Are you oiling that pan?

1605
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:50,199
-I oiled it with sesame oil.
-Sesame oil?

1606
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,101
-Sesame oil?
-Sesame oil.

1607
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:56,539
Is she going to put <i>songpyeon</i> on it?
We do that, don't we?

1608
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:00,810
It's hard for me to tell
what Chef Ji-sun is doing right now.

1609
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,279
-I'm not sure how it'll turn out.
-No.

1610
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:04,914
Technically, the same applies

1611
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,482
to Poong too.

1612
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,554
-But that was always his thing.
-Yes.

1613
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,888
6. MIX RADISH SLICES,
MUSHROOM BULGOGI, AND RICE POWDER

1614
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,057
She's mixing radish slices with bulgogi,

1615
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:18,127
and then putting it on the pan
greased with sesame oil.

1616
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,028
INTO THE STEAMER!

1617
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,663
I guess that tray is used as a mold.

1618
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,032
So that it doesn't stick.

1619
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,435
It was to prevent the <i>tteok</i>
from sticking to the pan.

1620
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,705
-Is that perilla oil?
-Anchovy sauce.

1621
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,574
-Anchovy sauce.
-Fish sauce?

1622
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,376
He keeps adding something else
instead of perilla oil.

1623
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,045
-Cooking wine.
-Cooking wine.

1624
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,547
He's stir-frying that with fish sauce
to make pizza.

1625
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,117
Butter, anchovy sauce, and perilla oil?

1626
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,718
That's peculiar.

1627
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,355
The distrust against Poong is on the rise.

1628
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:47,923
ONE SUPPORTER REMAINS

1629
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,958
(I BELIEVE IN YOU)

1630
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,426
Scissors.

1631
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:54,964
He cuts the mix with scissors
into tiny pieces, making it easier to eat.

1632
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,299
The texture of <i>siraegi</i> is very important.

1633
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,535
-Perilla oil!
-He finally uses perilla oil.

1634
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:00,803
Perilla powder!

1635
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,037
AND!

1636
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,839
CHICKEN STOCK

1637
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,407
-Perilla powder.
-And perilla powder.

1638
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,042
They finally look relieved.

1639
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:08,110
At the very least,

1640
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,547
the texture of the<i> siraegi</i>
should be to their tastes.

1641
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:17,253
5. BOIL SIRAEGI AND BUTTER STIR-FRY
WITH PERILLA OIL AND WATER

1642
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,789
POURING RICE POWDER INTO A HUGE BOWL

1643
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,424
IN GOES THE SIRAEGI

1644
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,160
What Chef Ji-sun is doing now

1645
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,830
is like how people make mugwort <i>tteok.</i>

1646
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,632
Like tossed rice cake?

1647
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:31,534
EXPLANATION SUCCESS!

1648
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:35,037
She chopped <i>siraegi </i>into tiny pieces,

1649
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,540
so it'll smell very strong.

1650
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,210
8. TOP THE BULGOGI RADISH TTEOK
WITH SIRAEGI

1651
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:42,545
SQUEEZING THE WATER OUT

1652
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:45,781
Dates. She's using dates.

1653
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,052
Ji-sun is using dried persimmons too.

1654
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,421
Dried persimmons and dates
are great together.

1655
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,126
FLATTEN OUT A LUMP
OF SIRAEGI SONGPYEON DOUGH

1656
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,695
That must be the filling.

1657
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,464
The dried persimmons and dates
have become the filling.

1658
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,767
I see. Just like that.

1659
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,069
She made it into <i>songpyeon.</i>

1660
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,939
Chef Ji-sun makes some <i>tteok.</i>

1661
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,507
They're <i>songpyeon.</i>

1662
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:15,778
The shape of <i>songpyeon</i>
Chef Ji-sun is making

1663
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,280
looks exactly like my mother-in-law's.

1664
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:21,951
HOW AMAZING!

1665
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,820
Was that information leaked somehow?

1666
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,755
How did Chef Ji-sun know this?

1667
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,524
-Were you aware?
-How did she know?

1668
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:29,725
Were you aware?

1669
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,894
No, I wanted to let them cook quickly.

1670
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,662
-You just ended up doing that?
-Yes.

1671
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:38,500
People in the Seoul area make
tiny and cute-shaped <i>songpyeon</i>.

1672
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:42,338
But my mother-in-law
used to make them with ease.

1673
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,839
-Yes.
-Since she had no time,

1674
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,508
she made them quickly into big pieces.

1675
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,511
-Into big pieces, to make them quickly.
-Yes.

1676
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,616
-It seems Chef Ji-sun got lucky again.
-Yes, she has.

1677
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:57,152
We can take a stab
that Chef Ji-sun will win the star.

1678
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,587
You have six minutes left.

1679
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:01,156
He grabs the blended beet.

1680
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:04,026
How will he use this beet liquid?

1681
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,795
HIS PLAN: POUR THE LIQUID
INTO A CLOTH AND STRAIN

1682
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,465
NOT STRAINING
FAILED

1683
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,034
CHANGE IN PLAN:
SQUEEZE THE CLOTH

1684
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,137
OH, NO… THE SIDE!

1685
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,206
THE CLOTH WAS NO USE

1686
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,542
Oh, my. No!

1687
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,012
It broke and fell into the flour.

1688
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,780
Poong fails to strain the liquid.

1689
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:25,681
It's okay.

1690
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,816
It looks like he needs help.

1691
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,386
Believe me, we all want to in our minds.

1692
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,121
Goodness, Poong.

1693
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:33,255
-Lotus root.
-Lotus root?

1694
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,857
How will he use that?

1695
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,358
Is that also a garnish?

1696
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,994
-You'll top it like salami, right?
-That's right.

1697
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,130
-I think he'll deep-fry them.
-I know!

1698
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,264
Like pepperoni pieces.

1699
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,266
PEPPERONI?

1700
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,635
Goodness, pepperoni pieces.

1701
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,170
-Sung-ju!
-Yes?

1702
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,239
-We have five minutes left!
-You're right!

1703
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,174
First Lady, you must come with me!

1704
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,744
Let's go to the kitchen.
Please be careful.

1705
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,747
We are now moving to the kitchen station.

1706
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:03,218
I'm going to have the five-minute check
along with the First Lady.

1707
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:04,920
I'll give you three spoons,

1708
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,789
so please have a taste.

1709
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,957
7. MAKE FRYING BATTER WITH BEET LIQUID

1710
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:12,027
The first thing we must check
is the <i>siraegi.</i>

1711
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:16,231
Please check the texture
and the seasoning.

1712
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,067
We'll try just the <i>siraegi</i>.

1713
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,270
Poong gives it a taste too, and so will I.

1714
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,304
THEY EACH TAKE A BITE

1715
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,640
<i>Siraegi</i>. Be careful.

1716
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,241
-Let's try the <i>siraegi</i>.
-It's hot.

1717
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:27,343
NOM, NOM

1718
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,045
WILL IT SET UP POONG FOR LIFE?

1719
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:33,148
Will it become
the best pizza of their lives?

1720
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,883
HOW IS THE SIRAEGI
WITH BUTTER AND PERILLA OIL?

1721
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,019
Why is this good?

1722
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:37,920
It's good!

1723
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:40,322
-"Why is this good?"
-Why is this good?

1724
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,357
Why is this good?

1725
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,560
THAT'S THE LINE
THAT BEGINS THE KIM POONG MAGIC!

1726
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,662
-"Why is this good?"
-Why is this good?

1727
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:47,563
It's good.

1728
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:48,731
IT'S ME, KIM POONG!

1729
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:51,166
-It's been seasoned nicely.
-The butter.

1730
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,202
Why does butter go well with <i>siraegi?</i>

1731
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:54,903
It's his magic.

1732
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,305
-It pairs well.
-And it tastes rich.

1733
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,339
Yes, it does.

1734
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,442
-They go well.
-Green vegetables go well with butter.

1735
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,211
I've never thought of that before.

1736
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,346
It's a surprise.

1737
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,883
So far, Poong's <i>siraegi</i> dish
is going well.

1738
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,687
It's so annoying that he's using
the lotus root as pepperoni pieces.

1739
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,589
LOOKING BACK ON HIS CAREER…

1740
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:14,923
You have 4 minutes and 23 seconds.

1741
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,860
Both sides seem to be a bit behind.

1742
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,896
She only has the <i>tteok</i> base.

1743
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,199
KNEADING THE STEAMED TTEOK

1744
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:26,335
-Isn't it hot?
-It is.

1745
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,269
IT'S HOT!

1746
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,771
Can you try the radish <i>tteok?</i>

1747
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:32,908
It was just steamed
and pretty much cooked, so yes.

1748
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,310
It's been cooked, right?
Will you griddle this?

1749
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,279
-Yes, I'll griddle it again.
-Pan-frying.

1750
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:38,781
There's <i>siraegi</i> in here.

1751
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,750
We'll try what Ji-sun
has done with the <i>siraegi.</i>

1752
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:42,818
She used radish too.

1753
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,388
Yes, she steamed it
with the radish slices.

1754
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,957
-She's now griddling them again.
-Yes.

1755
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:50,092
She used Korean beef too.

1756
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,327
We'll try it before griddling.

1757
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,330
Will <i>siraegi tteok</i> go to the moon?

1758
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,834
It's crisp.

1759
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,603
She has such a nice personality.

1760
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,274
-It's not seasoned yet.
-Shouldn't you season this?

1761
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,341
I haven't yet.

1762
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,776
-No, right?
-No, I haven't.

1763
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,611
It just tastes like radish.

1764
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,146
-It tastes like radish?
-Yes.

1765
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:14,883
It'll get more toasty once I griddle them.

1766
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,286
No, it tasted salty enough.

1767
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,720
She doesn't like to say mean things.

1768
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,689
It hasn't been seasoned yet.

1769
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,792
I like how I can bite
on the radish slices.

1770
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,194
-Do you?
-Is that okay?

1771
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,496
-It's fine without seasoning.
-You have a minute.

1772
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,231
-Put some seasoning on it.
-Poong.

1773
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,599
-Only a minute left.
-It's hot!

1774
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,535
-You have a minute and 40 seconds!
-Wait, be careful!

1775
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,771
-Protect her.
-Protect her.

1776
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:36,805
What are you doing, Poong?

1777
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:40,142
This is important!
It has to bubble for it to turn crunchy.

1778
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:44,046
-You have a minute and 30 seconds.
-A minute and 30 seconds!

1779
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:47,616
-Please watch from a distance.
-I'm sorry.

1780
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:50,152
It's supposed to come out
like pizza dough.

1781
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,988
-Is that going to work?
-Look at him.

1782
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,456
NOW'S THE TIME!

1783
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,059
STAY BEHIND JI-SUN

1784
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,496
HE MANAGES TO FLIP IT

1785
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:06,602
FLIP THE PIZZA
AND TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND TOO!

1786
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,403
IT'S ME, KIM POONG!

1787
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,105
-Did it go well?
-It looks great.

1788
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,975
He did it,
though oil is splattering everywhere.

1789
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,776
-Don't get too close.
-Don't come near!

1790
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,045
Please don't come near.

1791
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,514
I'M KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU!

1792
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,282
THE THREAT FACTOR GUARDS THE THREAT

1793
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,950
-Get back to cooking!
-One minute!

1794
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,386
1 MINUTE REMAINING!

1795
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,488
You have under a minute left.

1796
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,057
LOCKING IT UP WITH A DISH?

1797
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,326
FLIPS IT OVER TO SERVE IT!

1798
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,930
THE SCORCHED RICE CRUST

1799
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:37,499
She's deep-frying on this side too.

1800
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,868
Are you steaming these?

1801
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:42,504
She doesn't have enough time.

1802
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,906
You have 30 seconds.

1803
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,909
-Thirty seconds!
-You don't have anything here.

1804
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,076
You have 30 seconds left.

1805
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,178
Isn't that way too greasy, Poong?

1806
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,880
No, it's not a lot of oil.

1807
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,849
YOU'RE IMAGINING IT

1808
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:57,019
I'm curious what Chef Ji-sun is doing
with this <i>tteok.</i>

1809
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,521
They slowly begin to serve the food.
Fifteen seconds.

1810
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:02,357
-We can do this, Korea!
-What's Poong doing?

1811
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,294
-We can do this, Korea!
-Ten. Nine.

1812
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,296
OPENS THE STEAMER!

1813
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,565
-We can do this, Korea!
-Ten.

1814
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:12,401
-We got this!
-Nine. Eight.

1815
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,403
-I can do this!
-Seven.

1816
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,204
-I can do this!
-Seven. Six.

1817
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,940
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1818
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,108
-Three. Two.
-The pepperoni pieces!

1819
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,910
-Five. Four.
-Five. Four.

1820
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,745
JI-SUN JUST NEEDS TO SERVE SONGPYEON

1821
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,247
-Two!
-Oh, no.

1822
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,049
-That's time!
-Ji-sun is done.

1823
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:28,784
Ji-sun finishes first.

1824
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,386
TIME'S UP!

1825
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,755
What are you going to do about this?

1826
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,290
Is this really in the right state?

1827
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,192
Is this right?

1828
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,760
-Are you sure?
-Are you done?

1829
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,195
COULD'VE DONE BETTER

1830
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,931
-He still has two lotus root pieces.
-Two pieces.

1831
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,435
Shouldn't you have fished out everything?

1832
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,071
-Great work.
-Great work.

1833
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,607
THE PROUD(?) K-INGREDIENT ROUND IS OVER!

1834
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,142
-My gosh.
-That's all that went in?

1835
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,677
But the <i>siraegi</i> tastes okay.

1836
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:57,512
-Something came of it.
-It did.

1837
01:16:57,579 --> 01:17:00,949
-It's the bare minimum that a dish can be.
-The bare minimum?

1838
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,018
He managed to make
the bare minimum of a dish.

1839
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:06,922
And now, both dishes are ready,

1840
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:10,592
filling the order
for K-ingredient for the world: <i>Siraegi.</i>

1841
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,261
There are two dishes on the table.

1842
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:17,265
But the atmosphere around our guests
seems rather serious.

1843
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,537
They continue to look at the dishes
with caution in their eyes,

1844
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:25,173
especially one of the two.

1845
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,342
Your opinion may change once you try it.

1846
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,045
Chef Ji-sun finished cooking first.

1847
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,446
<i>Siraegi Tteok</i> to the Moon.

1848
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,881
SIRAEGI SONGPYEON
WITH PERSIMMONS AND DATES

1849
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:36,585
SIRAEGI RADISH TTEOK
WITH PYOGO BULGOGI

1850
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:41,623
CHEF JUNG JI-SUN'S
SIRAEGI TTEOK TO THE MOON

1851
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,326
She served <i>songpyeon</i>
and what looks like <i>jeon.</i>

1852
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,295
-There are two types, right?
-Yes.

1853
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:48,797
How should they eat these?

1854
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,233
-The steamed one? <i>Songpyeon?</i>
-Try the <i>songpyeon</i> first. Yes.

1855
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,501
-The steamed one first?
-Yes.

1856
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,236
-<i>Songpyeon</i> first.
-The steamed one first.

1857
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:58,006
She said it's shaped
just like the <i>songpyeon</i>

1858
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,275
her mother-in-law used to make.

1859
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,678
This dish may feel more familiar to them.

1860
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,547
Will <i>siraegi songpyeon</i>
also make a good impression abroad?

1861
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,416
WILL IT CATCH THE WORLD'S ATTENTION?

1862
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,551
Will it be a success?

1863
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:11,453
They tried a piece.

1864
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,122
-It's not too hot, is it?
-It should be fine.

1865
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:17,025
-A big bite.
-It has dried persimmons and dates inside

1866
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,361
-for a sweet bite.
-I see, dried persimmon and date.

1867
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,530
HMM?

1868
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:24,266
-It's different from what I expected.
-Is it?

1869
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,802
This is much better
than regular old <i>tteok</i>.

1870
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,737
-The outer layer.
-Yes, I like this better

1871
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:32,641
-than just the regular rice cake layer.
-Instead of an all-white layer.

1872
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,211
-It must be better with <i>siraegi.</i>
-He prefers it with <i>siraegi.</i>

1873
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,481
At first, it seemed odd to me.

1874
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,216
-But it's not so bad.
-Instead…

1875
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,252
Instead of blending it in
just to add color to the rice cake,

1876
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,888
this is much better
because it gives it more texture.

1877
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,557
RELIEVED

1878
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:52,527
I wonder if the filling is playing a part.

1879
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,664
Dried persimmons and dates
taste delicious just as they are.

1880
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,033
This one is pretty sweet to begin with,

1881
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,634
having dried persimmons and dates inside.

1882
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,403
-Kids…
-It's better than <i>songpyeon</i> with beans.

1883
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,805
Kids would love sweet <i>songpyeon </i>like this.

1884
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,941
It doesn't smell too strong,
so it should be okay.

1885
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,642
-It's good.
-It may feel sticky

1886
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,978
and get stuck on your teeth.

1887
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,314
-That's <i>tteok.</i>
-That's how <i>tteok</i> is.

1888
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,316
-That's a given, right?
-On the contrary,

1889
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:17,285
the <i>siraegi </i>plays a part
in making it less sticky.

1890
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:20,222
Yes, of course.
They're another element in the <i>tteok</i>.

1891
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,390
-It's good.
-He says it's delicious.

1892
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,793
-He had a whole piece.
-Yes.

1893
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,629
-Radish <i>tteok.</i> Is that it?
-Yes.

1894
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:28,830
This is <i>siraegi</i> and radish <i>tteok.</i>

1895
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:33,401
I mixed rice powder by using the moisture
from the radish before steaming it.

1896
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:36,438
-Radish and <i>siraegi.</i>
-And <i>siraegi.</i>

1897
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,640
-<i>Pyogo</i> mushroom.
-A bit of <i>pyogo</i>.

1898
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:41,343
-It's just in the meat, right?
-Yes, I used just a little.

1899
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,912
If you sense too much <i>pyogo</i>,
feel free to say so.

1900
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,984
She steamed <i>siraegi</i> and radish <i>tteok,</i>
and then griddled it once again.

1901
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,385
MMM

1902
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,621
UTTERLY NERVOUS

1903
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,991
Griddling these added so much flavor.

1904
01:19:56,057 --> 01:20:00,128
It brings out more flavor when you fry,
as opposed to just steaming.

1905
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,497
There are all kinds of <i>jeon</i> we eat
during the holidays,

1906
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:06,134
-and I think these will sell well.
-I see. It has a competitive edge.

1907
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,370
It tastes a bit peculiar.

1908
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,604
Peculiar?

1909
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,173
UNFAMILIAR AND PECULIAR

1910
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,375
Can you taste <i>siraegi</i> in it?

1911
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,244
-Yes, very subtly.
-Subtly.

1912
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:19,481
-The radish tastes much stronger.
-The radish.

1913
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:23,018
-But he likes radish.
-He does?

1914
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,287
-Yes.
-All right.

1915
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:28,089
It's time to try
Webtoon Artist Poong's dish.

1916
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:32,027
SIRAEGI AND BRACKET STIR-FRY
ON TOP OF SCORCHED RICE DOUGH

1917
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:36,064
TOPPED WITH PEPPERONI PIECES
MADE WITH FRIED LOTUS ROOT IN BEET BATTER

1918
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:40,969
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S
LEE JAE-MYUNG PIZZA

1919
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,839
-May I slice it for you?
-I wonder what it's like.

1920
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:46,708
Sure. It looks mind-boggling to start.

1921
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:49,411
Let me slice it and serve it separately.

1922
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:52,013
-Will you slice it like pizza pieces?
-Yes.

1923
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,082
He really brought that.

1924
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,483
He's cutting it like pizza.

1925
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,152
ROLLING

1926
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,987
-Does it cut?
-Of course.

1927
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,356
-She asked if it actually cuts through.
-Yes, it does.

1928
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:02,757
Surprisingly enough, it does.

1929
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,226
One pepperoni piece each.

1930
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:05,627
All done.

1931
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,362
CUT INTO BIG SLICES

1932
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,664
Can you cut it into smaller pieces?

1933
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:11,700
Even smaller?

1934
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:15,170
-The President has made a request.
-He says the slice is too big.

1935
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:18,940
-Can you cut it into a smaller piece?
-Yes, of course. I can do that.

1936
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,942
I can blend it for you if you wish.

1937
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,310
TALKING NONSENSE

1938
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,846
You can't tell him
that he's supposed to eat it like this.

1939
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:29,017
You can only eat this
here on <i>Chef & My Fridge.</i>

1940
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,285
-One and only.
-Yes.

1941
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,821
-I've never seen anything like it.
-It's a first.

1942
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,490
He did shape the dish like pizza.

1943
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:37,158
It's actually rice.

1944
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,593
CRISP

1945
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:42,264
He tries the lotus root piece
that has been dyed.

1946
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:44,299
OH?

1947
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,802
SURPRISED

1948
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,474
-It's different from how it looks.
-What's kind of reaction was that?

1949
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,877
KIM POONG'S MAGIC TAKING EFFECT?

1950
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,612
-Different from how it looks.
-Kim Poong magic.

1951
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,781
He tried the lotus root first.

1952
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:03,451
<i>He blended beet into the frying batter,</i>
<i>and deep-fried the lotus root pieces.</i>

1953
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,457
We should turn this
into a standalone product.

1954
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,861
Poong, he says the lotus root
made to look like pepperoni

1955
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,130
should be turned
into a standalone product.

1956
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:16,031
Is that so?

1957
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,266
-That's all he has tried for now.
-All right.

1958
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,435
NEXT IS THE SIRAEGI
AND SCORCHED RICE DOUGH

1959
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:23,672
-And now, <i>siraegi.</i> This is it.
-This is important.

1960
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,441
He can call himself a big <i>siraegi</i> fan.

1961
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,445
The texture is very important.

1962
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:32,013
Is it a familiar texture?

1963
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,584
What's going on?

1964
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,853
WHISPERING
ISN'T IT GOOD?

1965
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:41,122
DID KIM POONG PULL OFF ANOTHER KIM POONG?

1966
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,824
I didn't need to feel repulsed.

1967
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,926
-Why is this so good?
-Right?

1968
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:46,695
-He didn't need to feel repulsed.
-No.

1969
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:49,464
-The process wasn't all right at all.
-No.

1970
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,800
Does it taste all right?

1971
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:53,168
-It's not so bad.
-Not so bad?

1972
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,202
Is it seasoned well?

1973
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:55,737
-It's good.
-It's seasoned well too.

1974
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,872
I told you. He seasons his food well.

1975
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,475
The scorched rice is crunchy.

1976
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,912
I don't know if it was the mashing,
but the <i>siraegi</i> is very tender.

1977
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,514
All I can feel is the crunchiness.

1978
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:10,118
I thought it'd be way too greasy
when he poured too much oil in.

1979
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:11,453
-But it's not.
-Not greasy at all.

1980
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,354
No, right?

1981
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:15,623
-He means the scorched rice dough.
-Yes.

1982
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,826
-It's such a surprise.
-He keeps eating it.

1983
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:19,327
He might eat it all!

1984
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:21,463
SIRAEGI PIZZA IS ABOUT TO SELL OUT

1985
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,999
-What's going on?
-It's delicious.

1986
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,835
-It's delicious.
-He says it's delicious!

1987
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:28,636
KIM POONG'S MAGIC EVEN WORKED ON THEM?

1988
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,705
-Is this the Kim Poong magic?
-Yes.

1989
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,174
I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS

1990
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:37,012
It didn't seem planned.
Why is this so good?

1991
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:39,581
Everything came out

1992
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:42,183
just as I planned
without an inch of disparity.

1993
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:47,055
I believe <i>siraegi</i> and bracken
are a great combination.

1994
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,090
So if we mix the two,

1995
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,760
steam them or mash them tenderly
just like pulled pork,

1996
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:54,796
can the product, and export that,

1997
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,664
it can be used as a spread.

1998
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:59,634
It'll also go well with baguette.

1999
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,536
-I see.
-Yes.

2000
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:04,272
You were already thinking of a product

2001
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,007
-and exporting it.
-As a major industry exporter,

2002
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,777
I am willing to ride
on a cargo ship tomorrow.

2003
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,246
Are you touting for yourself?

2004
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,282
It looks like he has a chance.

2005
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:17,285
It's not pizza, but it's siraegi pizza
in the shape of pizza.

2006
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:18,853
HE FINISHES THE LAST PIECE

2007
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,823
-The President has finished everything.
-He finished it.

2008
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,425
It was more delicious than I thought.

2009
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:27,228
-You keep craving more, right?
-Yes.

2010
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,597
You can keep craving for more.

2011
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:32,767
-I'm seeing you in a new light now.
-There's been a turn of events.

2012
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,135
There's been a turn of events.

2013
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,137
-Can we come to a decision?
-Yes, we should.

2014
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,173
-This is a tough one.
-I'm sure.

2015
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,609
<i>Press one for Chef Jung Ji-sun</i>
<i>and her </i>Siraegi Tteok <i>to the Moon.</i>

2016
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,978
<i>And press two for Kim Poong.</i>

2017
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,214
Press two for Kim Poong
and his Lee Jae-myung Pizza.

2018
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:48,149
THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THE NAME

2019
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,385
-Let's change it to Best Pizza.
-Best Pizza.

2020
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:53,021
-It must be too big of a burden.
-Best Pizza of Your Life.

2021
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,090
He might have to choose you
because of his name.

2022
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:57,392
Well, he said <i>Jae</i> stood for fortune.

2023
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,861
If I win, I'll offer you some royalties
for your name.

2024
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,031
I'm tempted.

2025
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:06,701
You used his name,
so you're offering a royalty? All right.

2026
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,771
Please make your decision
and press the button!

2027
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:11,840
The whole world is watching right now.

2028
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,708
Is the result out?

2029
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,277
-Goodness.
-I can't believe this.

2030
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,378
It must be one to one.

2031
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,546
They have made

2032
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,915
-the same choice!
-Oh, my.

2033
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,087
We have the result, then.

2034
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:27,422
My goodness.

2035
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,923
FEELING BAD AND CRYING(?)

2036
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,025
-This is a huge blow for one of them.
-A big blow.

2037
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:33,695
Who was chosen?

2038
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,530
Let's find out the result!

2039
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:36,865
Show us!

2040
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:39,934
-It's hard to tell.
-K-ingredient for the world.

2041
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:42,971
Chef Ji-sun has currently won
all seven rounds she fought.

2042
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:46,007
However, Poong is ready
to get his revenge.

2043
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:50,111
Which one was chosen unanimously?

2044
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:52,614
What's the result?

2045
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,083
Whose <i>siraegi</i> dish is it?

2046
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,584
Who won?

2047
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,785
Who won?

2048
01:25:57,852 --> 01:26:00,054
KIM POONG WINS

2049
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:02,190
KIM POONG'S LEE JAE-MYUNG PIZZA WINS

2050
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:03,391
-Kim Poong wins!
-Poong!

2051
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:06,361
THE KIM POONG MAGIC WORKED!

2052
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,664
Ji-sun loses her winning streak…

2053
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,500
CONGRATS

2054
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:16,037
-…and Poong finally got his revenge.
-Is he crying?

2055
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:19,841
I was surprised
when I got a taste during the check.

2056
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:25,013
<i>It's hard to imagine what butter,</i> siraegi<i>,</i>
<i>and perilla oil tastes like.</i>

2057
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:27,015
But it's really good.

2058
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:29,417
-The topic was <i>siraegi</i>.
-Yes.

2059
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:31,786
And the theme really came through.

2060
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,955
-You could see lots of the <i>siraegi.</i>
-Yes.

2061
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,458
He seemed mischievous while cooking,
but the taste was far from funny.

2062
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,360
WIDE-EYED

2063
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,729
THANK YOU

2064
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:45,133
I didn't know there would be such
a big upset on an occasion like today.

2065
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,637
We had K-food cook-offs today
as a part of our Chuseok special

2066
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,941
with the President and the First Lady.

2067
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:56,544
Do you have any final words
for our viewers?

2068
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:59,113
We have two big holidays a year,
Lunar New Year and Chuseok,

2069
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,982
but Chuseok always feels more abundant.

2070
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,884
I hope you enjoy time with family

2071
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,420
and find new hope

2072
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,288
in the Chuseok holiday.

2073
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:09,390
And <i>siraegi</i> is especially great for you.

2074
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,859
Yes, please enjoy lots of <i>siraegi.</i>

2075
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:15,163
This means President Lee will put a star

2076
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,333
on Webtoon Artist Poong.

2077
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,235
May he name the dish with your name?

2078
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,804
-Can he use Lee Jae-myung Pizza?
-Of course.

2079
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,672
-We need to get his consent.
-We do.

2080
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,175
That's wonderful.
Please put a star on him!

2081
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,912
Webtoon Artist Poong receives
a valuable star

2082
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,047
-from the President!
-With Lee Jae-myung Pizza?

2083
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,783
-You're a true talent.
-Please put a star on Poong!

2084
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,787
Congratulations, Poong!

2085
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,289
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

2086
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,626
An actor of <i>The Roundup,</i>
who grossed 40 million audiences.

2087
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:46,961
He looks way too handsome now.

2088
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,264
People want to know what I eat
to rejuvenate my organs.

2089
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,200
-I've been eating that for six years.
-Six years?

2090
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,936
I eat that when I become forgetful,
and then I remember again.

2091
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,371
I was broke,

2092
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,539
-but I got money after that.
-You got paid?

2093
01:27:58,606 --> 01:27:59,607
That's intriguing.

2094
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:00,942
Should I order some?

2095
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,544
Who'll seize the victory
without using a knife?

2096
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:04,879
CRUSHING GARLIC WITH HIS PALM

2097
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,848
Sung-jun continues without hesitating.

2098
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:08,349
He's such an artist.

2099
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,852
-Both hands!
-Double scissors!

2100
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,220
<i>He's cutting everything!</i>

2101
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,454
THE BEST WAY TO USE SCISSORS

2102
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:14,822
WHO'LL WIN THE SCISSORS ROUND?

2103
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,224
One shall live, the other shall die.

2104
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,092
It's such an honor, Boss!

2105
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,496
Who will be the number two
for the boss, Park Ji-hwan?

2106
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:23,865
-It's on fire.
-That's so cruel.

2107
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:25,967
-A fire show.
-It's a fire show!

2108
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:28,703
His eyes are on Tae-hun!

2109
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,338
Who'll be the number two?

2110
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:34,075
-This is driving me crazy.
-It's driving him crazy!

2111
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:39,547
-Watch it! You're with the boss!
-I'm sorry.

2112
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,282
-You punk!
-I'm sorry, Boss!

2113
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:43,384
-I'm sorry!
-Are you trying to kill him?
