1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,051
A makeover project
for your most unhinged leftovers.

2
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,855
The best chefs in Korea will
turn your fridge inside out.

3
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,957
The classy cooking show has returned.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,160
<i>-Chef & My Fridge!</i>
<i>-My Fridge!</i>

5
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,431
Welcome to the show.

6
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,435
The studio is full today.

7
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,738
We're here
with a few more chefs than usual.

8
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,342
Do you remember our previous team round?

9
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,111
<i>Our viewers loved it.</i>

10
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,881
2 VERSUS 2 ROUND IS FUN!
PLEASE DO ANOTHER TEAM ROUND!

11
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,450
So, we plan to do a team round

12
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:54,521
between two teams
of the viewers' favorite pairs.

13
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,223
We can't tell you
who the pairs will be at this point.

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,760
If the teams were formed
by the viewers' favorites,

15
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,730
the most strongest pair,
the dream pair must've been

16
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,932
Chef Jong-won and myself.

17
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,734
-The unsinkable.
-They're too good.

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,702
I'm sorry,
but did you forget to dry your hair?

19
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,704
WET

20
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,506
-He copied Young-kwang.
-It's Young-kwang.

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,241
MY DEAR YOUNG-KWANG

22
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,210
-He copied his hairstyle.
-Wait.

23
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,112
Kim Young-kwang the soccer player?

24
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,382
It's probably our first time
seeing these two on our show.

25
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,618
It's Chef Lu Chinglai and Park Eun-yeong,
the master and his protégé.

26
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,488
-The first time they're side by side.
-That's right.

27
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,223
You two go way back, right?

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,459
-It's been over a decade.
-Over a decade.

29
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,260
-My gosh.
-Ten years?

30
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,130
<i>I met him first at school</i>
<i>during my university years,</i>

31
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,300
<i>-and my first job was under him.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

32
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,601
My father is still alive,

33
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,838
but I consider him my father
when it comes to Chinese cuisine.

34
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,439
A teacher who's like a father.

35
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,908
-He is your teacher-turned-master.
-A master.

36
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,111
I know that she respects him very much.

37
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,479
One thing about me

38
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,647
is that I have an obsession with symmetry.

39
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,585
-And she's sitting closer to Jong-won.
-No, wait.

40
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,853
Is it just her instinct?

41
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,987
-You're right.
-No, it's the chair.

42
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,055
What?

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,389
-You're right.
-No, it's the chair.

44
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,024
Is she instinctively avoiding him?

45
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,260
Recently, Chef Hyun-suk said something

46
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,062
toward Chef Eun-yeong.

47
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,698
"There's no discipline
in the world of Chinese cuisine."

48
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,899
He said that!

49
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,468
-He said that when Woo-jin was here.
-He did say that.

50
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,972
Chef Chinglai would say things like,
"Eun-yeong, light the stove."

51
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,440
And I'd teach him.

52
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,109
He usually teaches just by talking.

53
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,411
There's no discipline
in the world of Chinese cuisine.

54
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,480
-She said you only took pictures.
-I didn't.

55
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,815
-I didn't say that.
-We heard it.

56
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,484
The conductor conducts.
He does not perform.

57
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,288
<i>Chef Chinglai's words and orders</i>
<i>are the recipe and the process of cooking.</i>

58
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,422
You're right.

59
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,024
You're the best, Hyun-suk.

60
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,027
-You expected this attitude from her.
-Right.

61
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,863
-There are demons and evil spirits here.
-I guess the protégé feels that way.

62
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,699
She's doing her best
to come up with an excuse.

63
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,835
She's breaking out in a cold sweat.

64
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:53,072
We've invited yet another two guests
who let us borrow their fridges.

65
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,642
You'll see that
they're very good-looking individuals.

66
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,777
Who are today's guests?

67
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,612
Let us present them. Come on out!

68
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,918
-Please welcome our two guests!
-They're here.

69
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,887
AMAZED

70
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,422
-Our two guests!
-They're here.

71
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,391
The two magically charming actors!

72
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:15,595
Please welcome Kwon Yul and Kim Jae-wook!

73
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,665
<i>He can make your heart race</i>
<i>in romantic comedies,</i>

74
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,767
<i>or he can give you chills as a psychopath.</i>

75
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,904
<i>He's an actor who captures the viewers</i>
<i>with his unexpected charms.</i>

76
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,440
-Please welcome Kwon Yul!
-Hello.

77
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,210
-Welcome to the show.
-It's great to be here. I'm Kwon Yul.

78
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,844
Let me present the next guest.

79
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,913
He's no longer the Coffee Prince,

80
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,015
-but the sexy prince.
-Yes.

81
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,751
Please welcome the fatally charming
and sexy, Kim Jae-wook!

82
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,819
Please welcome Jae-wook!

83
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,256
-Hi, I'm Kim Jae-wook. Happy to be here.
-He's so cool.

84
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,658
-The sexy prince?
-The sexy prince.

85
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>Coffee Prince</i> aired ages ago.

86
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,496
-But he still looks the same.
-He does.

87
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,465
-Goodness.
-Yes, tell me about it.

88
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,500
You look happy, Eun-yeong.

89
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,835
I'm having fun today.

90
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,303
GIGGLING

91
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,972
-We haven't started.
-What's so fun?

92
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,740
-What's so fun?
-We just introduced them.

93
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,675
The distance is growing wider.

94
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,445
-It's even wider.
-You'll soon end up right next to him.

95
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm just having fun.

96
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,083
-Do you want to switch seats?
-It's fun.

97
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,218
We're happy to hear that you're happy.

98
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,053
HAPPINESS GOES VIRAL

99
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,222
Is there a special reason
that brings you to the show?

100
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,927
-Yul and I are in a play together,
-I see.

101
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,364
and we want to tell people all about it.

102
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,367
-It's a play called <i>Amadeus.</i>
<i>-Amadeus.</i>

103
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,868
<i>It's about Mozart, the genius,</i>

104
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,705
<i>the life of his story</i>
<i>as observed by Salieri.</i>

105
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,407
Who's Salieri and who's Mozart?

106
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,710
-We're both playing Salieri.
-You are?

107
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,312
We did the premiere on the 16th,

108
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,848
and the play will continue
until November 23rd.

109
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,385
Yul, I hear this is the first play
you're starring in since your debut.

110
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,320
-Is that so?
-Yes, you're right.

111
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,722
I was a theater arts major,

112
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,025
but it's my first time
starring in mainstream theater.

113
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,127
I'm going through a lot right now.

114
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,963
We received information about Jae-wook.

115
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,433
He saw how distressed
and troubled Yul was about the play

116
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,036
and got a kick out of it.

117
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,004
You got a kick out of
seeing Yul in distress?

118
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,139
What happened?

119
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,709
Actually, the role we're playing is hard,
even for experienced stage actors.

120
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,944
But he bravely chose this role

121
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,580
and regretted his decision immediately.

122
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,616
I'm still regretting it now.

123
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,819
-We've begun, but the regret continues.
-Even though you've begun?

124
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,521
It hasn't been long since the premiere.

125
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,756
I said this the most often
over the last two months.

126
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,459
-"Something has gone wrong."
-"Something has gone wrong."

127
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,161
I said that the most often.

128
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,798
But no one forced you into this.
Wasn't it your choice?

129
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,733
I don't know where it went wrong.

130
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,636
I'm sure there's one thing
that's the hardest for you

131
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,838
as you play in this production.

132
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,773
The play is 150 minutes long,

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,475
-Gosh, 150 minutes?
-and I'm on the stage

134
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,378
for about 140, no, about 143 minutes.

135
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,815
So our lines take up around 200 pages.

136
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,718
-A hundred sheets.
-That's a lot.

137
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,520
Salieri stays on the stage at all times.

138
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,822
Do you not change your costume?

139
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,590
-It happens on the stage.
-On the stage.

140
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,492
Have you made a mistake yet?

141
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,527
-Any mistakes?
-I made one yesterday.

142
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,564
-Theater is physically grueling.
-It is.

143
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,999
And your production crew
took my fridge yesterday,

144
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,468
so I couldn't eat breakfast.

145
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,003
All I had was a single banana,

146
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,840
-which kept my energy level low.
-I see.

147
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,377
We took your fridge
on the day before your performance?

148
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,444
It's an odd coincidence.

149
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,080
So I must be more entertaining today

150
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,982
to make up for the mistake
I made yesterday.

151
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,084
FULL OF SPIRIT

152
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,520
This means you two must memorize

153
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,022
and perform the same lines, correct?

154
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,724
-Yes.
-You two have the same role.

155
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,428
Can you two try exchanging lines
between each other

156
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,397
without stopping in the middle?

157
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,233
-Wait, we have to listen for 140 minutes?
-No!

158
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,567
THAT WILL BE THE DAY…

159
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,302
Yul can start it off.

160
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,104
I won't tell you which part it is.

161
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,173
OUT OF 200 PAGES?

162
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,542
Like perfect choreography
of an idol group.

163
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,877
IN-SYNC PERFORMANCE

164
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,078
-Like the group dance.
-Yes!

165
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,881
-They can jump in at any time.
-Yes, it's reflexive for them.

166
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,082
THE RANDOM PLAY THEATER STARTS

167
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,718
"As you can see,
in the 18th century, musicians like us

168
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,255
were a kind of elegant servant
who served the needs of aristocrats."

169
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,024
"We used our talents to make money."

170
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,460
"No, let me rephrase that."

171
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,931
"Allow me to say we used our talents
to bring beauty into ordinary lives."

172
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,332
It's his turn.

173
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,502
Should I go? Is it my turn?

174
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,204
He's stalling for time.

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,039
-He stalls for time.
-Wasn't that enough?

176
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,308
-No way.
-You should've done one more round.

177
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,910
-He's stalling.
-He's stalling for time.

178
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,411
Something must've gone wrong.

179
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,813
Did you forget? No stalling.

180
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,781
-Should I go right away?
-Yes.

181
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,483
"Artists like us

182
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,787
have brought grace and beauty
into insignificant human lives."

183
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,124
"We softened them
with a string orchestra."

184
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,560
"And that, in turn,
added vitality to their nights."

185
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,195
"A march for their march."

186
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,463
"A serenade for love."

187
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,831
"Horns for hunting."

188
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,233
"And we've even provided drums for war."

189
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,535
"Trumpets celebrate their birth."

190
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,206
"And trombones cry a long note
as they pass away."

191
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,242
My gosh! That was so cool!

192
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,510
PERFORMANCE PERFECTLY IN SYNC

193
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,744
That was so cool.

194
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,613
LOOKING COOL

195
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,381
The short exchanges were amazing.

196
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,551
-"The unstoppable…"
-Okay. We get it. Enough.

197
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,654
We get it, Yul. You're good.

198
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,690
-They're good.
-The expectation is rising.

199
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,458
He's got great sense for variety shows.

200
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,694
I have a question.
If you have too many lines,

201
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,830
do you sometimes end up
reciting later lines much earlier?

202
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,332
If you have plans after,

203
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,001
-Yes, right.
-you can edit out this much and end it.

204
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,369
Salieri can always end the play.

205
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,172
-Those who haven't seen it wouldn't know.
-No.

206
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,708
There are times
when I want to die as soon as I appear.

207
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,378
SALIERI IS LEAVING EARLY TODAY

208
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,747
-The play can't continue without Salieri.
-No.

209
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,083
I just realized that Yul

210
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,619
was born into a family
that's in the restaurant business.

211
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:44,390
His mother runs a Korean restaurant.

212
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,559
She had a different restaurant
when I was younger,

213
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,927
The Korean restaurant was around

214
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,595
-for about 20 years.
-That's a long time.

215
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,798
-Twenty years just in Korean cuisine?
-I frequented his mother's restaurant.

216
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,333
-Really?
-What do you mean?

217
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,669
I've been going there
since I was in my 20s.

218
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,105
-But I didn't know.
-I also found out just recently.

219
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,172
You didn't know that?

220
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,775
-I didn't. No.
-Yul didn't tell you about it?

221
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,779
Can you recommend
a few dishes from the restaurant?

222
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,416
-I believe oyster <i>bossam</i> is her best dish.
-Oyster <i>bossam?</i>

223
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,752
-I want to go. I'm curious.
-It sounds good.

224
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,253
I personally love stir-fried octopus

225
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,255
-and seasoned acorn jelly.
-Acorn jelly.

226
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,224
-Octopuses are good
-It's so delicious.

227
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,359
I don't get to eat those dishes.

228
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,128
-Why not?
-Does he not eat oysters?

229
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,229
You're her son.

230
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,799
She tells me to order something else
if it's too complicated to make.

231
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,467
That makes sense.

232
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,170
-That can happen.
-"My son, you must eat something else."

233
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,807
She usually recommends dishes
that are easier to make.

234
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,677
-It's the restaurant owner's son problems.
-Sounds plausible.

235
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,214
-His fridge is rather special because…
-Really?

236
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,251
he recently got married this May.

237
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,653
-He's a newlywed groom.
-He's a newlywed.

238
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,622
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

239
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,690
Congratulations.

240
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,291
I want to get married too.

241
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,528
-So we get to see the newlyweds' fridge.
-You're right.

242
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,330
You must be happy, right?

243
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,498
-Yes, I am.
-I see.

244
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,167
What kind of question is that?

245
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,170
What do I ask then?
Should I ask, "Do you feel anxious?"

246
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,272
Of course, he'll say he's happy.

247
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,807
I almost said I felt anxious.

248
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,675
THE GUY WHO RUNS WITH EVERYTHING

249
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,077
You play along with everything.

250
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,145
FEELING PROUD

251
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,548
-He must've been dying to do that.
-Today's huge.

252
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,250
-His improvisation is on fire.
-I love it.

253
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:22,188
Why don't we take a look
at the newlywed couple's fridge?

254
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,158
-I'm not sure if we're allowed to see it.
-Don't you think?

255
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,861
-Three months, hot from the wedding.
-Three months.

256
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,298
It's probably cool because it's a fridge.

257
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,567
-I'm sure it's chilled.
-Sure.

258
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,936
His wife must be…

259
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,005
-He was trying to make a joke.
-Chilled.

260
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,573
We said their marriage is still hot.

261
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,575
I was going to call it <i>hiyashi</i>.

262
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,976
HIYASHI:
CHILLED BEVERAGE IN JAPANESE

263
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,145
I hesitated a bit.

264
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,180
WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT SENSE

265
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,017
The fridge of a newlywed couple
three months married.

266
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,085
-We present Yul's fridge!
-Fridge!

267
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,988
-It's so neat.
-It is.

268
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,424
-Goodness.
-It's so neat.

269
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,626
-It is.
-This is his fridge.

270
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,062
-I can see that they're newlyweds.
-Me too.

271
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,864
I can see it.

272
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,299
Look at all these containers

273
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,834
and cans lined up neatly.

274
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:09,902
It's easy to dispense.

275
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,571
-I keep thinking about it.
-The fridge has you all over it.

276
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,674
-This thing spins.
-My gosh!

277
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,042
-That's useful.
-Sauces.

278
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,343
This is new.

279
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,478
Look at how all these are upside down.

280
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,547
-Very easy to use.
-Right?

281
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,883
Did you do this yourself?
Or was it your wife?

282
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,186
-I did everything myself.
-I see.

283
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,922
I'm the type who likes
to keep things organized.

284
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,258
You can tell his family is
in the restaurant business.

285
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,593
I can see kimchi on the first shelf,

286
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,429
as well as white kimchi.

287
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:41,167
That's the white kimchi
my mother uses at her restaurant.

288
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,203
-You must've had it.
-It is. I have it all the time.

289
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,706
Do you also receive<i> jang,</i>
Korean condiments, from her?

290
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,309
-Those were homemade by my father.
-What?

291
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,311
-His father?
-He made <i>jang?</i>

292
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,214
-He makes <i>jang?</i>
-Is he also well-versed in culinary arts?

293
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,317
He studied chemistry as a college student,

294
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,552
so it's not just <i>jang.</i>

295
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,722
He even makes soap and shampoo himself.

296
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,424
He has a hobby of making these things.

297
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,293
He even made <i>jang</i>?

298
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,129
He buys fermented soybean blocks
and makes it.

299
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,331
<i>-He's a total chemist.</i>
<i>-He even hangs it to dry?</i>

300
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,767
Yes. He knows the accurate ratio
of the mixes.

301
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,969
-He must be accurate.
-Yes, he's good at that.

302
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,071
-If it isn't a problem…
-Yes?

303
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,207
May we evaluate his <i>jang?</i>

304
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,542
-Of course.
-We'll let the chefs taste it.

305
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:28,147
Is it different when it's made by someone
who has a background in chemistry?

306
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,216
Please see
if it's different from the usual.

307
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,450
Try some, Jae-wook.

308
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,953
It's not very rich.
It's on the lighter side.

309
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,122
Please try some.

310
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,957
It has that orthodox taste,

311
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,658
-but it's lighter.
-Yes.

312
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,328
Does it taste lighter?
So it's not too rich?

313
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,430
Most doenjang taste savory,

314
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:49,034
but this one is so refreshing that
it can even be used as salad dressing.

315
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,169
It's refreshing.

316
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,005
He likes the clean and light flavor.

317
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,842
I see <i>jang-jorim,</i> a braised side dish.
Who is it by? Your mother or father?

318
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,513
The person who lives with me.

319
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,614
AKA HIS WIFE

320
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,315
-It was her.
-"Wife" must still feel odd.

321
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,917
His wife made this.

322
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,919
She tried it for the first time,

323
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,488
so I'd say it was a 50% success.

324
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,223
-It was a 50% success?
-A half.

325
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,460
-Did you have to eat it out of love?
-Well…

326
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,961
Yes, sure.

327
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,730
He can't lie.

328
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,698
-Then we won't try this.
-Okay.

329
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,434
-That's an excellent choice.
-All right.

330
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,003
It'll make everyone awkward.

331
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,639
You were so eloquent so far,
but you began to stutter

332
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,040
when mention of your wife came up.

333
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,676
-Next, I'm seeing some cola.
-Okay. Moving on.

334
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,011
We have some too.

335
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,280
The third shelf.
Sesame sauce. Black sesame sauce,

336
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,983
chipotle sauce, sriracha,
and <i>katsuobushi</i> sauce.

337
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,586
Do you use lots of sauces to cook?

338
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,824
I'm the type
who likes to use only basic condiments.

339
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,160
-But my partner, yes.
-She likes sauces?

340
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,131
-I see.
-I rarely even eat ketchup.

341
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,099
Which one of these do you like?

342
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,135
I use <i>katsuobushi</i> often.

343
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,604
-<i>Katsuobushi </i>sauce.
-That sauce. Here's the thing.

344
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,773
I have baked fish cake at home.

345
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,908
Yes, it's in the freezer.

346
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,712
It's been baked, not fried,
so it's lower in calories

347
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,181
and has about six grams of protein.

348
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,186
So I mix 500 ml of water,
2 tbsp of <i>katsuobushi</i> sauce,

349
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,755
and boil five pieces of fish cake.

350
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,958
That adds up to about 30 g of protein,

351
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,429
so that's more than chicken breast,
which carries about 23 to 27 g of protein.

352
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,398
You don't get sick of it
if you take your protein like that.

353
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,134
It's a good part of your diet,
and you can eat it as a snack.

354
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,670
I thought you had studied chemistry
as you spoke right now.

355
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,207
He has a detailed breakdown
of the numbers.

356
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,976
Do you also enjoy vegetables?

357
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,446
You have napa cabbage,
cabbage, radish, and many more.

358
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:46,652
I prefer vegetables
such as cabbage, napa cabbage, or endives.

359
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,488
The kind that still tastes delicious
even when eaten fresh.

360
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,524
Something I can just dip in some sauce.

361
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,994
-You don't have much seafood.
-No.

362
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,196
I only have some cocktail shrimps.

363
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,298
He seems to prefer meat over seafood.

364
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,635
-I'm seeing some meat on this side.
-There are lots.

365
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,903
He carries a lot of meat.

366
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,170
This must be beef.

367
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,006
-He has pork too.
-He does.

368
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,775
Honestly speaking, I prefer pork.

369
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,479
But beef doesn't splatter oil
as much as pork when you cook it at home.

370
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,081
-So I can eat it and keep the place clean.
-You're a neat one.

371
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,951
Do you contemplate
what you'll make as you watch this?

372
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,186
That's why everyone is so serious.

373
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,623
-We need to know what he likes.
-I see.

374
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,625
So I usually eat pork outside.

375
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,727
I prepped the beef

376
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,996
into 150 g to 200 g pieces
to eat when I want to.

377
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,599
SO ELABORATE

378
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,735
-Did he say 150 g?
-It's strange that he knows the numbers.

379
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,171
-Do you have a scale at home?
-I do.

380
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,507
-He has a scale.
-The chemistry major's son.

381
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,741
He's very elaborate.

382
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,710
But I enjoy my food deliciously.

383
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,780
That was all for Yul's fridge,
The son of a restaurant business.

384
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,649
THANK YOU

385
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,185
It's fun to see
what other people have in their fridge.

386
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,154
I feel like I'm under search and seizure.

387
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,922
IT'LL HAPPEN TO HIM SOON

388
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,357
Search and seizure?

389
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,593
It's time to find out what his orders are.

390
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,197
Let us share the details of his orders.

391
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,365
Show us!

392
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,836
Chemistry between Dad's <i>jang</i> and me.

393
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,504
NOT JUST THE JANG, BUT ITS CHEMISTRY

394
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,775
I wanted to ask the chefs here
to make a delicious dish

395
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:22,214
by using the <i>jang</i> my father made
as a hobby and with love.

396
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,049
That sounds fun.

397
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,285
What's the second order?

398
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,154
-An ingenious dish to make Mozart cry.
-Mozart cry.

399
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,489
-That's hard.
-That's hard.

400
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,926
I'm actually asking for a freestyle round.

401
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,995
All these chefs here

402
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,732
are talented enough to make Mozart cry,

403
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,133
so although I do not have much,

404
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,138
I still want to ask you to show off
your brilliant talents.

405
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,041
I'm looking forward to this.

406
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,877
Chef Chinglai returned after a while,
so he gets the first choice.

407
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,046
-Which round do you prefer?
-The ingenious dish?

408
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,248
I'm a Chinese chef,

409
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,018
so I want to try using Korean <i>jang</i>

410
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,319
and make something.

411
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,021
HE PICKS DAD'S JANG ROUND

412
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,655
-The Korean-Chinese collab.
-Yes.

413
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,324
-That means…
-Then…

414
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,392
-One's decided.
-Yes.

415
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,327
-We should ask Chef Eun-yeong.
-We should.

416
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,497
I've never fought
Chef Chinglai before, so…

417
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,198
-You'll take him down?
-You're now on par?

418
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,469
-She'll drag him down for good.
-She's now on par.

419
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,904
-Yes.
-But honestly speaking,

420
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,141
I won't back down that easily.

421
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,477
This is a huge match.

422
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,380
That's the highlight of the day.

423
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,049
There are two more slots.

424
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,786
If you think you're a genius,
feel free to jump in.

425
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,087
FLINCHING

426
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,589
There's a guy who's flinching.

427
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,091
I do not think I'm a genius,

428
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,261
but I've seen many like Salie
who become jealous of me

429
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,096
-and talk behind my back.
-Salami?

430
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,831
Many Salie. Many Salieri.

431
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,866
-It's not Salad. It's Salieri.
-He doesn't know.

432
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,668
His name isn't Salami.

433
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,670
-Salieri.
-He's trying to say

434
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,539
he's the Mozart of chefs.

435
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,673
-I see.
-That's it, right?

436
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,741
So you're in?

437
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,342
I'm not saying I'm in.

438
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,344
I mast… I must do it.

439
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,347
-You mast do it?
-You mast.

440
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,918
He wanted something ingenious,
so the round calls for you, does it?

441
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,987
Hyun-suk takes a slot
for the ingenious round.

442
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,490
The ingenious round.

443
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,492
Who's going to fight him?

444
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,727
Hey, it's Ho-young!

445
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,831
I'm not a genius,
but someone who's hardworking.

446
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,433
-A hardworking genius.
-I'm not quite a genius yet.

447
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,435
-He's been doing well recently.
-He's gifted.

448
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,270
And your ranks are first and second.

449
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,405
-You're right.
-Yes.

450
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,240
I thought it was about time we fought.

451
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,911
So that's a round
between Mozart and Salieri.

452
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,947
All right, then. It's the first round.

453
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,282
-Lu Chinglai versus Park Eun-yeong.
-The big one.

454
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,384
Let the 15-minute cook-offs begin!

455
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,386
THE COOK-OFFS BEGIN!

456
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,825
<i>This is the first round played</i>
<i>with ingredients from Yul's fridge.</i>

457
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,496
The father of Chef Eun-yeong's career,
Chef Lu Chinglai,

458
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,198
is up against
his little girlie in the kitchen,

459
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,733
-Chef Park Eun-yeong.
-His little girl?

460
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,537
We're about to see
the first master-protégé round.

461
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,372
-Gosh.
-It's such an honor.

462
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,840
She must be nervous.

463
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,308
She's already nervous to death.

464
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:09,081
I believe you two have been
journeying together for over a decade.

465
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,049
I've become my own entity,

466
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,919
but I still consult Chef Chinglai
whenever I make big decisions.

467
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,023
I only feel at ease after I hear him say

468
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,360
that my decision
seems to be the right one.

469
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,828
-A true master.
-They're close.

470
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,198
I only have two biological sons
and no daughter,

471
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:30,002
so she was like my own,
and she gladly accepted my love.

472
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,837
I'm about to cry.

473
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,839
How can you compete
with each other after this?

474
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,574
She should give him all her stars.

475
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,444
What's Chef Chinglai like
in the kitchen as your master?

476
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,346
First of all, he's elegant like a tiger,

477
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:45,450
so he never yells or curses.

478
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,254
He quietly watches you from behind
and keeps an eye on you,

479
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,357
and say something
that pierces you deeply from time to time.

480
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,326
He pierces you?

481
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,460
Like a tiger.

482
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,696
She said he was a tiger
who stays hidden then pierces you.

483
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,498
-You mean he pounces on you?
-Right.

484
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,200
Shouldn't you be complimenting him?

485
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,968
-So the chef…
-What's with you?

486
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,270
I can already feel the stab in the back.

487
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,672
No, that's not the case.

488
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,440
CHEF CHINGLAI'S INGREDIENTS:

489
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,541
DAD'S SSAMJANG,
DAD'S DOENJANG,

490
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,609
STRIPLOIN, COCKTAIL SHRIMP,

491
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,677
APPLE, OYSTER SAUCE

492
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,812
What are you making, Chef Chinglai?

493
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,280
Let me tell you about my dish.

494
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,283
Chef Eun-yeong said I was like her father.

495
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,352
"The King, the Teacher,
and the Father are one."

496
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,654
It's an old adage that reminds you
never to forget your teacher.

497
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,390
So I named my dish
Master Lu Equals Your Father.

498
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,793
-Master Lu Equals Your Father.
-That's good.

499
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,929
-It's not too late to kneel.
-That's a declaration.

500
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,731
What's the dish like?

501
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,269
I'll roll the meat with cocktail shrimp

502
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,439
and make the sauce by using <i>doenjang.</i>

503
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,574
There's something called
black bean sauce in China,

504
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,543
-so I'll use it like that.
-Black bean sauce.

505
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,112
I also saw some apples,

506
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,115
so I'll put some <i>ssamjang</i> inside
and turn it into <i>basi.</i>

507
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,350
<i>-Basi?</i>
<i>-Basi?</i>

508
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,619
-I thought it'd taste good as <i>basi.</i>
-Apple<i> basi?</i>

509
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,420
<i>-Doenjang </i>and apples?
-It'll taste new,

510
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,124
and it's a new challenge for me,
so I hope you consider that.

511
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,559
-<i>Doenjang</i> and apples?
-I see.

512
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,962
-<i>Doenjang</i> and apple <i>basi?</i>
-It's hard to imagine.

513
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,031
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS:

514
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,566
DAD'S SSAMJANG,
DAD'S DOENJANG, CABBAGE

515
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,967
ZUCCHINI, BULGOGI MEAT,
AND MORE

516
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,436
Up against him is Chef Eun-yeong.
What's your dish?

517
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,372
Here's the name of my dish.

518
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,541
<i>Please Lose, Dad</i>

519
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,176
<i>Please Lose</i>

520
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,514
Please Lose, Dad.

521
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,851
She's asking him directly. Man.

522
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,720
-Out in the open.
-She's asking him, "Please Lose, Dad."

523
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,156
But kid, I only have one star.

524
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,393
-Kid.
-Yes, kid.

525
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,594
-Hey, kid.
-Hey, kid.

526
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,663
-This is family trouble.
-How scary.

527
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,366
-Yul said he liked napa cabbage very much.
-I do.

528
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,702
I want to grill the cabbage

529
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,306
and serve it with bulgogi
stir-fried in your dad's <i>doenjang</i> sauce.

530
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,374
I'll also make something
I learned from him.

531
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,477
It's <i>menbosha,</i> but shaped in my style,

532
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,747
and I'll serve it with some sauce.

533
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,516
-I love <i>menbosha.</i>
-I see.

534
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,518
So you'll use
the skills you learned from him?

535
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,186
Yes, it's my foundation,

536
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,922
but I'll add my own touches
and turn it into a different dish.

537
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,591
-She learned it, but will change it.
-Yes.

538
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,193
-It's just the foundation?
-Yes.

539
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,295
But with the kick, will she rise higher?

540
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,332
Nice try, but she has nothing on me.

541
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,267
She has nothing on him!

542
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,003
-You still have nothing on him.
-You're still in his palm.

543
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,504
She's still in Chef Chinglai's palm.

544
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,973
-You can try, but you can't win.
-She has nothing on him.

545
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,242
You two are greatly talented
in twisting their words

546
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,345
into the most negative comment in history.

547
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,180
It's not completely wrong.

548
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,049
-I'm not making up anything.
-He's not.

549
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,984
This is what we do, right?

550
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,521
It's as serious as match fixing.

551
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,889
-Fixing?
-He's not making it up.

552
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,558
-All right.
-It's true, though.

553
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,194
-It's an attempt to make them competitive.
-To rile them up.

554
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,029
It's to make them more competitive.

555
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,399
This is Yul's order,
chemistry between Dad's jang and me.

556
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,901
Let us begin the round.

557
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,903
-My gosh.
-Hey.

558
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,672
Gosh, the family feud.

559
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,674
She's trembling.

560
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,777
"Do not forget
that I am like your father!"

561
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,714
The Himalayas of Chinese cuisine,
Chef Lu Chinglai.

562
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:06,184
"I shall rise above my mater
and conquer the mountain."

563
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,687
The mountaineer of Chinese cuisine,
Chef Park Eun-yeong.

564
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,790
The two are up against each other.

565
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,092
This is the long-awaited
master-protégé round.

566
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,627
Who'll rise above as the winner?

567
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,164
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

568
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,232
You can do this!

569
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,367
It's an honor, Chef Chinglai.

570
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,804
A BOW TO HER MASTER IS IN ORDER
BEFORE SHE BEGINS

571
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,607
"Please lose, Dad! Lose for me, Father!"

572
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,575
-Yes.
-"You're my father!"

573
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,911
PLEASE (TAKE A HINT) LOSE, DAD

574
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,381
THE LITTLE GIRLIE
SHOOK HANDS FOR A REASON

575
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,283
-Yes.
-"You're my father!"

576
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,551
"Please lose!"

577
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,987
-It's the master-protégé round.
-"Please lose for me!"

578
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,892
He said he'd use <i>doenjang</i> with apple,
and I'm wondering what that will be like.

579
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,528
-Apple<i> basi?</i>
-Apple <i>basi?</i>

580
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,929
She must be nervous.

581
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,531
It's more nerve-racking than it looks.

582
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,932
It must be.

583
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,636
It has probably been a while
since Chef Chinglai peeled an apple.

584
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,138
-I'm sure.
-That's a job for his students.

585
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,607
Who in the kitchen
would make him peel an apple?

586
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,477
-His hands are a bit shaken.
-Yes.

587
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,946
And that has a bigger impact on you,

588
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,549
-even if you feel fine.
-He's a bit shaken.

589
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,417
-He's not just a bit shaken.
-No?

590
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,753
-He's trembling.
-He's trembling?

591
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,955
It's been a while since he has done that.

592
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,991
-I'm seeing lots of flesh on the peel.
-His hands are shaking.

593
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,128
That job is usually outsourced.

594
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,330
He's using a Chinese kitchen knife now.

595
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,300
-He said he'd make <i>basi</i> with that.
-Yes.

596
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,068
-That's the shape.
-Big pieces.

597
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,671
EUN-YEONG BEGINS
WITH NAPA CABBAGE

598
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,806
-She has a lot to do, though.
-I do.

599
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,043
She cut the napa cabbage
into pretty shapes.

600
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,244
For steamed napa cabbage?

601
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,846
-Grilled napa cabbage.
-Grilled.

602
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,948
-What is she rubbing on it?
-Oil.

603
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,616
-Oil.
-Yes, it's olive oil.

604
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,718
The slice looks like millefeuille.

605
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,788
-She rubbed it with oil.
-It's going into the oven now.

606
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,922
Just like that?

607
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,524
He's trembling a whole lot.

608
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,059
IS MY FATHER DOING OKAY?

609
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,895
WHAT'S CHINGLAI'S NEXT STEP?

610
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,831
-What? He's carving?
-He's carving out the apple.

611
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,199
Will he fill it?

612
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,735
-It's for the <i>ssamjang.</i>
-It must be where the <i>ssamjang</i> goes.

613
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,804
Is that space for the <i>ssamjang?</i>

614
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,707
Yes, that's right.
It's my first time trying this.

615
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,175
She learned to carve from him.

616
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,478
-She learned to carve from Chef Chinglai.
-She learned that too.

617
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,314
Do you remember
the petals she carved out with a radish?

618
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,784
-You're right. It was Chef Chinglai.
-She learned it all from him.

619
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,087
Two minutes have gone by.

620
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,955
He's filling it with <i>ssamjang.</i>

621
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,023
<i>Ssamjang</i> goes in.

622
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,592
-Just like that?
-It's made by his chemistry-major father.

623
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,728
This is how he's using the <i>ssamjang.</i>

624
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,397
-My father is in for a surprise.
-I'm sure.

625
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,765
He probably couldn't imagine

626
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,801
his <i>ssamjang</i> getting used
as a part of Chef Chinglai's recipe.

627
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,137
He couldn't have known
through his chemical computation.

628
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,939
-"Getting used"?
-Used?

629
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,375
-He's taking advantage of it.
-Taking advantage?

630
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,545
-I'm dying to know.
-That's what he's doing!

631
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,114
-He put those together.
-He turned it into a sandwich.

632
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,985
-Like a sandwich.
-Otherwise, they'll stick to each other.

633
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,421
-I did not expect something like this.
-Right?

634
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,989
I think they'll go well together.

635
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,458
Peanut butter and apples were a thing.

636
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,826
-Right?
-That's true.

637
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,997
I hope he gets
enough frying batter on the apple.

638
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,433
-Chef Eun-yeong grabs shrimps.
-I did.

639
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,402
-It must be <i>menbosha.</i>
-Is it for <i>menbosha?</i>

640
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,703
-It is.
-Shrimps for <i>menbosha.</i>

641
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,240
2. REMOVE TAILS
FROM THE SHRIMPS AND GRIND

642
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,342
It must be the <i>menbosha</i> filling.

643
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,077
One <i>ssamjang.</i>

644
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,746
She's also using <i>ssamjang</i>
to make <i>menbosha</i>.

645
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,215
Yes, it's going in here,
and it'll go in the sauce too.

646
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,019
-She used ssamjang and eggs.
-She seasons <i>menbosha</i> with <i>ssamjang.</i>

647
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,187
Sesame oil.

648
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,455
MIXING QUICKLY

649
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,857
I can tell by seeing them cook

650
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,227
that Eun-yeong is moving very fast.

651
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,897
But Chef Chinglai is so laid back.

652
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,701
-He doesn't hustle.
-That shows his experience.

653
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,035
In the world of martial arts,

654
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,370
she's the Shaolin style,

655
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,540
and Chef Chinglai is the tai chi style.

656
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,478
-It looks like a scene from a drama.
-Doesn't it?

657
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,614
<i>Chef Chinglai,</i>
<i>who had the world under his feet,</i>

658
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,016
have become older after years.

659
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,185
And one of his protégés stepped up

660
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,188
and told him that she'd like to win.

661
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:06,691
Who'll rise as the winner of this battle?

662
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,060
Wait. Without frying batter?

663
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,528
Right away?

664
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,397
-Wait.
-No frying batter?

665
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,132
-Is he frying those?
-No.

666
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,800
-He parboiled them.
-Were they parboiled?

667
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,003
-It was water?
-He's coating them with starch.

668
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,372
COATS WITH STARCH
BY DIPPING IT IN WATER

669
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,841
-He dipped it in water.
-It probably became stickier.

670
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,242
That's his technique.

671
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,079
He coats it twice
to make the batter thicker.

672
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,582
He coats apple pieces with starch
and begins to deep-fry.

673
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,783
The batter won't fall off.

674
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,452
You're right. It won't fall off.

675
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,520
WHAT ABOUT CHEF EUN-YEONG?

676
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,554
She's using bread.

677
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,090
What? Why is she slicing the bread?

678
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,893
-It's for <i>menbosha.</i>
-She made cubes.

679
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,194
CHOPPING BREAD INTO CUBES

680
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,329
Why are you cutting it like that?

681
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,831
3. COAT SHRIMP BALLS
WITH CUBED BREAD

682
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,334
She's coating the bread cubes
on the shrimp balls.

683
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,402
That's the coating?

684
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,103
They aren't sandwich-shaped.

685
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,072
She's coating it like breadcrumbs.

686
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,809
Aren't there corn dogs shaped like that?
With cubes on the outside.

687
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,944
The potato corn dog. Yes.

688
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,914
-That's not a bad idea.
-It seems better, actually.

689
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,017
He grabs some meat.
Which cut are you using?

690
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,153
-It's striploin.
-Striploin?

691
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,623
You can see that his hands are trembling.

692
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,425
I've never seen him this nervous.

693
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,528
It might be out of nervousness,

694
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,897
or it might be fury
after hearing Eun-yeong talk.

695
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,366
-Because he's furious?
-Yes.

696
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,635
-He's enraged.
-There's fury in him.

697
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,072
He's like, "I have brought up
my worst enemy!"

698
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,574
-After training her all these years.
-"I trained my own enemy!"

699
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,376
It must feel undeserved.

700
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,144
How dare you ask me to let you win?

701
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,547
A REMINDER,
JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO FORGET

702
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,981
He cuts in fury.

703
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,650
"I taught you with all I had."

704
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,187
I watched <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> at home,

705
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,088
and I realized

706
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,157
the chefs on this side
tend to roast me the most when I cook.

707
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,059
-Roast you?
-Roast you?

708
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,295
-Roast you?
-Come on!

709
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,199
-Especially you. Take some time off.
-Me?

710
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,034
-Take a rest.
-What do you mean, roast you?

711
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,869
You can always call them mean.

712
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,237
-They sabotage you.
-Hurry.

713
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,640
You have to work with her, this side.
Stop being mean.

714
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,709
-Jeez.
-Don't do it.

715
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,910
FINALLY, CHOPPING IN PEACE

716
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,746
-Zucchini? She chops zucchini.
-Zucchini.

717
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,681
I'll stir-fry this with meat.

718
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,816
WHAT ABOUT CHEF CHINGLAI?

719
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,352
THE APPLE SANDWICH
GOT DEEP-FRIED DELICIOUSLY

720
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,420
It's so new.

721
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,622
He already finished making fried apples.

722
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,390
Green onion.

723
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,493
CHOP JUST THE WHITE PART

724
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,828
He tops lots of green onion on the meat.

725
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,098
They're chopping the same thing right now.

726
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,400
-You're right.
-They chop mushrooms in the same shape.

727
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,403
The striploin is almost ready.

728
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,973
They chop the ingredients
in the same shape.

729
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,041
-Yes.
-It's because she learned from him.

730
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,209
Eun-yeong was taught.

731
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,979
He'll probably julienne those,
add <i>ssamjang</i>, and roll them.

732
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,981
-He'll roll those.
-I guess so.

733
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,582
He'll add some <i>jang,</i> right?

734
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,618
-<i>Doenjang </i>or <i>ssamjang?</i>
-Will he make the sauce?

735
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,952
He's adding shrimp too.

736
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,421
-He tops it with shrimp too.
-Even shrimp?

737
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,923
He coats it lightly with starch.

738
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,858
Chef Chinglai also tries
lots of new things.

739
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,594
He begins to roll the striploin.

740
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,897
-He doesn't want to lose.
-Not at all.

741
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,699
It'd be courteous to do his best,
since she is his protégé.

742
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,270
It would be quite amazing
if she won and got a star.

743
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,572
-That will be the beginning of her era.
-Green onion oil?

744
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,440
-It's green onion oil.
-Green onion for oil.

745
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,875
King oyster mushroom.

746
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:11,943
DOENJANG, MINCED GARLIC

747
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,977
<i>Doenjang.</i>

748
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,245
Is that butter?

749
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,513
-It is.
-Butter?

750
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,714
-Butter?
-Butter?

751
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,516
Is this the Hong Kong style?

752
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,485
-Like Western cuisine.
-Yes, Hong Kong mixes

753
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,921
Western and Chinese cooking techniques.

754
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,889
She added butter, unlike her master.

755
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,357
THE MODERN STYLE

756
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,494
"I'm no longer living in your shadow."

757
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,596
I can't use just Chinese ingredients,

758
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,097
-not just chili oil.
-"I'm going global."

759
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,401
-She incorporated the Western culture.
-She likes butter too.

760
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,535
The Western culture?

761
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,804
-They're from different generations.
-Generations?

762
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,240
-Eun-yeong goes global.
-Of course.

763
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,309
-She accepts new ingredients.
-That's a lot of butter.

764
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,644
It should be labeled Western
with that much butter.

765
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,079
Yes, that's a Western dish now.

766
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,114
Flambé! Wasn't that flambé?

767
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,950
EVIL LAUGHTER

768
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,252
Poong, can you be quiet?

769
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,420
KEEP IT QUIET

770
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,888
SHOOTING OUT POISON

771
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,323
-The poison needle.
-He's poisoned.

772
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,426
-He's playing along?
-He's dead.

773
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:06,431
-Chef Chinglai does not rush. He's calm.
-He remains calm.

774
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,100
He's mixing starch and egg.

775
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,902
He's not rushing.

776
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,071
What will he use that with?

777
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:16,274
The tiger swipes with his claws
and the batter is ready.

778
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,744
-That's different from Eun-yeong's skills.
-He fries it right away.

779
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:24,015
-Yes. That's right.
-Nothing is wasted. It's all calculated.

780
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,085
His hands move like measuring cups.

781
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,253
DREDGING WITH A SINGLE TOUCH

782
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,021
He'll cook it lightly.

783
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,757
-He knows when he feels it.
-Of course.

784
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,459
He's deep-frying strip loin.

785
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,095
He dredges the meat and…

786
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,329
Dunk.

787
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,064
Dunk.

788
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,066
-That was precise.
-Right?

789
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,068
You can tell by Chef Chinglai

790
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,938
that Eun-yeong
is where she's at for a reason.

791
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,575
This is something we can see
because it's a master-protégé round.

792
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,177
-There's a lot of suspense.
-It's so much fun.

793
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,612
Five minutes.

794
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,247
Allow me to get out there.

795
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,548
SUNG-JU REPORTS LIVE

796
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,752
The master-protégé round unfolds
out here in the kitchen.

797
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,820
Chef Chinglai looks very laid back.

798
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,122
4. MIX INGREDIENTS TO MAKE SAUCE

799
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,623
DOUBLE-FRYING APPLE
TO ADD CRUNCHINESS!

800
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,226
-The apples look so good.
-Yes.

801
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,928
WHAT ABOUT EUN-YEONG?

802
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,430
Chef Eun-yeong is very busy.

803
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,699
She begins to serve the first part.

804
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,935
This smells so good.

805
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,536
I'll serve it with grilled napa cabbage.

806
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,206
On top of that?
The stir-fried meat is the first layer.

807
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,975
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

808
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,478
Can she win against Chef Chinglai
and climb over the Himalayas?

809
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,381
She's only halfway there.

810
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,950
OH, NO

811
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,284
She's only halfway there.

812
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,553
SHE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO

813
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,956
I need a little more from you.

814
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,490
That's sugar for <i>basi.</i>

815
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,326
-He's doing it.
-<i>Basi.</i>

816
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,528
HE GRABS A TRAY

817
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,831
AND COATS IT WITH HOT OIL

818
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,299
RUBBING

819
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,101
He just touches the hot oil with his hand.

820
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,602
-Hot oil?
-Really?

821
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,471
He touched hot oil with his hand?

822
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,341
-Is that sugar?
-Sung-ju!

823
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,843
Can you touch the oil and see if it's hot?

824
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,978
No.

825
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,813
Sugar is even hotter than oil.

826
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,048
Can you try touching the sugar, then?

827
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,116
This?

828
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,517
SCARED…

829
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,286
-Don't. It's hot.
-It's like a furnace.

830
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,822
-Are these apple pieces?
-Yes.

831
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,623
These are apple pieces.

832
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,892
5. MELT SUGAR IN OIL,
STIR-FRY SESAME AND APPLE PIECES

833
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,561
He's stir-frying those.

834
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,896
-He's making <i>basi</i>, right?
-Do you know what's peculiar?

835
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,733
He's using the same pot of oil

836
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,869
to cook rolled striploin at the bottom

837
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,904
-and apples on the top.
-Apples.

838
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,940
-How efficient.
-Two at once.

839
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,541
He's saving time.

840
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,410
That shows how experienced he is.

841
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,413
-These look great too.
-It looks well-cooked.

842
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,382
HOW ABOUT EUN-YEONG?

843
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,517
Those look good.

844
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,019
Gosh, I'm running out of time.

845
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,788
MAYONNAISE, FIG JAM, SRIRACHA

846
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,991
You need to continue
climbing the Himalayas.

847
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,526
Eun-yeong makes sauce!

848
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,795
-Can you try the sauce?
-The sauce.

849
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,263
What is this for?

850
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,998
-It's for <i>menbosha.</i>
<i>-Menbosha.</i>

851
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,901
This is the sauce for <i>menbosha.</i>

852
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,970
-It's important.
-Eun-yeong!

853
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,440
Now, can she climb over the mountain?

854
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,941
This is fantastic!

855
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,910
WOW

856
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,311
This is fantastic!

857
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,380
YOU DID IT, MOUNTAINEER

858
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,481
Goodness!

859
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,884
-Has she reached the top?
-It's within her reach!

860
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,653
<i>"Time to step down, Lu Chinglai!</i>

861
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,056
<i>I am here to take over!"</i>

862
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,490
<i>The sauce is fantastic.</i>

863
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,925
You used <i>jang,</i> right?

864
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,595
-Yes, I did.
-I can taste it in the sauce.

865
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,230
The napa cabbage looks great.

866
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,633
This sauce will play a huge part.

867
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,768
Goodness, Eun-yeong.

868
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,270
Two minutes left.

869
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,439
-Two minutes, sir.
-Okay.

870
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,506
JULIENNED GREEN ONION

871
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,208
You must press on harder!

872
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,178
Your student is right behind you,
Chef Chinglai.

873
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,346
You have a minute and 40 seconds.

874
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,182
You have a minute and 45 seconds. Hurry.

875
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,517
You have a minute and 40 seconds.

876
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,319
Chef Eun-yeong uses a torch one last time.

877
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,288
Yes, I wanted to broil the top.

878
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,489
To add smoky flavor.

879
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,258
-You should speed it up.
-Okay.

880
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,661
Please speed up.

881
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,863
I've never seen myself tremble so much.

882
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,865
Chinglai begins to tremble.

883
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,001
His student is right behind him!

884
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,271
-One minute.
-The kitchen is chaotic!

885
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,274
You have under a minute! One minute.

886
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,909
What's he doing?

887
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,578
-Should I wipe this?
-Garlic.

888
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,912
-One minute.
-It's garlic.

889
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,547
-Finish up!
-He forgot garlic.

890
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,449
-He forgot?
-It must've slipped his mind.

891
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,951
-Did he forget garlic?
-Forget what?

892
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,153
-He forgot garlic.
-He's re-frying those.

893
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,089
-He forgot garlic and had to re-fry?
-Okay.

894
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,457
He forgot garlic?

895
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,326
-Chef Chinglai forgets!
-How can anyone do that?

896
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,461
I left out garlic.

897
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,064
I guess people often forget garlic
as they age.

898
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,867
-I guess it comes with age.
-You forget to use garlic with age.

899
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,635
It can't be helped.

900
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,172
-You have a minute left!
-A minute left!

901
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,673
Eun-yeong serves her food.

902
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,543
PARK EUN-YEONG FINISHES!

903
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,179
Eun-yeong is done cooking!

904
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,647
Eun-yeong is done.

905
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:50,681
Thirty seconds.

906
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,618
Chef Chinglai had a forgetful moment.

907
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,621
Many years have passed
for our dear Chef Chinglai.

908
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,625
Many years have passed,
and he became a bit forgetful.

909
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,960
-Fifteen seconds, sir.
-Okay.

910
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,529
You have fifteen seconds!

911
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,331
Will Chef Chinglai finish his dish?

912
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,900
Father!

913
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,868
-Can you do it, Dad?
-Nine. Eight.

914
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,170
-You got enough time!
-Ten. Nine.

915
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,071
-Just one serving.
-Nine. Eight.

916
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,474
-Three. Two.
-Three. Two.

917
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,808
FATHER!

918
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,978
-Three. Two. One.
-Three. Two. One.

919
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,914
IT'S TIME TO WRAP UP!

920
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,515
That's all you can serve.

921
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,751
Chef Chinglai finishes.

922
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,553
AMAZED

923
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,820
Give them a round of applause!

924
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,255
AN APPLAUSE TO HIS CHALLENGE

925
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,291
Did you forget anything?

926
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,659
I haven't forgotten anything.

927
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,761
-But I didn't expect to fumble so much.
-I see.

928
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,529
You still put it together.

929
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,566
TIME TO DELIVER THE DISHES

930
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,067
My gosh.

931
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,169
-Great round, sir.
-Great job.

932
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,304
A HUG AFTER A FIERCE ROUND

933
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,838
My gosh.

934
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,440
This is fascinating.

935
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,542
-That was overwhelming.
-It must've been.

936
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,245
Wasn't it? I couldn't take my eyes off
even for a second.

937
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,315
Both dishes were finished for Yul.

938
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:03,154
Toward the end of the play,
Salieri and Mozart make music together.

939
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,557
They continuously chime in
and create a masterpiece called <i>Requiem.</i>

940
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,125
<i>-Requiem.</i>
-Yes, <i>Requiem.</i>

941
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,027
<i>It felt like I was watching that scene.</i>

942
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:14,332
<i>-I held my breath as I watched them cook.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

943
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,767
-Thank you. I was moved.
-Of course.

944
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,370
But now, it's time to put in
your honest two cents.

945
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,741
Please try Chef Eun-yeong's dish,
Please Lose, Dad.

946
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,543
CRUNCHY MENBOSHA
MADE WITH DAD'S SSAMJANG

947
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,879
SPECIAL SSAMJANG SAUCE

948
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,582
GRILLED NAPA CABBAGE,
DOENJANG-SEASONED MEAT

949
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,417
THE 3 DISHES MADE
WITH HIS FATHER'S JANG

950
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,755
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S DAD,
PLEASE LOSE

951
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,056
Thank you so much.

952
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,891
-I'm so moved.
-I see.

953
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,694
She used <i>ssamjang</i> for that meat stir-fry.

954
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,429
I like the presentation.

955
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,530
SMELLS IT FIRST

956
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,466
Goodness. It smells great.

957
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,001
ANTICIPATION

958
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,270
It's like pepper steak.

959
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,639
-Another Chinese dish.
-Yes.

960
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,041
THE FIRST BITE

961
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,479
SAVORING

962
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,781
Sweet napa cabbage meets salty meat.

963
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,182
-It must be good.
-Salty and sweet.

964
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,084
She used your father's <i>jang.</i>

965
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,853
He's wrapping the beef with napa cabbage.

966
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,454
-It's fun to eat too.
-The smoky flavor.

967
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:15,359
He'll finally know why she sliced
the napa cabbage and put it on top.

968
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,194
She grilled it first.

969
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,163
Why? What is it? What's it like?

970
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,033
-I can taste my dad's usual <i>jang.</i>
-Can you?

971
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,902
It would also be delicious

972
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,772
to mix this with a bowl of rice.

973
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,240
It'd be good with rice.

974
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,343
By any chance, are you disappointed
that she didn't serve it with rice?

975
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,544
CHUCKLING

976
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,612
Is that so?

977
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,181
It would've been the cherry on top
if I had some rice,

978
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,785
but this by itself isn't missing anything.

979
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,321
HE KEEPS CRAVING MORE

980
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,924
I think this will be
a really nice snack with a drink.

981
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,626
So she forgot to serve a drink too?

982
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,960
She forgot both.

983
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,296
He's missing some rice and a drink.

984
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,431
She's missing lots.

985
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,699
IT'S SO MUCH FUN TO TEASE HER

986
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:55,966
-It's so delicious.
-Is it?

987
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,569
Please try the <i>menbosha </i>now.

988
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,304
The shape looks lovely.

989
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,474
-Let me try the sauce.
-I tried that sauce out there,

990
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,444
-and it tasted fantastic.
-He starts with the sauce.

991
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,245
TASTING

992
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,315
This is nice.

993
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,884
She climbs the Himalayas.

994
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,154
I love how the savory flavor
hits my mouth with richness.

995
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,457
-It's amazing.
-I told you.

996
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,392
-Do you remember the mix
-Right?

997
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,260
-of ketchup and mayo over cabbage?
-Ketchup and mayo.

998
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,130
It's like that,
but with much more savory flavor.

999
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,033
-It fills your mouth in a different way.
-Right?

1000
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,702
You didn't learn this
from Chef Chinglai, did you?

1001
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,106
-That sauce is my personal creation.
-Her personal creation.

1002
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,141
"It's my personal creation."

1003
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,609
"I never learned this."

1004
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,712
-Your personal creation?
-She has never learned this.

1005
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,180
That sauce is hers.

1006
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,217
But she made it
with the ingredients from my fridge.

1007
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,284
-Yes.
-So how…

1008
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,754
-What's in the sauce?
-I made it

1009
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,691
<i>with mayonnaise,</i>
<i>your father's </i>ssamjang,<i> and some fig jam.</i>

1010
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,360
-Fig jam!
-The secret was fig jam.

1011
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:01,031
-It would be a nice spread for bread too.
-Even for bread?

1012
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,800
Yes. Exactly.

1013
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:07,138
That was Eun-yeong's personal creation
with a hint of Western culture.

1014
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,608
This wasn't Lu Chinglai's,
but her personal creation.

1015
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,111
It's her personal recipe,
so please remember that.

1016
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:17,515
That sauce alone
is Eun-yeong's personal creation.

1017
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,517
-It's been cooked well.
-The shrimp ball.

1018
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,551
-Nice.
-Nice job.

1019
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,520
She also mixed the shrimp ball with <i>jang.</i>

1020
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,587
<i>Yes, she did that.</i>

1021
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,557
-It must smell rich on the inside.
-<i>Menbosha</i> must be her master's teaching.

1022
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,093
-He said he liked <i>menbosha.</i>
-I do.

1023
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,963
I hope it goes well with the sauce.

1024
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,633
-The sound.
-Nice.

1025
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,468
I'm sure they go well together.

1026
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,569
-Gosh.
-It's good.

1027
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,638
-So?
-He looks so happy.

1028
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,239
What's it like?

1029
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,707
IT MAKES HIM CLAP

1030
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,843
-He claps.
-An applause.

1031
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,645
HAPPY

1032
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,681
Just <i>menbosha</i> without the sauce.

1033
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,349
CRUNCH

1034
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,019
IT MADE HIM CLAP AGAIN

1035
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,520
The sauce was there to help.

1036
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,656
It's already delicious as is.

1037
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,159
But it creates another flavor
when you dip it in the sauce.

1038
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,129
-It made me very happy.
-I see.

1039
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,498
And she made the sandwich
with tiny cubes, right?

1040
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,568
It reminded me of the potato corn dog,
which people who love it go crazy for.

1041
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,369
The cubed potato corn dog.

1042
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,406
I loved how crunchy it was
at different parts as I chewed on it.

1043
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,374
It helped me enjoy it a lot.

1044
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,845
Chef Chinglai, do you use
bread like this one to make <i>menbosha?</i>

1045
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,213
I don't do it like that.

1046
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,848
-This was also her personal creation.
-Personal.

1047
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,583
It was not her master's, but hers.

1048
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,785
This was her personal creation.

1049
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,587
The technique was solely hers.

1050
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,857
Next, please try Chef Chinglai's dish,
Master Lu Equals Your Father.

1051
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,494
CRUNCHY BEEF ROLL
MADE WITH SHRIMP AND MUSHROOM

1052
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,397
AND APPLE-SSAMJANG BASI
TO BRING OUT THE JANG FLAVOR

1053
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,168
CHEF LU CHINGLAI'S
MASTER LU EQUALS YOUR FATHER

1054
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,337
-Thank you.
-My gosh.

1055
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,873
It obviously looks like
an authentic Chinese dish.

1056
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,675
He rolled striploin and deep-fried it.

1057
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,044
And it's rolled with shrimp and mushroom.

1058
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,179
SAVORING

1059
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,281
HE'S IN AWE AFTER THE FIRST BITE

1060
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,550
THE SON OF A RESTAURANT OWNER
ENJOYS THE FLAVOR

1061
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,120
-He used <i>jang </i>for the sauce, right?
-Yes.

1062
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,388
HE CONTINUES TO FEEL AMAZED

1063
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,990
It must taste good.

1064
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,392
Yes, goodness.

1065
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,530
I'd like to dare and say that I understand

1066
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,398
why he is the master of Chinese cuisine.

1067
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:18,369
-It's almost like spicy fried chicken.
-Spicy fried chicken?

1068
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,804
-That dish includes a bit of garlic,
-Right.

1069
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,940
so that becomes a nice kick.

1070
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,275
It must've been important.

1071
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,509
ANOTHER BITE AT ONCE

1072
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,214
DYING TO TRY A BITE…

1073
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,450
It's hard to believe he made this
in 15 minutes with my ingredients.

1074
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,286
It's of great quality.

1075
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,489
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to chime in,

1076
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,892
but I was the most flustered today
over my decades-long career.

1077
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,160
I see.

1078
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,962
But I can't taste that.

1079
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,030
-It's so good.
-I'm curious.

1080
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,234
-Next, the apple.
-Apple <i>basi?</i>

1081
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,537
-I was the most curious about this one.
-I'm dying to know.

1082
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,073
-He made apple <i>basi.</i>
-Apple <i>basi.</i>

1083
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,409
It must be good. It's sweet and salty.

1084
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,710
Will it go well together?

1085
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,846
-I can smell <i>ssamjang</i> right away.
-Can you?

1086
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,516
I thought the sweet and saltiness
would go well together.

1087
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,185
-I've never done it before.
-It was his first time doing this.

1088
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,787
Yes, it was a new try.

1089
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,258
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT LIKE?

1090
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,528
Will apple go well with <i>ssamjang?</i>

1091
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,862
Sour and sweet.

1092
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,264
Goodness.

1093
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,100
HE CAREFULLY TASTES EVERYTHING
UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT

1094
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,869
It almost feels like
it doesn't go well together, but it does.

1095
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,840
I already had a pretty strong perception

1096
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,109
of what apples and <i>ssamjang</i> are like.

1097
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:36,380
So if I didn't have that perception,
I think these go very nicely together.

1098
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,015
The mix wasn't so bad.

1099
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,350
IT MAKES HIM GO BACK FOR MORE

1100
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,720
-Okay. Why don't you try some, Jae-wook?
-Yes, I'm so curious.

1101
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,222
The flavors are so amazing.

1102
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,725
-That one is Chef Eun-yeong's dish.
-Yes.

1103
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,460
THE MIX OF MEAT AND NAPA CABBAGE

1104
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:58,435
Yul said he wanted to have it
with both rice and a drink.

1105
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,771
He left that comment with us.

1106
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,172
What's it like?

1107
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,009
-It's the flavor that calls for rice.
-It needs rice.

1108
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,144
-It's too salty.
-They both want rice.

1109
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,412
You should've served rice.

1110
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,881
Those chefs over there
start a rumor that it's too salty.

1111
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,217
Did you mean that it was too salty?

1112
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,286
They didn't say that.

1113
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,722
-They didn't.
-They didn't say that. It's not that bad.

1114
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,057
I'm sorry, Eun-yeong.

1115
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,760
-It'd be good served with rice.
-We didn't have rice, right?

1116
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,228
Next, <i>menbosha.</i>

1117
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:30,034
Let's hear Jae-wook's take on this.

1118
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,435
CURIOUS

1119
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,638
She served <i>menbosha</i> with sauce.

1120
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,006
He looks happy.

1121
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,508
That's a nice reaction.

1122
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,344
-The sauce is amazing.
-Isn't it?

1123
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,747
-It was her personal creation.
-Her personal creation.

1124
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,349
It's even good cold.

1125
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,583
It's sauce.

1126
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,119
-"It's sauce"?
-The sauce…

1127
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,655
It was already cold,
but he said it was still good cold.

1128
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,857
COLD YET DELICIOUS SAUCE

1129
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:54,758
It's uncanny, right?

1130
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,093
It is, but it's so good.

1131
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,162
-He says it's good.
-Did he?

1132
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,364
Next, please try Chef Chinglai's dish,

1133
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,966
-Master Lu Equals Your Father.
-This one.

1134
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,737
A BITE OF
THE FRIED BEEF ROLL FIRST

1135
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,205
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1136
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,207
ENJOYING!

1137
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,775
HE NODS AFFIRMATIVELY

1138
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,911
I guess
he tastes something new as he chews.

1139
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,779
How is his chin so beautiful?

1140
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,381
His chin is just…

1141
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,749
THE UNATTAINABLE IS BEAUTIFUL

1142
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:24,688
I like how he cut the beef thinly
so that it's perfect to eat.

1143
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,991
<i>And the garlic flavor is appropriate.</i>

1144
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,727
This is really good.

1145
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,528
He says this is really good.

1146
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:35,232
That's the apple <i>basi.</i>
It's a strong contender.

1147
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,600
-What's it like?
-With <i>ssamjang.</i>

1148
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,701
My gosh.

1149
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,103
It's the smell.

1150
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,738
It's quite noticeable.

1151
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,742
Let's see how Jae-wook reacts.

1152
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,643
Apple <i>basi.</i>

1153
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,179
It has a lot of sugar on it,
so it must be good.

1154
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,382
The master of Chinese cuisine made this

1155
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,852
-for the first time for this battle.
-It's not easy.

1156
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,154
Tell us what it's really like.

1157
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,689
To me,

1158
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,291
it does have that apple smell,

1159
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,228
but the texture
almost made it think it was potato.

1160
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,530
-It was cooked.
-Yes.

1161
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,966
It was soft enough
for me to break with the roof of my mouth.

1162
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,802
It almost felt like a potato piece.

1163
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,572
Also, the <i>ssamjang</i>
and the sweetness of hardened sugar

1164
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,375
mixes in my mouth in a peculiar way.

1165
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,847
-I thought it'd be a nice dessert.
-Right?

1166
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,283
And now, it's time to decide.

1167
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,685
Press one for Lu Chinglai,

1168
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,821
<i>and press two for Park Eun-yeong.</i>

1169
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,556
Please make your decision

1170
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,125
-and push…
-Man. One second.

1171
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,193
One second.

1172
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,995
-Time-out.
-I'm sorry.

1173
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,631
-I really hate stalling.
-It's okay.

1174
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:45,102
-It's a nerve-racking moment.
-It mustn't be easy.

1175
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,170
Okay.

1176
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:47,437
-Have you decided?
-Yes.

1177
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,940
-I was greatly honored by both chefs.
-Yes.

1178
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,909
He made a difficult choice

1179
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,978
in this first master-protégé round.

1180
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,914
Let's find out the result.

1181
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,515
Show us!

1182
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,285
Did Chef Chinglai prove
that he is still going strong?

1183
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,788
Or will Chef Eun-yeong open a new era?

1184
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,490
Who did Yul choose?

1185
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:07,925
Who is it?

1186
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,459
-Who's the winner?
-Who is it?

1187
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,628
The chemistry round!
Will it be the master?

1188
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,931
-Or the protégé?
-Hey!

1189
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,232
Will it be the master?

1190
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,601
PARK EUN-YEONG WINS

1191
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,837
CHEF PARK EUN YEONG'S
PLEASE LOSE, DAD WINS

1192
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,271
The protégé wins!

1193
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,506
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1194
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,174
-Great job.
-The protégé wins!

1195
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,442
It's a new era.

1196
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,112
-Kneel to him first.
-Eun-yeong's era has finally begun.

1197
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,649
-He went easy on her.
-I do not dare to evaluate anything.

1198
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:37,087
But I picked the side
that brought out my father's <i>jang</i>

1199
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,856
a little more than the other.

1200
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,558
Of course, both were delicious,

1201
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,261
and Chef Chinglai's beef roll
was perfect to my taste.

1202
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:48,866
But I thought that dish didn't include

1203
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,667
as much <i>jang</i> flavor.

1204
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:53,570
Chef Chinglai, the production crew checked

1205
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,973
and confirmed that the beef roll

1206
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,175
did not include

1207
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,344
any <i>doenjang.</i>

1208
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,179
-Yes, I left it out.
-You did?

1209
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,181
<i>This wasn't my usual recipe,</i>

1210
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,084
<i>so I left it out</i>
<i>during the process of making the recipe.</i>

1211
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,219
HE ENDED UP LEAVING OUT
YUL'S FATHER'S DOENJANG

1212
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,455
-That's why.
-That was crucial.

1213
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,990
We must confirm this.

1214
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,191
-Was this intentional?
-Yes.

1215
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,326
-Was it out of love for his student?
-Was it?

1216
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,263
Did he wonder if he should use it
to let his protégé win?

1217
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,098
I'm suddenly choking up.

1218
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,667
Master!

1219
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,803
-That's the love of our teachers.
-Oh, no.

1220
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,773
<i>Oh, how grateful we are</i>

1221
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,277
<i>For our teacher's love</i>

1222
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,047
<i>Oh, we shall return</i>

1223
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,083
<i>Our teacher's kindness</i>

1224
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,420
That was a moving round.

1225
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:47,190
The star I won today feels
more special than anything.

1226
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,558
When I left his restaurant,

1227
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,795
he told me,
"Eun-yeong, do not suffer too much."

1228
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,431
But as I sit here with these evil chefs…

1229
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,700
THE EVIL SPIRITS
WHO BITE AND GNAW AT HER

1230
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,637
…I guess he felt bad
for how I fought to survive in this place

1231
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:04,841
and let me win this round.

1232
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:08,111
-Please put a star on Eun-yeong.
-Thank you.

1233
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,448
This star is for her, and for her only.

1234
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,218
Chef Eun-yeong wins a star!

1235
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,653
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1236
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,255
-Sure.
-It was delicious.

1237
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,090
THE HAPPY MASTER

1238
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:24,094
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Yul's fridge.</i>

1239
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,229
The kitchen is their stage,

1240
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,399
and the two will perform
<i>Amadeus,</i> the Chef's Version.

1241
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:34,371
The impregnable first place of the show,
the Mozart among chefs,

1242
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,506
Chef Choi Hyun-suk,

1243
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:40,177
is up against the Salieri of the show,
who's right on his tail,

1244
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,312
Chef Jung Ho-young.

1245
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,914
THE ANTICIPATION RISES

1246
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,950
I believe
the number one quality of a genius

1247
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,720
is his or her creativity.

1248
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,790
Who do you think is the chef
that continuously made creative dishes?

1249
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,025
Who is it?

1250
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,560
Choi Hyun-suk, of course.

1251
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,627
It's Hyun-suk.

1252
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,230
-Yes.
-Try to show some more interest.

1253
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,633
-Yes, sure. It's you.
-Yes, sure.

1254
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,702
-Yes, sure.
-Yes, sure.

1255
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,839
Chef Ho-young,
do you find his demeanor annoying?

1256
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,741
Do you feel jealous or envious?

1257
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,143
Well, the chased must feel anxious,

1258
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,945
not the chaser.

1259
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,080
Not the chaser.

1260
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,548
THE NUMBER 2 TAUNTS

1261
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,117
He has a point.

1262
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,085
Aren't they just like Mozart and Salieri?

1263
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,755
Yes, Chef Hyun-suk shows
the typical characteristics

1264
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,357
-which Mozart should carry.
-He's right.

1265
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,727
But in the play, Mozart dies early.

1266
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,763
Does he die early?

1267
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,865
That's all I have to say.

1268
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,467
-I'm not jealous of that.
-He dies?

1269
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,703
But Salieri lived
32 more years after his death.

1270
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,871
Thirty-two years?

1271
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,440
-Then I want to be Salieri.
-Me too!

1272
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,176
-I like it. Salieri sounds great.
-We should live.

1273
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,178
-Let's be Salieri.
-We should be him.

1274
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,248
Was Mozart also a show-off?

1275
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,350
-He's really bad.
-He is?

1276
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,751
Everyone hates him.

1277
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,953
They hate him!

1278
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,688
Gosh, everyone hates him.

1279
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:02,459
One of his lines is,
"Why do people hate me?"

1280
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:05,195
<i>Why do people hate me?</i>

1281
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,165
<i>I am, I am Choi Hyun-suk</i>

1282
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,833
<i>Why do people hate me?</i>

1283
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,035
-What's with him?
-"No idea!"

1284
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,805
But the music he made

1285
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,773
and the dishes Hyun-suk makes

1286
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,209
both come with significant authenticity.

1287
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,946
That's how they make up
for how disagreeable they are.

1288
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,014
-What now?
-Disagreeable?

1289
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,115
-Disagreeable.
-Disagreeable?

1290
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,150
Did I just say disagreeable?

1291
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:30,120
-You enunciated the word disagreeable.
-You did.

1292
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,255
CHEF HYUN-SUK'S INGREDIENTS:

1293
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,325
ENDIVES, ARUGULA CHERRY TOMATO,
APPLE, RICOTTA, KETCHUP

1294
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,527
Here's the name of my dish.

1295
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,496
MoChoirt.

1296
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,832
-MoChoirt.
-MoChoirt.

1297
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:45,135
-What's MoChoirt? Mo and Choi?
-Mo and Choi.

1298
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,404
What I'm making today

1299
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:51,641
is something I created
almost 19 to 20 years ago.

1300
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:55,245
This was
when people began to call me a genius.

1301
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,747
-What?
-That's why they began to call me

1302
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,282
the Crazy Chef.

1303
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,684
-That's true.
-Yes, the Crazy Chef.

1304
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,987
-That's a true story.
-I'm making tofu and kimchi today.

1305
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,956
-Tofu and kimchi.
-Tofu and kimchi?

1306
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,558
-Ingenious tofu and kimchi.
-Ingenious tofu and kimchi?

1307
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,361
-You'll have to watch until the end.
-What?

1308
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,396
There aren't many ways
to make tofu and kimchi.

1309
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,931
-Tofu, kimchi?
-How is it ingenious?

1310
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,601
-Will you change it?
-Do you want to see how these

1311
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,403
ordinary, everyday ingredients change
in a genius's hands?

1312
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,873
HOW IMPRESSIVE

1313
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:25,041
He's not using any kimchi.

1314
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,010
-But there was some.
-There was.

1315
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,879
I'm probably the only one in the world

1316
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,347
who makes something like this.

1317
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,882
HIS INGENIOUS DISH
IS COMING RIGHT UP

1318
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,383
Is it shaped differently?

1319
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,853
-That's what he wants. The ingenuity.
-Yes.

1320
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,890
CHEF HO-YOUNG'S INGREDIENTS:
STRIPLOIN, COCKTAIL SHRIMP…

1321
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,058
…CABBAGE, ZUCCHINI, MAYONNAISE,
LEMON JUICE, DIJON MUSTARD…

1322
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,361
What are you making, Chef Ho-young?

1323
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,897
The name of my dish is as follows.

1324
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,832
One, two, three, Fry.

1325
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,867
-Like the BLACKPINK song.
-Fry.

1326
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,135
Isn't it supposed to be JUMP?

1327
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,570
-I'll deep-fry.
-Fry?

1328
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,406
-I want to make a deep-fried dish.
-Fry?

1329
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,408
You surprised me.

1330
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,277
HOW STRANGE

1331
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,511
Isn't that just a drunk guy jumping?

1332
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,382
You seem like a drunk guy
who feels good and jumps.

1333
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,751
-What's your dish called exactly?
-The exact name?

1334
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,819
One, two, three, Fry.

1335
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,322
Is your dish called One, Two, Three, Fry?

1336
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,957
He's losing his mind.

1337
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,125
Some are like him.

1338
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,894
-He was surprised.
-Yes, he seemed to be shocked.

1339
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,863
-He's really something.
-Will you deep-fry something?

1340
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,332
-Thank you.
-I want to make a deep-fried dish.

1341
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,634
I was good at most everything

1342
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,170
during my study abroad in Japan,

1343
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,740
but I was the most talented
in deep-frying.

1344
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,877
When they thought of me,
they thought of deep-fried dishes.

1345
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,679
I'm that confident about this.

1346
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:39,182
First, I want to make

1347
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,786
-some juice beef steak cutlet.
-Beef steak cutlet.

1348
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,623
I'll also wrap shrimp
with zucchini pieces and fry those.

1349
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:51,061
It can feel greasy,
so I'll serve coleslaw on the side too.

1350
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,396
I'll also serve it with a sauce

1351
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,600
that smells subtly of truffle oil.

1352
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,402
I love coleslaw.

1353
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,339
Jae-wook looks thrilled too.

1354
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,642
-I'm having so much fun.
-That's the appeal of our show.

1355
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,744
And now, another round for Yul.

1356
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,581
Let them fill the order titled,
"An ingenious dish to make Mozart cry."

1357
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,484
A genius chef of the 21st century,

1358
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:18,221
MoChoirt of the show,
Chef Choi Hyun-suk is up.

1359
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,590
This man is here
to save his dance, his dish,

1360
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,259
and even his star.

1361
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:25,862
The Salieri of the show,
Chef Jung Ho-young is also up.

1362
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,799
Which one of them will become
the genius chef who'll make Mozart cry?

1363
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,969
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1364
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,972
SALIERI VS MOCHOIRT

1365
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,108
SALIERI BOILS SOY SAUCE & WATER

1366
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,910
-The genius chefs.
-All right.

1367
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:45,115
-It's a fierce round. It'll be intense.
-Cabbage.

1368
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,182
Who's the real Mozart?

1369
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,518
1. JULIENNE CABBAGE

1370
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,588
-Endive.
-Endive.

1371
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,657
They're using endive and cabbage.

1372
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,459
-He's salting endive.
-He's making kimchi with endive.

1373
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,663
He's making kimchi with endive?
He's salting it.

1374
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,031
I KNOW THIS!

1375
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,599
This was really famous in the past.

1376
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,367
-I've seen it in his book.
-Really?

1377
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,670
Is he making kimchi right now?

1378
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,571
He's putting salt between the leaves.

1379
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,373
This was published?

1380
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,808
It's like napa cabbage.

1381
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,243
-I see
-He'll make the seasoning

1382
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,446
-with tomato purée. It looks red.
-I see.

1383
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,449
-I know exactly what he's doing.
-How do you know it?

1384
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,984
You know what this dish is?

1385
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,320
I've read it in his book
and have seen it in a video.

1386
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,422
I have both of his books.

1387
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,058
ENOUGH, NAM-NO!

1388
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,893
-My gosh.
-Hey!

1389
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,029
THE SHOW-OFF KNOWS
HOW TO GRAB PEOPLE'S ATTENTION

1390
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,564
-We didn't know.
-He's more excessive.

1391
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:37,233
How does endive
taste different from napa cabbage?

1392
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,536
-It tastes more bitter.
-It does.

1393
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,171
-Yes.
-It's more bitter and crunchier.

1394
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,472
It's a new approach.

1395
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,808
Hyun-suk will make kimchi in 15 minutes.

1396
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,042
2. BOIL PUNCTURED TOMATOES

1397
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,044
He's making tomato <i>concasser.</i>

1398
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,647
-He's trying to peel the tomatoes.
-It's to peel those?

1399
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,083
-He's trying to… What?
<i>-Concasser.</i>

1400
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,285
SALIERI LOSES ALL HIS ATTENTION

1401
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,120
HE TRIES TO CATCH UP
BY QUICKLY CHOPPING ONION

1402
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,490
-Ho-young chops cabbage.
-Wait.

1403
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,392
He stops him as you talk.

1404
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,760
PUNISHING AN ATTEMPT
TO CHASE HIM!

1405
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,729
I think some went in here.

1406
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,164
-What if it became too salty?
-It must've gone inside.

1407
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,866
THE GENIUS LEAVES
MANY TRACES IN HIS JOURNEY

1408
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:10,934
DIDN'T GO IN

1409
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,569
<i>Chef Hyun-suk.</i>

1410
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:16,306
Stop salting the floor.
My shoes are ruined every time I go there.

1411
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,209
-My soles began to fall apart.
-Like the beach.

1412
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,844
-My gosh.
-He uses too much salt.

1413
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:24,047
-It's like a salt pond.
-Yes, that's true.

1414
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:27,951
2. PUT CHOPPED ONION IN COLD
WATER TO REMOVE THE ACRID TASTE

1415
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,755
THE HARDWORKING GENIUS
ALWAYS REMEMBERS THE BASICS

1416
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,691
THE FRIED SHRIMP GENIUS IS UP!

1417
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,459
MAKING HORIZONTAL CUTS

1418
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,560
What's that?

1419
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,295
What are you doing, Ho-young?

1420
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,498
I'm trying to… The shrimps.

1421
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,434
-He's stretching it out.
-He grabs it and stretches it out.

1422
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,836
SPREADING THE INGREDIENT
AS VERTICALLY AS YOU CAN

1423
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,671
HE MAKES LONG SLICES OF ZUCCHINI

1424
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:52,008
HE STACKS A FEW AND CUTS THEM!

1425
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,211
He's rolling the shrimp with that.

1426
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,681
-Ho-young wraps that around the shrimp.
-Is that cucumber?

1427
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,784
-Zucchini.
-It's zucchini.

1428
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,952
-Does it help with the shape?
-Yes.

1429
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,055
Hyun-suk captures takes more attention.

1430
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:07,957
3. DUNK TOMATOES IN COLD WATER,
PEEL

1431
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,727
I hear tomato peels are tough to digest.

1432
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,696
I think that's why he's peeling them.

1433
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,398
MAKING TOMATO PURÉE!

1434
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:21,304
4. GRIND PEELED AND DE-SEEDED
TOMATOES, BOIL IN A PAN

1435
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,341
This is taking Chef Ho-young a while.

1436
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:26,843
It requires a lot of work.

1437
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,445
-It's pretty, though.
-Shrimp and zucchini roll.

1438
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,380
-It takes a lot of work.
-It does.

1439
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,417
He twisted zucchini pieces on the shrimps.

1440
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,686
It's pretty. I love the shape.

1441
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,221
The fritters will look pretty.

1442
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,390
That took up almost five minutes.

1443
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,158
Ho-young grabs meat.

1444
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,593
Which cut is it?

1445
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,929
-It's striploin.
-Striploin.

1446
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,931
Ten minutes.

1447
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,432
Ten minutes left.

1448
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,135
MAKING THIN APPLE SLICES!

1449
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,772
Why are you using apple
to make tofu and kimchi?

1450
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,774
-I wonder.
-He's substituting for the pear.

1451
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,843
He used pear in the old recipe as radish.

1452
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,678
He knows the recipe by heart.

1453
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,580
Why is Nam-no answering everything?

1454
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,981
-I'm a fanboy.
-The fanboy.

1455
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,516
OKAY, THEN!

1456
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,952
ONE FOR THE FAN!

1457
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,922
We didn't know you were his fan.

1458
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,991
-Okay, now.
-That's it!

1459
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,962
IF YOU CAN DO IT,
I CAN DO IT TOO!

1460
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:20,029
EXCELLENT JOB!

1461
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,499
-A dunk shot.
-That's it!

1462
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,068
LET'S WORK HARD, EVERYONE!

1463
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,070
If Hyun-suk can do it, he can too.

1464
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,905
-Ten minutes left.
-What's that?

1465
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:33,176
5. SLAM THE STRIPLOIN AND SOFTEN
WITH A MEAT TENDERIZER

1466
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,277
What's he using?

1467
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,280
-It's a meat tenderizer.
-So that's a thing?

1468
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,482
It's to tenderize the meat.

1469
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,518
-It's ketchup.
-Ketchup?

1470
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,152
-He's using ketchup.
-Ketchup?

1471
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,387
-Ketchup.
-A little bit.

1472
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,856
-A little bit. He uses a little bit.
-A little bit.

1473
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,025
That's MoChoirt!

1474
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,861
Wait, Yul said he didn't like ketchup.

1475
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,130
Hence, only a little bit.

1476
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,067
I wouldn't have been sure
if he used a little more.

1477
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,136
That was great, Chef Hyun-suk.

1478
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,305
-"Hence, only a little bit."
-"A little bit."

1479
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,641
SALIERI MAKES THE SAUCE!

1480
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,876
Ho-young makes the sauce.

1481
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,245
Chef Eun-yeong's sauce,
her personal creation,

1482
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,215
earned her lots of points
in the previous round.

1483
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,184
THIS SAUCE IS ALSO
A PERSONAL CREATION OF SALIERI

1484
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,021
NEXT, BREADCRUMBS!

1485
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,557
-He's grinding bread.
-Bread.

1486
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:24,260
He'll coat the beef steak
with breadcrumbs.

1487
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,762
-He's making breadcrumbs.
-He is.

1488
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,697
He's using bread.

1489
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,400
Ho-young makes breadcrumbs.

1490
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,636
EGG, FRYING POWDER

1491
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,005
8. MIX FRYING POWDER, EGG,
AND WATER TO MAKE THE BATTER

1492
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,309
HE'S READY TO MAKE
BEEF STEAK CUTLET!

1493
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,777
DREDGE WITH FRYING BATTER

1494
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,079
He's coating the meat with breadcrumbs.

1495
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,014
9. DREDGE STRIPLOIN
WITH BATTER AND BREADCRUMBS

1496
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,449
MATURING FOR A SECOND

1497
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,751
HYUN-SUK FINISHES SALTING ENDIVE

1498
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,087
I think he's done salting the endive.

1499
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,388
HE'S DONE ALREADY?

1500
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,224
I wonder if that was enough time
to salt the endive.

1501
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,559
Was that enough?

1502
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,561
He has to wring it out.

1503
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,030
-He salted the endive.
-He's wringing it out.

1504
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,333
-What's he doing?
-What was that?

1505
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,001
-Endive.
-Endive?

1506
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,970
-Endive.
-He has to wring it out.

1507
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,005
White endive kimchi.

1508
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,208
-He already had his mother's white kimchi.
-He did.

1509
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,676
-Right.
-He could've used that.

1510
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:17,213
-But he didn't.
-He's wringing it out as much as he can.

1511
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,249
-He's anguished as he prays.
-Oh, no.

1512
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,952
The praying Mozart.

1513
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,687
-Look at him!
-It's Hyun-suk.

1514
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:25,855
My Lord!

1515
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,424
Please bless Salieri, who follows my suit.

1516
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,828
He blesses Salieri, not himself.

1517
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,029
It's his selfless side.

1518
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,264
BOILED TOMATO PURÉE

1519
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,667
He's cooling the purée.

1520
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,003
-After all, that's kimchi.
-He's chilling it.

1521
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,337
RICOTTA

1522
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,505
Is that cheese?

1523
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:43,806
-Ricotta.
-It's ricotta.

1524
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,276
Is he making tofu with ricotta?

1525
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:48,845
RICOTTA TOFU?

1526
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:49,979
Instead of tofu?

1527
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,448
So that it'll look like tofu and kimchi.

1528
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,084
He's making caprese salad.

1529
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,686
That's a genius idea.

1530
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,222
He's making tofu with cheese,

1531
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:03,259
and he'll also make kimchi on the spot.

1532
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,396
-Ricotta is like Italian tofu.
-I see.

1533
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,998
So he's making the shape?

1534
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,900
-The shape.
-He's a genius.

1535
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,935
Goodness, tofu. He's a genius.

1536
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,804
Do you hear me?

1537
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,806
What? Oh, we heard that.

1538
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,908
HE'S NOT A GENIUS AT ENGLISH…

1539
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,976
It's done.

1540
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,278
…BUT HE'S A GENIUS CHEF!

1541
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,714
WITNESS THE RICOTTA TOFU!

1542
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,583
He gets an ovation.

1543
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,053
That's amazing.

1544
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,622
That was ingenious, Hyun-suk.

1545
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,823
MoChoirt.

1546
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:34,891
HMPH! I CAN DO THAT MUCH

1547
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,027
Salieri is losing
everyone's attention to him.

1548
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:41,531
-We don't know what he's doing.
-We don't.

1549
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:42,765
10. MAKE FRYING BATTER

1550
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,402
HE MUST RECLAIM THE ATTENTION
AND MAKE THE FRITTERS!

1551
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:47,904
FINALLY!

1552
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,739
You have to fry those quickly.

1553
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,442
Chef Ho-young begins to deep-fry.

1554
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,777
-He's putting them in.
-Ho-young!

1555
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,680
He has to fry the beef steak cutlet too.

1556
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:58,981
Beef steak cutlet.

1557
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,149
With his hand?

1558
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,451
His bare hand?

1559
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,252
-With his hand?
-His hand?

1560
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,221
HE CAPTURES
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION!

1561
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:10,793
THE DEEP-FRY GENIUS ACKNOWLEDGED
BY THE COUNTRY OF TEMPURA

1562
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,931
-He's using his bare hand!
-My gosh!

1563
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,800
SALIERI MAKES IMMACULATE TEXTURE

1564
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,437
EVERYONE CLAPS

1565
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,439
Ho-young!

1566
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:24,540
Chef Hyun-suk!

1567
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,843
Can you put your hand in there too?

1568
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,212
RETURN AFTER
100 MORE YEARS OF TRAINING!

1569
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,715
-Did he shake off the water?
-He did.

1570
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,484
-He shook off the water.
-It was water.

1571
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,753
He's threatening him a little.

1572
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,588
He didn't pull it out, did he?

1573
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,823
APPLE AND ARUGULA

1574
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,892
He's making the kimchi seasoning.

1575
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:43,993
The kimchi seasoning?

1576
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,828
-That's impressive.
-Kimchi seasoning?

1577
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:49,699
-Is the sauce tomato?
-It's tomato purée.

1578
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,467
-It looks like kimchi.
-Like that?

1579
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,102
-Not bad.
-It's just like kimchi.

1580
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,971
KITCHEN KNIFE

1581
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,439
-The knife.
-It's in hot water.

1582
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,942
That way, it'll melt the cheese
and make the cut pretty.

1583
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,011
He heats up the knife.

1584
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,513
He warmed it up.

1585
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,214
-It looks real.
-It's like tofu.

1586
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,350
-That's ingenious.
-The texture looks insane.

1587
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,854
He cuts cheese as if it's tofu.

1588
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,524
-It looks like homemade tofu from here.
-It does.

1589
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,125
Five minutes.

1590
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,727
-You have five minutes!
-Five minutes!

1591
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,129
I think Salieri
is cooking to save himself.

1592
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,900
I think Salieri
is cooking to save himself.

1593
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,036
11. MAKE CUTLET SAUCE WITH

1594
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:29,906
SUGAR, COOKING WINE,
SOY SAUCE, TRUFFLE OIL

1595
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,911
HO-YOUNG'S PERSONAL SAUCE
INSPIRED BY TERIYAKI SAUCE

1596
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,780
-What's that? Salad?
-The coleslaw.

1597
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,448
-Coleslaw.
-Coleslaw?

1598
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,050
MAYONNAISE AND MUSTARD, CABBAGE

1599
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,118
ONION

1600
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:44,453
Look at the tofu.

1601
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,756
-It really looks like tofu.
-I see.

1602
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,924
He's making kimchi.

1603
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,560
-It looks realistic.
-That's kimchi.

1604
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,695
10. ADD FILLING INTO
THE SALTED ENDIVE

1605
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,665
-It looks just like tofu and kimchi.
-It does.

1606
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,166
-Yes.
-It's not, though.

1607
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,135
-It looks realistic.
-But it looks like it.

1608
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,803
That's so new.

1609
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,104
He's a genius.

1610
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,941
-All right.
-He's done.

1611
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,011
He finishes
3 minutes and 45 seconds before time.

1612
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:11,781
He finishes
3 minutes and 45 seconds before time.

1613
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,617
He didn't use all 15 minutes.

1614
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,319
That's amazing.

1615
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,189
CHEER EVEN LOUDER FOR ME!

1616
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,893
This means it didn't take him 12 minutes.

1617
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,029
-He's a genius.
-And he's fast.

1618
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,065
Ho-young fries beef steak cutlet now.

1619
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,132
Beef steak cutlet.

1620
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,102
The hardworking Salieri.
He's trying hard until the end.

1621
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,937
He's frying more food.

1622
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,373
-Deep-fried dishes.
-Shrimps take a lot of work.

1623
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,875
They look like snowflakes.

1624
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,977
THE INGENIOUS FRIED SHRIMP
IS FINISHED!

1625
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,413
-They look great.
-The zucchini did not come undone.

1626
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,017
AND HIS SECRET WEAPON,
BEEF STEAK CUTLET!

1627
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:49,085
Was it cooked well?

1628
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,920
He's also using endive.

1629
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,456
-Take your time.
-Ho-young.

1630
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,458
-Endive--
-Let me explain before you try this.

1631
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,194
Endive already tastes bitter,
and it becomes more bitter with salt.

1632
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,397
That's why I added sweetness with apple
to balance it out.

1633
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,567
-I see.
-It was an ingenious dish

1634
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,535
-with balanced flavor.
-We'll hear that later.

1635
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,839
Things are important for Ho-young,
so stay out of this.

1636
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,641
-The shrimps.
-This is Ho-young's time.

1637
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,476
Now, the beef steak cutlet.

1638
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,779
-Has it been cooked well?
-It has to be.

1639
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:19,081
-Was it overcooked?
-It looks good.

1640
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:21,851
-It got cooked perfectly.
-Was it?

1641
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,786
The shrimp and the steak both look good.

1642
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,555
-He judges Salieri.
-Salieri.

1643
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:29,158
Mozart has free time.

1644
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,427
Salieri is just cooking to save himself.

1645
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,930
Fifteen seconds.

1646
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,331
Fifteen seconds.

1647
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,600
That must taste so good.

1648
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,668
Hardworking Ho-young.

1649
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,437
-How can you beat that taste?
-Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

1650
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:42,738
-He fights with the taste.
-Six.

1651
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,608
-Five. Four. Three.
-Five. Four. Three.

1652
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,376
-Two. One.
-Two. One.

1653
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,644
Time's up.

1654
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,179
-It's time.
-Ring the bell.

1655
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,717
-I can't believe this is possible.
-Ho-young is done.

1656
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,118
That looks good.

1657
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,721
-That's new.
-We know this is already good.

1658
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,890
THE GENIUS ROUND ENDS!

1659
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:01,958
It looks like tofu.

1660
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,761
All right, now.

1661
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:09,265
Both ingenious dishes
were finished for Yul.

1662
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,499
THANK YOU

1663
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:13,202
AMADEUS,
THE CHEF & MY FRIDGE VER.

1664
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,037
It felt like I watched a play.

1665
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,272
-Right?
-It did.

1666
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,274
Which one of them will be chosen?

1667
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,510
Please try MoChoirt's dish first.

1668
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,847
THE MISMATCH OF
WHAT YOU SEE AND WHAT YOU TASTE

1669
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:29,185
CAPRESE SALAD
POSING AS TOFU AND KIMCHI

1670
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:33,990
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S MOCHOIRT

1671
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,860
-It looks just like tofu and kimchi.
-It does.

1672
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,062
I can only think of it that way.

1673
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,564
-It's obviously tofu and kimchi.
-Yes.

1674
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,133
-He'll need <i>makgeolli</i> with that.
-That's true.

1675
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,036
-I wonder what it's like.
-It's an Italian dish.

1676
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:51,207
It'll taste delicious if you top endive
with ricotta, the tofu.

1677
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:53,242
-I'll cut this in half.
-In half.

1678
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,112
We expect a certain taste
when it looks like tofu and kimchi.

1679
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,015
Please try some.

1680
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,083
SNIFFING

1681
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,318
ENTRANCED

1682
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,487
Will it taste like kimchi?

1683
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,821
A BIG BITE

1684
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:08,157
Will it have the tofu and kimchi texture?

1685
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:10,760
It's crunchy like salad.

1686
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,396
It looks like he's eating tofu and kimchi.

1687
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,699
HE QUIETLY TAKES ANOTHER BITE

1688
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,769
-It won't taste like kimchi.
-It's not kimchi.

1689
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,570
But it looks like it.

1690
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:25,841
It must be confusing when you taste
something different than what you see.

1691
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,410
It must be inspirational.

1692
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:28,978
CLAPS RIGHT AWAY

1693
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,447
He starts with an applause.

1694
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,815
I think

1695
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,316
he truly is a genius.

1696
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,452
ACKNOWLEDGES
MOCHOIRT AS A GENIUS

1697
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,989
When he said he'd make tofu and kimchi,

1698
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,224
I couldn't think outside the box.

1699
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,994
But this was
beyond anything I could imagine.

1700
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,464
I feel like he suggested
a different kind of realm

1701
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,333
that I never would have thought possible.

1702
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,002
-It's fascinating.
-I see.

1703
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,838
Actually, how long ago did you make this?

1704
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,574
-I made it 19 years ago.
-It was 19 years ago.

1705
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,477
He pulled out something from 19 years ago.

1706
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:06,315
-He's reusing this.
-Now, back then, I used fresh mozzarella.

1707
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,152
This time, I used ricotta
and made it melt in his mouth,

1708
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:13,089
and I used apple
to add a refreshing flavor.

1709
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,024
-That's all he had.
-Those were in his fridge.

1710
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,427
A genius continues to develop.

1711
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,396
He's a genius at making excuses.

1712
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:23,065
-He's such a genius.
-He is.

1713
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,634
-Can you consider that?
-Okay.

1714
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,970
Did it give you that eureka moment?

1715
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,306
It gave me that eureka moment,

1716
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,842
and it also stabbed me in the back.

1717
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,077
-You were caught off guard?
-Yes.

1718
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,047
If this was a menu at a restaurant,

1719
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:42,051
-I'd order this every single time.
-I see.

1720
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,220
It would also be perfect

1721
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,389
-with a glass of wine.
-It would be great.

1722
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,626
-I see. As a snack with wine.
-You're right. It sounds perfect.

1723
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:55,598
However, I do understand
why he wrung out the endive.

1724
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:56,966
WHY DID HE WRING IT OUT?

1725
01:08:57,032 --> 01:09:01,403
It might have been better
if it had even less moisture.

1726
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,739
He would've had more grip strength
19 years ago.

1727
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,841
-Was it a matter of his energy?
-Yes.

1728
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,811
-That can happen.
-Many years have passed.

1729
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:12,882
He had time, so if he couldn't do it,
it had to be his energy level.

1730
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,917
MoChoirt couldn't wring it out.

1731
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,553
-MoChoirt couldn't wring it out.
-He couldn't.

1732
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:22,291
-He couldn't wring it out anymore!
-MoChoirt couldn't do it!

1733
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,026
-It's…
-He couldn't.

1734
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:28,497
Adding salt to raw endive
will bring out its bitterness.

1735
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,433
It would've tasted even more bitter
if it dried out even more.

1736
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,137
I'd like to recommend some moisture
for better balance of the entire dish.

1737
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:36,572
UNDERSTOOD

1738
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,840
I understand what you mean.

1739
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,376
Next, Chef Ho-young's dish.

1740
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,844
-One, two, three, Fry.
-Fry.

1741
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:45,948
THE DEEP-FRY GENIUS'S BEEF STEAK
CUTLET AND ZUCCHINI SHRIMP

1742
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,818
SERVED WITH TRUFFLE TERIYAKI
SAUCE AND COLESLAW

1743
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,089
CHEF JUNG HO-YOUNG'S FRY

1744
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,927
He served two deep-fried dishes
and coleslaw.

1745
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,797
First, try the shrimp served on endive.

1746
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:05,467
You can pour a bit of sauce
and take a bite.

1747
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,570
The same goes for the beef steak cutlet.

1748
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,939
Try one as is, and another with the sauce.

1749
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,675
Lastly, refresh your palate with coleslaw.

1750
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,277
It's tough to beat this combination.

1751
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,746
-It looks good.
-Zucchini and shrimp.

1752
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,181
He can compare this with that.

1753
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,817
You used raw endive, right?

1754
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,719
-Yes, it's raw.
-That's raw.

1755
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,688
-But that's salted and wrung out.
-And wrung out.

1756
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,189
TAKING A BIG BITE

1757
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,225
-It looks good.
-Listen to the sound.

1758
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,628
The endive sounds crunchy,
as well as the fried shrimp.

1759
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,231
-Ho-young is best at deep-fried dishes.
-That's right.

1760
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,333
-That's why he fried those.
-It must be good.

1761
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,968
-It looks good.
-Does it have good balance?

1762
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,971
HE FINISHES THE REST

1763
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,772
CUTS OFF THE TAIL

1764
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:44,907
I want that tail.

1765
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,108
Is it good?

1766
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,677
-My gosh.
-He's amazed.

1767
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,879
He's really good at deep-frying.

1768
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,748
-He is?
-He's the deep-frying genius.

1769
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,284
-Did you add truffle oil?
-Yes.

1770
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:58,254
<i>I mixed teriyaki sauce</i>
<i>with a bit of truffle oil.</i>

1771
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,855
Into the sauce.

1772
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:00,990
MORE FLAVOR WITH TRUFFLE OIL

1773
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,726
When did he make that sauce?

1774
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,860
Beef steak cutlet.

1775
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:05,995
NEXT, BEEF STEAK CUTLET

1776
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,429
I wonder if it's cooked well.

1777
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,399
A BITE WITHOUT THE SAUCE

1778
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,067
ALSO TAKES AN AIR BITE

1779
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,669
ASTONISHED

1780
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,004
It's so soft

1781
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,206
that it almost melts like ricotta.

1782
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,441
-My gosh.
-I mean it.

1783
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,043
-It just disappeared.
-It's that soft.

1784
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:25,514
How could beef melt like ricotta?

1785
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,284
I used a meat tenderizer
that comes with lots of pins.

1786
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,519
<i>I used that a few times on the meat</i>

1787
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:33,522
<i>to create holes in the meat,</i>
<i>which makes it much more tender.</i>

1788
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,191
-I see.
-Beef steak cutlet should be cooked

1789
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:39,094
<i>-for only a minute at 190 °C.</i>
<i>-A minute?</i>

1790
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:42,598
But shrimps should be cooked
for a minute and a half at 170 °C.

1791
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,934
I had to use the right time,
so they were cooked differently.

1792
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,436
You calculated the time?

1793
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,138
-It's on the screen.
-You're a genius.

1794
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,639
-I am.
-My gosh.

1795
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:51,974
That guy.

1796
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,109
Look at that.

1797
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,645
-In the sauce?
-It looks good.

1798
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,647
-It must be heavenly.
-I'm craving the cutlet.

1799
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,417
-It'd go well with meat.
-That goes well with meat.

1800
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,985
AMAZED AS SOON AS HE HAS A BITE

1801
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,520
-It must be good.
-Salieri.

1802
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:08,090
He's a genius at deep-frying food.

1803
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,025
Salieri brings out the flavor!

1804
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,761
-Oh, Mozart.
-Now, the coleslaw.

1805
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,701
This was ordinary.

1806
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:23,672
It's the simple flavor you think of
when you hear the word coleslaw.

1807
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,674
So it wasn't ingenious?

1808
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,543
Was he just gifted?

1809
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,679
It should've been, "One, two, three, Fry."
But it had two.

1810
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,982
He only fried up to two, but not three.

1811
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,951
Why couldn't you deep-fry the salad?

1812
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,886
Deep-fry salad?

1813
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,621
I should have.

1814
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,658
-But the first two were good.
-It's not the main dish.

1815
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,526
These two had such a huge impression,

1816
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:47,529
-so it's okay to have this as a side dish.
-It's a side dish.

1817
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:51,166
-Let's try Hyun-suk's dish first.
-Some for Jae-wook.

1818
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:52,234
MoChoirt.

1819
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,970
Try one tofu with each bite.

1820
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,107
-The balance is good with lots of ricotta.
-I see.

1821
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,009
DEEPLY MOVED?

1822
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,979
He looks shocked.

1823
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,449
He must be Mozart.

1824
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,852
Food isn't just about the flavor,

1825
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:13,322
because it's something you can enjoy
with all five senses,

1826
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,691
and we should consider all those.

1827
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,893
In that aspect, he surely is a genius.

1828
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,094
CAN'T DENY HIS BRILLIANCE

1829
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,796
-Did you notice his ingenuity?
-Yes.

1830
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,032
-The impulsive, cheeky,
-Impulsive.

1831
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:27,836
-cocky, and immature Mozart.
-I see.

1832
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,338
-That Mozart.
-However,

1833
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,808
the sound of peace he gave birth to

1834
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,444
was truly gentle and relaxing.

1835
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,446
That's an actual line.

1836
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,849
-It's the perfect line for him.
-It is.

1837
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,451
Good grief.

1838
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,486
Everyone hates him.

1839
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:45,954
He died early.

1840
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:48,857
Are you cursing him?

1841
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:49,992
IMMERSION ISN'T A CRIME

1842
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,429
When you look at it,
it feels like tofu and kimchi.

1843
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,798
<i>So it confuses you with its flavor.</i>

1844
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:59,735
He said what he did
was the process of deceiving your palate.

1845
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,404
-It's the first version with ricotta.
-Wasn't it even nicer?

1846
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,640
I liked it better with its sweet flavor,

1847
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:08,343
which goes better
with the bitterness of the endive.

1848
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,914
There's an expression
I can use to describe this dish.

1849
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,683
It's called trompe-l'œil, a French word.

1850
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,019
It means an illusion to your eyes.

1851
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,687
-Yes.
-An illusion to your eyes.

1852
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:23,392
I thought it was an ingenious dish.

1853
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,161
Let's try Chef Ho-young's dish.

1854
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,763
He fried these so well.

1855
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,799
-Is it good?
-He's so good at this.

1856
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,535
It's still crunchy.

1857
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,006
-He's a genius of flavor.
-Genius of flavor.

1858
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:41,243
That was the most delicious
beef steak cutlet of my life.

1859
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,578
It was so good.

1860
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,613
The most delicious
beef steak cutlet he had.

1861
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,616
Chef Hyun-suk was a genius
who thought outside the box,

1862
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:50,652
while Chef Ho-young proved himself
as a genius of texture.

1863
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,856
The crunchiness of the fries
and the coleslaw matches perfectly.

1864
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:57,993
-A genius who knows how to create flavor.
-That's true.

1865
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,295
It must be tough to make a decision.

1866
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:03,198
-They're the two leads in the play.
-That's it.

1867
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,901
The two characters made these two dishes.

1868
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,403
<i>Press one for Jung Ho-young,</i>

1869
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,906
<i>and press two for Choi Hyun-suk.</i>

1870
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,075
I want to thank both chefs.

1871
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,543
-He pressed it.
-He did.

1872
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,712
Will it be Mozart, Choi Hyun-suk?

1873
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:18,447
Or will it be Salieri, Jung Ho-young?

1874
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,849
Let's find out his choice!

1875
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,351
Show us!

1876
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,786
An ingenious dish to make Mozart cry.

1877
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:29,758
Will Hyun-suk remain
the first place chef of the show?

1878
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,794
Or will Ho-young win against him

1879
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:36,198
and finally earn his tenth victory?

1880
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:39,768
Who did Yul choose?
Who was more ingenious?

1881
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,238
Whose dish did you choose?

1882
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,040
Show us!

1883
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,076
CHOI HYUN-SUK WINS

1884
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,078
CHEF CHOI HYUN-SUK'S
MOCHOIRT WINS

1885
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,748
Choi Hyun-suk wins!

1886
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:56,985
-Choi Hyun-suk's MoChoirt wins!
-MoChoirt.

1887
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,721
So this is how it ends.

1888
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:01,857
It was so hard to choose.

1889
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:02,925
It can't be helped.

1890
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:07,996
He helped me think outside the box
in a way I couldn't have done myself.

1891
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,633
So I thought his dish
was more appropriate for the order.

1892
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,635
I'd like to make an honest confession.

1893
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,370
I'm not a genius.

1894
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:18,173
I've even had to practice
making the same dish 130 times.

1895
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:23,011
-So please remember me as hardworking.
-He means that he makes hidden efforts.

1896
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,947
Well, even geniuses have to put in work.

1897
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,950
-However, the production crew reached out.
-Yes?

1898
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,918
They said your speech was too boring,

1899
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,854
so they're thinking of cutting it out.

1900
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:36,725
-They want a cockier version from you.
-Yes, an arrogant version.

1901
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,660
I can't believe this.

1902
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,896
All of you up there
are trying to destroy me too.

1903
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,065
-Okay.
-Show your character.

1904
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,266
THE GENIUS VER. SPEECH, ACTION!

1905
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,335
Did you think you could win?

1906
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,905
There's only one way to win against me.

1907
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,107
Be born as Choi Hyun-suk
in your next life.

1908
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,942
THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE HYUN-SUK

1909
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:55,243
He delivered.

1910
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,045
May I change my decision?

1911
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,916
We got to see
what Hyun-suk was really made of.

1912
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:03,518
Please put a star on him!

1913
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:06,188
-Chef Hyun-suk takes another star.
-Thank you.

1914
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,823
He now has 14 stars!

1915
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,626
Congratulations, Hyun-suk!

1916
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,060
He's running out of space.

1917
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,864
<i>This is the team round</i>
<i>the entire country has been waiting for.</i>

1918
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,299
FULL OF ANTICIPATION

1919
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,102
<i>The polished male lead</i>
<i>and the sassy female lead,</i>

1920
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,037
Team Jong-won and Poong.

1921
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,639
Let's go, my baby!

1922
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,208
-Right here?
-<i>Ramyeon</i> soup base?

1923
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,876
<i>He has abandoned his ethical standards.</i>

1924
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:28,910
Sugar.

1925
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,146
-Pour it in.
-Jong-won has a reputation to live up to.

1926
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,381
That's it. Good job!

1927
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,982
Will he be tempted by Poong's ways?

1928
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,450
The doppelgänger chemistry,

1929
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:38,787
Yoon Nam-no and Kwon Sung-jun
are up against them.

1930
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:39,955
Who's the leader here?

1931
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:40,956
RAISING HANDS

1932
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,457
What? Drop it.

1933
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:44,326
-Sugar. Okay.
-I found sugar.

1934
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,328
-What about the rolled sushi?
-It's coming.

1935
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,796
-They have good teamwork.
-Right?

1936
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,031
WHAT IF HE STARTS FIRE?

1937
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,066
So? Don't I look cool?

1938
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,334
HE'LL START A FIRE TOO

1939
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,202
THE FRIDGE OWNER,
JAE-WOOK, IS PLEASED

1940
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,804
-The rolled omelet is burnt!
-It's okay.

1941
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,239
It's burnt? Yes!

1942
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,573
YOUR MISFORTUNE

1943
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,275
IS OUR BEST LUCK

1944
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,044
HOW WILL THIS
CRAZIEST TEAM ROUND END?

1945
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:06,815
I'm crying.

1946
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,551
Does the flavor make you cry?

1947
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:24,332
