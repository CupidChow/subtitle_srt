1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,549
Two polar opposite guests are
here with us today,

2
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,852
Sunwoo Yong-yeo and Lee Joon.

3
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,087
First of all, have you all heard?

4
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,489
Yes, I have.

5
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,091
-It's the biggest talk in town right now.
-What news?

6
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,393
I heard she's watching our show.

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,829
Yes, an amazing person
is watching our show.

8
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,798
We heard that Natalie Portman

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,667
really loves <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>.

10
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:53,720
<i>People commented on the video and said</i>
<i>we should have her on the show.</i>

11
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,655
<i>-We should.</i>
<i>-Let's make it happen.</i>

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,157
The funniest comment I saw said,

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,359
"She knows who Poong is?"

14
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,594
-That's true.
-Does she really know me?

15
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,596
She must've seen you make the loaches.

16
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>Do you think she saw my loaches?</i>

17
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>That's embarrassing.</i>

18
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,402
DON'T WATCH… PLEASE WATCH…
NO, DON'T WATCH…

19
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,905
She also said she wanted to visit Korea.

20
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,075
EVERYONE STARTS GREETING HER

21
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,744
THEIR SHORT ENGLISH VOCABULARY

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,112
PLZ COME VISIT KOREA

23
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:23,349
Anyway, I hear Chef Sung-jun has something
he wants to say to Natalie Portman.

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,684
-Sung-jun?
-Yes.

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,920
Hello, Ms. Natalie Portman.

26
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,621
VERY RESPECTFUL

27
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,990
As someone whose name
also begins with Na…

28
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:33,927
-Na?
-You're a Kwon.

29
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,562
-Napoli Matfia.
-I'm Napoli Matfia.

30
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,764
-Yes, Napoli Matfia.
-That begins with Na.

31
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,167
-Our names are both 6 syllables in Korean.
-He finds the weirdest similarity.

32
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,070
-I'd like to invite you. Please join us.
-He found one.

33
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,907
Anyway, until the day
Natalie joins us on <i>Chef & My Fridge</i>,

34
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,677
-we'll continue to do our best.
-Yes.

35
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,814
Joon, I heard you had a special reason
why you joined us here today.

36
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,683
I'm doing a musical.

37
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,351
-You are?
-Yes.

38
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,254
It's called <i>Even If This Love Disappears</i>
<i>from the World Tonight</i>.

39
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,556
-Tonight?
-It's a romantic musical,

40
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,492
and I'm playing a high school student.

41
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,594
-A high school student?
-High school?

42
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,562
Yes, I know I look so 38.

43
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,464
THE INFAMOUS OLD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT!

44
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,601
But it'll be fine. I seem to do well.

45
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,137
-It seemed fine after the rehearsal.
-Was it?

46
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,104
It sounds fun.

47
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,574
Joon is the complete opposite of Yong-yeo,

48
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,178
who drives her Mercedes
and eats breakfast at a hotel buffet.

49
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,946
He's famous as the frugal idol star.

50
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,115
You created buzz
by eating at a library cafeteria.

51
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,218
-Cafeterias serve very good food.
-Right.

52
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,653
Not only can I save on time,

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,456
but I can take as much food as I want,
so I don't make waste.

54
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,457
I really hate to waste food.

55
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,058
-I see.
-That's so true.

56
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,060
I basically love cafeteria food, period.

57
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,762
Even in elementary and middle school,

58
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,898
I'd even take some home in a plastic bag.

59
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,800
Because it was that good?

60
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,202
Because there were leftovers.

61
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,137
When everyone is done eating,
there are leftovers,

62
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,805
-which they'll throw away.
-Yes.

63
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,042
So I'd bring black plastic bags,
take dishes like

64
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,311
seasoned eggplants and bean sprouts,
and give them to my mom.

65
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,979
She'd go, "Good job."

66
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,682
Isn't this so efficient?

67
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,518
We can eat those side dishes for days.

68
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,587
Because I got a kick out of doing this,

69
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,990
I got permission from the principal
to work on the school garden.

70
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,226
I asked, "May I take care of the garden?"

71
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,594
So I planted eggplants.

72
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,229
You went to school to make a living.

73
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,730
And I grew eggplants, so

74
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,333
-I harvested those and gave them to Mom.
-Was she happy again?

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,035
-She was. And it's free.
-Yes, of course.

76
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,736
I just bought the seeds from the store.

77
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,207
You're so unbelievable.

78
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,343
He also says at times,
he wasn't portrayed in the right way.

79
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,880
There were some misunderstandings
he wanted to undo.

80
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,951
I debuted back in 2008,

81
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:42,155
I was portrayed as frugal
in variety shows back in the day.

82
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,324
-Yes.
-And the story kept coming up,

83
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,693
but I didn't think
I was the same at this point.

84
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,262
My values have changed over time.

85
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,031
-You aren't that frugal.
-Not that much.

86
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,633
I save when I should,

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,535
but I also splurge when I don't have to.

88
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,869
-Of course.
-However,

89
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,538
it's funny how your image sticks.

90
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,440
I feel self-conscious
when I go to department stores

91
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,409
and walk into an expensive store,
although I'm there to spend my money.

92
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,479
-Why is Lee Joon here?
-Yes, that's what I mean.

93
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,681
-That frugal guy is at a department store.
-I see.

94
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,552
I mentioned kimchi fried rice
just once on <i>Radio Star</i>,

95
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,388
that I ate it every single day
at that time.

96
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,056
I don't eat it anymore.

97
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,392
But people still ask,
"You only eat kimchi fried rice, right?"

98
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,160
FOR OVER 14 YEARS? COME ON

99
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,329
-You had to establish your character.
-That's right.

100
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,933
People who are frugal
think of efficiency when they spend money.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,935
Efficiency is everything for me.

102
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,970
He's not the frugal idol star.
He's the efficient one.

103
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,039
Is it important when it comes to food?

104
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,009
Actually, food is the one thing
that needs to be the most efficient.

105
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,844
-What do you mean?
-In what way?

106
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,913
It may be hard to understand,
but I believe

107
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,615
the moment you eat your food,

108
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,083
that's it.

109
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,185
-It disappears.
-Yes, you eat it, it's gone.

110
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,788
And I'm very indifferent about taste.

111
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,923
It doesn't matter
if you eat something good or not.

112
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,759
-In the end, you're full.
-Yes.

113
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,093
That's why I…

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,094
It's a sign that you're doomed.

115
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,298
-Does it mean he's doomed?
-He's doomed.

116
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,267
When I was in the worst spot,
I even ate only rice.

117
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,036
-What?
-Just rice?

118
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,337
I was that lazy.

119
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,639
There are videos of rice harvest.

120
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,941
-Rice harvest?
-On the Internet?

121
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,944
When people reap the actual rice?

122
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,646
When you eat it as you watch the video,

123
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,848
it tastes good. It really does.

124
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,583
At times, I just eat rice and kimchi,

125
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,086
-so I watch people making kimchi.
-I see.

126
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,587
Then it really tastes better.

127
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,290
-Like putting up a dried fish?
-It's like that fable.

128
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,626
-You eat your food and watch the video?
-Eat and watch.

129
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,560
Yes.

130
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,929
-If you're going to do that…
-He gets his energy from that.

131
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,166
…wouldn't it be easier
if you threw in <i>sundae</i> and <i>tteokbokki</i>

132
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,601
into a blender, and drink it as juice?

133
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,905
-It's the same and the fastest.
-Yes.

134
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,807
That's a great tip.

135
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,608
How is that a great tip?

136
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,211
How is that a great tip?

137
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,847
Wouldn't it be great if we could
take a pill and feel full?

138
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:48,848
Is that the best?

139
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,417
He keeps talking about efficiency,

140
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,354
but in my opinion, he just sounds cheap.

141
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,423
He's not even cheap. He's just Scrooge.

142
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,958
He's like Scrooge.

143
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,661
-That's so not true.
-He's just Scrooge.

144
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,230
-He still takes allowances from his mom.
-I see.

145
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,099
Aren't you old enough to give it to her?

146
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,968
Don't you live alone now?
How do you take the allowances?

147
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,172
When I'm too busy to meet her as often,

148
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,608
she'd leave it in my locker at the gym.

149
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,610
Your mom?

150
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,114
I have no idea, either.
The money's just there without her.

151
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,982
It's like a dark market transaction.
Just the cash?

152
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,617
-Is it in cash?
-Yes.

153
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,620
He must've given all his earnings to her.

154
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,722
-I bought her a home and a car too.
-See?

155
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,090
You've done enough.

156
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,892
You bought her a house,

157
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,527
a car,

158
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,561
a fridge,

159
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,764
-and a piano.
-He's such a good son.

160
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,367
-I'd give him allowances too.
-You would.

161
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,903
-She'd go to the gym and leave it.
-I would too.

162
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,939
-You're such a good son.
-He is.

163
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,409
It's time to go through Joon's fridge.

164
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,511
But this isn't his fridge.

165
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,880
-What?
-He brought someone else's fridge.

166
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,549
-This can't happen on our show.
-We can't do that.

167
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,351
When I first got the offer,

168
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,486
I wanted to come, but I was flustered too.

169
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,321
My fridge at home

170
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,891
only has water and sugar-free colas.

171
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,795
But I wanted to be on the show,
so I couldn't find a way around it.

172
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,730
I wondered what I could do

173
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,332
and realized my mom was
my immediate family.

174
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,902
-Your mom?
-So isn't it the same?

175
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:16,803
She's your immediate family.

176
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,306
And I go there once a week
and eat her food too.

177
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,875
We once shared the same fridge.

178
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,311
And you bought the fridge.

179
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,046
You're right. That's his fridge.

180
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,449
-That's true.
-You bought the fridge.

181
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,418
So we came to an agreement
and got to be on the show.

182
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,953
That was honest of him.

183
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,290
When his mother gave us her fridge,

184
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,493
she also gave our production crew
a handwritten letter.

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,030
-She must want to share something with us.
-A handwritten letter?

186
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,898
That's really touching.

187
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,734
-My gosh.
-It's an actual letter.

188
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,337
"Hello, I'm Joon's mom."

189
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,806
"His home is
exactly 15 minutes away from mine."

190
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:58,644
"Whenever he comes, he suddenly calls
and says, 'Mom, I'm leaving now,'

191
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,446
and he arrives within ten minutes."

192
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,384
"He can't hold back his hunger,
so he'll start eating just rice

193
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,488
-when I'm not done cooking."
-Come on!

194
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,388
I hate that.

195
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,091
-Why do you do that?
-That's so annoying.

196
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,496
"That's why I go on high alert
whenever he says he's coming."

197
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:20,600
"But he's not a picky eater,
so he eats whatever I serve."

198
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,635
"If the chefs make him something

199
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,538
within 15 minutes with new ideas,

200
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,575
I'll watch the show
and try to copy your recipe."

201
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,079
"Good luck, chefs!" That was her letter.

202
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,680
HE CAN FEEL HIS MOM'S SINCERITY

203
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,350
You can't suddenly call her
and go over to eat.

204
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,019
She's been doing 15-minute challenges
without realizing it.

205
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,722
You're right.
She's doing <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> all the time.

206
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,924
Perhaps he was being considerate.

207
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,392
If he goes over after an hour or two,

208
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,327
his mom may make too much food.

209
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,029
-Right.
-That might be it.

210
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,531
-"Don't make too much food."
-Yes.

211
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,133
Maybe he calls at the last minute
to eat something simple.

212
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,771
And now, let's find out
what's in Joon's fridge,

213
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,806
no, to be exact, his mother's fridge.

214
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,444
He still has a share in this fridge
because he bought it for her.

215
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,481
We present Joon's fridge,

216
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,385
-to be more exact, his mother's fridge.
-His mother's fridge.

217
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,021
ALL EYES ON THE FRIDGE

218
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,055
-His mother's fridge.
-His mother's fridge.

219
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,591
-Whoa.
-Hey.

220
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,493
-It's not so bad.
-It's not bad.

221
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,595
There are lots of things in here.

222
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,097
I don't see any delivery food or takeout.

223
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,966
-No delivery food.
-Right?

224
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,534
Honey and tofu.

225
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,902
I don't see any instant food.

226
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,470
My mom is

227
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,339
just like Yong-yeo.

228
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,908
-She doesn't eat any MSG…
-I see.

229
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,577
…and she doesn't enjoy soup.

230
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,146
She's pretty much the same as Yong-yeo.

231
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,248
What's in this one?

232
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,450
Is that <i>mak-doenjang</i>?

233
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,154
-It doesn't look like regular <i>doenjang</i>.
-Something's mixed inside.

234
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,023
These look like sunflower seeds.

235
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,792
There are many things inside.

236
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,327
-It looks homemade.
-Do you know what it is?

237
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,828
Well…

238
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,964
-No.
-Yes? No?

239
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,866
His mom knew he wouldn't know,
so she told us.

240
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,804
His grandmother on mom's side
added kelp and other things

241
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,472
to make this homemade <i>doenjang</i>.

242
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,107
-Kelp?
-Yes.

243
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,811
She'd make stew with this
when her son comes home.

244
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,879
-Yes, that's good. It's really good.
-Yes.

245
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,249
-I know what that is. It's good.
-You get it, right?

246
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,318
It's because he ate just the rice.

247
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,154
There are lots of vegetables.

248
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,123
-Yes.
-There's a lot.

249
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,459
-Cucumbers, chives…
-Mushrooms.

250
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,760
…and mushrooms.

251
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,630
-Paprikas and radishes.
-Paprikas and zucchinis.

252
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,231
-Yes, she keeps paprikas.
-There are lots.

253
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,967
-Zucchinis, onions, and more.
-Yes.

254
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,470
Do you still keep a garden?

255
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,738
THE EGGPLANT FROM THE GARDEN?

256
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,839
Wait.

257
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,674
-Do you still keep a garden?
-Do you?

258
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,442
There's more than one.

259
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,845
There are lots of eggplants.
You must enjoy these.

260
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,213
I do, very much.

261
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,681
That's why she kept eggplants.

262
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:53,252
That was why you grew eggplants at school
and brought those home as a kid.

263
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,720
You're right.

264
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,921
What's this?

265
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,923
Marigold.

266
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,325
-Marigold.
-What's that?

267
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,426
Those are edible.

268
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,895
-These are… Oh, flower tea.
-Flower tea.

269
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,497
-My mom…
-Rose of Sharon.

270
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,132
-She has rose of Sharon tea?
-Rose of Sharon.

271
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,333
She must enjoy flower tea.

272
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,703
-She always boils stuff.
-Your mom?

273
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,371
-She must like flower tea.
-Instead of water.

274
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,639
The freezer.

275
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,809
-Look at the meat.
-What's in the freezer?

276
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,210
Beef.

277
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,645
These are short ribs.

278
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,980
-Short ribs sound good.
-Yes.

279
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,314
-Do you like meat?
-I do.

280
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,917
When my mom cooks, she always gives me

281
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,253
either fish or meat as the main dish.

282
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,821
Yes, moms do that.

283
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,389
-It's fast to make.
-She can grill them in 15 minutes.

284
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:34,393
We also found out that
she doesn't enjoy meat.

285
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,496
-Those are all for her son.
-It's all for him.

286
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,932
She keeps all this meat for her son.

287
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,769
It's like that one song about how mom says
she didn't like something her son liked.

288
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,472
Your mom said she didn't like meat!

289
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,741
That's the heart of a mom.

290
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,242
I had no idea!

291
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,178
Yet she kept all these for her son.

292
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,413
Have you ever had
braised short ribs at home?

293
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,615
-It takes a while.
-It's been a while.

294
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,884
-Isn't that so?
-Yes, it's been long.

295
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,188
The one dish she wanted to make
for her son was

296
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,490
-braised short ribs.
-Gosh.

297
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,025
But she didn't have time.

298
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,329
However, her son would barge in
within 15 minutes.

299
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,331
-She can't do that in 15 minutes.
-She never had the time.

300
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,999
She can't make that in 15 minutes.

301
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,403
That's why she kept the meat in there.

302
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,905
She was waiting for a chance
to make it for you.

303
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,808
These ingredients sit here
with her lingering sadness.

304
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,644
She wanted to make that for you.

305
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,781
-Goodness.
-She knows that you love meat.

306
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,817
-This is the bad son episode.
-Gosh.

307
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,886
-The bad son idol star.
-The bad son idol star.

308
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,488
The bad son idol star.

309
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,124
I meant an idol star
who is also a passionately devoted son.

310
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,160
But if one of our chefs manages to make
braised short ribs in 15 minutes,

311
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,895
that changes everything.

312
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,730
We need Doctor Strange to do that.

313
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,266
-It probably needs to be steamed.
-No?

314
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,401
The second shelf.

315
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,870
Dried and shredded pollack.

316
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,073
-And salmon.
-And salmon.

317
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,575
-Mussels.
-Mussels and Manila clams.

318
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,944
I see lots of seafood, including fish.

319
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,480
Shrimps. Do you like shrimps?

320
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,650
I do. I really like seafood.

321
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,752
I have a sudden question.

322
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,654
When people roast shrimp over salt,

323
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,292
why do people peel the shell
before they eat it?

324
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,761
-The shrimp shell?
-Why do people peel it?

325
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,365
Because we usually lay out coarse salt
when we roast shrimps, right?

326
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,567
I eat those as is.

327
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,469
-What?
-Shrimps?

328
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,670
It's because

329
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,540
-the shell must be seasoned with salt.
-Right.

330
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,175
So when I eat it as is, it tastes salty.

331
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,710
If you're going to peel it,
why bother using salt?

332
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,312
He has a point.

333
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,849
I believe the salt isn't used
to season the shrimps.

334
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,019
-The moisture.
-It's to remove extra moisture

335
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,587
and give it a chewy texture.

336
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,123
-I see.
-And salt doesn't burn.

337
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,593
And most people don't eat it
because the shell is hard and tough.

338
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,261
It stabs the top of your mouth.

339
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,696
Do you have strong teeth?

340
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,798
I just put up with it.

341
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,333
THE ONE WHO ENDURES RISES TO THE TOP

342
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,368
You just put up with it?

343
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,570
He just puts up with it?

344
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,606
It's not easy to see
what your palate is like

345
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,441
by looking at your mom's fridge.

346
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,177
Basically speaking,
I say thanks to everything.

347
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,679
-Thanks to everything.
-Thanks to everything.

348
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,014
-People his age would eat anything.
-Anything.

349
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,983
-You welcome everything.
-Everything.

350
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,651
Do you enjoy
all spicy, salty, and sweet food?

351
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,387
Yes, it can even be overly sweet.

352
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,090
He's one of us.

353
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,926
Let's find out his orders.

354
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,795
What are his orders?

355
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,263
Here's the first one.

356
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,732
-<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> cafeteria.
-Cafeteria.

357
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,469
I knew this would happen
when he said he liked cafeteria food.

358
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,037
Can you tell us about it?

359
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,673
First of all, efficiency is everything.

360
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,775
-It is.
-That's the kind of life I lived.

361
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:41,814
I want to eat something that's efficient.

362
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,916
-Do you need it on the food tray?
-Yes.

363
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,952
-It has to be on that tray.
-Only on that tray.

364
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,888
-You have to fill up the slots.
-Right.

365
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,789
-We'll have to move quickly.
-It won't be easy.

366
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,858
Here's the second order.

367
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,995
-Special mission, mom's challenge.
-Special mission, mom's challenge.

368
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,330
Special mission, mom's challenge.

369
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,866
-Do you remember her letter?
-Yes.

370
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,602
This was an order from his mother.

371
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,104
The ingredients may be the same,

372
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,172
but she wants something new,

373
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,675
new ideas for something she can make
in 15 minutes.

374
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,343
Other than the chefs who went last week,

375
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,314
we have Eun-yeong, Poong,
Nam-no, and Sung-jun left.

376
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,049
Please make your choices.

377
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,119
-I'd like to go first.
-Sung-jun!

378
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,654
It wasn't a cafeteria,

379
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,058
but I was the military cook
for Corps Five.

380
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,226
You were a military cook?

381
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,329
I've made about 300,000 servings
of cafeteria food.

382
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,097
I see. He was a military cook?

383
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,166
He's taking the cafeteria round.

384
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,036
It won't be easy to choose one.

385
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,304
I'll go.

386
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,838
I'll do the mom's challenge.

387
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,707
You will?

388
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,443
As a fellow parent,

389
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,246
I kept thinking of my own
as I listened to him.

390
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,014
-Dad's challenge.
-That's why

391
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,450
I want to make this the dad's challenge

392
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,652
and make something in 15 minutes.

393
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,554
So you won't cook like you always do.

394
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,489
You wouldn't cook like that
for your daughter.

395
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,425
-I have a son, Hyun-suk.
-You do?

396
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,729
-I'm sorry.
-I only have a son.

397
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,464
He chooses the mom's challenge.

398
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,566
Poong picks the mom's challenge.

399
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,301
We have two chefs left,

400
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,804
Eun-yeong and Nam-no.

401
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,705
I'll fill the order

402
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,606
for <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> cafeteria.

403
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,041
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> cafeteria.

404
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,111
-I'll fight against Chef Sung-jun.
-I see.

405
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,879
It won't be easy.

406
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,348
This means Nam-no automatically takes

407
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,415
the mom's challenge.

408
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,984
Nam-no is up against me.

409
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,721
I'm fighting against evil once again.

410
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,624
And now,
let the 15-minute cook-off begin for Joon!

411
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:40,199
<i>This is the first round</i>
<i>with Joon's ingredients.</i>

412
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,935
The order is titled
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> cafeteria.

413
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,903
Today's, the cafeteria is run

414
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,840
by Chef Eun-yeong and Chef Sung-jun.

415
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:51,510
These are the chefs who played a big part
in destroying the hierarchy among chefs.

416
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,148
-They're like buffalo.
-They are.

417
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,151
I've been waiting
to fight against Chef Sung-jun.

418
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,755
Because he's about
four or five years younger than I am.

419
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:07,092
But I still don't find him
too comfortable to deal with.

420
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,093
It's just awkward.

421
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,029
It wasn't easy to talk casually to him.

422
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,498
-You find him uncomfortable.
-I'm cool around her.

423
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,767
I thought Eun-yeong and I were
dear friends.

424
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,870
He called her a dear friend.

425
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,040
I thought we were besties,
so it's kind of a shame.

426
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,041
A four-year difference is
perfect between spouses.

427
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,411
-A four-year gap is perfect.
-It is.

428
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,912
SORRY?

429
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,114
Four years are the best.

430
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,082
You want to get them together.

431
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,717
But he's four years younger.

432
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,485
-That's even better.
-It is.

433
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,454
A guy who's four years younger is
the best.

434
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,955
The ratings will soar.

435
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,791
Please don't take it the wrong way.

436
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,126
-It's important to consider.
-It is.

437
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,529
It's up to them,
but I'm just sharing my thoughts.

438
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,397
A four-year gap is perfect.

439
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,534
The problem is that they'll use
a food tray to serve cafeteria food.

440
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,437
They need to make soup, rice,
and at least three side dishes.

441
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,704
They need to make three side dishes.

442
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,306
That means five dishes.

443
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:58,043
I was the military cook
for Artillery Brigade Five, Corps Five.

444
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,145
-And?
-If I count the numbers,

445
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,682
I cooked for 150 people 3 times a day
over about 600 days,

446
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
so I've cooked at least 300,000 servings.

447
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,187
-About 300,000 servings?
-That's right.

448
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,389
-No one counts it like that.
-So I know I'll do well.

449
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,757
How come he remembers that?

450
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,625
You kind of look like a soldier today.

451
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,462
His hair is the perfect style
to wear a beret.

452
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,997
That's the beret cut.

453
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,866
One, two, three, four. That's all.

454
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,269
-He's in full discipline.
-I like it.

455
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,238
Eun-yeong, do you have experience
with food trays?

456
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,108
I was in charge of the staff meal,

457
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,409
so I've done it many times.

458
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,745
I'm going to fill the tray
with the Chinese dishes I learned

459
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,181
while I worked here in Korea.

460
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,816
I know Joon will like everything.

461
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,685
-I'm sure.
-Those are her go-to dishes.

462
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,588
CHEF SUNG-JUN'S INGREDIENTS: SIRLOIN,
INSTANT PUMPKIN PORRIDGE, GRILLING CHEESE

463
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,690
RYE BREAD, SLICED CHEESE, CHICKEN WINGS,
TARTAR SAUCE, YOGURT, CABBAGE, AND MORE

464
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,191
First, Chef Sung-jun.

465
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,060
My dish is called

466
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,461
Mat-deria.

467
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,963
Mat-deria.

468
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,465
-Mat-deria?
-My gosh.

469
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,467
-Mat-deria.
-It sounds like the burger chain.

470
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,735
It's not the burger chain.

471
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,470
It's a reference to gun-deria,
the military burger.

472
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,039
-Does it come from gun-deria?
-You're right.

473
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,608
-I was a military cook.
-Mat-deria.

474
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,909
Are you making a hamburger?

475
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,980
-You make it yourself.
-It's that, soup, and salad.

476
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,682
But Joon mentioned efficient food,

477
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,852
and I believe hamburgers are
the most efficient food in human history.

478
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,487
The balance of carbs,
protein, and fat is perfect,

479
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,123
and you can eat it quickly
and neatly all at once.

480
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,324
-And convenient.
-Yes.

481
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,661
-To add, I'll serve some hot wings.
-Chicken wings.

482
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,330
-I'll serve a side of hot wings.
-I see.

483
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,798
The key to military burger is

484
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,736
the salad you put into the burger
and eat on the side.

485
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,770
So I'll make the salad

486
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,373
and even serve some sweet pumpkin soup.

487
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,108
THE MOST EFFICIENT FOOD TRAY

488
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,075
Does that sound good?

489
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,211
-It sounds delicious.
-It does.

490
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,114
CHEF EUN-YEONG'S INGREDIENTS: DUCK MEAT,
CABBAGE, PAPRIKA, OYSTER SAUCE, MUSSELS

491
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,216
PEANUT BUTTER, MANILA CLAMS, SHIITAKE,
DRIED AND SHREDDED POLLACK, AND MORE

492
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,418
What's your dish, Chef Eun-yeong?

493
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,020
Well, before I talk about my dish,

494
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:52,925
I found out that Joon's fandom
is named Leejoonxi Lovely.

495
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,460
You're right. That was so cool.

496
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,563
-How did she know?
-She gets extra points.

497
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,431
-That was touching.
-She did her research.

498
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,133
FEELING ANXIOUS

499
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,634
You need to sing or something.

500
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,703
I'll fill the tray
with lovely Chinese food today.

501
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,572
Lovely Chinese food.

502
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,539
What will you make?

503
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,707
Fried rice.

504
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,610
-Fried rice.
-And <i>jjamppong </i>with dried pollack.

505
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,811
Smashed cucumber salad,

506
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,646
stir-fried duck and vegetables,

507
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,582
-and sweet and sour beef.
-What?

508
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,482
That's crazy.

509
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,651
-Can you do this in 15 minutes?
-In just 15 minutes?

510
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,354
-What? In just 15 minutes?
-That's a lot.

511
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,823
You need to deep-fry
sweet and sour beef three times.

512
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,558
-You're right.
-That's impossible.

513
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,261
I'm sorry, but did you order
from a Chinese restaurant?

514
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,164
-Did you make an order?
-During the break?

515
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,899
-To Self-Made Chef?
-I mean, think about it.

516
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,367
Is Self-Made Chef here?

517
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,702
Is he cooking in the back?

518
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,938
I'm sure she made an order
or is hiding someone back there.

519
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,074
-You can't do that in 15 minutes.
-It's impossible.

520
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,542
She has to make one every three minutes.

521
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,877
-That's right.
-Gosh, 3 times 5, 15.

522
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,847
One of the dishes
I can probably leave out is

523
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,882
-Stir-fried duck and vegetables.
-The stir-fry.

524
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,752
I'll make that one last.

525
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,554
-Stir-fried duck and vegetables?
-It won't be easy.

526
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,189
Just say you won't make it.

527
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,525
She's worried about you.

528
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,027
-Let's look forward to it.
-Yes.

529
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,131
And now, let us begin
the cafeteria food round.

530
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,133
Chef Park Eun-yeong is here

531
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,069
to fill the food tray
with lovely Chinese food.

532
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,573
But up against him is
the legendary military cook

533
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,975
who made over 300,000 servings,
Chef Kwon Sung-jun.

534
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,679
Who'll become the main chef
of <i>Chef & My Fridge</i> cafeteria?

535
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,982
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

536
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,487
This is going to be fun.

537
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,921
Begin!

538
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,259
This is going to be fun.

539
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,529
Is that a sweet pumpkin?

540
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,830
He's wrapping the pumpkin.

541
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,033
-He has to make soup.
-Soup.

542
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,101
-He said he'd make soup.
-He did.

543
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,137
-He's using a microwave.
-Yes.

544
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,073
This round is literally
a race against time.

545
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,842
Chef Eun-yeong is the problem now.

546
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,577
She must be quite busy.

547
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,112
-Mushroom.
-Mushroom.

548
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,315
-Zucchini.
-Zucchini.

549
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,551
Chinese chefs always begin
by preparing the ingredients.

550
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,320
-You're right.
-She must rush that too.

551
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,755
GARLIC CLOVES

552
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,058
AN AMAZING SPEED

553
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,360
She's really fast.

554
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,594
She's like a machine.

555
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,531
It's been a minute already.

556
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,367
1. OIL PAN AND PUT THE INGREDIENTS IN

557
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,935
She's really fast.

558
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,538
Are you making <i>jjamppong</i>?

559
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,772
Yes, I am.

560
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,641
RED PEPPER POWDER

561
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,476
STIR-FRY UNTIL SEASONED

562
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,079
-Mussels.
-Mussels.

563
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,349
-She must make one every three minutes.
-She's moving quickly.

564
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,550
That's <i>jjamppong</i>.

565
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,085
-Is that <i>jjamppong</i>?
-She's almost done.

566
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,319
That's <i>jjamppong</i>?

567
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,220
Yes.

568
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,855
-That's <i>jjamppong</i>.
-Yes.

569
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,990
She made it so easily.

570
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,892
SHE MADE JJAMPPONG THIS QUICKLY?

571
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,594
She made <i>jjamppong </i>in three minutes?

572
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,196
She was done in no time.

573
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,964
WHAT ABOUT THE BURGER BOY?

574
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,733
MILITARY COOK MODE, ON

575
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,801
Look at that speed.

576
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,172
1. JULIENNE CABBAGE, CARROT,
APPLE, AND PAPRIKA

577
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,407
Is that coleslaw?

578
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,476
-Yes.
-Is it?

579
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,811
What's that? Mayonnaise?

580
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,179
-Mayonnaise?
-Mayonnaise.

581
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,681
YOGURT

582
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,516
-And some yogurt.
-Yogurt.

583
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,684
That has to be good.

584
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,552
-And he adds wasabi!
-Wasabi!

585
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,520
Wasabi.

586
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,921
ANCHOVY CREAM, HORSERADISH

587
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,757
He must be making tartar sauce.

588
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,492
BLENDING EVERYTHING TO MAKE SAUCE

589
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,094
He's adding peanut butter.

590
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,966
MIXING EVERYTHING WITH THE SALAD

591
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,636
-He made coleslaw.
-Coleslaw.

592
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,672
-You're putting yogurt there?
-Isn't that yogurt?

593
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,242
-Already?
-That's the side dish?

594
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,377
Sung-jun grabs chicken wings.

595
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,246
He's stabbing the wings.

596
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,514
To let the seasoning seep in.

597
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,749
-Chicken wings.
-He's salting the wings.

598
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,886
-Rice wine.
-Rice wine.

599
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,953
Starch.

600
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,023
Is he going to deep-fry the wings?

601
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,794
-Do you eat fried food?
-I eat everything. No limits.

602
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,462
He enjoys everything.

603
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,131
He doesn't say no.
He says thanks to everything.

604
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,133
He likes everything
that's inexpensive and efficient.

605
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,737
-Meat.
-That must be for the sweet and sour beef.

606
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,838
It's beef tenderloin.

607
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,540
-So it's sweet and sour beef?
-Yes.

608
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,542
-Cafeterias use pork.
-You're using beef?

609
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,577
-Are you making sweet and sour beef?
-Yes, it's beef.

610
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,112
You had the meat at home.

611
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,381
-I thought…
-Is that a thing?

612
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,082
-Of course.
-Of course.

613
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,785
-It's a bit more expensive.
-It's more expensive.

614
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,220
Sweet and sour beef is
a bit more expensive.

615
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,888
What do you mean, Joon?

616
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,623
-I had no idea.
-Joon.

617
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,893
All he wants to do is fill his stomach.

618
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,296
-But he…
-He just needs to be full at that age.

619
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,664
Starch.

620
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,668
Chef Sung-jun has the advantage
in many different aspects

621
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,369
-in this situation.
-Right?

622
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,338
The sweet and sour beef.

623
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,274
She's throwing them in.
The sweet and sour beef.

624
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,511
-She's really fast.
-That's how you make sweet and sour beef?

625
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:40,412
She's this fast?

626
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,614
The batter looks perfect.

627
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,782
Be careful.

628
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,584
Be careful.

629
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,719
Hot oil is splashing.

630
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,423
I don't mind, if I can make this for Joon.

631
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:53,959
What just happened?

632
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,527
WHAT WAS THAT LINE?

633
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,628
What just happened?

634
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,498
JOON, HAVE SOME BEEF

635
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,000
-You don't care even if it hits your face?
-No.

636
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,435
Stop lying.

637
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,571
That's how motivated you are.

638
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,473
She's desperate
to break her two losses in a row.

639
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,675
He's never had it,
but it's absolutely delicious.

640
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,043
-It's very good.
-She has the advantage.

641
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,880
-He'll go crazy for it.
-He will.

642
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,082
It's been five minutes.
You have ten minutes left.

643
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,950
THE BURGER BOY SCOOPS OUT THE WINGS

644
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,720
Aren't the wings overcooked?

645
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,989
-No, not at all.
-Are those fine?

646
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,958
American wings are that crunchy.

647
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:27,993
Is that right?

648
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,929
-It's better when it's a bit overcooked.
-Yes. It has a better flavor.

649
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,731
MAKING BUNS WITH RYE BREAD

650
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,567
I think he's using those as buns.

651
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,968
Butter. Is that butter?

652
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,904
-He's toasting bread.
-Those must be buns.

653
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,473
-I really love butter.
-He loves butter!

654
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,507
Butter.

655
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,810
He's going for the blender.
He's about to make the patty.

656
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,245
He's grinding the beef.

657
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,114
-He should.
-He needs to grill that.

658
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,850
It works really well.

659
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,320
GROUND PERFECTLY

660
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,521
Whoa.

661
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,591
He's doing that with the beef?

662
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,127
Sung-jun begins to grill the beef.

663
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,195
That looks so good.
This is driving me crazy.

664
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,897
Do you enjoy burgers?

665
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,866
Well.

666
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,034
I barely ever eat it.

667
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,101
Why not?

668
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,202
I'm not so picky,

669
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,538
but my skin breaks out
when I eat too much flour.

670
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,208
-Please refrain from using flour.
-Flour?

671
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,779
-It doesn't matter. I can always pop them.
-Pop them?

672
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,281
-He can just pop them.
-He'll pop them.

673
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,750
-I just have to pop them. It's fine.
-You'll pop them?

674
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,086
THANKFULLY, HE'S USING RYE BREAD

675
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,689
Chef Eun-yeong has the advantage
if you consider his palate.

676
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,724
CHOPPING GREEN ONION

677
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,759
She chops really fast.

678
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,596
-She does.
-It's amazing to witness in real life.

679
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,131
Eun-yeong came prepared today.

680
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,467
She hadn't left home
after losing twice in a row.

681
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,302
Yes, she's ready to win.

682
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,604
DROPPING BEATEN-UP EGGS

683
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,738
It's my first time seeing the process.

684
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,574
Eun-yeong is moving very fast.

685
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,977
-The fried rice.
-I'm making fried rice.

686
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,244
Egg fried rice?

687
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,014
-That looks good. Egg fried rice?
-Egg fried rice.

688
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,384
Sung-jun is falling behind.

689
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,685
OYSTER SAUCE

690
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,755
-She must make one dish in three minutes.
-She's moving very fast.

691
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,957
STIR-FRYING QUICKLY

692
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,293
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

693
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,295
-That's amazing.
-That was so fast.

694
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,099
-The fried rice is done.
-She's done.

695
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,900
-The fried rice is done.
-It's finished.

696
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,169
She's done.

697
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,439
-It looks good.
-It already looks good.

698
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,341
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds.

699
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,377
We're already halfway through.

700
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,881
It seems like
Eun-yeong has the advantage right now.

701
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,716
How will Sung-jun turn this around?

702
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,188
There isn't much time,
and Sung-jun is a little behind.

703
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,557
-Are you doing okay?
-Yes.

704
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,825
You have to move quickly.

705
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,161
He just added gochujang
like the sauce for fried chicken.

706
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,630
-What's that?
-Instant soup.

707
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,132
-Soup?
-I see.

708
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,435
-Sweet pumpkin soup?
-He's mixing the soup.

709
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,271
I mixed sweet pumpkin porridge
and mushroom soup.

710
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,741
TO THE STOVE

711
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:57,709
Why am I so busy?

712
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:58,777
This is driving me crazy.

713
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,011
Why am I so busy?

714
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,013
THE BUSIEST DAY SO FAR

715
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,883
It's not easy to make a burger quickly.

716
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,786
He has to think of making
every ingredient on the inside.

717
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,488
It won't be easy to finish everything.

718
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,825
Sung-jun is at a disadvantage right now.

719
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,960
-You're refrying the chicken?
-He is.

720
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,529
He fried the chicken twice.

721
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,963
He fried them twice?

722
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,165
AND MIX WITH THE SAUCE

723
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,367
-It's like fried chicken.
-Into the sauce.

724
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,668
That's what he's doing.

725
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,704
It's like sweet and spicy fried chicken.

726
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,238
LOOKING HOT AND DELICIOUS

727
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,407
That looks good.

728
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,976
You still have some more time, though.
Over six minutes.

729
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,546
THE BEEF SHE HAD BEEN FRYING

730
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,816
SCOOPING OUT THE 1ST TIME

731
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,085
-The fried beef looks great!
-It looks good.

732
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,253
CAUGHT HIS EYES

733
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,623
-The fried beef looks great!
-It looks good.

734
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,194
The sauce is important
for the sweet and sour beef.

735
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,563
-She'll fry it again.
-She is.

736
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,864
She's frying it twice.

737
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,800
She's moving very fast.

738
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,904
SMASHED CUCUMBER SALAD

739
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,407
SMASHED IN A FLASH

740
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,374
Smashed cucumber salad.

741
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,210
She's diluting peanut butter with water.

742
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,378
Dang it. I'm running out of time.

743
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,647
Garlic.

744
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,218
IT WON'T OPEN…

745
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,122
-It won't open. Why won't it open?
-My beef.

746
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,158
Why won't it open?
And the fried beef looks burnt.

747
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,426
It just burnt.

748
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,595
-Help her.
-Why won't it open?

749
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:27,232
Why won't it open?
And the fried beef looks burnt.

750
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,433
-It just burnt.
-You have to open this.

751
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,436
Hyun-suk plays a nice guy
and runs over to help.

752
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,773
That was such a random moment.
He's doing it for his image.

753
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,008
When that other guy did it,
you called him kind-hearted.

754
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,777
Why did you say mine was stage?

755
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,612
HIS SINCERITY SEEMED STAGED

756
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:43,782
It's ginger!

757
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,117
EVEN HIS STAGED KINDNESS WAS USELESS

758
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,989
3. MIX MINCED GARLIC, SOY SAUCE,
AND SESAME OIL WITH CUCUMBER

759
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,258
She's done with the cucumber salad.

760
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,592
-The duck.
-She just needs to make the stir-fry.

761
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,262
-The stir-fried duck isn't out yet.
-She has four minutes.

762
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,898
-Sung-ju?
-Hurry up! What are you doing?

763
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,300
-What are you waiting for?
-I was mesmerized with them.

764
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,835
You have 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

765
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,670
I'm the most curious of this.

766
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,339
It's <i>jjamppong</i>!

767
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,441
You're done with <i>jjamppong</i>.

768
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,443
I wanted to try this soup.

769
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,379
This is Eun-yeong's <i>jjamppong</i>!

770
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:18,416
Does the <i>jjamppong </i>taste lovely?

771
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,785
Does the <i>jjamppong </i>taste lovely?

772
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,887
Does the <i>jjamppong </i>taste lovely?

773
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,656
It's a little bland.

774
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,057
-It is?
-It is?

775
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,092
-Is it?
-It's bland.

776
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,894
-I'll boil it down some more.
-She'll boil it down.

777
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,163
Is this spicy sauce?

778
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,565
-Yes.
-Spicy sauce.

779
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,067
Let me try the sauce.

780
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,670
Let me try the sauce.

781
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,739
Does it taste delicious?

782
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:42,874
Or does it not?

783
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,844
-It's delicious.
-Is it?

784
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,580
It's good. I think you'll like it.

785
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,181
Three minutes.

786
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,016
The sauce was good.

787
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,218
It's not so bad.

788
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,118
THE TOP SLOTS ARE FILLED UP

789
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,221
BUT NO SOUP OR BURGER

790
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,924
Sung-jun has a plan right now.

791
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,626
She's making the sweet and sour sauce.

792
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,862
Eun-yeong is very fast.

793
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,364
But this one doesn't look easy.

794
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,800
-Did it go well?
-Starch water.

795
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,568
Two minutes and thirty seconds.

796
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,471
-What about the sauce?
-I'm making it now.

797
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,074
I wonder if the beef was fried well.

798
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,877
IT'S SO HOT

799
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,945
Will Joon fall for it?

800
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,381
It has to be delicious.

801
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,482
It's made with tenderloin.

802
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,817
What's it like?

803
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,185
Is it good?

804
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,987
I feel like I'm walking on snow.

805
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:30,922
It's so crunchy!

806
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,625
Hey, how does my sweet and sour beef look?

807
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,959
-How does it look?
-It looks bad.

808
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,261
-Yours look bad too.
-It looks bad.

809
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,595
DISSING IN A PROXIMITY

810
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,997
Why are you two bickering?

811
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,531
Sweet and sour beef is bad for you.

812
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,967
What about burgers?

813
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,737
FRYING THE BEEF THE THIRD TIME

814
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,405
She's frying the beef three times.

815
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,607
Is this done?

816
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,209
He got the sweet pumpkin out.

817
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,011
-It's so hot!
-What's so hot?

818
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,712
STEAMING

819
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,681
-Two minutes.
-You have two minutes left.

820
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,650
-Two minutes. It's still hot!
-It's hot!

821
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,853
He's making the sweet pumpkin soup.

822
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,223
He's using actual sweet pumpkin.
Sung-jun puts up with the heat.

823
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,325
He's pretending like it didn't hurt,

824
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,326
like it wasn't hot.

825
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,930
What now? That's what he's doing.

826
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,731
-That looks good.
-Move quickly.

827
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:16,434
It's almost gone.

828
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,802
THE JJAMPPONG SHE BOILED DOWN
AFTER SUNG-JU'S REVIEW

829
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,938
ONE LAST TASTE TEST

830
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:20,972
It's not too salty.

831
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,575
THE JJAMPPONG IS DONE TOO

832
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,178
PULLING OUT THE BEEF
SHE FRIED FOR THE THIRD TIME

833
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,214
She made <i>jjamppong</i>, sweet and sour beef,
so she just needs the stir-fry.

834
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,749
She'll be done after that.

835
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,719
POURING THE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE

836
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,555
A minute and twenty seconds.

837
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,757
The last dish,
stir-fried duck and vegetables.

838
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,592
She's making the stir-fry.

839
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,594
-Are you making the stir-fry?
-She has a minute.

840
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,563
-Right now?
-She begins with a minute left.

841
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,098
You can't do that now.

842
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,001
-That's insane. You can't do this.
-Can you make the stir-fry?

843
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,035
Can you do this?

844
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,872
-The cucumber…
-You prepared nothing. Can you do it?

845
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,307
He said he eats things that aren't cooked.

846
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,043
-He said he eats uncooked food?
-Yes.

847
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,511
When my mom told me to get bulgogi,

848
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,013
I ate the raw meat.

849
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,414
In its marinated state?

850
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,350
-He said he eats uncooked food?
-Yes.

851
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,751
EAT THE RAW FOOD, JOON

852
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,288
Yes, he said he ate raw bulgogi.

853
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,623
-He did say that.
-Raw bulgogi.

854
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,625
-He'll be fine.
-He said he eats uncooked food.

855
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,461
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds left.

856
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,296
-Thirty seconds!
-Thirty seconds!

857
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,331
-Thirty seconds!
-Thirty seconds!

858
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,900
There's the patty.

859
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,635
PULLS OUT A TORCH

860
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,005
He's broiling the cheese.

861
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,773
Whoa! That looks amazing!

862
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,376
Darn it!

863
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,644
ABOUT TO SERVE THE BURGER

864
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,380
Wait! The sauce.

865
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,483
Whoa, the patty.

866
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,986
-Thirty seconds.
-You need to serve it on a food tray.

867
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,188
The food tray. Here's Sung-jun's tray.

868
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,258
Sung-jun is almost done too.

869
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,061
ADDING ANCHOVY CREAM TO THE YOGURT!

870
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,631
Sung-jun is almost done too.

871
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,601
You have 15 seconds left.

872
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,003
Can you really finish on time?

873
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,405
-Whoa, the fire.
-The duck.

874
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,206
-Whoa.
-Ten seconds.

875
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,941
The stir-fry!

876
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,310
-You can do this!
-Joon!

877
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,212
-Four. Three.
-Four. Three.

878
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,181
-Three. Two.
-Three. Two.

879
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,483
-One.
-She's done!

880
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,584
SUNG-JUN FINISHES FIRST

881
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,854
-Two. One.
-Oh, no. What will she do?

882
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,091
She finishes right on time.

883
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,126
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

884
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,329
-That was so amazing.
-It was.

885
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,398
That was insane.

886
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,767
I wonder if this stir-fry is cooked.

887
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,303
The duck stir-fry is key.

888
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,838
How about the sweet and sour sauce?

889
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,406
Yes, that was really rough.

890
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,844
BOTH FOOD TRAYS ARE FULL

891
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,013
It's full of Chinese food.

892
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,483
THE CAFETERIA MEALS WERE PREPARED
WITH THE HIGHEST EFFICIENCY

893
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,218
My gosh.

894
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:52,090
Both chefs finished making
cafeteria meals for Joon.

895
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:56,327
The fridge owner looks very pleased.

896
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,629
You won't see this kind of quality food
at a cafeteria.

897
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,832
-It's crazy.
-It is.

898
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,235
Please try Chef Sung-jun's dish first.

899
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,670
It's called Mat-deria.

900
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,006
AN EFFICIENT BURGER MEAL
WITH BALANCED NUTRITION

901
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,244
THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF MILITARY BURGER
MADE BY AN EX-MILITARY COOK

902
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,949
CHEF KWON SUNG-JUN'S MAT-DERIA

903
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,485
-It already looks delicious.
-It does.

904
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,186
I don't even have to try it.

905
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,122
-Try the soup first.
-Yes.

906
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,190
He tries some soup.

907
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,093
AMAZED

908
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,496
Gosh, this is really good.

909
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,332
What's not good to you?

910
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,637
-Yong-yeo doesn't trust your palate.
-That's right.

911
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,974
-He likes most things.
-Now, the hamburger.

912
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,842
I'm personally looking forward to this.

913
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,944
This is so hip-hop.

914
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,581
He didn't have hamburger buns, so…

915
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,116
I see.

916
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,619
I wonder if it works well.

917
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,355
-Gosh.
-How is it?

918
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,924
-It's just my style.
-I see.

919
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,093
You can probably release this.

920
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,364
And the salad.
That salad should be good too.

921
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,132
Man.

922
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,901
As for the salad,

923
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,470
apple and peanut butter were the secret.

924
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,805
I really love this.

925
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,974
I once stayed in Germany

926
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:21,212
for a month and a half to film a movie.

927
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,881
Back then, Rain would

928
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,785
always give me apples and peanut butter.

929
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,055
This is something from my memories.
I liked this the most.

930
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,990
The balance must've been good.

931
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,725
There's another secret.

932
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,695
Try adding the salad on the burger.

933
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,197
-Add some salad.
-Like this?

934
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,298
That's the military burger style.

935
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,300
That looks good.

936
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,668
It looks good.

937
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,369
-It became a bit thicker.
-Look at that.

938
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,605
-But that's…
-It's huge.

939
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,307
Will it fit in his mouth?

940
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,374
Joon goes for it.

941
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,677
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

942
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,047
IT'S GOING IN

943
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,915
I WANT A BITE TOO…

944
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:58,883
Man!

945
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,884
What's it like?

946
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,886
Is it different with the salad?

947
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,487
Actually, I like to eat bibimbap

948
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,690
without mixing it,
leaving everything separated.

949
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,325
I can mix it in my mouth.

950
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,193
I just mix it in my mouth.

951
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,728
That's his thing.

952
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,765
So it tastes great
both separately and together.

953
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,569
Try the hot wings too.
It's the sauce next to the wings.

954
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,171
The sauce was really good.

955
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,640
You made it with chili oil, right?

956
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,610
Chili oil, green onion, garlic,
and soy sauce.

957
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,312
Whoa!

958
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,480
-Huh?
-What is it?

959
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,315
Wait, what is this?

960
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,783
-The sauce?
-What's this sauce?

961
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,685
<i>I used yogurt</i>

962
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,487
<i>and anchovy cream.</i>

963
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,456
-This is really good.
-I see.

964
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,558
A THUMBS-UP

965
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,460
I've never had this kind of sauce before.

966
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,894
ABSOLUTELY AMAZED AT THE SAUCE

967
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,864
It's like sour cream, the one that comes
with pizza, which I love.

968
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,833
-Yes.
-It's similar, but this is better.

969
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,334
It's something like that.

970
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,036
This is really good.

971
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,672
His response was different.

972
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,773
Man.

973
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,777
I can tell by the way he eats
that he probably can't eat alone.

974
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,612
"Whoa! Man! This is good!"

975
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,116
-He needs someone to respond.
-You're right.

976
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,484
Long ago,

977
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,686
I once did this
while eating with my elders.

978
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,321
I was like, "Whoa! Hey!"

979
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:11,922
THE ELDERS WERE IN SHOCK

980
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,358
-My friend told me not to do that.
-Don't do that.

981
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,994
I thought I stopped doing it,
but it just happened after eating this.

982
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,297
-Because it was that good.
-It's your genuine response.

983
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,466
Of course, the burger and wings were good,

984
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,136
-But these two were the best.
-The kick.

985
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,605
-Yes, these were good.
-I see.

986
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,241
Next up, Chef Eun-yeong's dish.

987
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:38,049
A LOVELY TRAY OF LOVELY CHINESE FOOD
JUST FOR JOON

988
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,120
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
ISN'T CHINESE FOOD LOVELY?

989
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,657
This is the kind of meal I usually prefer.

990
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,392
Is that so? Usually?

991
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,629
Rice, soup, meat, and vegetables.

992
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,298
-You're right.
-It's that balance.

993
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,268
Let me try this first.

994
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,636
The stir-fried duck.

995
00:38:58,703 --> 00:38:59,870
<i>That was the last dish she made.</i>

996
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,672
He said he also eats
things that aren't cooked.

997
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,542
-Let me see how well it's cooked.
-She said Joon eats even uncooked food.

998
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,378
She made the stir-fry in just a minute.

999
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,880
-This is cooked.
-They are?

1000
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,949
-It would be.
-It's cooked.

1001
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,384
It's cooked well, actually.

1002
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,419
-It's cooked well?
-It's very tender.

1003
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,721
The sweet and sour beef first.

1004
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,557
Dip it generously
into the sauce on the side.

1005
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,027
-Generously.
-I like to dip the sauce, so this is nice.

1006
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,130
POPPING IN

1007
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,732
SAVORING

1008
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,333
Isn't it your first time
eating sweet and sour beef?

1009
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,335
A DRY CHUCKLE

1010
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,804
-He didn't know it existed.
-No.

1011
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:38,442
-He could've tried it without knowing.
-That's true.

1012
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,978
This sauce is good too.

1013
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,381
Is this kimchi? No? What is this?

1014
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,982
-It's a piece of onion.
-Onion?

1015
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,785
<i>-I used grapefruit </i>cheong<i>.</i>
<i>-Grapefruit </i>cheong<i>?</i>

1016
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,687
This sauce is really good too.

1017
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,390
Grapefruit <i>cheong </i>is
already sour and sweet.

1018
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,791
PLEASED

1019
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:54,792
The fried rice.

1020
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,193
THIS TIME, THE FRIED RICE

1021
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,695
Mmm.

1022
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,629
It's cute.

1023
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,265
-It's cute. The fried rice is cute.
-How is it cute?

1024
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,266
It's a cute flavor.

1025
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,834
I love this kind of flavor.

1026
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,170
HIS REVIEW IS SOMEWHAT QUIRKY

1027
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,072
It's like something in comic books.

1028
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,473
I like what people call Howl's breakfast.

1029
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,910
-Howl's breakfast?
-The set meal in <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>.

1030
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,279
It tastes like that.
Something that I imagined in my head.

1031
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,848
It kind of tastes like a comic book.

1032
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,451
It's a pretty basic flavor.

1033
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,353
-And <i>jjamppong</i>.
-<i>Jjamppong</i>.

1034
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,989
This is it. The <i>jjamppong</i>. How's the soup?

1035
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,559
She used seafood to make that.

1036
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,463
-This is nice.
-He says it's nice.

1037
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,098
Are there noodles inside?

1038
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,800
-No.
-There are no noodles.

1039
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,935
-You wanted noodles!
-Oh, no!

1040
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,905
He said he didn't like noodles,
that he doesn't like flour.

1041
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,640
You still should've made noodles.

1042
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,341
He could've just popped the zits.

1043
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,977
-I was ready to pop them.
-He could've just popped them.

1044
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,679
He was ready to eat noodles.

1045
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,981
-I'll try the solid ingredients.
-The solids.

1046
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,616
There's seafood.

1047
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,186
Mmm.

1048
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,287
She made it in a flash.

1049
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,390
This is really refreshing.

1050
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:04,662
It's so delicious that I can't believe
she made it in such a short while.

1051
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,931
It'll taste delicious
if you dip some fried rice in soup.

1052
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,700
Yes, people usually do that.

1053
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,235
-Like this?
-Yes.

1054
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,604
-Dip it in a little bit of soup.
-Let it get seasoned.

1055
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:14,972
Yes, that's it.

1056
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,241
Hey!

1057
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,676
Yes, this is it.

1058
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,244
THE TASTE THAT ALWAYS DELIVERS

1059
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,179
-This is really good.
-I see.

1060
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,915
-He eats so deliciously.
-He does.

1061
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,818
-He's dipping rice into the soup.
-He enjoys it a lot.

1062
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,421
When his mom cooks,
she'll want to make him more

1063
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,858
-if he enjoys it that much.
-You're right.

1064
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,327
He looks even happier
because everything is on a tray.

1065
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,896
-There's that fullness.
-There is.

1066
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,866
-He's eating two meals with two trays.
-That's right.

1067
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,601
You just saved 12,000 won.

1068
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,169
SAVED UP FOR TWO MEALS

1069
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,637
-They cost only 12,000 won?
-Right.

1070
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,272
A meal costs 6,000 won,

1071
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,674
-and there are two trays.
-These have to be more expensive.

1072
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,143
This is driving me crazy.

1073
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,678
-It's really good.
-Sung-jun's patty.

1074
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,180
What do I do?

1075
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,283
Why don't we try it too?
This is Mat-deria.

1076
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,284
Nice.

1077
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,320
A BIG BITE

1078
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,756
Chef Hyun-suk enjoys it a lot.

1079
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,993
I can taste
the richness of Korean beef sirloin.

1080
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,829
-It tastes like a burger served in Europe.
-Gourmet burger.

1081
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,898
-It tastes European.
-That's true.

1082
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:19,136
THE TWO ARE STARING AT THE FOOD TRAY

1083
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,772
Look at those two. Ho-young and Nam-no.

1084
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,874
You aren't here to dine.

1085
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,677
They're regulars here.

1086
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,412
-This is amazing.
-They enjoy it too much.

1087
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,482
This time, let's try
Isn't Chinese Food Lovely?

1088
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,550
Nice.

1089
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,318
The sweet and sour beef is amazing.

1090
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,021
A BIG BITE

1091
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,323
THEIR MUKBANG IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL

1092
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,258
It's as if those two

1093
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,860
are dining at a restaurant.

1094
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,029
The two friends are here to dine.

1095
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,064
Chef Ho-young, any thoughts?

1096
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,134
I want this Chinese food meal

1097
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,736
-to be on the menu somewhere.
-I agree.

1098
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,638
The composition is perfect.

1099
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:58,409
She served vegetables, meat,
soup, and even rice.

1100
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:02,746
It'll be really popular if this was
a menu at a cafeteria somewhere.

1101
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,083
-I mixed the fried rice in the soup.
-I see.

1102
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,952
It almost gave me chills.

1103
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,486
I see.

1104
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,789
All right, now.

1105
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,525
-Are you asleep? Have you decided?
-What? No.

1106
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,126
-Joon.
-It must be tough.

1107
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,461
It's one of the two.

1108
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,129
<i>Press one for Park Eun-yeong,</i>

1109
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,031
<i>and press two for Kwon Sung-jun.</i>

1110
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,000
Please make your decision

1111
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,768
and press the button.

1112
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,138
Which one did he like better?

1113
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,375
-I'm done.
-He pressed it.

1114
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,944
Let's find out the result. Show us!

1115
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,746
<i>Chef & My Fridge</i> cafeteria.

1116
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,283
Will Sung-jun keep his upturn
and remain as the second placed?

1117
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:44,154
Or will Eun-yeong break her losing streak
and get back on track?

1118
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,323
-This is hard.
-It is.

1119
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,626
Who did Joon choose?

1120
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,794
Was it Western cuisine or Chinese cuisine?

1121
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,931
-Who's the winner?
-Who did he choose?

1122
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,333
Which one is it? Show us!

1123
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,935
PARK EUN-YEONG WINS

1124
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,637
CHEF PARK EUN-YEONG'S
ISN'T CHINESE FOOD LOVELY WINS

1125
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,572
Chef Eun-yeong wins!

1126
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,208
-I didn't expect this.
-She won.

1127
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,944
-He picked Chinese food.
-I knew it.

1128
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:07,878
He did.

1129
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,413
If I had to think of a single dish,

1130
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,383
these two were absolutely amazing.

1131
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,919
But I picked Chef Eun-yeong

1132
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,889
<i>because of the overall balance.</i>

1133
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,359
If I were to eat this every single day,

1134
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:26,330
I thought I'd enjoy dipping rice
into the soup a lot. That was huge.

1135
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:30,200
Gosh, I helped her win the star.

1136
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,437
First of all, I'm so grateful
that Joon enjoyed the dish a lot.

1137
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,040
I always felt awkward around Sung-jun,

1138
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:39,209
but I feel like we've grown closer
after today.

1139
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,645
I feel more awkward.

1140
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,548
-You feel closer when you win.
-That's right.

1141
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,051
-I feel like we're closer.
-It happens when you win.

1142
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,786
-I'm blocking her.
-I see.

1143
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,588
All right.
Please put a star on Chef Eun-yeong!

1144
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,425
YOU'RE THE BEST, EUN-YEONG!

1145
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,126
Please put it above her name tag.

1146
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,128
Chef Eun-yeong takes her fourth win.

1147
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,064
It's her fourth victory!

1148
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,965
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1149
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:08,205
<i>This is the second round</i>
<i>with ingredients from Joon's fridge.</i>

1150
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:13,110
This is an order directly from his mother.

1151
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:17,548
Special mission, mom's challenge.

1152
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,717
She has 15 minutes until her son arrives.

1153
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,386
She wants you to make something

1154
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:28,058
quite unexpected with the ingredients
she already has in her fridge.

1155
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,595
Webtoon Artist Kim Poong is up,
and he's ready to cook as a dad.

1156
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,531
Up against him is Yoon Nam-no,
who has eaten

1157
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:38,135
his mother's food for 36 years.

1158
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:41,238
You've eaten her food for 36 years?

1159
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,074
I'm what they call
the boomerang generation.

1160
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,175
The boomerang?

1161
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,479
I've spent 36 years of my life
eating my mom's food,

1162
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,214
and I finally moved out two months ago.

1163
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,815
-I see.
-You moved out?

1164
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,585
I did, but I live five minutes away.

1165
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,288
-He didn't move out.
-That's like right next door.

1166
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,091
I can't live without my mom.
I have to whine to her.

1167
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,659
I think we can call him

1168
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:06,797
-the Bad Son Maniac.
-The Bad Son Maniac.

1169
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:10,300
-And Poong has a son, right?
-Yes.

1170
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,003
I always cook for my son.

1171
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,973
-There are such families.
-Yes.

1172
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,776
Kids have no idea what it's like

1173
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,612
to cook for one's children.

1174
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,781
You can only know
after you become a parent.

1175
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,616
How old is your son now?

1176
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,752
He's four.

1177
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,255
-He's four? Then…
-What is this?

1178
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,824
Joon is 38 years old right now.

1179
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,092
He's huge.

1180
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,560
-Baby food?
-He's as big as Joon.

1181
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,628
You've only made baby food.

1182
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,564
-He's as big as Joon.
-You're only making baby food.

1183
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,133
-He's huge.
-He must be the big type.

1184
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,035
-Do you enjoy baby food?
-Well, sure.

1185
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,638
-Baby food is the most efficient.
-You're right.

1186
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,706
-I can just chug it down.
-At once.

1187
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,875
The record shows that
Poong has the upper hand.

1188
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,812
-Right.
-Because Chef Nam-no is the only one

1189
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,747
who lost against him twice.

1190
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,184
-I see. Right. He has a weak spot.
-He does.

1191
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,720
<i>He always has a bad time</i>
<i>whenever he's up against Poong.</i>

1192
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:04,788
<i>He can't do his thing.</i>

1193
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,891
When I lost the first time,
I thought he got lucky.

1194
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,493
Yes, that could happen.

1195
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,229
But the second time I lost,

1196
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,831
I had pork cutlet

1197
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,833
and three bottles of soju
right after the shoot.

1198
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,768
-Were you heartbroken?
-It hurts to win against Poong.

1199
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,871
What do you think
about this situation, Poong?

1200
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,473
There was something people called
the Koreaphobia,

1201
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,977
when national soccer teams
couldn't do their best against Korea.

1202
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,580
-The Chinese national team was like that.
-That's it.

1203
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,381
I'll show him what Poongphobia is.

1204
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,483
POONGPHOBIA WARNING

1205
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,886
-Poongphobia?
-Yes.

1206
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,088
I'll make sure Nam-no shudders

1207
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,291
whenever he sees me after this round.

1208
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,226
That's cruel.

1209
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,895
-I'll secure yet another win today.
-I see.

1210
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,232
WEBTOON ARTIST POONG'S INGREDIENTS:
CHIVES, SHORT RIBS, OYSTER SAUCE

1211
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,933
EGGPLANT, TUNA SAUCE, SESAME

1212
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,302
My dish is called

1213
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,737
Mommy Poong.

1214
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,573
-Mommy Poong?
-Mommy Poong?

1215
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,576
I'm hearing lots of Poong today.

1216
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,345
What's Mommy Poong like?

1217
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:05,682
There was something
that touched my heart deeply.

1218
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,986
-What is it?
-When he cultivated the garden as a kid,

1219
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,822
-he'd harvest the vegetables for his mom.
-Eggplants.

1220
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,223
Especially eggplants.

1221
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,827
So I wanted to make
a new kind of dish with eggplants.

1222
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,464
And there were short ribs
his mother had prepared.

1223
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,833
I want to griddle it
almost to the point of deep-frying

1224
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,503
-and serve everything as a single dish.
-I see.

1225
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,406
CHEF NAM-NO'S INGREDIENTS: KELP DOENJANG,
TUNA SAUCE, RED WINE, MUSSEL, MANILA CLAM

1226
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,508
CABBAGE, MARIGOLD, BLACK SESAME, TILEFISH,
OYSTER SAUCE, DRIED PRAWN, MAGNOLIA, CHIVE

1227
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,577
The dish I'm making is

1228
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,479
Yoon Mom-no.

1229
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,315
-Yoon Mom-no?
-Yoon Mom-no?

1230
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,885
I'm going to make fish tuile
with tilefish.

1231
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,353
-Tuile?
-Tuile?

1232
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,554
-Fish tuile?
-What's that?

1233
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,025
It's from French cuisine,
a thin, chip-like garnish.

1234
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,726
That's so amazing. I love it.

1235
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,529
I'll use your mother's flower tea

1236
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,932
<i>and something else on top of that.</i>

1237
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,869
I want to use
your grandma's kelp <i>doenjang </i>as well.

1238
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:03,206
I'll also deep-fry tilefish bones
and prepare that for you.

1239
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,442
It'll be too hard for his mother.

1240
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,611
PARENT MODE ON

1241
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,547
It already sounds like
such a heavy burden for her.

1242
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,516
She should be able to do it.
Isn't it too complicated?

1243
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,785
-He's using five pans.
-He is.

1244
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,520
It's not very hard.

1245
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,589
Joon can gnaw on the tilefish bones

1246
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,826
while I gnaw on Poong.

1247
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,028
That's brutal.

1248
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,497
-He wants to gnaw on me?
-He'll gnaw on Poong.

1249
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,701
Will he overcome his Poongphobia?

1250
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:34,771
Let us begin the cook-off for Joon.

1251
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,108
They both look anxious.

1252
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,477
Once again, he'll make

1253
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,280
Yoon Nam-no shudders with Poongphobia.

1254
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,048
Kim Poong is up.

1255
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,952
But this man is here to prove that
he has eaten his mom's food for 36 years.

1256
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,722
Yoon Nam-no the mama's boy is up as well.

1257
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,090
The mama's boy?

1258
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:57,894
Which one of them will
successfully finish the mom's challenge?

1259
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,731
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin!

1260
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,233
-Mom!
-Mom!

1261
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,302
-I'm on my way now.
-He's on his way!

1262
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,604
15 MINUTES UNTIL HER SON COMES!

1263
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,473
-Mom! I'm on my way now.
-Mom!

1264
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,908
-He's on his way now.
-Here we go!

1265
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,377
Just wait, my son!

1266
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,313
-The son is on his way.
-Why is he peeling the eggplants?

1267
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,348
Why are you peeling the eggplants?

1268
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,550
I'm only going to use the insides.

1269
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,152
WORRIED, CAN'T WAIT

1270
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,820
Do the peels get in the way?

1271
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,756
Wouldn't it get too soft?

1272
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,325
-Yes, but it's okay.
-I see.

1273
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,527
1. PEEL EGGPLANTS
AND STEAM IN THE MICROWAVE

1274
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,496
Poong is using eggplants,

1275
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,931
the very vegetable Joon grew

1276
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,833
in his school garden
as an elementary school kid.

1277
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,235
That's his main ingredient.

1278
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,737
-Over here, I see the tilefish.
-The tilefish.

1279
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,805
The tilefish.

1280
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,540
That's the tilefish her son will eat.

1281
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,509
You can't leave any bones behind.

1282
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,511
-It has lots of bones.
-Yes.

1283
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,112
He's using just the flesh.

1284
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,948
Do people eat tilefish bones?
I've never heard of it before.

1285
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,051
-They're good when fried.
-Deep-fried.

1286
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,154
Tilefish bones are
sturdier than most other fish,

1287
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,122
-so he should deep-fry them well.
-I hope so.

1288
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,190
I wondered if it was edible.

1289
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,592
If you don't fry it the right way,
your son will lose teeth.

1290
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,228
But he even eats raw bulgogi.

1291
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:06,596
That's true.

1292
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,799
What's that?

1293
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,834
Rice wine.

1294
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,770
1. SPRAY RICE WINE,
COAT, AND DEEP-FRY

1295
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,272
-Is that flour?
-Flour.

1296
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,540
-Flour?
-Frying powder.

1297
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,774
He's already frying those.

1298
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,543
He must have to fry them for a while.

1299
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,678
The first thing he does is
deep-frying tilefish bones.

1300
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,347
The bones went into the oil
after one minute.

1301
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,316
ONLY SMALL BONES REMAIN!

1302
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,085
There are too many bones.

1303
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:32,155
Nam-no puts in a lot of effort
into pulling out the bones.

1304
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,424
Tilefish has lots of bones.

1305
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,727
This will be a little too anxious
for his mother to try.

1306
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,429
Tilefish has tender flesh,

1307
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,099
-but its bones are very hard.
-I see.

1308
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:46,336
It's not easy to use tweezers
to pull out everything.

1309
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,572
CHECKING UNTIL THE END

1310
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,875
It gets really annoying
when you find a bone while eating fish.

1311
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,145
Yes, especially if the bone is too hard.

1312
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,246
It'll pierce into your mouth.

1313
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:59,216
If any bones are left behind,
that'll be the end of it.

1314
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,819
He carefully turns
the tilefish into a fillet.

1315
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,688
2. SEASON TILEFISH FILLETS
WITH RICE WINE AND SALT

1316
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,656
AS ALWAYS, THE GREEN ONION ROUTINE

1317
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:07,958
Are you making green onion oil again?

1318
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:09,526
Green onion.

1319
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,162
-Are you going to mince that?
-You're right.

1320
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,264
Whoa, he's mincing green onion?

1321
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,565
It can be used like that.

1322
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,033
Is that the oil?

1323
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,102
MINCE GREEN ONION AND CHEONGYANG PEPPER

1324
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,438
He's making chili oil.

1325
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,074
-Is that the chili oil?
-That's the chili oil?

1326
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,242
What's that?

1327
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,545
You could've just used
green onion and Cheongyang pepper.

1328
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,347
Why did you choose to mince it?

1329
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,982
I'm going to use everything.

1330
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,017
-Without straining it?
-No.

1331
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,920
-It's not just the oil.
-He'll use the solid ingredients.

1332
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,089
RED PEPPER POWDER

1333
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,757
-Isn't that too much?
-It's fine.

1334
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,692
He shouldn't make it too spicy and salty.

1335
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,494
That was a lot of red pepper powder.

1336
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,429
It's for the mother's son.

1337
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,064
I hope it's not too spicy and salty.

1338
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,332
It's for her son.

1339
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,369
Do you make green onion oil
to make baby food?

1340
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,173
Answer him!

1341
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,340
That's crazy!

1342
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,610
That's why I'm asking.

1343
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,846
-I don't think he likes that yet.
-It's too much.

1344
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,248
He's putting in a lot of work into it.

1345
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,384
What's that sauce for?

1346
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,187
-It's for the eggplants.
-The eggplants.

1347
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,289
-It must be a spicy dish.
-Yes.

1348
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,191
The tilefish. He's grilling the fish.

1349
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,626
-He put it in without heating the pan.
-No.

1350
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,727
-It's over low heat.
-Is it because of time?

1351
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,462
He oiled the pan a little.

1352
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,598
Does it look good?

1353
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,400
THE BONES ARE DEEP-FRIED FOR THE 1ST TIME

1354
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,534
Those are done already.

1355
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,372
3. SHAPE THE FISH OVER LOW HEAT,
AND THEN GRILL OVER HIGH HEAT

1356
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,741
The tilefish was grilled deliciously.

1357
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,944
THE TILEFISH FILLETS LOOK GOLDEN BROWN

1358
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,012
WATER

1359
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,280
COOKING OIL

1360
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,648
What's that?

1361
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,317
FLOUR

1362
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,620
What's that? What is that, Nam-no?

1363
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,121
Tuile. He's making tuile.

1364
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,057
-Tuile?
-It's the tuile batter.

1365
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,391
That's the batter?

1366
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,427
I didn't know that was how it's done.

1367
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:54,130
He can probably make
a thousand tuiles with that.

1368
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,666
That's too much.

1369
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,201
Why did you make so much?

1370
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,636
IT'S FUN TO TEASE HIM

1371
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,771
That's a fast way of making the batter.

1372
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:02,872
BATTER'S FINISHED

1373
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,141
HE POURS THE BATTER OVER THE FISH!

1374
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,144
-He's cooking them together.
-The fish tuile.

1375
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,281
-That's a strange way of cooking.
-It is.

1376
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,049
It's like my Dongpo pork dumplings.

1377
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,184
CHUCKLE

1378
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,719
He copied your dumplings.

1379
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,489
-It's like the wings for dumplings.
-It's like the dumpling wings.

1380
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:22,459
I think he's trying to make it crunchy.

1381
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:25,428
-It's done with dumplings.
-With dumplings.

1382
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,998
It can't be just regular batter.

1383
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,433
You have to add flour, water,
and oil to make that.

1384
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,003
The edible flowers.

1385
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,739
-The flowers?
-Are you topping it with flowers?

1386
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,340
Edible flowers. I love those.

1387
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:38,775
CHUCKLE

1388
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,343
He's putting in a lot of effort.

1389
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,445
-It looks good.
-Doesn't it?

1390
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,715
-It looks good.
-But can his mother make that?

1391
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,651
I'm not sure about that.

1392
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,119
HIS MOTHER'S WISH, SHORT RIBS

1393
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,620
He pulls out short ribs.

1394
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,989
He's using short ribs
to cook in just ten minutes?

1395
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,359
Her son is a third of his way here.

1396
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:57,994
Her son is a third of his way here.

1397
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,596
Why is there no traffic?

1398
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,133
I don't think there's traffic
in the bike lane.

1399
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,201
He bikes home.

1400
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,470
He removes the bones
and uses just the meat.

1401
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,073
-The bones are the good part.
-Those are good too.

1402
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,275
-There's the fun in that.
-Yes.

1403
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,244
He's cutting it into pieces.

1404
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,979
5. CHOP JUST THE MEAT OF THE SHORT RIBS

1405
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:20,283
He just removed the bones
and began to hammer the meat.

1406
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,653
-Is he making it tenderer?
-Yes, it's a great method.

1407
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,324
6. HAMMER THE SHORT RIB

1408
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,391
Nam-no!

1409
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,393
Yoon Nam-no!

1410
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,761
He's busy.

1411
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,797
BRING ME NAM-NO!

1412
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,598
Okay.

1413
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,834
I CAN'T HEAR HIM

1414
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,036
ONION

1415
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,105
GARLIC

1416
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,973
Will he be able to make the tuile?
I don't think so.

1417
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,241
Does the tuile look okay?

1418
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,778
It's not working. It's the flour.

1419
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,880
-I guess so.
-He used too much water.

1420
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,549
Is it not working? Was it too little?

1421
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,651
He needs some more flour.

1422
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,288
He must've used the wrong amount of flour.

1423
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,757
-What will he do?
-It'll be fine after some more batter.

1424
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:05,595
Shouldn't it have been a bit thicker?

1425
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,533
6. OIL PAN AND STIR-FRY

1426
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,604
ONION, GARLIC, AND CABBAGE

1427
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,508
Nam-no puts in
a lot of effort into the tilefish.

1428
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,643
All done.

1429
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,813
Seasoning is everything.

1430
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,517
Joon's mother has her eyes on you.

1431
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,086
GINGER, GARLIC

1432
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:35,358
7. MIX SHORT RIBS WITH TUNA SAUCE,
OYSTER SAUCE, GINGER, GARLIC, RICE WINE

1433
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,961
He tries it himself.

1434
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,765
People who can't eat raw meat
would spit it out after tasting it.

1435
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:42,999
But it's good.

1436
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,234
-Is it?
-All right.

1437
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,803
-Her son is halfway there.
-Halfway?

1438
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,972
He's halfway there.

1439
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,207
You have 7 minutes and 30 seconds.

1440
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,277
It'd be nice if her son took his time.

1441
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,247
This is much more entertaining
than short-form contents.

1442
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:01,184
These 15 minutes don't feel too long.

1443
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,887
Yoon Nam-no uses mussels.

1444
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,789
GETS RED WINE READY

1445
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,992
He must be making the sauce
with the seafood.

1446
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,860
RICE WINE

1447
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:17,167
8. MIX MUSSELS AND MANILA CLAMS IN WINE
WITH VEGETABLES IN RICE WINE

1448
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:21,037
AND HE GETS INSTANT RICE READY

1449
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,072
A HANDFUL

1450
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:24,941
Are those chives?

1451
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,009
Yes!

1452
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,978
I have to sprinkle these on top
to add some fragrance at the end.

1453
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:29,979
I see.

1454
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,615
Poong improved a lot as a cook,

1455
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,250
but not his chopping skills.

1456
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,519
And you've abandoned
your Chinese kitchen knife.

1457
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,755
It's right here. I used it to cut meat.

1458
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,357
-I knew it. So sanitary.
-Yes, to be sanitary.

1459
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,461
He's not using the knife
he used for meat for sanitary reasons.

1460
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,229
Poong is that sanitary.

1461
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:48,531
Poongphobia.

1462
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,134
-The eggplants.
-It's hot!

1463
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,770
-The eggplants.
-That's what happened?

1464
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:54,971
They became mushy.

1465
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,139
He's using a mortar?

1466
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,674
What's he doing?

1467
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,345
Will you smash those?

1468
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,414
It's the Middle Eastern style.

1469
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,382
What about rice?

1470
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,517
Rice.

1471
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:08,485
That's a good one.

1472
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,787
He doesn't have rice.

1473
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,622
I just saved you.

1474
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:17,193
He's mixing the eggplants with the sauce.

1475
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,730
-Jung-hwan, will you go out?
-Yes.

1476
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,300
Poong begins to deep-fry the short ribs.

1477
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,336
He's just frying it over high heat.

1478
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,704
Are you making sweet and sour beef?

1479
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,273
-That's new.
-He's frying short ribs.

1480
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,311
I'm not sure if this tuile will happen.
It may not come together.

1481
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,180
It's splattering.

1482
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,517
What's this? Stir-fried mussels?

1483
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,120
It's for him to eat with rice.

1484
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,455
Like a home-cooked meal.

1485
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,525
What is this? Minced eggplants?

1486
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,159
Yes, smashed eggplants.

1487
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,962
Whenever I walk out while Poong cooks,

1488
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,697
it always smells the same.

1489
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,666
I see. It's the same smell.

1490
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:00,470
I always smell the Chinese-style
green onion oil and chili oil.

1491
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,405
Let me try that.

1492
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,209
He put a lot of work into this.
Cheongyang pepper, green onion, and what?

1493
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,378
-Minced garlic and ginger.
-Minced garlic.

1494
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:09,979
-Ginger.
-Cabbage.

1495
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,347
ANXIOUS

1496
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:16,252
Can he continue to give Nam-no
the Poongphobia?

1497
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,488
Will Nam-no shudder?

1498
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,623
Will he shudder?

1499
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,026
What's wrong?

1500
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,227
I'm about to shudder.

1501
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:26,729
This is

1502
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,665
really strong. But it's good.

1503
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,900
He'll mix it with eggplants, though.

1504
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,302
It's for the son.

1505
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,304
It's spicy, but it's good.

1506
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,473
It feels like I'm eating chili oil

1507
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,776
with a spoonful of Cheongyang pepper.

1508
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,278
Chili oil with pepper?

1509
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,180
-But it's good?
-It's sweet too.

1510
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,315
You have 2 minutes and 50 seconds.

1511
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,150
9. ADD CHOPPED CHIVES
INTO THE SEASONED SMASHED EGGPLANTS

1512
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,820
THE INSTANT RICE IS READY

1513
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,423
But the more I sit on it,
the more delicious it is.

1514
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:54,324
-It gets better?
-Yes.

1515
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,658
Is it still good?

1516
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,961
It's not so bad.
I think Joon will like it.

1517
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,996
His rice is ready.

1518
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,497
<i>Doenjang.</i>

1519
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,334
That's his grandmother's <i>doenjang</i>.

1520
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:09,806
9. ADD KELP DOENJANG, DRIED PRAWN,
OYSTER SAUCE, AND SUGAR INTO THE STIR-FRY

1521
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,107
SUGAR

1522
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,512
-It happened.
-He did it.

1523
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,581
-Is that the tuile? It is.
-He did it.

1524
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,150
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1525
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,518
It looks very pretty.

1526
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,253
Whoa, what is that?

1527
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,090
-It happened.
-He did it.

1528
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,825
-It looks so cool.
-That's amazing.

1529
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,694
He's using chives too.

1530
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,496
10. ADD CHIVES INTO THE STIR-FRY
AND COOK WITH THE LEFTOVER HEAT

1531
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,798
It's the stir-fry.

1532
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,900
This almost looks like a Chinese dish.

1533
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,202
It's like freshwater snail
and <i>doenjang </i>stir-fry.

1534
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:42,538
Freshwater snail stir-fry?
You must've used his grandma's <i>doenjang</i>.

1535
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,439
His grandma's?

1536
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:46,009
-I can smell the <i>doenjang</i>.
-I see.

1537
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,344
But are these bones edible?

1538
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,979
Yes, it'll be crunchy and delicious.

1539
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,515
I'm curious,
but it's not enough portion for me to try.

1540
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,818
I see. The son is almost here.

1541
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,187
Is that the sauce for rice?

1542
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:01,557
-You're right.
-You smashed eggplants and made that?

1543
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,292
That's kind of new.

1544
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,594
That's new.

1545
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,362
Whoa, that was eggplants?

1546
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,031
He smashed the eggplants.

1547
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,732
HE'S NEVER SEEN THIS EGGPLANT DISH BEFORE

1548
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:10,800
It looks so good.

1549
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,268
It looks good.

1550
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,671
-A minute and 40 seconds.
-He deep-fries it again.

1551
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,674
Hurry up. There's a minute left.

1552
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,008
He deep-fries it again.

1553
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,979
They have to put in a lot of care,
and I can see that happening.

1554
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,313
He's serving rice too.

1555
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,548
He serves rice.

1556
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,051
He's putting
in a lot of thought into this.

1557
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,152
It's so hot.

1558
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:30,353
One minute, Nam-no.

1559
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,523
It's a minute before the son arrives!

1560
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,824
He's almost here!

1561
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,628
He'll be here in just 30 seconds!

1562
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,430
You can hear his footsteps.

1563
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,799
He just got on the elevator!

1564
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,067
-He's on the elevator!
-He's on the elevator!

1565
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,668
You have 30 seconds left.

1566
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:46,869
SHAKING

1567
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,771
His hands are trembling!

1568
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,106
I see.

1569
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,709
A CLASSY-LOOKING DISH!

1570
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,043
Poong sprinkles sesames on top.

1571
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,545
You have 15 seconds, Poong!

1572
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,280
-He's almost here.
-Poong is done.

1573
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,049
The son is almost here!

1574
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,218
-He's on the stairs!
-Ten.

1575
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:03,386
-Poong finishes first.
-Nine.

1576
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,954
-Hurry up.
-Eight.

1577
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,856
-He's almost here.
-Poong must be done.

1578
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,692
The son is almost here.

1579
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,761
-He's on the stairs!
-Ten.

1580
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,162
-Poong finishes first.
-Nine.

1581
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,099
-Hurry up.
-Eight. Seven. Six.

1582
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,967
-Five.
-The bones.

1583
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,136
-Four. Three.
-The bones.

1584
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,437
Two. One.

1585
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,906
Mom, I'm here!

1586
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,641
I'm here!

1587
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,310
He's done.

1588
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,278
-You won't serve the bones?
-No, I won't.

1589
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,247
My mom's sweating a lot.

1590
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:32,849
His mom is sweating a lot.

1591
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:37,987
SHEDDING BEAUTIFUL SWEAT TO FEED HER SON

1592
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,322
I feel bad.

1593
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,424
These look beautifully burnt.

1594
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,192
Why didn't you serve this?

1595
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,594
You should try it.

1596
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,263
-This looks…
-Don't eat it!

1597
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,298
Serve it! Serve the inedible stuff!

1598
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,434
Serve it! Why not? You had it made!

1599
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,936
You finished making it,
so serve it with the dish!

1600
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,906
He chooses not to serve
the tilefish bones.

1601
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,007
You should have!

1602
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:03,446
And both dishes were made for Joon
in this special mission, mom's challenge.

1603
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,749
Do you think your mother
would be able to follow the recipe?

1604
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,786
These were much fancier
and prettier than I expected,

1605
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,688
-so I wasn't quite sure.
-I see.

1606
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:15,391
What's troubling me more than that is

1607
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,827
that my mom must've done this
every single time.

1608
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:21,297
I felt really bad
as soon as I realized that.

1609
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:26,068
<i>Her son may have walked home</i>
<i>for 15 minutes without thinking,</i>

1610
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,703
<i>but she must've cooked in a frenzy.</i>

1611
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,173
I did that for 38 years. What do I do now?

1612
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,774
What will you do?

1613
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:32,809
Be grateful for her.

1614
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,243
Yes, you can be a good son.

1615
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,979
Poong finished cooking first.

1616
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,382
<i>Please try Mommy Poong first.</i>

1617
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,083
JOON'S VEGGIE OF MEMORIES, EGGPLANTS,

1618
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:44,821
MEET WITH SHORT RIBS
FULL OF HIS MOM'S LOVE

1619
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,925
WEBTOON ARTIST KIM POONG'S MOMMY POONG

1620
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,927
It looks good.

1621
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,228
Do you like how it smells?

1622
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,930
I love the smell.

1623
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,398
RELIEVED

1624
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,533
-He likes spicy food.
-He does.

1625
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,602
Eat the rice and eggplants together,

1626
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,270
and then pick up a piece of meat.

1627
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,272
-I see.
-Take a big spoonful.

1628
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,708
-It's eggplants over rice.
-Rice.

1629
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,677
It still feels hot in my mouth.

1630
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,879
He put eggplants over rice

1631
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,615
and topped it with fried short ribs.

1632
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,051
Do you know what's weird?

1633
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:15,985
It's not spicy at all.

1634
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:16,953
It's not?

1635
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,888
-Not at all.
-It looked very spicy back there.

1636
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,024
-It's not that spicy.
-It must be because I had just the sauce.

1637
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,060
Even kids could eat this.

1638
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,061
It's that mild?

1639
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,963
-It's not spicy at all.
-Not at all?

1640
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,297
It's just delicious.

1641
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,168
I see. Poong made correct calculations.

1642
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,502
Mmm.

1643
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,005
-Try the short ribs.
-I wanted to make

1644
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,841
something healthy for my child,
instead of something too strong.

1645
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,611
He poured
lots of red pepper powder into that.

1646
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:44,347
The viewers should try this recipe.

1647
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,749
It's the kind of flavor
everyone will love.

1648
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,886
I see. His eyes widened.

1649
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:54,523
And I couldn't imagine what it'd be like
to eat deep-fried short ribs.

1650
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,525
<i>But it's much more delicious</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

1651
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,362
I can taste the short ribs

1652
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,665
<i>along with the crunchiness of fries.</i>

1653
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,799
It's unique and delicious.

1654
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,769
It's also amazing
that he made eggplants like this.

1655
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,704
There's a Middle Eastern dish

1656
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,440
<i>called baba ghanoush.</i>

1657
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,742
<i>It's similar to this.</i>

1658
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,211
I see. They must smash eggplants too.

1659
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,079
Have you been studying
Middle Eastern cuisine?

1660
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,648
Baba what?

1661
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,283
Baba ghanoush.

1662
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,417
-Baba gani?
-Baba ghanoush.

1663
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,252
-Baba ghanoush.
-I see.

1664
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,688
Joon likes eggplants, so it worked.

1665
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,089
-Yes.
-Yes.

1666
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,724
Anything he could've done better?

1667
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,393
It's perfect.

1668
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,762
I don't know how to explain this.

1669
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,331
It tastes light yet not light.

1670
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,899
It feels perfect.

1671
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,335
-The balance.
-Light yet not light.

1672
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,171
-It's on fire.
-He says it's on fire.

1673
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:44,040
It's much better than it looks.

1674
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,341
Is it?

1675
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:48,210
I can't believe this, Poong.

1676
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,646
Will his Poongphobia continue?

1677
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,983
Next, Yoon Mom-no.

1678
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,318
TENDER TILEFISH AND CRUNCHY TUILE

1679
01:05:55,952 --> 01:06:00,723
SERVED WITH STIR-FRIED MUSSEL
AND MANILA CLAM WITH KELP DOENJANG!

1680
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:05,928
CHEF YOON NAM-NO'S YOON MOM-NO

1681
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,564
This one looks very pretty.

1682
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,033
-It's almost…
-It's perfect.

1683
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,635
First of all, it's crazy.

1684
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,670
It looks so pretty.

1685
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,342
-I wonder what it's like.
-He worked hard on the tilefish.

1686
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,077
I'll eat it with rice.

1687
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,013
He tries it with rice.

1688
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,148
The tilefish.

1689
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,485
I hope it's seasoned well.

1690
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,489
This is hard. What do I do?

1691
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,124
-Why?
-This is perfect too.

1692
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,225
I see.

1693
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,527
Man.

1694
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:39,695
He's good.

1695
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,531
You should consider
how it looked when you decide.

1696
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,300
The key to these dishes are

1697
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,102
that it's something you won't get sick of.

1698
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,405
In a way, I think you can
eat these every single day.

1699
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,108
I thought his dish might be
a little bland.

1700
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,676
This is stronger than that one.

1701
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,212
-That one looked stronger.
-The eggplants aren't strong.

1702
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,147
ANOTHER BITE

1703
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,715
-It looked bland.
-It did.

1704
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,451
-Huh?
-What?

1705
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,719
-What's this?
-What?

1706
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,187
What did I just chew on?

1707
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,088
Did you chew on something?

1708
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,523
Something… What is this?

1709
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,624
Was it

1710
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,892
a piece of bone?

1711
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:10,793
The bone?

1712
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,695
I chewed on something delicious.

1713
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,865
-Something delicious? Like candy?
-It's like candy. What is this?

1714
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,033
Did you add sugar?

1715
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,901
-What?
-He chewed on something delicious.

1716
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,603
-Was it a bone?
-Was it a flower?

1717
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,073
-It must be the bone.
-I see.

1718
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,208
-The bone?
-You found a bone?

1719
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,577
-The bone?
-You found a bone?

1720
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,012
I pulled out everything.

1721
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,280
But he said it was good.

1722
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,382
The bones were the best part.

1723
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,352
-This one here.
-Why didn't you serve the bones?

1724
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,887
-What's that?
-What is this?

1725
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,388
It's the fin.

1726
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,891
-I see.
-The fried fin?

1727
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,626
The fin is really good.

1728
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,461
-Is it toasty?
-Yes.

1729
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,662
The fin?

1730
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,732
-Why the fin?
-He worked so hard on the meat,

1731
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,135
-but he likes the fin best.
-He likes the fin.

1732
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:57,706
It's because everything is
tender and crunchy,

1733
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:01,444
so when I bit on that hard fin,
the texture was enjoyable.

1734
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,046
-I see.
-It was the texture.

1735
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:07,683
Nam-no didn't mean to do that,
but he had a happy accident.

1736
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,385
-Let me try just this.
-Yes.

1737
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,054
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

1738
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,756
Nam-no had a happy accident.

1739
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,758
You should've served the bones.

1740
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,462
This is really hard. Jeez.

1741
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,831
You didn't serve the bones on purpose.

1742
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,299
No.

1743
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,034
Will you let him try those?

1744
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,569
Just in case.

1745
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,805
He didn't serve it,
so don't use it for the evaluation.

1746
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,274
-He might like it.
-Give it a try.

1747
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,211
The bones are harder than the fins, so…

1748
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,679
It's good for you.

1749
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,815
SO?

1750
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,084
It's good for you.

1751
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:43,285
This is nice.

1752
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,955
It's nice!

1753
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,590
It's nice!

1754
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,059
This is good.

1755
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,761
-You can't add that to the evaluation.
-No?

1756
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:55,798
-He chose not to serve that.
-This would be great with beer.

1757
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,235
He's a guy who eats shrimp shells.

1758
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,536
Yes, you're right.

1759
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,404
-You're right.
-Yes, right.

1760
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,573
-I had forgotten.
-He eats the shells.

1761
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,841
The idol star with good teeth.

1762
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,310
-The idol star with good teeth.
-Good teeth?

1763
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,378
This is so good.

1764
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:12,414
You would've gotten more points
if you served those.

1765
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,083
I told you to serve those.

1766
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,485
What a shame, Nam-no.

1767
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:19,288
I've never had anything like this.

1768
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,758
-It's so good.
-You could've won.

1769
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,095
Let's try
Webtoon Artist Poong's Mommy Poong.

1770
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,668
This is new.

1771
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:33,736
It's good.

1772
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,705
I thought it'd taste strong,
but not too much.

1773
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:39,341
The creamy part is
the smashed eggplants, right?

1774
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,076
-Eggplants.
-Right?

1775
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,679
That creamy sauce was the best part.

1776
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,447
When I tried this,

1777
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:48,918
I felt like I was eating
a soft version of kimchi jeon.

1778
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,819
It's good with rice,

1779
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,790
but it'd also be good with thin noodles
when it's still hot.

1780
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,226
It's a great dish to use here and there.

1781
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,728
-I learned something today.
-I see.

1782
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,198
He made a dish that wasn't like him.

1783
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,933
It wasn't like him?

1784
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,334
<i>When he first made the sauce</i>

1785
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,503
<i>with red pepper powder,</i>
<i>it must've been pungent.</i>

1786
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,539
<i>But when he steamed eggplants</i>
<i>and added some water,</i>

1787
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:11,874
<i>it created a great balance.</i>

1788
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,410
This was a completely different dish
from his usual ones.

1789
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:16,812
It was delicious.

1790
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,815
He could also make something like this

1791
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,750
when he thought of cooking for a child.

1792
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,921
-It's perfect.
-He did it with a dad's heart.

1793
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,489
You only do this for your son?

1794
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,392
What about us?

1795
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:31,727
Will you be like this?

1796
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,295
Call me Dad, then.

1797
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,100
We found out that he could do this.

1798
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:42,171
Next, let's try Chef Nam-no's Yoon Mom-no.

1799
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,607
Did he say this fin part was good?

1800
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,978
-It's good.
-He used garlic too.

1801
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:52,615
-The tuile was better than I thought.
-I see. It's <i>doenjang</i>.

1802
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,783
<i>Doenjang </i>and fish always go well together.

1803
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,719
It's a great match.

1804
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:00,689
-And <i>doenjang </i>is good for you.
-It has a nice, earthy taste.

1805
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,227
It's like eating rice with <i>gang-doenjang</i>.

1806
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,730
<i>There are lots of textures,</i>
<i>including crunchiness</i>

1807
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,032
<i>and the tender fish, so it's really good.</i>

1808
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,735
He just did what he could do best.

1809
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:16,772
I hope your mother watches this
and finds something helpful.

1810
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,241
But the decision is her son's.

1811
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:21,877
They both cooked with the mother's heart.

1812
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,580
It's now time to decide.

1813
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,048
<i>Press one for Yoon Nam-no.</i>

1814
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,951
<i>Press two for Kim Poong.</i>

1815
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:31,420
<i>Make your choice.</i>

1816
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:32,921
CHUCKLING…

1817
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,990
You must choose one dish.

1818
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,158
Jeez.

1819
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,626
It must be hard.

1820
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,094
HE CHOSE ONE

1821
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,396
Did you press a button?

1822
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,697
-I did.
-He decided.

1823
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,999
He made his decision.

1824
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,535
Let's find out Joon's choice.

1825
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,737
Which one of them won?

1826
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,539
Special mission, mom's challenge.

1827
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:53,909
-Please!
-Will Poong take another victory?

1828
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,778
-Please!
-Chef Yoon Nam-no.

1829
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:58,614
Nam-no has won both times against Poong!

1830
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,717
Will he get his revenge
through this round?

1831
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:07,222
Or will he relapse into Poongphobia
and let Poong take another victory?

1832
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:10,025
Who did Joon choose?

1833
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,961
Let's find out. Show us!

1834
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,197
Who did he choose?

1835
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,465
Who won?

1836
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:17,766
Who did he choose?

1837
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:18,667
Who won?

1838
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,269
KIM POONG WINS

1839
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,870
KIM POONG'S MOMMY POONG WINS

1840
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,539
Poong wins yet again!

1841
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:26,709
-Poong wins yet again!
-Poongphobia!

1842
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,179
Wait!

1843
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,880
-Poong wins!
-No!

1844
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:33,315
Poong wins yet again!

1845
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,217
Poongphobia!

1846
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,252
His Poongphobia continues.

1847
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:38,454
Poongphobia!

1848
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,022
SWOOSH

1849
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,924
Nam-no shudders yet again.

1850
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,993
What's going on here?

1851
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,963
Poong is the strongest against Nam-no.

1852
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,532
LOST 3 TIMES IN A ROW AGAINST POONG

1853
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,301
I liked Nam-no's dish.

1854
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,469
It was great.

1855
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,371
But it was the eggplant.

1856
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:56,772
Eggplants and short ribs.

1857
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:59,141
I was amazed
that he smashed the eggplants.

1858
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,744
Most kids don't like eggplants, right?

1859
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,446
But if you smash it like this,

1860
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,682
-they'll have no idea and love it.
-The idea was insane.

1861
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:08,217
That's why I chose him.

1862
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,752
But Chef Nam-no's dish was great too.

1863
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:13,422
He turned the tilefish into… Tulip?

1864
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,891
It's not tulip, it's tuile.

1865
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,527
-Call it tilefish tulip.
-Tilefish tulip.

1866
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:19,995
Call it tilefish tulip.

1867
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:24,400
I really liked the new idea
and thought it was fun.

1868
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,701
It was fun to look at.

1869
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,536
Well, anyway,

1870
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:31,907
Poong proves once again that
he's strong against Nam-no.

1871
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,511
You've won all three rounds
against Nam-no in this season.

1872
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,680
Winning all three rounds is pretty big.

1873
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,048
POONGPHOBIA WAS REAL

1874
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,517
Let's hear a word from him.

1875
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,986
I mentioned Poongphobia as a joke,

1876
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:47,356
but when he failed
to serve the fried bone fish

1877
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,526
with confidence, I thought,

1878
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,995
"Why couldn't he score?"

1879
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:56,865
-He was right before the goal.
-Yes, and I kept it wide open.

1880
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,434
When he didn't serve it,

1881
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,837
I thought, "This is bad.
This is going to jinx him forever."

1882
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,906
<i>He should've taken a shot in confidence.</i>

1883
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,074
<i>I may not have won if he served those.</i>

1884
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,244
You fried the bones with so much work

1885
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:12,147
so why were you unable to serve those?

1886
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,982
How do you feel, Nam-no?

1887
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,285
I want to leave and go drink soju.

1888
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,689
Then please put a star on Poong,

1889
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,925
the winner of this round.

1890
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,693
POONG WINS THE ROUND
WITH THE POONGPHOBIA EPIDEMIC

1891
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,196
My gosh. I can't believe this.

1892
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,898
Webtoon Artist Poong takes his fifth win!

1893
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,733
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1894
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,368
STAY TUNED FOR NEXT WEEK'S FRIDGE OWNERS,
DOH KYUNG-SOO AND PARK BYUNG-EUN

1895
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,304
Poong destroys Nam-no.

1896
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:39,007
Today's fridge owners are
Doh Kyung-soo and Park Byung-eun!

1897
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,542
He's famous as a great cook.

1898
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:41,777
I wanted to be a military cook.

1899
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:42,845
TA-DA

1900
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:45,981
-You made all these?
-Yes.

1901
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,115
I buy ingredients each time.

1902
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,817
-He likes to use fresh ingredients.
-He's the real deal.

1903
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,119
I'm here at Noryangjin Fish Market.

1904
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:52,421
These are all huge.

1905
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,523
Let the 15-minute cook-off begin

1906
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,792
with fresh ingredients he just bought!

1907
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,227
It's on fire.

1908
01:14:58,293 --> 01:14:59,261
Hey, open up!

1909
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,729
They won't open up.

1910
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:01,797
-Corporal Kwon.
-Yes, sir!

1911
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,031
-Private Yoon!
-I'm sorry, sir!

1912
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,266
-Louder! What's this?
-I'm sorry, sir!

1913
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,834
Cauliflower steak… Ugh.

1914
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:08,470
Cut! Do it over!

1915
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,440
This is the battle
the world has been waiting for.

1916
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,942
<i>-I'm deeply afraid.</i>
<i>-That's love.</i>

1917
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,245
<i>Can Chef Jong-won handle me?</i>

1918
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:17,913
It's so peculiar.

1919
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,848
Poong is chopping veggies!

1920
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,050
GETTING DISTRACTED

1921
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:23,452
This is like foam from soap.

1922
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,353
Foam from soap?

1923
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,455
You have to move quickly
if you want to finish.

1924
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,323
CAN HE OVERCOME THIS ORDEAL?

1925
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,260
<i>What if it's good?</i>

1926
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,829
-It's good.
-Is it?

1927
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,297
THE KIM POONG MAGIC WAS ACTIVATED TOO?

1928
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,765
It'll be bad if he loses.

1929
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:50,946
