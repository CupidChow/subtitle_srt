What did they say at the hospital?

10
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,840
It's not painful.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,990
What should we do?

12
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,880
You should focus on taking care of your body.

13
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,300
I can do it well by myself, so don't worry about it.

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,600
Even if you can do it well, working on your own is not easy.

Let me see if there's anybody who can work instead of me.

16
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,320
Don't worry about it, and rest well until you take off your cast.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,030
Also, don't worry about the hospital bill.

But it's real, though. I wonder what happened.

21
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,780
I wonder as well.

- Auntie! I'm here!
- Welcome!

29
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,180
- I'll have stir-fried squid.
- Like usual?

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,750
- Yes, very spicy, please.
- You got it.

31
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,290
- I'll take one bottle of soju.
- Okay!

32
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,530
I'll take this one.

33
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,440
Auntie, I'm the one who ordered the stir-fried squid.

34
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,040
Yours is here.

35
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,640
You two both ordered the same dish that's not even on the menu.

36
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,360
I didn't know that.

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,250
How are you feeling?

38
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,670
I'm totally fine.

39
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,750
I feel like I can come to work tomorrow.

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,180
How can you wait tables with your arm in a cast?

41
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,870
What about your friends?

42
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,760
I asked around, but nobody could do it.

43
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,550
How are you going to work from tomorrow?

44
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,100
You don't have to worry about that and focus on getting better.

45
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,860
I can do it well by myself, so don't worry.

46
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,470
Shall I just come to work?

47
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,000
How can you work in that condition?

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,770
It'll ruin the restaurant's impression.

49
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,230
How can you say it like that?

50
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,500
Are you going to make me a bad boss who puts a patient to work?

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,710
You're only concerned about your image, aren't you?

52
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,770
Your image to me is not good right now.

53

I'm saying this for you.

54

I'll talk to you later. I have to eat now.

I went to your restaurant today, but it was closed.

62
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,620
I guess your staff couldn't come to work?

I'm here to propose again to you.

72
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,040
I won't do it.

73
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,610
Just eat and go, please.

74
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,430
Why don't you listen to me more and then decide?

75
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,940
Why don't you hear me some more first?

76
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,970
We can eat here today, right?

77
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,940
Welcome.

78
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,540
Are there two people in total?

79
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,820
It's open. Come inside, guys.

80
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,820
We're having a school reunion, but the other store didn't have enough seats.

81
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,950
It's okay for middle-aged people like us to be here, right?

82
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,900
Of course.

83
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,830
What can I get for you?

84
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:10,120
Our kids are all gathered in one house right now, and can you deliver the food there first?

85
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,200
Kids are very hungry.

86
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,340
I think it won't be possible to do that.

87
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,890
Of course! Thank you for coming to our place.

88
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,520
What are you doing right now?

89
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,380
Let's talk later. Don't you need my help?

90
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,490
Then can you do the delivery?

91
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,300
Yes. Don't worry about it.

92
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,060
I delivered the food safely to the address you gave me.

93
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,810
Thank you.

94
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,360
The kids are all very pretty and handsome.

95
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,150
Thank you, young man. Your heart is pretty as your face.

96
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,720
Thank you. Let me know if you need anything.

97
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,540
Okay.

98
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,720
Enjoy.

99
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,260
Why don't you talk about the food before you go?

100
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,720
Also, what kind of liquor do you have?

101
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,290
We don't know well, so please recommend something that goes well with the food.

102
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,380
Our restaurant doesn't serve any alcohol.

103
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,340
No alcohol in a restaurant?

104
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,410
What?

105
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,290
How can a restaurant not have any alcohol?

106
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,830
Currently, our restaurant is not selling any alcohol.

107
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:11,840
But if it's okay with you, I would like to introduce a traditional soju.

108
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,670
Also, for free.

109
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,250
For free!

110
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,390
But will it be okay if I ask you for a simple survey after tasting it?

111
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,240
Of course! You're giving out that for free.

112
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,490
Thank you so much.

113
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,990
And the food you will have today is Korean-style pasta with perilla oil and salted octopus.

114
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,850
If you mix it and have it with perilla leaves, the scent and texture will be very good.

115
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,030
The next dish is the short rib patties made of Korean beef.

116
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:42,930
If you have it with the water parsley salad next to it, it cuts the greasiness so that you can enjoy it more.

117
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,210
I hope you enjoy the food.

118
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, thank you.

119
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
Thank you for the food!

120
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,570

Thank you.

124
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,090
Why don't you reconsider my proposal?

125
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,250
It's a great proposal, and I got help from you today.

126
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,390
But I don't have the capacity to do it right now.

127
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,860
But thank you for your proposal and help.

128
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,540
Then, what if...

129
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,440
How did you persuade him?

130
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,130
Well...

131
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,030
I'll work here during the weekends to help you.

132
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,630
Excuse me?

133
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,220
Don't you need someone to help for some time?

134
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,820
I waited tables for a long time when I was a student.

135
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,470
Isn't it a problem starting this weekend?

136
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,860
But what if he doesn't sign the contract after your help?

137
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,640
If that happens, I should look for another job like you told me.

138
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,820
But I can do it. I'm confident about it.

139
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,470
Really?

140
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,940
Yes.

141
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,290
Welcome. Please have a seat where you want.

142

Are you smiling?

You sound like you're in a good mood. That doesn't make me feel good.

No, I mean your voice sounds great.

Okay. I'll see you soon.

164
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,920
Get some rest.

165
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,550
Okay.

166
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,860
Hello?

167
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,270
What is it?

168
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,040
Hey, come out. Let's have some spicy chicken.

169
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,260
I drank too much last night.

170
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,920
My stomach is not feeling great right now.

171
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,370
Did you drink for a good occasion?

172
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,290
Of course, since I broke up with that bastard!

173
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,250
It's not "of course."

174
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,660
Then come eat the chicken and not drink.

175
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,440
Are you not listening to me? I said my stomach was not feeling well!

176
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,760
If I eat something spicy, it'll be a bloody stool!

177
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,010
How can you say that? I'm eating right now!

178
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,570
Just come and eat something not spicy! I'm bored.

179
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,540
Hey, hang up the phone.

180
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,420
I told you, my stomach is not good!

181
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,690
He thinks a bloody stool is a joke.

182
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,160
Hey—

183
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,100
It's spicy.

184
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,150
It's spicy, but I can't stop eating it.

185
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,970
Because I can't stop it.

186
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,790
If I stop eating, I feel like my mouth will tear apart.

187
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,140
Oh, that hurts!

188
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,750
