Yes.

Yes?

Our Team Leader says that Ki Hoon needs to cook on the stage on the launching day.

What?

00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,540
- Be quiet.
- Y-Yes.

What's going on?

19
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,980
Well, the thing is...

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,930
On the launching day,

21
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:02,600
they want you to go up on a stage and cook.

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,140
I won't do that!

23
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,100
Hyung, why not?

24
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,210
He's not picking up his phone and not responding to my texts.

25
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,350
What should we do now?

26
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,070
Shall I go to his place?

27
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,600
No. Let's give him some time.

28

53
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,970
You said you were hungry.

54
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,530
But still, you came over at this late hour?

55
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,200
Do you know what stage fright is?

56
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,310
Yes, I know.

57
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
It's something that makes your eyesight go blank when you stand in front of a lot of people.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,250
That's me.

59
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,600
My sight goes blank, and my vision gets blurry.

60
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,750
When it's like that, I can't speak.

61
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,980
I see.

62
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,980
I didn't know that.

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,540
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,770
Why are you laughing? Is it funny?

65
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,070
You speak fine in front of me.

66
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,460
What if you think about something good when you feel like your eyesight goes blank?

67
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,880
Think about something good?

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,730
Yes. Wouldn't that make you feel a bit calmer?

69
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,840
You have the strongest principle than anyone else.

70
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,080
You have the courage to refuse the customers for not selling alcohol.

71
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,750
Also, you have the courage to admit it quickly when you think you're wrong.

72
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,920
Why don't you do it with that kind of courage?

73
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,750
What is that kind of courage?

74
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,900
Admitting you're wrong is not an easy thing.

75
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,910
It's because it's hard not to be self-conscious. And telling someone honestly like now is also courage.

76
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,650
Right?

77
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,670
If you say so, I'll give it a try.

78
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,550
Yes.

79
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,780
Then, shall I be a little bit more courageous?

80
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,440
You asked the reason why I don't sell alcohol in my store.

81
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,080
Will you tell me?

82
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,010
Do you remember?

83
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,160
The spicy rice cake place that you were looking for when you first came to my store

84
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,770
was where my grandma did business to raise me.

85
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,440
It must have been hard to raise a young grandchild. She drank every day.

86
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,590
And I hated that because it felt like I was the reason for her to drink.

87
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,590
The night before the first day of college, she was drinking alone again.

88
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,150
At that time, I thought I had become alone because of alcohol.

89
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,350
In retrospect, on that night, when my grandma was drinking alone,

90
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,810
I think she wanted to congratulate herself on raising her grandson and doing a great job until now.

91
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,350
What I just said was too heavy, wasn't it?

92
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,080
No.

93
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,240
I was a bit surprised that you said it so easily.

94
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,730
Did I?

95
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,610
It was difficult for me to say it.

96
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,370
But still...

97
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,450
There's only a good time ahead of you now.

98
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,210
So let's cheer up together.

99
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,080
Okay.

100
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,380
Now that you have me, you won't be lonely.

101
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,200
We'll see.

102
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,040
Hyung, but still!

103
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,590
You could've just said yes.

104
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,310
It's so exhausting to work after a long break.

105
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,080
Why did you come out to work? I told you to rest until today.

106
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,120
I need to adjust again to come back to work.

107
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,480
Also, you are here to help.

108
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,440
And today's the weekend. It was so busy today!

109
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,130
Right. We had so many customers today. The time flew by.

110
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,540
When there are a lot of customers, the end of the day comes in a blink of an eye.

111
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,640
By the way, today's your last day here. Right?

112
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,910
Yes.

113
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,690
Drink this. Thank you for your hard work during this busy time.

114
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,680
It's Ji Yoo's last day working here, and it won't end like this. Right?

115
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,720
What do you want to eat?

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Yes! Let's eat something expensive.

117
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,740
Sure, let's get something expensive. I'll get everything you want to eat.

118
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,990
Nice! What do you want to eat, Ji Yoo?

119
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,340
Do you want beef? Sashimi?

120
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,070
How about pork belly?

121
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,640
I really wanted to have grilled beef today.

122
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,420
This place looks good as well.

123
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,340
Are you saying it's beef-like pork?

124
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,650
- Hello!
- Hello!

125
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,390
Wow, you're so handsome.

126
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
Han Ji Yoo, how can you tell this place to others?

127
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,870
To tell you about this place—

128
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,410
We don't tell this place to anybody.

129
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,540
Really?

130
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll start grilling the meat for you.

131
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll do it.

132
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,540
Let me pour you a glass.

133
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,510
Thank you.

134
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,020
Thank you.

135
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,520
You two really worked hard until now. Let's enjoy the food.

136
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,640
Shall we do cheers first?

137
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,980
Cheers!

138
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,290
It's incredible!

139
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,120
I can understand what you said earlier.

140
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,830
After all, pork belly is the best!

141
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,720
What was that?

142
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,870
Have this greasy pork belly with kimchi and garlic.

143
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,190
And wash down the oil in your mouth with soju.

144
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,230
And have another bite when the soju's bitterness disappears.

145
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,130
It's an endless cycle.

146
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,200
I think pork belly is the most delicious food in the world, after all.

147
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,020
Pork belly eaten together is the best.

148
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,120
It's incredible. Ji Ha and Ji Yoo's passion for food is philosophical.

149
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,790
I respect that.

150
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,860
You're overly praising!

151
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,620
Here!

152
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,820
- Ji Yoo.
- Yes.

Ki Hoon.

154
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,150
Let me pour it for you.

155
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,270
Thank you.

156
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,430
You two look great together.

157
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,780
It's not like that.

158
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,610
Shall we do cheers again?

159
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,990
Cheers!

160
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,650
Deputy Kim, when was your last relationship?

161
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,710
- Me?
- I'm curious.

162
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,600
When was it?

163
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,330
It's a secret.

164
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,370
Okay, then, what do you think love is?

165
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,510
I broke up—!

166
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,700
- Oh, no!
- When did you break up?

167
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,830
It's because he was too selfish, and—!

168
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,540
- You were?
- No, he was too selfish. And I was...

169
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,820
It got pretty chilly.

170
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,020
It did.

171
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,360
Time flew by.

172
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,450
It's tomorrow.

173
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,680
Are you nervous?

174
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
If I say I'm not, it's a lie.

175
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,920
But I feel better after thinking about good things.

176
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,610
I wonder what you are thinking about it.

177
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,520
Do you want to know?

178
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,010
No, it's okay. I'm glad you feel better.

179
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,720
Let's go back inside.

180
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,020
What?

181
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,160
When we go to the next place, I'll—!

182
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,070
There he is!

183
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,090
- Hello!
- Ji Yoo, hi!

184
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,980
You're here.

185
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,020
I called them to come root for you.

186
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,310
Chef, you look so cool!

187
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,000
How can you slay it already like this?

188
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,440
I didn't do anything special.

189
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,650
Are you getting nervous? Your face got red already.

190
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,970
Is it?

191
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,890
Don't get nervous!

192
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,790
Yes, don't get nervous. You'll do great!

193
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,700
Just do as you practice. Don't be anxious.

194
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,250
You got nervous right now.

195
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,880
We'll start the event now.

196
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,790
I want to thank all of you who came to the launching party of Baeksoondang's new product, "Waiting."

197
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,590
And I'd like to introduce Chef Park Ki Hoon, who will be cooking today as a collaboration.

198
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,510
Please give him a round of applause.

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,290
Oh, no! I think he got nervous.

201
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,940
What should we do?

202
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,770
Hyung...

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,520
♫ I only love you ♫

♫ Always only you ♫

♫ When I call you ♫

♫ Tears come out first ♫
