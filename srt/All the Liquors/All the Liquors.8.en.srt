Yes. Wouldn't that make you feel a bit calmer?

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,930
Let's think about good things and good people.

16
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,850
I'll start the cooking now.

17
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:39,240
The first dish I prepared is Arancini which has pickled pickling melon made with liquor lees inside.

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,890
It has the scent of liquor lees that came out while making the liquor,

19
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,650
so it has even better harmony when you have this with the liquor.

20
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,440
Also, there's rice inside the Arancini, which prevents heartburn while you're drinking.

21
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,230
The second dish I prepared is pasta, which is widely preferred by the younger generation, and I gave a Korean twist to it.

22
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,660
It's an oil pasta with grilled flatfish and water parsley.

23
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,020
The flatfish is grilled not to harm the original taste of the fish,

24
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,110
and the water parsley will cut the greasiness to enjoy the dish more.

25
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,500
Grilled flatfish has been removed from the bones to avoid inconvenience when drinking together.

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,240
The motivation behind these dishes is

27
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,400
the heart of removing fish bones for the one who's not good at chopsticks

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,050
and caring to make soup for someone sick from drinking.

29
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,910
I hope you enjoy the food and hope it brings you joy.

30
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,960

I'm not good at things like that.

56

That's not true. You were so good at the speech earlier.

60

but let me say this, even though it's embarrassing.

I'm asking, what good things did you think about?

Thank you.

163
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,900
Ji Yoo, eat as much as you want.

164
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,760
Thank you.

165
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,670
I have something to say.

166
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,000
Wan and I are seeing each other.

167
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,280
- We know that.
- What?

168
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,310
Did you think we wouldn't know when it's that obvious?

169
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,550
Was it that obvious?

170
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,850
It's super annoying.

171
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm sorry, but all of you, please leave now.

172
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,100
I'll eat the chicken all by myself!

173
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,540
- Don't be pathetic.
- What did you say?

174
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,660
Then, shall we go on a second round to celebrate the official couple?

175
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,230
Why don't we go up on the rooftop?

176
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,520
Sounds great!

177
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,040
Can we go up right now?

178
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,670
What is it?

179
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,920
Nothing.

180
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,760
That's what I'm asking. Nothing, what?

181
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,090
What is it?

182
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,130
Why?

183
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,750
Nothing.

184
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,420
That's what I'm asking. Nothing, what?

185
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,650
You're following what I said.

186
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,370
Do you like me?

187
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,190
I like you.

188
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,850
I like you, too.

189
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,230
Cheers to the two who officially started dating!

190
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,870
What? Ji Yoo, you are also—

191
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,210
No, it's nothing. Let's do it louder! Cheers!

192
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,440
Cheers!

193
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,740
How can you do it without me?

194
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,990
Let's do it again together. Cheers!

195
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,850
Cheers!

196
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,220
- This wine is good!
- Yes, it is good.

197
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,230
What wine is this?

198
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,410
It's an Italian wine.

199
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,550
Maybe he doesn't know that well, too.

200
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,510
That's not true! Why are you saying that to him?

201
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,120
You're so protective of him.

202
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,060
It's not like that.

203
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,350
Do you like bread like this?

204
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,320
Try it with this on.

205
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,470
What sauce is this? Is it a cheese dip?

206
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm on a diet.

207
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,600
Why are you on a diet? You're beautiful right now.

208
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,240
I'm leaving!

209
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,200
Why? Where are you going?

210
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,290
I'm going to leave to find my love. Don't stop me!

211
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,100
- All right.
- What? All right?

212
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,580
Hello!

213
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,810
He's the new part-timer in our restaurant. I invited him to join us, and is that okay?

214
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,330
Of course, it's great!

215
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,640
Nice to meet you.

216
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,000
I brought some wine from home to share with you.

217
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,020
Were you still here?

218
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,240
Do you keep wines at home?

219
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,660
It's so unrealistic!

220
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,480
Right now, I have people around me.

221
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,750
They laugh together while talking about nothing.

222
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,980
In retrospect, there was a time when I was heavily carrying insignificant things.

223
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:22,310
The one who let me escape that long, suffocating tunnel is smiling at me right by my side.

224
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,960
Happiness was right here.
