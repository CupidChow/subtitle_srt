00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,520
It'll be more delicious if I have it with soju.

167
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,700
You've done all kinds of rude behaviors while you were drunk,

168
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,370
and now you want more alcohol?

169
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,410
No, I just said that because this cold noodle is so good—

170
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,510
People drink because the food is good, because of good feelings,

171
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,120
and because of bad feelings!

172
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,870
We don't sell any alcohol here.

173
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,820
Is it something for you to get this upset?

174
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm sorry, but it'll be better for you to leave now.

175
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,840
Seriously.

176
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,620
What kind of inhospitality was that?

177
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,020
Wow, everything about this place is not kind.

178
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,870
But the cold noodles were delicious.

179
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,590
Let's go.

180
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,190
As long as the cold noodles were great, it's all good.

181
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,100
Really.

182
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,400
Welcome.

183
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,720
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

184
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,250
What can I get for you?

185
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,430
Do we have to order?

186
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,850
I heard you bring food on your own.

187
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,340
Is it like a high-end version of a simple meal place?

188
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,490
Why don't you bring the food out for two people?

189
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,890
Okay, we'll prepare it. Thank you.

190
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,570
- Wait.
- Yes?

191
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,720
We brought a bottle of wine.

192
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
What's your corkage fee?

193
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm sorry, but we don't sell or allow alcohol in the store.

194
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,140
We are saying we'll pay to drink.

195
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,270
Don't you know what corkage is?

196
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,990
Can you call the person in charge?

197
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,570
I'm sorry, but I think it'll be difficult due to the rule of the restaurant.

198
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,860
I'm the owner of this place.

199
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,850
I'm sorry, but it's not possible to meet your requirements.

200
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,820
Our restaurant only offers meals for the customers.

201
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,490
If that's not okay with you,

202
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,620
shall I suggest other restaurants that offer corkage service?

203
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,990
This is outrageous.

204
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,320
Are you kicking out your customers?

205
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,740
Do you know who I am?

206
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,240
Stop it. Let's go somewhere else.

207
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,690
Just wait a minute.

208
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,180
How can I stay quiet when I get ignored by this stupid restaurant?

209
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,470
I'll get back at you.

210
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,060
Since you are bothering other customers, it'll be great if you can leave now.

211
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,020
Let's just go.

212
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,410
You better look forward to what will happen.

213
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,600
Hyung.

214
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,310
By the way...

215
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,670
What is it?

216
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,700
You know it's a natural thing for customers to ask if there is any alcohol at a restaurant.

217
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,690
So?

218
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,850
But you get easily enraged at customers' remarks.

219
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,780
What do you want to say?

220
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm just saying, can't we just sell alcohol?

221
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,790
We can't.

222
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,200
Then we don't have to fight with customers.

223
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,980
You don't have to do anything. I'll deal with any drunk customers.

224
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,620
Honestly, having trouble with customers every day is a great stress to me.

225
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,500
If you don't want to work here, then don't.

226
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,190
I'm not forcing you to stay here.

227
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,750
You're saying that again!

228
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,790
When did I say I'd quit?

229
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,540
You know that I work the hardest here, right?

230
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,440
Do you know that?

231
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,310
Why are you not answering me?

232
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,120
Are you angry?

233
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,890
Hyung...

234
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,580
Hyung!

235
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,830
Let's organize the rest tomorrow.

236
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,240
That's not important right now.

237
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,300
Take a look at this.

238
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,380
[Restaurant Goosoo was the worst. They ignored the customers' requests and kicked us out.]

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,440
You better look forward to what will happen.

240
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,540
♫ I can feel your eyes looking at me ♫

241
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,260
♫ little by little ♫

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,280
Do you need something?

244
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,520
Can I have a line bream?

245
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,240
All of our line breams are out today.

246
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,300
Okay.

247
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,230
I'm sorry about that.

248
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,160
♫ We already know ♫

249
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,900
