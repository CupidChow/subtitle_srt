00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,080
It's nice.

167
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,640
What's nice?

168
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,440
It's nothing.

169
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,280
What is it? Why are you not finishing your sentence?

170
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,120
You're right.

171
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,150
Your face got red again.

172
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,780
Again?

173
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,940
It always gets red.

174
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,720
How can your face become red after one glass of beer?

175
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,560
Right.

176
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,220
Cheers.

♫ Stay with us ♫

178
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,740
♫ Wherever it was ♫

179
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,950
♫ We were laughing together ♫

180
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,350
♫ Be with us ♫

He's not picking up his phone and not answering the texts.

182
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,170
What should we do? I guess he got anxious.

183
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,620
Should I go to his place?

184
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,010
Why don't you give him some time?

185
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,770
♫ I comforted you silently ♫

186
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,620
Shall we have ramen a bit later?

187
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,800
♫ You came to me like a coincidence ♫

188
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,410
♫ And lit up the light ♫

189
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:42,960
♫ You came into my life like a present ♫

190
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,200
♫ You are like an angel ♫

192
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,030
♫ Can you feel my love? ♫
