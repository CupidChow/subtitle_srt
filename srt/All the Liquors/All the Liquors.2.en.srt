Let's contact this chef.

What is it?

152
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,770
I'm just wondering, but do you have soju?

153
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,360
Excuse me?

154
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,890
You've done all kinds of rude behaviors while you were drunk.

155
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,600
And now you want more alcohol?

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,530
What?

157
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,660
Then, what should we do?

158
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,790
We should look for another chef.

159
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,300
- Oh, you're here.
- Hello, sir.

160
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,230
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

161
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,130
Let's see.

162
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,500
Let me see.

On top of that, he has a mysterious concept that he doesn't even go on TV shows.

167

Let's do the project with him.

00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,400
Well, the thing is...

170
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,220
We are still discussing it.

171
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,150
How long are you going to discuss it?

172
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,940
We need a result now.

173
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,920
Yes, sir. I understand.

174
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,540
I'll make sure we can sign the contract by the end of this week.

175
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,010
Okay, I'll have my faith in you.

176
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,270
Okay.

What are you going to do?

181
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,550
- We have to try it.
- That's what I'm saying. How?

182
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,440
Then, are you not going to do it? You know my personality.

183
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,940
Still, the thing is...

184
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,480
If you couldn't do it, you should've kept your mouth shut.

Yes, ma'am.

Hello.

197
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,310
I'm Han Ji Yoo from the Baeksoondang Marketing team.

198
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,460
We've already met, but I never formally introduced myself.

199
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,000
Our company is about to launch a traditional soju.

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,660
And we want to do a collaborative project with you.

201
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,180
I'm not doing it.

202
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,720
Sorry?

203
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,440
I won't do it.

204
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,080
If you have finished your food, please leave.

205
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,270
Ah, that's because the boss is sensitive about things related to alcohol.

206
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,330
Right, I'm aware that you don't sell any alcohol.

207
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,700
We're not asking your store to sell alcohol.

208
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,130
The only thing you have to do is cook, Chef.

209
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,270
And there will be a large-scale promotional event after that.

210
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,150
It'll definitely help this restaurant's marketing.

211
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,570
I'm pretty sure I told you I don't need it?

212
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,980
Then I'll leave my business card here and go.

213
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,140
I'll come back to see you again soon.

214
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,200
It'll be a waste of your time, so don't come back.

I'm sorry. I'm on my way back to the office.

219

Did you talk to him at all?

220
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,660
I think we need to find a new chef.

221
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,930
Why? It's been already reported to the upper management.

222
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,200
Already?

223
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,690
Is there a problem?

224
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,380
The reaction for Chef Park Ki Hoon is really good right now.

225
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm going into another meeting, so let's talk again later.

Isn't it better to do it?

233
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,660
Honestly, the business hasn't been going well lately.

234
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,010
That collaborative work or whatever, wouldn't that be good for promoting the restaurant?

235
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,090
Then the sales will go up.

236
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,660
I finally got better enough to run the business.
