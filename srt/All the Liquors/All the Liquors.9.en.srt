[All the Liquors: Episodes 1, 2 Commentary]

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,310
Hello.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,280
- I'm Won Do Hyun from All the Liquors.
- And I'm Kim Jun Hyung.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,600
Jun Hyung, do you know why we are here today?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,020
We are here to shoot reaction videos.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,350
It's our first day to watch the final cuts.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,110
How do you feel when it's your first day watching the final cuts?

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,240
I'm very excited. I wonder how it came out.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,400
I'm very excited, too.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,660
I'm not sure if I can watch it well.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,480
I have mixed feelings.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,030
I got a gift for you today.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,380
- Oh, my!
- Ta-da!
[The filming day was Valentine's Day]

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,460
What? What is this?!

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,040
You got me chocolate.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,290
Let's have this together while watching it.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,700
Sounds great.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,620
Then, why don't you push the start button?

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,740
I'll play it.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,490
Can I have one more hangover-cure drink?

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,670
We can't do that originally. But today's a special day. It's our Christmas gift to you.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,990
I'm jealous.

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,220
Merry Christmas!

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,060
I asked for another one for my boyfriend.

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,100
Right, for your "ex-boyfriend."

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,570
But I know you got dumped by him.

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,370
It comes out now.

28
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,710
Look at me, liking him.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,800
Did you like him that much?
[Has nothing to say...]

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,220
Poor thing!

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,910
You told me to eat whatever I wanted to eat.

32
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,210
How could you break up with me before the line bream came out?

33
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,400
Was the line bream that important to you?

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,170
And this part.

35
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,790
His face is not all he's got.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,420
Oh, no! I can't watch this!
[Embarrassed Do Hyun...]

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,070
We don't sell any alcohol in our restaurant.

38
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,370
- We don't sell any alcohol in our restaurant.
- We don't sell any.

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,140
Did you know about that scene?

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,260
Actually, that is very low.

41
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,400
- So I was spreading my legs like this.
- Oh, you were like this!

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,480
Let's just drink somewhere else.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,360
We'll just have the food.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,690
She says she'll eat quickly and go.

45
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,070
Wow! Oh!

46
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,420
- You look so scary.
- I look so mad.

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
You are always angry.

48
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,980
It's because break time is important.

49
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,940
Right, break time is precious.

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,350
Look, she's salty!

51
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,310
Right, I should've not sent her away like that.

52
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,030
That was my first time eating that dish.

53
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,330
- Is that gizzard fish?
- Yes, it was my first time eating it.

54
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,410
How was it?

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,010
To be honest, it wasn't my favorite.

56
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,270
- It was good!
- Now you can tell the truth!

57
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,540
So that was the first time eating gizzard in my life.

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,570
And it had a very unique texture.

59
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,170
- It's a bit chewy, right?
- Yes, it was.

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,480
So it wasn't easy for Ho Gyun and me while eating it.

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,990
Do you not like raw fish that much?

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,150
No, I don't eat raw fish that much.

63
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,800
- But!
- But!

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,710
Your character, Ji Yoo, loves raw fish.

65
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,460
Right, Ji Yoo loves it, so I ate at my best.

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,650
I wanted to say this.

67
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,610
One cold raw fish soup, please!

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,360
I'll get another bottle on the way back from the restroom.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,790
That punk.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,760
He's so cool!

71
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,790
Hello?

72
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,330
- Look at him!
- He switched his mode right away.

73
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,840
Are cold noodles okay?

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,820
Of course, it's cold noodles on a hot day like today!

75
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,390
- Good sense!
- Good sense!

76
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,310
I remember every moment of that time since we are watching it right now.

77
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,170
Yes, I remember everything that happened as well.

78
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,680
This part! This part was pretty hard to film, wasn't it?

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,870
Yes, I fell on my butt so many times.

80
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,680
You look like you're washing the dish.

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,130
That was nice and cold.

82
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,590
People drink because the food is good, because of good feelings, and because of bad feelings!

83
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,210
- What's wrong with you suddenly?
- I got angry.

84
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,420
I suddenly accelerated my anger.

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,570
You're shaking in anger.

86
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,340
But the cold noodles were delicious. Let's go.

87
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,480
Ji Yoo's so simple.

88
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,360
So cute.

89
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,120
Don't you know what corkage is?

90
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,320
- What's your corkage fee?
- Corkage.

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Can you call the person in charge?

92
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,620
How can I stop it?

93
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,090
I'll get back at you.

94
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,910
Since you are bothering other customers, it'll be great if you can leave now.

95
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,110
You better look forward to what will happen.

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,090
Look forward to it. Look forward to All the Liquors!

97
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,250
Look forward to it.

98
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,260
I look like a person with a personality disorder.

99
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,170
- In episode 1...
- Right, you aren't an easy person.

100
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,370
- I was getting angry with everyone.
- Right, you were getting angry the whole time.

101
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,520
You get angry in this scene as well.

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,420
[Ji Yoo thinks mad Ki Hoon is funny]

103
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,790
What do you want to say?

104
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm not forcing you to stay here.

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,440
Oh, my?

106
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, my?

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
It's a person with a personality disorder.

108
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,700
- Oh, my?
- You know that I work the hardest here, right?

109
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,330
Look at him!

110
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,060
Didn't he look like a puppy?

111
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,140
Yes, he does.

112
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,560
- Do you need something?
- Can I have one line bream?

113
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,250
- It's the post-credits scene!
- So you were right behind me!

114
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,080
You were right behind me.

115
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's watch episode 2 right away.

116
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,380
Let's start episode 2.

117
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,990
He's late for work.

118
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,400
Ji Yoo's house is so nice!

119
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,420
Ji Yoo... I guess he's pretty well off.

120
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,680
Is he a son of a wealthy family?

121
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,140
From early in the morning...

122
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,480
Take a shot of the hangover-cure drink!

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,390
Wow, what a great company!

124
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh, our!

125
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,610
Deputy Yeon Ah.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,780
Are you sleeping in the office from the morning because of the hangover?

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,270
Is that possible in reality?

128
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,900
No, you can't do that.

129
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,070
It smells rotten.

130
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,080
Did you brush your teeth before coming in that day or not?

131
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,210
I guess I didn't brush my teeth.

132
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,320
Yes, I'm aware of it.

133
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,150
She looks very scary.

134
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,710
It's a pathetic moment.

135
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,940
- Fighting!
- It's not about if we can do it or not. We have to do it.

136
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,730
- She's so scary.
- You have to do it.
[Han Ji Yoo / Modern slavery moment]

137
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,060
If we can't do it, you have to look for another job.

138
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,840
You're scary.

139
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,930
Whenever you see alcohol!

140
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,390
You get excited whenever you see alcohol.

141
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,210
[Embarrassed...]

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,220
I got curious.

143
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,090
- So you came to spy on me.
- Right, I'm spying on you.

144
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,140
No, no!

145
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,310
Why did you do that?

146
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,460
You are such a tsundere.

147
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,510
- I mean well.
- You took care of me.

148
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,630
I'm going to eat a ton today.

149
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,010
- Did he break up again?
- Do not stop me from it.

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,260
Are you going to drink this in a wine glass?

151
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,650
In this scene, it was my real mistake to bring wine glasses when I had to get soju glasses.

152
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,490
Right. That scene was his improvisation.

153
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,390
Yes, it was improvised.

154
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,370
"What? A glass?"

155
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,360
Shall we drink it in soju glasses?

156
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,330
This scene! Look at that.

157
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,680
It's so funny that I brought wine glasses.

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,290
Both of them are so simple. They both feel better when they see alcohol.

159
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,330
I know.

160
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,750
It's like a liquor ad.

161
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,450
Look how juicy he looks.

162
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,440
"Look how juicy he looks?"

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,980
Wait, this person!

164
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,260
"Look how juicy he looks!"

165
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,900
That moment is so cute!

166
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
- It looks like we are sharing eye contact.
- Yes, it's an eye-contact moment.

167
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,240
Then what should we do?

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,060
On top of that, he has a mysterious concept.

169
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,140
I think it's great. Let's do the project with him.

170
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,310
Well, the thing is...

171
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,340
Ji Yoo's flustered.

172
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,820
- This week?
- A contract?

173
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,940
If you couldn't do it, you should've said nothing.

174
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,530
Okay.

175
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,310
- Look at me, closing my lips.
- Were you actually closing your lips?

176
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,300
It's a gesture of zipping my lips.

177
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,370
Now I have to go in there by myself.

178
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,880
Because we got a bad review...

179
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,870
- That's why there are no customers.
- Right, there are no customers.

180
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,580
It's empty.

181
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,980
Wow, the guy who's cooking! It's sexy!

182
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,770
Ji Yoo's waiting for the food to come out.

183
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,000
Ji Yoo's body was pretty bulky at that time.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,210
Ji Yoo worked out a lot at that time.

185
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,870
Right, I guess I worked out rigorously.

186
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,800
Da-dum! You know what this moment is, right?
[Amazing taste]

187
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,750
It was delicious, so here he goes.

188
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,900
He's going to promote the project.

189
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,930
Why were you like that?

190
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,700
Sorry, my personality was so bad.

191
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,760
It'll be a waste of your time, so don't come back.

192
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,480
What?! Look, Ji Yoo is sulky again.

193
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,610
I know. Why am I so mean?

194
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,780
Did you talk to him at all?

195
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,060
I think we need to find a new chef.
[Jun Hyung is eating chocolate that Do Hyun got for him]

196
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,160
I still have a hard time with many people.
[Nom nom]

197
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,370
Why are you making Wan tip-toe around you all the time?

198
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,080
It's because I don't like alcohol.
[Prim]

199
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,700
Wan is sulky again.

200
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm making everyone around me sulky.

201
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,670
Why are you making everyone sulky?

202
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,430
Oh, no!

203
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,200
Are you okay?!

204
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,170
I'm just giving it to you as if it's nothing.

205
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,230
Yes, you just toss it as if it's nothing.

206
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,250
Use this.

207

[All the Liquors: Episodes 1, 2 Thoughts after Commentary]

208
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,120
Ki Hoon isn't that bad.

209
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,640
But if you only watch episodes 1 and 2, you might hate Ki Hoon.

210
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,760
He's just a person who has a personality disorder...

211
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,420
He's just someone who has an anger management issue.

212
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,900
But Ki Hoon will be nicer from now on.

213
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,150
- Yes, he'll be nicer.
- Probably. He'll get better, probably.

214
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,540
Someone who's like a puppy might initially be vigilant, but they change later on.
[Doggo]

215
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,340
Do I get nice later on?

216
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,090
Nice...

217
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,100
- Yes, he does get nice.
- The way I get nicer.

218
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
- You'll figure it out if you keep watching it.
- Please watch the process.

219
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,500
Then, let's wrap up our commentary for episodes 1 and 2 here.

220
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,970
And we'll come back for episodes 3 and 4.

221
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,750
- Yes! Bye!
- Bye!

[All the Liquors: Episodes 3, 4 Commentary]

223
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,930
Hello.

224
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,440
Today, we are going to... What are we doing today?

225
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,190
- We'll do episodes 3 and 4's—
- Commentary!

226
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,250
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

227
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,770
Let's go do the commentary, bro!

228
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,600
- I looked like a terrible person in episodes 1 and 2.
- Right.

229
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Let's see if I became a bit nicer person.

230
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,770
Also, let's see how Ki Hoon and Ji Yoo's relationship changes.

231
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,090
Let's watch it together.

232
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,830
Then, let's start.

233
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,070
Can you play it for us?

234
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:02,150
Working in the kitchen and waiting tables all by yourself is a tremendous amount of work.

235
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,190
Right. Doing both things alone is a lot.

236
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,680
You have to cook and bring it out to the table repeatedly.

237
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,350
[He means it's hard work]

238
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,090
So cute!

239
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm right behind you.

240
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,250
- It's a bit scary.
- Yes.

241
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,010
You can't do that in real life.

242
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,760
Right, never ever. You'll be in big trouble.

243
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,580
I'm fiercely eating.

244
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,380
He's very mean.
[Somehow, embarrassed...]

245
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,420
But Ji Yoo's simple, so he immediately got into a good mood.

246
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,650
Ji Yoo has a shot of soju.

247
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,710
- And he feels better.
- Right, immediately feels better.

248
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,770
It's like Ki Hoon doesn't like Ji Yoo but has to accept him as a customer.

249
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:59,420
Also, you keep coming in front of me, making me think about you.

250
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,330
Ji Yoo's such a fox!

251
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,980
Right, he's such a fox.

252
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,230
He knows how to cross the line well.

253
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,170
Right, it's playing games.

254
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,470
- Right, he's good at playing games.
- Playing mind games.

255
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,700
That's the same menu Ji Yoo had with Ji Ha.

256
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,260
That's right. He got it to go at that time.

257
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,810
But it's always tastier if you eat it at the store.

258
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,230
Why not?!

259
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,790
Ki Hoon is very stern.

260
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,690
He's very surprised.

261
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,040
But Ki Hoon has to make money.

262
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,280
So he needs to take the customers even if it's a large group.

263
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,830
Also, you need to do a delivery.

264
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,220
So Ji Yoo scooped in to help you.

265
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,100
Also, Ki Hoon needs to run the business.

266
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,240
So he asks for help. Please help me.

267
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,690
Yes, you have to help. And if Ji Yoo helps, it'll be fine.

268
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,640
It's like he's thankful but can't express that feeling.

269
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,110
[So proud]

270
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,940
It's a face of "how do you know that?"

271
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,920
Ji Yoo's a man who loves food.

272
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,550
Look at Ki Hoon slowly smiling!

273
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,590
It's like, "thank you."

274
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,240
- You can see Ki Hoon feels a bit better toward Ji Yoo after the help.
- Right.

275
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
He got a bit mellow now.

276
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,020
Compared to before, yes.

277
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,330
You said it so confidently!

278
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,770
Ji Yoo volunteered to become a part-timer at the restaurant.

279
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,930
- Oh, so cool.
- So cool!

280
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,100
- Cool.
- Oh...

281
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,510
You look so confident.

282
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,280
Now, Ji Yoo's working as a part-timer!

283
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,350
Ji Yoo's doing great!

284
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,350
He's really doing a good job.

285
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,450
My expression is like, "You are doing a pretty good job."

286
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,280
Now, he's taking off the No Liquor panel.

287
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,710
It's like, "Should I really sell the alcohol or not?"

288
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,880
"Is selling alcohol really the right thing to do?"

289
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,210
Ji Yoo's just happy without noticing how Ki Hoon feels.

290
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,190
Exactly.

291
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,390
Ji Yoo could've eaten dinner with him!

292
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,980
Han Ji Yoo's such a god of playing games!

293
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Ji Yoo is!

294
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,470
Ki Hoon thought they might get dinner together after work, but Ji Yoo left right away.

295
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,940
Right.

296
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,340
This place was so good, too!

297
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,400
Ji Yoo went to have a drink by himself after work.

298
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,680
- That chicken was too spicy for me.
- It was too spicy for real, right?

299
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes, it was so spicy for me.
[Jun Hyung can't eat spicy food, unlike his character, Ji Yoo]

300
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,530
- You kept saying it was too spicy.
- Yes, it was really spicy.

301
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,490
If you see, the name is saved as "Park Ji Ha B*****d."

302
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,950
Look at him!

303
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,970
He's sitting on the toilet.

304
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm enjoying the food!

305
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,320
Eating chicken and having a drink by yourself...

306
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,690
It's pretty romantic.

307
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,350
You're very serious about food.

308
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,780
It's like, "What the heck?"

309
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,090
Why did you not hold me? I stretched my hand out!

310
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,980
Yeah—

311
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,180
But since Ji Yoo's his part-timer now,

312
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,460
- Ki Hoon's taking care of Ji Yoo more.
- Right.

313
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,850
Look at Ji Yoo's face. It's a bit like..!

314
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,350
[Ah-eum-ah-ooh-ya]

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,440
This is how episode 3 ends.

316
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Shall we watch episode 4 continuously?

317
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,620
- Yes.
- All right.

318
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I stretched my hand out for you to hold me.

319
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,800
- But Ki Hoon didn't care that much.
- Right, he didn't care.

320
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,080
- He's so cold.
- It's like, "Why is he falling?"

321
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,590
Look at him sitting at Ji Yoo's table immediately!

322
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,210
Very shameless.

323
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,270
Yes, so shameless.

324
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,580
They have dessert after the chicken.

325
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,030
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream.

326
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,040
- This ice cream was so good as well.
- Yes.

327
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,390
Now Ki Hoon's smiling.

328
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,610
I know.

329
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,750
This part is Ji Yoo's...

330
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,460
- Ji Yoo's sincere...
- Yes, sincere...

331
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,920
[They mean Ji Yoo told his sincere heart to Ki Hoon]

332
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,150
This is when Ki Hoon saw Ji Yoo's sincere moment...

333
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,510
[And changed his mind~]

334
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,000
It's when he thought, "Maybe I should do the project with him."

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,540
That's right.

336
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,090
So they sign the contract.

337
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,400
That's when Ki Hoon's getting ready to go to sign the contract.

338
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,110
Right.

339
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,930
You're so handsome!

340
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,670
Thank you!

341
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,300
So handsome!

342
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,640
He's in such a good mood.

343
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
What was that?

344
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
- Why is he in such a good mood?
- Wait, what's wrong now?

345
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,400
It's like, "What's wrong with me?" kind of mood.

346
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
Ji Yoo's always smiling.

347
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,720
It's like, "What the heck are you saying?"

348
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,320
She thought I read her inner monologue.

349
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,290
Ki Hoon needs Ji Yoo around now.

350
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,830
Knowledgeable about delicious food?

351
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,700
Yes, Ji Yoo's knowledgeable about delicious food.

352
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,420
Ji Yoo's a bit offended. Do you know why?

353
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,050
I know, of course.

354
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,970
- It's because I said, "I'll use him."
- Yes, "use."

355
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,570
Ji Yoo's sulky.

356
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,800
Look at that cold attitude.

357
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,090
It's like Ki Hoon in the first episode.

358
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,070
That was really painful, actually.

359
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,740
Right, you had to fall so many times.

360
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,000
And I got soaked.

361
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,420
Oh, no! I can't watch it!

362
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,360
- I can't watch this part.
- Me, neither.

363
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,570
We are not going to watch it.

364
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,100
Don't comb back his hair!

365
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,590
What's going on between you two?!
[Touching his ear for no reason...]

366
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,360
But Ki Hoon stops it.

367
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,500
- Thank goodness.
- He cleared up the air.

368
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,120
He's sleepy.

369
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,250
So exhausted. I guess you worked a lot of overtime.

370
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,750
Yes, it requires a lot of overtime.

371
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,320
But you remember when we were filming this scene, do you?

372
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,440
We had to change our outfits quickly.

373
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,090
The filming technique was very refreshing.

374
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,890
That dish was very delicious.

375
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,410
Right, that one was really good.

376
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,610
- So we kept eating in between filming.
- Yes.

377
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,870
- It's extra good if you eat that with the pickled melon.
- Right.

378
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,960
So I have a memory that we ate that a lot.

379
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,210
Both of them are pretending as if they didn't see each other.

380
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,610
They are pretending not to know and not to see.

381
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,660
And now Ji Yoo says something important.

382
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,120
Ki Hoon's worried at the thought of drinking the liquor.

383
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,170
It is worrisome.

384
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,160
Did he say "We?"

385
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,850
That little fox! Ji Yoo's such a fox.

386
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,020
- Now, his heart is open.
- Yes, it's open.

387
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,900
It's almost completely open.

388
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,130
Ji Yoo's such a fox.

389
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,540
Ji Yoo's such a fox. He's so good at seducing.

390
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,310
Ki Hoon invited Ji Yoo over to his place.

391
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,930
And the place is amazing.

392
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,350
Yes, my place is nice.

393
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,390
And that's the liquor our company is about to launch.

394
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,690
Yes, that's the sample.

395
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,520
It's Ki Hoon and Ji Yoo's first drinking together time.

396
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,010
How long has it been?

397
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,050
It's almost... a week?

398
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,510
But I was being considerate.

399
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,190
I just poured a little bit. It's not a full glass.

400
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,410
Oh? Ji Yoo looks pretty on the screen.

401
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,500
Ji Yoo's good-looking.

402
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you.

403
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,920
Now he's drinking!

404
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,160
How is it?

405
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,100
- Is it good?
- It's good.

406
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,020
But who becomes like that after a glass?

407
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,120
But Ji Yoo also has a habit.

408
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,210
Ji Yoo has a habit of touching a drunken person's blushed cheeks.

409
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,440
- Oh, really?
- That's a terrible habit.

410
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,850
I thought you only did that to me!

411
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,910
- Ki Hoon fell asleep.
- Totally fell asleep.

412
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,230
But it's not easy to fall asleep like that after only one glass of drink.

413
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,650
It's pretty ridiculous.

414
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,500
Right. I think I'll be very surprised.

415
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,420
Yes, if anyone falls asleep like that after only one glass of drink.

416
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,170
Right. I would've thought of calling 911.

417
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,950
Yes, if it's really like that, you have to call 911.

418
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,020
That ramen was so good as well.

419
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,670
It looks delicious!
[Thinking about it makes him want to eat again]

420
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,430
That was so good. But I got a stomach ache the day after.

421
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,940
- Because it was too spicy?
- Yes, it was too spicy for me.

422
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,800
Okay!

423
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,600
[All the Liquors: Episodes 3, 4 Thoughts after Commentary]

424
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,410
How was it after watching episodes 3 and 4?

425
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,630
It seems like Ki Hoon is opening up a little bit throughout episodes 3 and 4.

426
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,040
But it's not completely opened yet, and it's more like he's feeling it out.

427
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,180
It shows Ki Hoon has feelings for Ji Yoo, but he's trying not to show that.

428
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,410
Right, it was interesting to see Ki Hoon trying not to show his feelings.

429
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,380
- Yes.
- It was interesting to see it on screen like now.

430
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,750
How was it for you, Ji Yoo?

431
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,560
You can see there's a change between the two throughout episodes 3 and 4.

432
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,780
It makes me curious about how Ki Hoon and Ji Yoo will change in future episodes.

433
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,290
Yes, I wonder how the story will unfold.

434
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:15,760
Also, we can see parts where we couldn't see when we were acting.

435
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,590
That's fun as well.

436
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,300
As I watch it, I see parts where I shouldn't have done it that way.

437
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,440
- I have so many parts I feel that way.
- That's true.

438
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,020
There are a lot of parts I'm not completely satisfied with.

439
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,060
But some parts are unexpectedly better than I thought as well.

440
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,010
Yes, there are parts like that, too.

441
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,370
I'm a bit unsatisfied with certain things.

442
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,620
But let's wrap up the commentary for episodes 3 and 4 here.

443
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,800
And please look forward to what will happen in episodes 5 and 6.

444
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,920
- Then, everyone.
- We'll see you next time!

445
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,020
- See you next time!
- Bye!

[All the Liquors: Episodes 5, 6 Commentary]

- Hello, everyone!
- Hello!

448
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,600
Today, we will do the commentary for episodes 5 and 6.

449
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,210
I'm excited about what will happen today.

450
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,050
What will happen in these episodes?

451
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,730
- Let's watch it together.
- Proceed.

452
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,650
Proceed.

453
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,860
I'll turn it on.

454
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,810
Ki Hoon fell asleep.

455
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,610
Yes, Ki Hoon fell asleep in the previous episode and is now completely out.

456
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,580
Ji Yoo brings out a blanket in case Ki Hoon gets sick.

457
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,380
- Yes, it's not good to get sick.
- Right.

458
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,090
Oh, you're so handsome. And you have such milky skin!

459
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,940
What is it?!

460
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,640
You're right. I do come out very fair on the screen.

461
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,540
You look very milky.

462
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,740
Why did you do that?!
[Chef thinks it's just funny]

463
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,350
Ji Yoo's heart skipped a beat.

464
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,020
Ji Yoo has a soft spot for this kind of situation.

465
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,030
- Do you mean Ji Yoo's weak for these kinds of touches?
- Right.

466
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,330
That's the scene after having that situation the night before.

467
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,620
But Ki Hoon doesn't remember what happened.

468
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,130
How can anyone blackout after one glass of drink?

469
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,950
Ki Hoon gets wasted after one glass of drink.

470
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,170
That's silly.

471
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,610
Ji Yoo's sleeping hard.

472
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,070
Why do you call someone out on a day off?

473
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,260
Now, Ki Hoon started to lure him.

474
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,130
If you look at the order of filming, this was the first day of shooting.

475
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,210
Right, this was the day when we first met.

476
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,540
Yes, we met for the first time and acted together for the first time.

477
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,760
- I think I'm hungry right now.
- Me, too.

478
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,930
Seeing us eating makes me want to eat.

479
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,090
Ji Yoo's excited.

480
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,120
- This was good, too.
- Yes, that place was delicious.

481
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,040
The dish was sweet and sour.

482
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,860
All of the side dishes were delicious, too.

483
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,770
Guess what he is looking for!

484
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,030
One bottle of soju, please!

485
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,210
Now, Ki Hoon knows more and more about Ji Yoo.

486
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,000
- Do you drink when you're having meals in real life?
- No.

487
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,720
- Never?
- Never ever.

488
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,330
I can't drink soju at all in the first place.

489
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,670
But in the show, you're a heavy drinker.

490
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,920
The two kind of look alike. You know, when people are in love, they resemble each other.

491
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,770
Right.

492
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,820
They are kind of lovey-dovey now.

493
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,660
Yes, they are.

494
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:18,400
- I think going on a trip together like this makes you get closer.
- Right.

495
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,500
- I did a good job, didn't I?
- Yes.

496
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,490
- Even if it was a day off?
- Yes.

497
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,440
Ji Yoo's tiredness melted away.

498
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,530
I touched the real crab while filming this scene.

499
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,430
- You were actually scared.
- Yes.

500
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,160
How can you sleep in the seat next to the driver?

501
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,840
It's not polite.

502
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm just kidding.

503
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,500
Ji Yoo's taking photos of Ki Hoon.

504
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,410
Ji Yoo's sweet.

505
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,620
You're very tall!

506
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,980
He's such a model.

507
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,990
This is one of the scenes for the released photos.

508
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,200
That's right.

509
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,310
The sea was very dreamy.

510
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,310
It was surreal and dreamy rather than pretty.

511
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,930
- It had a nice ambiance.
- Yes, it was.

512
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,680
Why do you want the time to stop? Our time is waiting for us in the future.

513
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,050
What? What did you just say?

514
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,710
Now, Ki Hoon is looking forward to it.

515
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,910
He's looking forward to the future time together.

516
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,890
Ji Yoo heard everything, but he's pretending he didn't hear it.

517
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,220
- Look at him!
- Oh?

518
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,360
You parked where you don't get rained on. But I got rained on!

519
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,900
That's true. I parked it wrong.

520
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,660
- I should've put the car in backward.
- Yes!

521
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,290
It's in front of Ji Yoo's house.

522
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,120
Yes. But it's grateful you drove me home.

523
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,040
It's sad to say goodbye.

524
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,310
That sad face and sad back!

525
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,750
Do you want to have some ramen at my place?

526
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,200
"Do you want to have some ramen at my place?"

527
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,920
Ki Hoon's saying it's fine, but he's also not leaving.

528
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,050
I'm really not drunk! I'm really not.

529
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,320
Look at that!

530
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,330
Ji Yoo grabbed onto Ki Hoon's arm very tightly!

531
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,510
Okay. That was the end of episode 5.

532
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,430
- Let's watch episode 6 right away.
- It's fun.

533
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,530
It makes you forget about time passing.

534
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,870
No, I'm good!

535
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,290
"I'm good!"

536
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,090
- What? Ramen?
- What? Ramen? I'm good.

537
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,990
- At this late hour...!
- Look at you eating.

538
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,850
It's delicious.

539
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,610
It's delicious!

540
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,390
Were you not going to go home?

541
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,740
Wow! Ji Yoo's so good at playing games.

542
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,180
Really, a god of playing games!

543
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,220
Ji Yoo brought Ki Hoon home to literally just feed the ramen.

544
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,150
Yes, he literally just fed the ramen.

545
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,580
And send Ki Hoon home right away.

546
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,360
Now I feel a bit sorry for Ki Hoon.

547
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,340
He wants to stay.

548
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,090
Call me whatever you want. I'll go now.

549
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,140
The awkwardness between them changed to a different kind of awkwardness.

550
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,420
They are a bit shy with each other.

551
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,470
That's the best time, isn't it?
[Sigh]

552
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,350
You're right. It's when you feel like you have butterflies in your stomach.

553
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,950
He changed his profile picture to the photo they took on a trip together.

554
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,940
Yes, Ji Yoo changed his profile picture to the photo they took on a trip together.

555
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,640
You know how that feels, right? The feeling of debating whether to send a text or not.

556
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,310
Should I call him or not?

557
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,510
Forget about it. I'm just going to bed.

558
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,610
Yes, just going to bed.

559
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,190
You look like a real cook!

560
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,080
You look like a real chef!

561
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,510
I'm a chef!

562
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,370
You look like a real one! That dish was also really delicious.

563
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,090
Yes, that one was really good as well.

564
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,620
Especially that Arancini!

565
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,360
Yes, that was so good.

566
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,130
Ji Yoo takes photos of food as well.

567
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,240
Ji Yoo loves to take food photos.

568
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,130
Right.

569
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,640
How will Ji Yoo evaluate the food?

570
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,170
How will he do it? It's nerve-wracking.

571
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,140
Ji Yoo is very objective when it comes to working.

572
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,530
You need to work objectively to do a good job.

573
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm not close to him at all.

574
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,610
Why? Stop it. I got my hair done!

575
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,920
Ki Hoon got jealous!

576
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,380
- Hyung!
Yes, what is it?

577
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,630
That kind of situation bugs you for no reason.

578
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,870
When the one you like is going like this with another guy.

579
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,240
Right, with another guy.

580
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,990
- It makes you feel like, "What are you doing?"
- "What's going on?"

581
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,420
- "Who the heck is that guy? "
- Right.

582
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,520
But isn't it cumbersome to eat fish with the bone when it's plated like this when you drink?

583
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,030
Wan is trying to seduce her!

584
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,730
I know. All of you are such players!

585
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,240
All of them are players.

586
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,160
This is why someone younger than you is scary.
[The one who's younger]

587
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,800
Seriously.

588
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,820
Wait for me!

589
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,900
Go home safely!

590
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,470
I actually laughed out loud at that time.

591
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,910
Everything will be all right. So don't worry too much.

592
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,800
Ji Yoo's sweet-hearted.

593
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,520
Ji Yoo gives me a lot of comfort.

594
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,030
Just two of them are having another drink.

595
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,390
Yes, they are having a drink.

596
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,660
It's beer.

597
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,880
Yes, Ji Yoo likes beer.

598
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,370
- Now, Ki Hoon drinks.
- Yes, he started to drink a little bit.

599
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,650
- And they speak comfortably with each other.
- Right.

600
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,170
- The two got close to each other a lot.
- Yes, they did.

601
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,370
Why are you not finishing your sentence all the time?

602
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,500
It's because he's shy.

603
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,680
Ki Hoon's not good at expressing his feelings.

604
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,050
He can't say how much he likes to the person he has feelings for.

605
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,510
That's right.

606
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,600
It's nice. The two look great together!

607
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,740
Those two right now!

608
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,550
Look at those two's faces!

609
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,650
What's going on between them?

610
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,580
What's going on between them?!

611
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,000
There was a behind scene like this.

612
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,930
Yes, there was.

613
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,650
I think we are not the only couple in this show.
[Interesting..!!]

614
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,890
It's not good to date inside of the office.

615
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,890
[All the Liquors: Episodes 5, 6 Thoughts after Commentary]

616
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,810
Anyway! Episodes 5 and 6.

617
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,580
- We just finished the commentary for them.
- How was it?

618
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,230
I thought the two were definitely more lovey-dovey now,

619
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,060
and I felt that they got a lot close to each other.

620
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,430
In the beginning, Ki Hoon was like, "Get out of here!"

621
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,200
"No! Don't do it! Don't do anything!" He was like that.

622
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,460
But Ki Hoon is now like, "Oh, my Ji Yoo."

623
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,160
Ki Hoon even drinks alcohol with Ji Yoo, so they really got close now.

624
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,380
In episodes 5 and 6, I could feel the change between Ji Yoo and Ki Hoon's relationship for sure.

625
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,480
I think the viewers will be able to find the heart-fluttering points.

626
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,200
With those heart-fluttering points, I think the show has more fun factors.

627
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,380
Now you can feel more like having butterflies in your stomach.

628
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,580
After watching this, it makes us curious about episodes 7 and 8.

629
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,440
Right, I wonder what will happen in episodes 7 and 8.

630
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,770
Then, we'll come back for episodes 7 and 8's commentary.

631
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,860
- Bye!
- Bye.

632
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,870
[All the Liquors: Episodes 7, 8 Commentary]

633
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,070
Hello, everyone!

634
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,960
We came back for episodes 7 and 8's commentary.

635
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,240
- Yes, I'm Kim Jun Hyung.
- I'm Won Do Hyun.

636
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,850
We'll start the commentary for episodes 7 and 8. Are you excited?

637
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,890
Yes, because episodes 7 and 8 are the final part.

638
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,980
So I wonder what changes will be there.

639
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,220
Also, let's check out what important scenes will be there!

640
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,610
- Let's go.
- Let's check out.

641
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,560
Let's go!

642
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,500
I think he's great.

643
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,790
- Of course, he'll look great to you.
- Ji Yoo looks excited.

644
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,270
Ki Hoon took up a lot of courage and worked this far.

645
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,290
Right, but if he needs to take up more courage, he needs time.

646
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,380
But if you throw news on to him like this, then, of course, Ki Hoon gets offended.

647
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,100
Right.

648
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,970
So he says, "I won't do that!" and leaves the room.

649
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,340
Ji Yoo got sulky again. He always gets sulky.

650
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,870
- But it must be a difficult situation for Ji Yoo as well.
- Right.

651
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:20,380
Because it's Ji Yoo's boss who's pushing the idea,

652
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,260
and Ji Yoo has another situation going on with Ki Hoon.

653
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,380
Right. Ji Yoo knows how to divide work and private life well.

654
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,850
You're right.

655
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,380
But it seems like love comes first for Ji Yoo, right?

656
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,470
- I guess Ji Yoo is also very worried about that.
- Of course.

657
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,610
Ki Hoon is also feeling uncomfortable.

658
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,380
Of course.

659
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,460
It's like, "Maybe I got too upset about it."

660
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,550
After running out upset, it makes you think,

661
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,720
"Maybe I overreacted. I could've just done it."

662
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,250
But also, at the same time, "No, that's not okay."

663
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,360
And he thinks, "Then, what should I do?"

664
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,050
It's pretty cute foot rolling.

665
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,300
It looks too itsy-bitsy now that I see it.

666
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,390
It's not like really roaring.

667
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,790
You look like a villain in that scene.

668
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,040
- Me?
- Yes.

669
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,070
- What should I do with this punk?
- Proceed with it.

670
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,710
Ki Hoon thinks a lot about it as well.

671
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,140
Things like whether I should contact him first.

672
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,060
Or not. But he got a message!

673
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,960
Ki Hoon thought about what to do.

674
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,670
Somebody came to Ji Yoo's doorstep.

675
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,200
Who is it?

676
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,890
Oh? Ki Hoon came.

677
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,020
You said you were hungry.

678
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,560
But still, you came over at this late hour?

679
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,370
Exactly. Ki Hoon doesn't have any manners.

680
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,680
I brought you delicious food because you said you were hungry!

681
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,320
Now, Ki Hoon tells his story.

682
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,760
Yes.

683
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,060
It's not Ji Yoo's or Ki Hoon's fault.

684
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,170
This is more of an inevitable situation problem.

685
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,290
Why don't you do it with that kind of courage?

686
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,580
What is that kind of courage?

687
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,290
Ji Yoo gives a lot of strength to Ki Hoon.

688
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,130
Right.

689
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,830
Admitting you're wrong is not an easy thing.

690
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,410
- And Ji Yoo is good at speaking.
- You're right.

691
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,050
If you say so, I'll give it a try.

692
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,700
So, Ki Hoon got encouraged by Ji Yoo's words and will take the challenge.

693
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,510
Yes, Ki Hoon got encouraged to do it.

694
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,130
I was a bit surprised that you said it so easily.

695
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,870
- There's only a good time ahead.
- Right.

696
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,860
Now they look more like a couple.

697
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,150
Right. Now Ki Hoon opened up his heart a lot to Ji Yoo.

698
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,710
Just having this conversation must have taken a lot of courage.

699
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,910
Ki Hoon seems to be certain that Ji Yoo is my person.

700
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,110
Yes, it seems so.

701
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,760
Wan is very chatty.

702
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,720
He's so cute!

703
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,100
Yes! Let's eat something expensive.

704
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,310
Tactless Wan is saying let's eat something delicious and fancy.

705
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:48,140
Wan is very excited. He's like, "Nice! Let's eat something fancy!"

706
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,120
But Ji Yoo and Ki Hoon are low energy.

707
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,230
Because it's the last day for Ji Yoo.

708
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,820
- "To tell you about this~"
- "To tell you about this~"

709
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,450
I guess since Ki Hoon is the chef, he's grilling the meat!

710
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,680
Right. And wherever Ji Yoo says delicious, it was all good!

711
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,170
Yes, Ji Yoo loves good food.

712
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,580
After all, pork belly is the best!

713
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,610
- Do you know that meme?
- What is it?

714
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,840
The genderless witches.

715
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,210
Do you know that?

716
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,730
Ji Yoo is good at metaphors.

717
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,610
He's very literary.

718
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,280
He's very emotional and literary.

719
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,970
Thankfully, Ki Hoon drinks better after hanging out with Ji Yoo.

720
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,190
Yes, it's getting better!

721
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,180
So Ki Hoon doesn't pass out after having a glass of drink.

722
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,830
You were actually nervous at this time.

723
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,030
Yes, I was.

724
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,280
But this project is what Deputy Yeon Ah and Ji Yoo worked hard on.

725
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,060
Right. But the way you look in this scene, you look like you're actually nervous.

726
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,820
Of course, you get nervous. It's a nerve-wracking moment.

727
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,350
- You can get nervous.
- Yes, of course.

728
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,610
But Ki Hoon reminds himself about what Ji Yoo told him.

729
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,860
Yes, he reminds himself about it...

730
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,850
Is this the end of episode 7?

731
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,370
Yes, it is the end.

732
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,770
Yes, episode 7 ended. How can it be cut like this?

733
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,160
Shall we watch episode 8 right away? I think we need to watch it now.

734
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,260
Let's watch episode 8 right away.

735
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,410
The chef is nervous right now.

736
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,210
The crowd starts to talk and rumble.

737
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,980
It's like, "What's going on?"

738
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,790
Ji Yoo sends him courage.

739
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:39,530
Ki Hoon got encouraged by Ji Yoo and got the strength to talk to people.

740
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,940
That's right, that's right.

741
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,230
It's pretty.

742
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,050
- Cooking in front of a crowd is not an easy thing to do.
- Of course.

743
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,280
When Ki Hoon is explaining the dishes, I see some familiar faces in the crowd.

744
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,140
I hope you enjoy the food and hope it brings you joy. Thank you.

745
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,930
But still, Ki Hoon made it.

746
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,720
He's doing great!

747
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,190
He did his best.

748
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,820
It would've been very nervous and hard, but he overcame it.

749
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,670
Ki Hoon got over it all thanks to Ji Yoo.

750
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,750
- From Ki Hoon's perspective, this is Ji Yoo's project,
- Right.

751
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,660
so he puts a lot more effort into it to do a good job.

752
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,610
Look at him!

753
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,130
Think how much Ji Yoo must be anxious in front of the CEO!

754
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,320
They are in the position of getting evaluated.

755
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,220
Flex as much as you want!

756
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,600
- "Flex as much as you want!"
- Flex!

757
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,570
- The CEO gave out the company's credit card.
- If that happens, it's incredible.

758
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,400
It's like, "Eat everything you want to eat!"

759
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,260
Right.

760
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,790
Ki Hoon switched back to his shy mode.

761
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,820
Yes, he's back to his shy mode.

762
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,270
That's right. You didn't seem to be nervous at all.

763
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,940
"Let's all be happy."

764
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
The taste of liquor will run away.

765
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,030
- Does that sound too much like an old man?
- Yes.

766
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,590
You said being happy is the best.

767
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,550
Oh? What's going on between you two?!

768
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,540
What's going on between you two?

769
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,040
Oh, it's this scene! This scene is finally coming out.

770
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,460
Ki Hoon must have thought good things.

771
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,420
I should watch it up close.

772
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,830
I'm going to watch it from a distance.

773
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,560
The atmosphere is ripe, isn't it?

774
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,250
Yes, it is.

775
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,040
Ji Yoo kissed Ki Hoon's cheek! What's happening?

776
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,390
And he confesses how he feels.

777
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,840
Stop it, stop it!

778
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,110
Get away from each other!

779
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,760
It's pretty embarrassing to watch it.

780
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,260
Yes, it's embarrassing.

781
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,300
He's so cute.

782
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,690
- It's raining suddenly.
- Yes, it rained on that day.

783
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,300
I think it always rained when we were shooting the scene of my house.

784
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,930
Now whatever they do, there's tension between them.

785
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,110
Right.

786
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,750
I'll make delicious ramen for you tonight.

787
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,570
Now Ki Hoon suggested first eating ramen upstairs.

788
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,400
It's another way of saying, "Can I have ramen at your place?"

789
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,620
But Ji Yoo is actually going to eat ramen.

790
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,540
Ki Hoon actually had other thoughts besides ramen in mind.

791
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,600
Look at Ji Yoo!

792
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,120
We should eat ramen.

793
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,470
That's why Ji Yoo's such a fox.

794
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,720
You're such a fox!

795
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,000
Shall we eat ramen a bit later?

796
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,390
- What are you going to do?
- What are you going to do instead?

797
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,110
Stop it. Stop it, now.

798
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,770
We actually took many takes of this scene.

799
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,020
You're right.

800
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,430
We did it many times to see which angle looked pretty on the screen.

801
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,020
- It came out nice and pretty.
- Yes.

802
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,610
It's good.

803
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,720
- We bumped our lips...
- Our lips...

804
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,690
We bumped our lips a lot.

805
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,570
Do you remember the rude customers in the beginning?

806
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,990
Yes, the rude customers.

807
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,590
We fought a lot at that time.

808
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,770
Right.

809
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:25,950
It was when Ki Hoon had a lot of anger in him.

810
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,290
We threw the potluck party, but everyone got chicken.

811
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,060
But it was all different chicken.

812
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,730
- Amazingly.
- I know.

813
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,940
You know well about your boyfriend's taste.

814
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,290
Of course, I remember.

815
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,990
Ji Yoo likes spicy foods.

816
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,550
I have something to say.

817
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,390
Wan and I are seeing each other.

818
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,370
- It was pretty obvious, right?
- Yes.

819
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,950
The two drank overflowing beer together from the same cup.

820
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,930
It's super annoying.

821
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,470
I'm sorry, but all of you, please leave now.

822
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,730
I'll eat the chicken all by myself!

823
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,350
- The two are...
- What's going on between the two?!

824
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,090
They are happy because they are so in love with each other.

825
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,710
It's like they are just happy to be next to each other.

826
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,470
Right.

827
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,750
Do you like me?

828
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,920
I like you.

829
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,980
You just said it straightforwardly.

830
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,050
Did we kiss here as well? Oh, we did.

831
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,980
Okay.

832
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,530
- Maybe he doesn't know that well, too.
- That's not true!

833
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,560
- The truth is that I didn't know what kind of wine it was.
- I knew you didn't know.

834
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,950
I just said it's an Italian wine.

835
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,310
Couples are only talking to their partners.

836
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,310
- So he feels excluded.
- Of course, it feels lonely.

837
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,200
He got sullen.
[Sullen]

838
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,520
The new part-timer came.

839
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,950
Look at his face! I guess it's love at first sight.

840
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,220
I brought some wine from home to share with you.

841
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,170
Ji Ha is very excited. Don't you think so?

842
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,120
He's so excited.

843
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,740
Now Ki Hoon and Ji Yoo became a very comfortable couple.

844
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,760
Is this the end?

845
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,140
Yes, it seems like it. We watched all eight episodes.

846
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,740
Yes, we finished all commentary videos for the entire episode.

847
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,750
[All the Liquors: Episodes 7, 8 Thoughts after Commentary]

848
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,200
How was it to see the entire episode?

849
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,400
While watching episodes 7 and 8, I thought Ki Hoon and Ji Yoo got very close,

850
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,130
and they were affectionate to seem like a couple to anybody's eye now.

851
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,060
And we kissed while we were filming.

852
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,050
All those kiss scenes came out on episode 8,

853
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,240
- so it was a bit embarrassing for us to watch,
- Right.

854
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,230
- but also it reminded me of those filming moments.
- Yes, the memory comes back.

855
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:57,370
Throughout episodes 1 to 8, I think the change in dynamics between Ki Hoon and Ji Yoo

856
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:01,350
got portrayed in a fun way, so it was fun to watch.

857
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:05,230
Also, the chemistry with the other characters!

858
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,690
And like what you said, the heart-fluttering moments that storm you at the end!

859
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:15,220
All these varieties of scenes made our show very pretty.

860
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,300
You're right. And, of course, it's not just us,

861
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,290
but my restaurant's staff Wan, Deputy Yeon Ah, and Ji Ha,

862
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,040
all these characters were there together

863
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,540
- for the show to be more exciting.
- It was so much fun.

864
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,900
That's what I thought.

865
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,350
It was our first time watching the final cut, and I enjoyed it so much.

866
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,250
And I hope all the viewers enjoy our show as well.

867
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,620
Now we are wrapping up the commentary videos from episodes 1 to 8.

868
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,770
Please watch Actor Won Do Hyun...

869
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,780
- And Kim Jun Hyung's...
- ...future endeavors as actors.

870
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,700
And I hope you love our show "All the Liquors" as well.

871
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,270
Then we'll say goodbye now.

872
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,980
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

873
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,810
Bye! Goodbye!

874
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,580
Bye!
