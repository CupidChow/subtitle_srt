[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,230
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,240
-Who's here?
-Who's here?

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,390
Isn't this Mr. Lu?

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,670
He's here with his wife.

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,510
He truly dotes on his newlywed wife.

7
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,370
It looks like

8
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,230
Mrs. Lu is no longer angry.

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,400
Indeed.

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,770
It took a lot of sweet-talking to appease her.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,230
What? Do you feel wronged?

12
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,000
Not at all.

13
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,670
I love comforting you.

14
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,150
Mrs. Lu.

15
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,870
I made you misunderstand it earlier.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,690
I apologize.

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,630
That was my suggestion.

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
It had nothing to do with you.

19
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,630
However,

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,009
your gambling skills are so impressive.

21
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,700
I'd like to have a go myself.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,360
As far as I know,

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,400
you are from a noble family.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,570
You actually know how to play these low-tier games?

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,550
A wife should follow her husband's lead.

26
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,320
My husband likes it,

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,979
so I naturally know how to play.

28
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,700
Wan'er,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
forget about it.

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,510
If you really want to play,

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,900
I'll play with you

32
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,840
after we get back home.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,560
It's only right for you to accompany me.

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,620
Today,

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,440
I'll have a competition with Miss Yunyun.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,039
What's going on?

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,830
What is she doing?

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,560
Are you alright?

39
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,530
I...

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm alright.

41
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm alright.

42
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,240
It's nothing.

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,280
Wan'er,

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
-I...
-Why are you forcing yourself?

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,750
You're usually so particular about cleanliness.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,240
Now you're reluctant to change your clothes.

47
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,450
Are you worried about me

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
or Miss Yunyun?

49
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,680
-I'm not...
-Mr. Lu.

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,260
I think you should go to the guest room and get changed.

51
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,200
Well then, thank you, Young Lord Yu.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,730
Please take care of Wan'er for me

53
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,000
and don't let her go too far.

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,280
This way please, Mr. Lu.

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,310
Look at Miss Sun.

56
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,360
She actually flirted with Mr. Lu right in front of Mrs. Lu.

57
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,870
She's got some nerve.

58
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,430
Mr. Lu,

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,050
this way, please.

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,360
Miss Yunyun.

61
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,870
Looks like we're in for a good show.

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,280
It's starting already?

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,080
Let's just wait and watch.

64
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,900
So many hidden guards?

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Looks like the golden booklet is nearby.

66
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,520
Mr. Lu,

67
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,310
we're here.

68
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay.

69
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,390
Mr. Lu,

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
please hurry up a bit.

71
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,450
Young Lord is waiting.

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,030
I'll be done soon.

73
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,870
Why hasn't Mr. Lu come back yet?

74
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,660
Yeah.

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
Mrs. Lu is almost out of money.

76
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,360
Young Lord,

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,190
he's here.

78
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,390
What happened,

79
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,390
Young Lord Yu?

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,350
It's nothing.

81
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,970
I just feel that

82
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,440
you changed clothes pretty quickly.

83
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,710
I just didn't want my wife to worry.

84
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,700
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

85
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,280
My gambling lady won quite a bit from your wife today.

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,430
It's normal for money to come and go at the gambling table.

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,690
As long as my wife is happy.

88
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,730
Anyway, it's all Lu Chen's money that's being lost.

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,210
What does it have to do with me?

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,560
Mr. Lu.

91
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,130
Since you're here today,

92
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
I suppose it shows your stance.

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
As for Lord Wang's matter…

94
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,710
Mrs. Lu lost again.

95
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,200
Honey.

96
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Honey,

97
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm coming.

98
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,500
She's calling for me.

99
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,750
You lost again?

100
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,030
It's fine.

101
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,250
Just enjoy yourself.

102
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,490
Miss Yunyun,

103
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,380
your gambling skills are truly exceptional.

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,280
How was it?

105
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,830
Three,

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,040
two,

107
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,630
one.

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,770
Bad news!

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,510
Bad news!

110
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,230
There's a fire!

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,800
There's a fire!

112
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,290
Young Lord.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,730
Let's go and take a look.

114
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,810
What's going on?

115
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,480
Where have they been?

116
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,070
Run!

117
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,630
Let's go and check it out.

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Bring more buckets!

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,810
Hurry!

120
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,830
You guys,

121
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,880
bring more buckets of water!

122
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,510
Hurry up!

123
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,400
Earlier, while I was changing clothes,

124
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
I took the opportunity to tour the Young Lord's Mansion

125
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,970
and used special silk threads

126
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,600
to connect all the fire points in the entire yard.

127
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,320
When the fire spreads,

128
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,860
wherever the hidden guards run,

129
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,480
that's where we'll go to find the booklet.

130
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,640
Bring water! Bring water!

131
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,130
Hurry!

132
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,770
We need more people!

133
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,110
Hurry!

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,690
It should be here.

135
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,300
Over there, over there!

136
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,230
Stay here,

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,190
and I'll be right back.

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,190
Let me go instead.

139
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,970
After all, this is a matter of our Shenyin Sect.

140
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,159
The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of us all.

141
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,909
Besides, I'm more experienced in stealing.

142
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm leaving.

143
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,960
Let's go together.

144
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,730
Young Lord,

145
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,110
we've already checked.

146
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
This fire was likely caused by a candle falling over

147
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,550
and burning the curtains.

148
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,670
My backyard is so large.

149
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,320
Could all the candlesticks have fallen over at once?

150
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,260
Hurry up and go to the main hall.

151
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,050
See who among the guests is missing.

152
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,010
Yes.

153
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,159
I didn't expect the Young Lord's Mansion

154
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,560
to have such a hidden place.

155
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,750
It must be here.

156
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,159
This fragrance...

157
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
The Hell Sect and Yu Xiaolin?

158
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,130
I should have thought of it long ago.

159
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,100
What's wrong with you?

160
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm fine.

161
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,510
Let's search.

162
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,840
Watch out!

163
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,920
Xie Tianxing.

164
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,660
Xie Tianxing!

165
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,720
Oh no.

166
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,840
Let's go back to the secret room.
