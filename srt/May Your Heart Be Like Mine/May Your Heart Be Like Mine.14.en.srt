[Episode 14]

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,950
Tianxing?

4
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,710
Tianxing?

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,780
Boss,

6
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,310
this chick is quite a looker.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,570
Yeah.

8
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,910
It'd be a shame to kill her.

[Lu's Mansion]

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,759
Wan'er?

11
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,539
I've brought the stuff back.

12
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,120
Young Master?

13
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,430
Young Master.

14
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,840
What's wrong?

15
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,230
Why have you come back?

16
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,710
Can't I come back?

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,350
No, it's not that.

18
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,680
Someone just came to the mansion with news

19
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,310
that you were in danger in the woods at the city's outskirts.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,950
Young Madam was very worried when she heard this.

21
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,910
So she rushed there immediately.

22
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,310
What?

23
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh no.

24
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Qing?

25
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,630
Qing!

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,590
Qing?

27
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,240
Qing!

28
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,120
How did she manage to escape again?

[Maple Inn]

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,430
Brother Xie,

31
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,210
are you alright?

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,520
Miss Yunyun.

33
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,590
Why are you here?

34
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,660
Did you do this to save Mrs. Lu?

35
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,870
Yes.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,310
Once she wakes up,

37
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,560
I will...

38
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,040
Let me help you inside first.

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,610
Master,

40
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,740
how is he?

41
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,580
His pulse is irregular,

42
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,910
and heat is emanating from his internal organs.

43
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,820
He must have been poisoned with an extremely hot poison.

44
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,990
Chiyan Powder?

45
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,560
To save me,

46
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,470
he transferred the poison in me to himself.

47
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,330
No wonder...

48
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,190
I hope this silver lock

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,270
can protect you and keep you safe.

50
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,360
Tianxing?

51
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,830
Tianxing.

52
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,600
Tianxing.

53
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,890
The Nine Nights of Hell.

54
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,160
You're saying he's been poisoned with Nine Nights of Hell?

55
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,940
It's Yu Xiaolin.

56
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,130
A red line

57
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,660
will appear on

58
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,010
the poisoned person's left arm.

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,800
The line will grow a bit each day,

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,210
their blood will turn purple-black,

61
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
and then they will...

62
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,450
You've followed Yu Xiaolin for many years.

63
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,510
You must know how to make the poisons he often uses.

64
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,990
Please, tell me.

65
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,450
I beg you.

66
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,790
Please.

67
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,640
Master,

68
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,130
what should we do now?

69
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,800
Though everyone fears the Nine Nights of Hell poison,

70
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,680
in fact, it's not difficult to concoct,

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,510
nor is it hard to cure.

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,140
It's just that its antidote is also a poison,

73
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,910
with an overpowering potency.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,810
We need a specific herb to protect the heart meridian.

75
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,800
What herb?

76
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Marsdenia longipes.

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
This herb grows in deep mountains shrouded in clouds and mist.

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,190
White Cloud Mountain...

79
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,140
Some might be growing there.

80
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,830
Wait!

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,860
You have many other matters to attend to. You can't take risks.

82
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,659
Master,

83
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,560
he got poisoned with Chiyan Powder

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
because of saving me.

85
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,390
I can't just leave him like this.

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,230
Please.

87
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,030
I beg you.

88
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,510
I'll go with you.

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Let's search more carefully.

90
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,750
The herb must be nearby.

91
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,660
I'll go take a look over there.

92
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,920
Mrs. Lu!

93
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,330
Come quickly and see this.

94
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Is this the Marsdenia longipes?

95
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,530
Where?

96
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,830
Here.

97
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,270
Yes.

98
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,560
I'll go pick it.
