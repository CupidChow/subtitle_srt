00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,060
[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,280
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,250
Why is it you?

4
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,870
Young Lord.

5
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,220
I saw the fire in the backyard

6
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,820
and was worried about your safety.

7
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,330
I didn't do it on purpose.

8
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,640
Alright, alright.

9
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,789
Okay.

10
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,070
Young Lord Yu?

11
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,810
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,910
I should be the one asking you, Mr. Lu,

13
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,350
what are you two doing here?

14
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,040
Young Lord Yu, you may not know,

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,750
just after you left with your people,

16
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Wan'er and Miss Yunyun started arguing again.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,550
She ran out, I chased after her,

18
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,560
and we ended up here.

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,400
Sure, sure.

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,520
I was being unreasonable.

21
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,520
No.

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,450
It's my fault, as your husband.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,390
Wifey, what can I do to make you feel better?

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,370
I'm hungry now.

25
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,370
I want to eat sweet and sour fish from Zuixiang Pavilion.

26
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:20,800
Okay.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,800
Let's eat then.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,720
Young Lord Yu.

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,560
You see,

30
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,460
you wouldn’t know since you’re not married,

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,170
but when it comes to women’s thoughts,

32
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,470
you have to go along with her.

33
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,850
Alright then,

34
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,680
we’ll take our leave for today.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,350
Let's meet another day.

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,070
Wifey.

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,780
Go away.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Slow down.

39
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,430
Wifey.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,910
Don't be angry.

41
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,310
Young Lord.

42
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,390
These two are clearly up to something.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Are you sure

44
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,530
you want to let them go just like that?

45
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,160
That day when they were trapped in the gambling den,

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,790
Lord summoned me

47
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,520
and gave me the gold-foil booklet to test me.

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,030
Today, I couldn't catch them red-handed,

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,110
so how could I justify keeping them in the mansion?

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,920
[Half an incense stick earlier]

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,520
You should leave now.

52
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,840
If you stay here, we'll both be exposed.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,360
No.

54
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,660
We came together and we'll leave together.

55
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,490
We have nothing to do with each other.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,450
You don’t have to stay for me.

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,030
Go.

58
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,270
You’re trapped here because you saved me.

59
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,590
I can’t just abandon you.

60
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,180
Go!

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,660
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,

62
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,710
you need to leave now.

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,680
I'll handle things here.

64
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,720
Take care.

65
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,510
Trust her.

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,180
Let's go.

67
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,940
[Lu's Mansion]

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
Although we didn't get the booklet this time,

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,590
we discovered its location

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,630
and uncovered Yu Xiaolin's other identity.

71
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,860
But what exactly is this booklet you speak of?

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,450
You took the mission without knowing?

73
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,910
I always take missions

74
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,690
without asking for reasons.

75
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,980
But now that this involves Yu Xiaolin,

76
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,000
and Yu Xiaolin is in cahoots with Hell Sect,

77
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,930
I must know.

78
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,520
What if I don't tell you?

79
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,510
Sure.

80
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,480
But now this matter is so dangerous.

81
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,920
I won't cooperate with you anymore in the future.

82
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,640
Come with me to a place first.

83
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,380
Come, come, take a look!

84
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,790
Why did you bring me

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,560
here?

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,870
What do you think of Tianshu State now?

87
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,260
Tianshu State is prosperous and thriving.

88
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,030
The people are living and working in peace and contentment.

89
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,960
And Yu Xiaolin, what do you think of him?

90
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,560
He is ruthless, cruel,

91
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,040
and full of tricks and schemes.

92
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,000
He commits unspeakable acts against women.

93
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,700
Even though others respect him as a Young Lord,

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,890
in my eyes,

95
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,690
he is nothing but a despicable person,

96
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
a shameless scoundrel.

97
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,130
Wait.

98
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,290
Weren't you talking about the booklet?

99
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,380
Actually, the booklet isn't important.

100
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,890
You just need to know that

101
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,880
Yu Xiaolin has been coveting the Lord's position for a long time.

102
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,320
If the booklet falls into his hands,

103
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,190
it will strengthen his claim to power.

104
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,610
But if he becomes Lord,

105
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,700
given his nature and character,

106
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,140
it would be a disaster for the people.

107
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,920
What beautiful fireworks!

108
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,120
The fireworks from Lord's mansion get more spectacular every year.

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,840
Look how beautiful the fireworks are.

110
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,250
Everyone loves them.

111
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,470
Not as much as someone.

112
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,750
Get up.

113
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,720
Do you know why I hit you?

114
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,740
I accidentally

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,230
triggered Young Lord's trap,

116
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,390
ruining Young Lord's plan.

117
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,670
Not only that,

118
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,430
I also saw you

119
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,520
personally handing dice to Mr. Lu.

120
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,310
What's going on?

121
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,560
You've taken a liking to him?

122
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,270
I wouldn't dare.

123
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,790
Young Lord.

124
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Everything I do

125
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,409
is for you.

126
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,490
Let's hear it then.

127
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,659
I love hearing your excuses.

128
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,980
I know

129
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,410
Young Lord really wants Lu Chen's booklet.

130
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,900
But not only does he hide it,

131
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,050
he also pretends it doesn't exist.

132
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,150
He must have some hidden agenda.

133
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,260
That's why I've been trying to get close to him

134
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,330
to help Young Lord obtain the booklet.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,490
Yunyun,

136
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,270
you're overestimating yourself.

137
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,960
Everyone knows by now

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
that Mr. Lu only has eyes

139
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,990
for his new wife.

140
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,179
Then let's make a bet.

141
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,440
Within three days,

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Mr. Lu will definitely ask Young Lord for me.

143
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,580
Young Lord.

144
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,300
How's the investigation going?

145
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,200
Reporting to Young Lord,

146
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,120
I have inspected all the places where the fire started.

147
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,870
It seems someone used a special kind of thread

148
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,620
to connect all the candles, causing the fire.

149
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,230
Commoner Swordsman garnered fame in just one battle

150
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,910
because he was able to set an entire mountain base ablaze at once.

151
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,170
Only he has that thread.

152
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,340
Could it be that

153
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
he's still alive?

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
That can't be right.

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,480
He was poisoned with the Nine Nights of Hell.

156
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,080
What day is it today?

157
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,750
The tenth day.

158
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,240
The tenth...

159
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,670
It shouldn't be possible.

160
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
He's still alive?
