[Lu's Mansion]

4
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,470
Women are so unpredictable.

5
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,570
One moment they're fine,

6
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,450
the next they're kicking you out of the room.

7
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,760
Young Master.

8
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,480
What are you doing here?

9
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,780
I woke up early

10
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,980
and came out for some fresh air.

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,039
Someone just asked me to give this to you.

12
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,370
Mr. Lu,

13
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
Yunyun has been waiting for you here for a long time.

14
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,720
Perhaps I should call you Brother Xie.

15
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,010
Why did you capture me?

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,100
Young lady,

17
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
your father owes us money.

18
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,360
You've been given to our Wanhua House as collateral.

19
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,660
Madam,

20
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,210
I'll find a way to repay the money owed to you.

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,890
Please let me go.

22
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I beg you.

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
Impossible.

24
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,650
I'm counting on you to make us a fortune.

25
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,290
Let's go.

26
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,750
She got away.

27
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,450
Don't worry, there's no one else here.

28
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,630
Thank you, Young Master.

29
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,190
What's wrong?

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
My surname is Xie, which means "thank you."

31
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,380
Then how should I address you, young master?

32
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,370
Don't call me young master anymore.

33
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,630
Just call me

34
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,480
Commoner Swordsman.

35
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,360
Commoner Swordsman?

36
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,570
How about I call you Brother Xie?

37
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,660
How's that?

38
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Whatever you like.

39
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,930
You're injured.

40
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,520
Miss Yunyun.

41
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,590
You recognized me at a glance?

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
Perhaps to you,

43
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm just a passerby in the martial arts world.

44
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,230
But to me,

45
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
you are extremely important.

46
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,070
After all, you saved my life.

47
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,140
Miss Yunyun, you flattered me.

48
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,310
But I remember

49
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,470
I had you settled elsewhere that day.

50
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,400
Why have you ended up here again?

51
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,880
I don't know

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,400
if I was lucky or unfortunate.

53
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,490
Shortly after you left, Brother Xie,

54
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,250
people from the brothel

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
came and kidnapped me again.

56
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,730
Not long after,

57
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,659
Young Lord Yu took notice of my arithmetic skills

58
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,970
and made me a gambling courtesan.

59
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,240
Miss Yunyun.

60
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,210
What are you doing?

61
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,990
Please get up.

62
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,680
Brother Xie,

63
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,310
you won't just stand by and watch, right?

64
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,510
Miss Yunyun,

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,210
please get up first.

66
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,480
Who did this to you?

67
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,080
Brother Xie,

68
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,770
please save me one more time.

69
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,060
I can't stay in the Young Lord's Mansion for another day.

[Rouge Shop]

71
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,360
Master,

72
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,270
yesterday I entered the inner quarters of the Young Lord's Mansion.

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
It's full of traps inside.

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,790
I also discovered that Yu Xiaolin is a member of the Hell Sect.

75
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,960
I never thought the Young Lord of Tianshu State

76
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,590
would be connected to the Hell Sect.

77
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,510
It must have been dangerous yesterday.

78
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,160
Thank you for your hard work.

79
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,990
Fortunately, there's the Commoner Swordsman.

80
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,450
If it weren't for him yesterday,

81
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,750
I would have been discovered by Yu Xiaolin.

82
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,050
So,

83
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,250
I think he can be useful to us.

84
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,360
Move slowly and be careful.

85
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,580
Why are you here?

86
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,310
Sister, you're back.

87
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,550
I've prepared some gifts for you.

88
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,790
Don't call me sister.

89
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,240
I don't need your things either.

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,890
Why are you at the Lu Residence?

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,290
I'm at the Lu Residence,

92
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,750
naturally, it's arranged by Mr. Lu.

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,950
Why didn't he discuss it with me?

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,830
What's wrong?

95
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,240
You don't believe me?

96
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,450
Sister, you don't think

97
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,380
that just because he married you,

98
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,490
he's settled down

99
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,970
and only loves you, do you?

100
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,130
Sister.

101
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,230
Miss Yunyun!

102
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,740
How are you?

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,680
It's nothing.

104
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,540
Don't blame Mrs. Lu.

105
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,260
She didn't mean to.

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,720
She didn't know I was injured.

107
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,750
Childish and ridiculous.

108
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,220
Then I'll take you to treat your wounds first.

109
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,200
Wan'er,

110
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,990
wait for me to explain to you later.

111
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,669
No need.

112
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,870
I don't care.

113
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,909
Wan...

114
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,390
Xiaobao, please take care of Miss Yunyun first.

115
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,030
What?

116
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,440
Wan'er.

117
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,670
Wan'er.

118
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,880
-Miss Yunyun.
-Wan'er.

119
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,000
Please.

120
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,790
So you're saying...

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,030
She's a pitiful person too.

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,480
Let's do as you say then.

123
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,070
Wan'er truly understands righteousness.

124
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,240
Come.

125
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,360
Please.

126
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,150
Miss Wan'er,

127
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,270
Thanks.

128
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,740
You little rascal.

129
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,390
Father.

130
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,840
-Father?
-Why did you hit me?

131
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,660
How dare you ask me that?
