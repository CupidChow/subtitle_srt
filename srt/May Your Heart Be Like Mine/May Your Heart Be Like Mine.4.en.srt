[Episode 4]

3
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,580
Why is this water slightly sweet and cloying?

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,920
Wifey?

5
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,140
Wifey.

6
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,120
What are you doing?

7
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,710
I’m here to help my husband recover, of course.

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,039
This bath is filled with precious medicinal herbs.

9
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,980
Deer antler, safflower branches, honey, and sweet alyssum.

10
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,560
Combined, they have the effect of promoting blood circulation and removing stasis.

11
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,220
They'll help you recover your memory.

12
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,950
That doesn't sound right.

13
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,680
I'd better slip out.

14
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,490
Never mind, Wifey.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,150
Thank you for your kind intentions, Wifey.

16
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,710
I’ll just…

17
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,150
Dear, you mustn't.

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,000
You need to soak for a full three hours.

19
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,170
Help!

20
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,300
Help!

21
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,670
Why isn’t he moving?

22
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
Wan'er.

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,650
Thank you.

24
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,680
Dear,

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,590
have you remembered something?

26
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,970
No.

27
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,860
He still needs to soak a little longer.

28
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,220
Wan'er.

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,400
Can I go out now?

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,960
No.

31
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,180
Such a lavish meal, Wifey.

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,130
Which one should I try first?

33
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll try this one.

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,240
Dear,

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
those are mine.

36
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,270
These are yours.

37
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,910
Just these?

38
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,880
Until you regain your memory,

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,710
you can only eat foods that help with blood circulation and removing stasis.

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,470
Young Master!

41
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,910
What's the matter?

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
Tianming Pavilion has requested your presence.

43
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,790
Why didn't I think of going to the tea house?

44
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,620
Tianming Pavilion?

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, I forgot

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,870
you lost your memory.

47
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,780
Tianming Pavilion is our Lu family’s teahouse.

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,240
I've already lost my memory.

49
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,700
Isn’t it inappropriate for me to visit the teahouse?

50
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,450
Don't worry, Young Master. I'll be with you.

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,440
Dear, let me accompany you.

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
It might help you regain your memory.

53
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,210
Perhaps the booklet is at the teahouse.

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,450
Alright, let's go.

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,110
[Tianming Pavilion]

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,470
Get out!

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,470
Mr. Lu,

58
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,470
I’ll return immediately.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,829
-Don’t punish me.
-Wait.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Don't be afraid.

61
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,360
I am Mrs. Lu.

62
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,860
No one will dare to bully you while I'm here.

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,540
Let me see.

64
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,560
Young lady, where are you going?

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,030
We're not done yet.

66
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,310
This one is pretty.

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,330
You must be new here.

68
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,110
Let go! Let go!

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,790
Mr. Lu,

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,700
what are you doing?

71
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,770
What am I doing?

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,190
I'm breaking your hand.

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,480
Young Master,

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,310
you mustn't do this.

75
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,350
This is Mr. Zhang.

76
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,100
He's a big client of our teahouse.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,159
Big client?

78
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,159
I don't care if he's a big client.

79
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,850
From now on, this person is not welcome at Tianming Pavilion.

80
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:55,870
Get out!

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,370
Mr. Zhang.

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,830
Mr. Zhang.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Are you alright?

84
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,870
Mr. Lu,

85
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,750
I know I made a mistake.

86
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,480
Do you guys want to leave this place?

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Mr. Lu, did we do something wrong?

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,950
Yeah,

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,270
if we did something wrong,

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,560
we're all willing to accept punishment.

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
Please don’t frighten us with such talk.

92
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,980
Everyone, get up.

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,510
Get up, get up.

94
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm not trying to scare you.

95
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,360
Lu Chen, what despicable means did you use in the past?

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,750
I...

97
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,800
It's just that I, Lu Chen,

98
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,600
have realized my past mistakes,

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
and I want to start anew.

100
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
I really want to set you guys free.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,070
Please get up.

102
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,170
This change in Lu Chen...

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Could it be that his memory loss awakened his good side?

104
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,400
Young Master, you mustn’t do this.

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Why not?

106
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,400
Young Master, you've forgotten.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,530
You and Young Lord Yu

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,920
were found by you and Young Lord Yu.

109
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,110
If you let them go so easily,

110
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,190
I'm afraid it will displease Young Lord Yu.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,070
And in a few days, it will be his birthday.

112
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,330
We'll need them then.

113
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,430
Let me see.

114
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,240
Young Lord Yu?

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,600
He's the Lord's younger brother.

116
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,250
Xiaobao is right.

117
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,840
If I dismiss the tea maids now,

118
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,590
it will surely anger Young Lord Yu.

119
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,070
And then, it might expose my identity.

120
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,400
Well then, about what I said earlier...

121
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Let me think about it again.

122
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,040
Everyone, return to your rooms for now.

123
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,560
Go. Hurry up, go.

124
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,330
Xiaobao.

125
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,120
You said I used to

126
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,070
come to this count room every night, right?

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
Yes, Young Master.

128
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,000
Everything here was sorted by you personally.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,100
You took it very seriously.

130
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,580
Every night?

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,190
There must be something special about this.

132
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,860
Wan'er,

133
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,680
I'll go find Young Lord Yu right away

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,800
to discuss the matter of the tea maids.

135
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,970
I certainly won’t let them affect Tianming Pavilion.

136
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Thank you for your efforts, my dear.

137
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,390
I’ll wait for your good news at home.

138
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,340
I didn't expect Mr. Lu to like this woman so much.

139
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,160
In just these few days,

140
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,140
he's willing to offend Young Lord Yu for her.

141
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Xiaobao, take good care of Young Madam.

142
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Yes, Young Master.

[Tianming Pavilion]

144
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,250
It’s quite tidy here.

145
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,960
Master, she left and returned for no reason.

146
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,480
She must have come to meet her lover.

147
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,750
Moreover, I've long heard that

148
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,250
that Qiao Wan'er had improper relationships with servants when she was in her maiden chamber.

149
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,600
I think that rumor might be true.

150
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,720
You have no evidence.

151
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,690
Don't talk nonsense!

152
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,130

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,050
What are you doing here?

162
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,470
Now's not the time to discuss this.

163
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,070
So why are we hiding in a cabinet?

164
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,330
-I saw you!
-Where is she?

165

Master.

169
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,990
I saw her come in with my own eyes.

170
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,180
She must still be here.

171
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,510
Someone come and search!

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,120
Yes.

173
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,780
This way.

174
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,400

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:13,790
Check everything.

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,510
Search thoroughly.

178
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,170
She must be hiding her lover here!

179
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,750
Search over there as well.

180
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,350
Wan'er, my legs are numb.

181
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,870
Miss Rong and Master are nothing to be afraid of.

182
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,320
But how do I explain why I'm here?

Master, what did I tell you?

187
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,850
Qiao Wan'er, we've caught you red-handed.

What are you trying to say?

189
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,750
Take a good look at who you're talking to first.

190
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,720
Father.

191
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,010
Mr. Lu?

192
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,290
How come it's you?

193
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,280
If not me, then who should it be?

194
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,630
But I...

195
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,820
Chen'er.

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,510
Why were you and Wan'er in the cabinet?

197
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,610
What are you two playing at?

198
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,280
Father.

199
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,240
I've been having trouble sleeping lately.

200
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,720
Wan'er suggested that walking around

201
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,560
might help me recover my memory,

202
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
so we came here.

203
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,510
Please don't overthink it.

204
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,930
When have I ever overthought anything?

205
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,180
No, but

206
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,720
I clearly saw you come in alone just now.

207
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,360
Then you must have been mistaken.

208
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,540
How is that possible?

209
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,060
Are you done?

210
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
We can allow you to stay in the mansion,

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
but you need to calm down.

212
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,870
Stop fixating on Wan'er all the time.

213
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,240
Master.

214
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,030
Enough.

215
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,600
I should be heading back now.

216
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,240
Take care, Father.

217
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,320
Why did you come here?

218
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,870
I can't say I came here for a stroll, right?

219
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,690
It would be too fake to say I came here for a stroll, wouldn't it?

220
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,840
I came to find the indenture contracts.

221
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,910
Earlier on, I saw those tea maids and felt so sorry for them.

222
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,200
But I also thought about how important the business is to you, my husband.

223
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,620
But I still couldn't bear it, so I...

224
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,390
I feel the same.

225
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,550
When I laid down to sleep,

226
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,260
all I could see in my mind were scenes of the tea maids being mistreated.

227
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,300
Knowing that was all my own doing,

228
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,080
I can't sleep at night.

229
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,100
If that's the case,

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
why don't we...

231
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,050
Mr. Lu, Young Madam,

232
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,360
why did you summon us so late at night?

233
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,440
What's the matter?

234
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,200
It's something that will make you happy.

235
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,960
Mr. Lu and I have decided

236
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,480
that from today onwards,

237
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,200
we will return your indenture contracts to you.

238
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,600
From now on, you're free to come and go as you please.

239
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,520
You won't have to live in fear of anyone's threats anymore.

240
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,630
That's right.

241
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,440
From now on,

242
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,270
Tianming Pavilion will only serve tea to tea lovers for their enjoyment.

243
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,000
We will no longer engage in such improper business.

244
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,630
Furthermore,

245
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,790
I will give each of you 100 taels

246
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,000
as travel expenses for your journey home,

247
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,180
as a gesture of apology from me.

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,390
Everyone, please go home.

249
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,910
Thank you, Young Master Lu.

250
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,600
How dare he!

251
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,530
Young Lord, please don't be angry.

252
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,010
I heard it was his new wife's idea.

253
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,190
Given Lu Chen's personality,

254
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,720
how could he possibly change for a woman?

255
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,390
But this time, it seems different.

256
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,670
Is that so?

257
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,990
In that case,

258
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,120
we need to meet this Mrs. Lu.
