00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,180
[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,040
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,990
[Lord's Residence]

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,950
Young Lord.

5
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,520
[Yu Xiaoze, Lord of Tianshu State]

6
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,710
Greetings, my lord.

7
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,710
Xiaolin.

8
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Get up quickly.

9
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:37,640
We're all brothers here.

10
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,860
There's no one else around.

11
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,950
No need for formalities.

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,070
I wonder why you have summoned me,

13
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,979
my lord?

14
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,330
I have a gift I'd like to give you.

15
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,870
It's too valuable.

16
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm not worthy to accept it.

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,900
We've been close since childhood.

18
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,050
Some things are shared between us.

19
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,170
So from now on, I expect you to be a good Young Lord,

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,670
to assist me

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
in governing Tianshu State.

22
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,829
Don't have any other thoughts.

23
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,090
Yes, my lord.

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,800
If there's nothing else,

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,410
I shall take my leave.

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,680
Xiaojing failed the task

27
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,760
and was summoned by the Young Lord.

28
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,630
That's why we had to ask a favor from you.

29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,530
Get up.

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,770
After all, Xiaolin is my brother

31
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,560
and the Young Lord of the state.

32
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,790
Now Miss Cui is officially the lady of the Lu household.

33
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,870
How could we go against her wishes?

34
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,200
Moreover, I can use this opportunity to teach him a lesson.

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,070
I hope he will back off because of this.

36
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,310
Don't force me to use my last resort.

37
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Please rest assured, my lord.

38
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,260
The Shenyin Sect will do everything in its power to stop Young Lord Yu.

39
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,490
Mr. Lu.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,510
Mr. Lu just loves to play hide and seek.

41
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,120
Mr. Lu.

42
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,190
I'm coming in.

43
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,420
How would a noble lady like Qiao Wan'er

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,110
know about my Lingxiu Point technique?

45
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,950
This is not good.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,720
As the poison spreads,

47
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,310
the pain intensifies.

48
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,750
What's wrong with you?

49
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm fine.

50
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,960
I might have been too nervous earlier.

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,270
Wan'er,

52
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I just remembered

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
Father seemed to need me for something.

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Why don't you go back to your room first?

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,150
I'll go see him.

56
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,190
Alright.

57
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,820
You know martial arts?

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Wan'er.

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,630
Or should I call you tea maid?

60
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,120
Dear,

61
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

62
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,250
How could I be a tea maid?

63
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Stop pretending!

64
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,450
Who are you?

65
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,970
Oh no.

66
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Don't kill me!

67
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,190
Don't kill me! Stay back! Don't kill me!

68
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,430
You killed Mr. Lu.

69
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,510
No,

70
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,060
I'm not pregnant with Mr. Lu's child.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,160
Don't kill me! I don't know anything!

72
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,860
Don't kill me!

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
I'm giving you two options now.

74
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,830
First,

75
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,170
take the money and leave the Lu residence.

76
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,620
Never come back.

77
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,390
Second,

78
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,240
you stay here with him

79
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,280
forever.

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,040
I choose the first one. I choose the first one.

81
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,720
I beg you.

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,310
I beg both of you.

83
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,310
Please don't kill me.

84
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm begging you.

85
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,140
Please don't kill me!

86
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,159
There can't be two people in this world who look so alike.

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Right now, it's not your place to question me. It should be me questioning you.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
I can be Qiao Wan'er,

89
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,830
or the tea maid.

90
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,580
What about you?

91
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,390
Actually, I...

92
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,190
Lu Chen's body

93
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,270
is the best evidence.

94
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,560
Tell me.

95
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
Who are you really?

96
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,950
What's your purpose for coming to the Lu residence?

97
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,920
Alright, I'll tell you.

98
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,780
Watch out!

99
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,200
This Chiyan Powder

100
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,810
needs cold energy as a catalyst

101
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,010
to draw out the poison.

102
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm sorry, miss.

103
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,419
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

104
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
One more poison won't make a difference.

105
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,060
Now,

106
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,490
I can only draw the poison from her body into mine.

107
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,150
Despicable!

108
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,960
You're awake.

109
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,750
I've already helped expel the poison from your body.

110
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,540
That's how

111
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,440
it happened.

112
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
If it weren't for this mission,

113
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,870
I wouldn't have had to impersonate this Lu Chen.

114
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,550
Oh, right,

115
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,410
we've worked together before.

116
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,780
Who are you?

117
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,450
Let go.

118
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,720
I didn't expect to meet a fellow professional, miss.

119
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,150
You're the swordsman from that day?

120
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,390
We have fought side by side, after all.

121
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,800
Since our goals align,

122
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,290
why don't we continue to work together?

123
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,360
Since our goals align,

124
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,470
how could we cooperate?

125
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Miss,

126
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,800
one must learn to be flexible.

127
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,090
Besides,

128
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,550
we've been through life and death together these days.

129
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,200
You've seen my abilities.

130
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,840
If we join forces,

131
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,590
we'll be far more efficient.

132
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,600
I need to consult my master about this.

133
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,130
Deal.

134
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,260
Now that I've revealed myself,

135
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,270
may I ask how I should address you, miss?

136
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,560
Qing'er.

137
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,740
Master,

138
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,410
that's what happened.

139
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,630
A wandering swordsman

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
looks exactly like Lu Chen.

141
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,270
Even Master Lu didn't notice.

142
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,560
Although it's not uncommon for people to look similar,

143
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,100
it's indeed rare to resemble someone

144
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,510
to this extent.

145
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,880
I'll send someone to investigate this matter.

146
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,800
There is indeed such a person known as the Commoner Swordsman in the martial arts world,

147
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,870
who's famous for robbing the rich to help the poor.

148
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,860
I suppose he's not a bad person.

149
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,110
Since he's a wandering swordsman,

150
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,200
he must have some skills in finding and stealing things.

151
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,570
Master, you want to use him?

152
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,100
Cooperate with him first,

153
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,510
and we'll decide what to do after we find the item.

154
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,270
Please come in.

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,760
Rongrong,

156
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,780
why have you suddenly become so rich?

157
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,750
Could it be that Mr. Lu is going to marry you?

158
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,660
What's so good about marrying him?

159
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,390
There would be no freedom afterwards,

160
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,080
and no way to come out and enjoy life.

161
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,370
Well, I've

162
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,070
discovered one of his secrets.

163
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,450
From now on, he'll have to do whatever I say.

164
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,920
What secret?

165
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Tell us quickly.

166
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,080
Come on, tell us!

167
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,920
It won't be a secret anymore if I tell you.

168
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,400
Take this.

169
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,790
Help! He—

170
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,080
Miss,

171
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't know anything.

172
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,670
Please let me go.

173
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,330
I want to know Mr. Lu's secret.

174
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,560
Mr. Lu...

175
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,470
Mr. Lu...

176
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,390
I'll tell you everything.

177
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,520
He...

178
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,820
Mr. Lu...

179
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,010
Mr. Lu is already dead.

180
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,910
And there are two Mr. Lu.

181
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,880
One is a very bad person.

182
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,720
Miss, I...

183
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,200
I'll tell you everything.

184
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,140
Miss, miss...

185
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,050
Mr. Xie,

186
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,880
I've come to see you.
