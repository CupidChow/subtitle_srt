[Young Lord's Mansion]

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,200
Come on.

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,030
Drink. Let's drink!

6
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,670
Down it!

7
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,600
Keep drinking, keep drinking.

8
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,110
Bottoms up!

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,030
I'll drink it all! Every last drop!

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,060
Waiter, bring more wine!

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,470
Cheers!

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,709
It's all gone!

13
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,480
Cheers, cheers!

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,640
Come on, it's been a long time.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,430
It's been a long time indeed.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,310
I'll place a bet.

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,190
It's opening!

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,480
Big!

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
I bet on big!

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,680
Big!

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,460
Big!

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,560
Big!

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,900
Place your bets, and no take-backs.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,500
Everyone, watch closely.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,940
I bet! I bet!

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,039
This round must be small!

27
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,710
It must all be big!

28
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,820
I'll bet on small again!

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,479
Open it!

30
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,430
It's opening, it's opening, it's opening!

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
Come on, open up! Hurry!

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,680
Open it!

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,640
Open it!

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,070
Don't just listen!

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Open it!

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,789
Will you open it or not?

37
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:49,900
It must be small!

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,710
It's open, it's open!

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,350
Open! Open! Open!

40
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:52,920
Open!

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Big!

42
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:53,920
Big!

43
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,280
Big!

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,509
Small!

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,870
Big!

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,430
Big!

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,310
Big, big, big!

48
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,789
Small!

49
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,430
Big!

50
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:57,590
Small!

51
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,039
Big!

52
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,640
Small!

53
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,200
Small!

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,680
Small!

55
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,510
Big!

56
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,350
Small!

57
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,000
Open it!

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Big, big, big.

59
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,840
Small!

60
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,800
A straight.

61
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,910
The dealer takes all.

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,960
Thank you, everyone.

63
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,520
Give me the money, give me the money.

64
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,240
Thank you.

65
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,710
Come on, come on.

66
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,960
Let's continue, let's continue!

67
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Brother Xie?

68
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,960
Dear,

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,829
what are you looking at?

70
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,630
Nothing.

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,030
Mr. Lu!

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
After what happened last time,

73
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,040
I thought you wouldn't come.

74
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,390
I didn't realize that in your eyes...

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,930
I, Lu Chen, am such

76
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,270
a person who can't take a joke.

77
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,800
If you hadn't hurt my wife first last time,

78
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,220
I don't think I would have been so angry.

79
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,310
Young Lord,

80
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,710
my husband and I have come here this time

81
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,620
not only to congratulate you

82
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,960
but also to apologize to you.

83
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,150
How so?

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,270
Young Lord Yu, you may not know,

85
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,810
but my husband had hit his head

86
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,510
and lost his memory,

87
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,890
and that's why he'd forgotten about the cooperation with you

88
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,090
and disbanded the tea maids.

89
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,260
What is this about now?

90
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,490
Right, dear?

91
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,350
Yes.

92
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,230
That's right.

93
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,010
At that time, I even forgot about my wife.

94
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,810
Fortunately, Wan'er was understanding

95
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,310
and didn't blame me.

96
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,800
Young Lord,

97
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,950
this is a small token from my husband and me.

98
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,430
Please accept it

99
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,240
and let bygones be bygones.

100
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,800
One cannot be blamed for what they don't know.

101
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,300
Of course, I won't hold it against you anymore.

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,670
As for this gift,

103
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,070
I'll accept it.

104
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,380
Please enjoy yourselves.

105
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,220
I

106
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,950
need to attend to other guests.

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,800
Please, go ahead.

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,220
Dear.

109
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,250
You've been staring at Miss Yunyun.

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,830
Do you want to gamble with her?

111
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,800
I don't want to gamble with her.

112
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:38,720
I... I don't want to...

113
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,040
I...

114
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,310
It seems Miss Yunyun's gambling skills are quite impressive.

115
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,950
I only have but a modest grasp.

116
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,790
How could I compare to Mr. Lu?

117
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,510
Previously,

118
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,950
seeing Mr. Lu's bet with the Young Lord,

119
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,350
I've been itching to test my skills.

120
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,950
I wonder

121
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,210
if Mr. Lu would do me the honor of a game today.

122
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,480
I can't.

123
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,920
My wife won't allow it.

124
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,830
Dear,

125
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,110
since Miss Yunyun has already said it,

126
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,310
you can't turn down such an enthusiastic request.

127
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,630
Come on.

128
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:15,870
I...

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,190
Well, since my wife has given permission,

130
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,260
I shall respectfully comply.

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,540
Miss Yunyun,

132
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,980
what would you like to play?

133
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,680
Let's play Sic Bo.

134
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,180
Alright.

135
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,960
I just said it, and you're really going to gamble?

136
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,240
Fine.

137
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,480
Go ahead and gamble to your heart's content.

138
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,360
Don't mind me!

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Wait...

140
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,330
Wan'er...

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,040
Wan'er?

142
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,630
Didn't you say I could...

143
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,270
Mr. Lu?

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,750
Mr. Lu!

145
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,040
It's time to open.

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,320
The Young Lord's Mansion is so large.

147
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,240
I wonder where Yu Xiaolin has hidden that booklet.

148
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,890
Every servant here is a secret guard in disguise.

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
The golden booklet must be nearby.

150
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,560
Mrs. Lu.

151
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,490
Why are you here?

152
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,070
The Young Lord's mansion is so big

153
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,290
that I got lost.

154
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,100
Is that so?

155
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,620
Or did you come here on purpose?

156
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,900
If I were to make a move now,

157
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,130
my cover would certainly be blown.

158
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,830
Honey!

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,720
Honey!

160
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,710
My dear.

161
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,040
There you are.

162
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,630
I've been looking everywhere for you!

163
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,190
Why are you still looking for me?

164
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,270
Go back to flirting with your Miss Yunyun

165
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,290
and enjoy your gambling!

166
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,590
What's this about?

167
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,000
You were the one who asked me to gamble with Miss Yunyun,

168
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,670
and that's why I did it.

169
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,640
How come you're still angry, even though I did what you said?

170
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,060
If you truly didn't want to,

171
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,310
you wouldn't have agreed,

172
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,210
even if I had asked you to.

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,030
Alright, alright, alright.

174
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,430
From now on, I'll only have eyes for you.

175
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,630
I certainly won't look at any other woman again.

176
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm sorry you had to witness this.

177
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Tell me,

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,830
what's your real purpose for coming to the Young Lord's Mansion today?

179
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,630
Nothing.

180
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,100
I just felt cooped up

181
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,070
and wanted to come out for a walk.

182
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,580
Do you think I'd believe that?

183
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

184
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,260
I didn't want to come today originally.

185
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,720
You came up with every possible reason to convince me to come.

186
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,380
But after coming here, you acted all strangely.

187
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,930
One minute, you said you wanted me to gamble with Miss Yunyun.

188
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,850
Next, you pretended to be jealous and stormed out.

189
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,050
Are you sure

190
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,270
you still want to play dumb?

191
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,180
I do have another purpose,

192
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,750
but that has nothing to do with you.

193
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,770
How can it have nothing to do with me?

194
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,070
You came here with me.

195
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,510
If anything happened to you,

196
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,730
how could I not be held responsible?

197
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,040
Fine.

198
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,200
If you don't tell me,

199
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,650
then I'll follow you wherever you go.

200
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,230
Let's see how you make your move.

201
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,750
You...

202
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,200
Fine.

203
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,720
I'll tell you.

204
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,790
There are originally three copies of the golden booklet.

205
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,240
One of them is here in the Young Lord's Mansion.

206
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,430
I came here today for this item.

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,560
So, if I steal this copy, pretend it's Lu Chen's,

208
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,470
and give it to the Hell Sect, wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone?

209
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

210
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,370
This is my specialty.

211
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,720
What?

212
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,630
Did you forget

213
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,150
what I used to do before?
