00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,340
Father has come to see you.

5
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,480
My Xiu.

6
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,550
Xiu.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,930
My poor child.

8
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,100
My Xiu.

9
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,910
Father.

10
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,350
You...

11
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,470
You are...

12
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,430
It's me.

13
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,950
Xiu.

14
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,810
You... you're not dead?

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,789
It's me.

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,410
It's me.

17
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,710

18
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,400

[Lord's Residence]

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,870
This matter has been resolved.

22
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,760
It's all thanks to the great help from Master Xie and Lady Cui.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
So,

24
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,770
I'd like to entrust the management of the Eight Gates in the state

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,130
to Master Xie.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,190
As for Lady Cui,

27
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,260
she will continue to manage Shenyin Sect.

28
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,040
Please forgive me,

29
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,030
but I cannot accept.

30
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,320
In fact, to the world,

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,910
I am already a dead man.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,460
Moreover, what I have always longed for

33
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,370
is a life like that of a free-spirited hermit.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Titles

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
and status

36
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,750
mean nothing to me.

37
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,630
I believe Xiaojing feels the same way.

38
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,500
I hope you will understand.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,150
What a matched couple.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Good.

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,960
Good.

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,880
Well,

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,110
I shall grant your wish.

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,500
Today,

46
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,600
Xiu, Xiaojing, and I

47
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,180
are leaving Tianshu State together.

48
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,150
You all

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,560
must take good care of this home for me.

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes.

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,870
Master.

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,680
Actually, we all don't want you to leave.

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,290
So young, yet already so nostalgic.

54
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,230
You should now think about marrying a woman

55
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,300
and settling down.

56
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,870
And all of you

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
should do the same.

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,070
Do you hear me?

59
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,820
Yes, Young Master.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,269
Young Master,

61
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,160
I have one more thing to say to you.

62
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,630
Go ahead.

63
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,240
I just found out

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,660
that your amnesia was actually a change of person.

65
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,900
Although we didn't spend much time together,

66
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,260
all of us

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,600
really like you.

68
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,390
Yes, Young Master.

69
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes.

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,860
We all hate to see you go.

71
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,270
Till next time.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,310
Let's go.

73
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,230
Chen.

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
It seems Father

75
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,980
is still grieving over Lu Chen's death.

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,030
Speaking of which,

77
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,170
how did Lu Chen die?

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
You haven't told me yet.

79
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,010
Help.

80
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Help.

81
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,860
So,

82
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,120
you disguised as Lu Chen

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,830
to help that woman escape among the guests.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,960
There are too many servants in the Lu family.

85
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,500
It's easy for me to escape alone.

86
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,230
But taking her with me

87
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,660
would complicate things.

88
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,630
Moreover, that woman is truly pitiful.

89
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
She must have been

90
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,880
violated by Lu Chen.

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,190
What a despicable man.

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,240
His death

93
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,730
is just karma for his evil deeds.

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Come to think of it,

95
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,830
Yu Xiaolin is indeed quite pitiful.

96
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,250
Yu Xiaolin is the Young Lord himself.

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,040
Although the Lord set up a trap,

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,430
whether to fall into it or not

99
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,040
is his own choice.

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,830
If it were me,

101
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,560
I would certainly choose to be a carefree Young Lord,

102
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,409
never getting involved in this mess.

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,230
There are three copies of this booklet,

104
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,070
each acquired with great difficulty.

105
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,330
I suppose it was the old lord

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,390
who wanted to persuade him to stop.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,610
Indeed,

108
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,140
obsession leads to action, and action leads to entanglement.

109
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,040
Besides,

110
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,140
the ways of the world are not

111
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,920
something you and I can fully comprehend.

112
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,890
As long as we do our best,

113
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,560
we can be at peace with ourselves.

114
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,000
Right?

[Three months later]

116
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,120
You made me come here early in the morning so mysteriously

117
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,560
and even had me wear a green outfit,

118
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,370

123
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,970
I'm not very clever,
