00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,970
[Young Lord's Mansion]

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Master Lu.

5
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,260
Aren't you curious why I invited you to my residence?

6
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,660
Young Lord, you also know

7
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,870
that I haven't been in business for many years.

8
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,720
With so many comings and goings with these shops,

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,710
how could I possibly know everything?

10
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,530
All I know is

11
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,590
that you are

12
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,970
one of the most prominent figures in the city.

13
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,220
I trust you wouldn't do anything rash.

14
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,070
Like father, like son, indeed.

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,590
So, Master Lu,

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,410
you're trying to put me in my place, aren't you?

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,080
Father!

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,760
-Chen!
-Father.

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,259
Here's what you wanted.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,759
Let my father go now!

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,850
Mr. Lu, how can I know if what you have

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,850
is real or fake?

23
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,800
The fact that I've returned

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,170
shows that I'm still willing to cooperate with you, Young Lord.

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,030
Take it

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,830
and let my father go immediately!

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,250
I hope this fake booklet

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,070
can hold up for a while longer.

29
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,680
Good.

30
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,080
Very good.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,310
Had I known how much you cared about Master Lu,

32
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,760
I wouldn't have gone to such trouble.

33
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,710
The Lord has arrived!

34
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,670
Lord, to what do we owe the honor

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,829
of your sudden visit?

36
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,120
You may rise.

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,120
Xiaolin.

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,390
I just returned from hunting

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,680
and happened to be passing by.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,329
I thought

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,550
it'd been a long time since we last met,

42
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,079
so I came over for a chat.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Mr. Lu.

44
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,400
You're here too.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,120
Lord,

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,320
I came to the Young Lord's mansion to deliver tea to him.

47
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,030
Now that the goods has been delivered,

48
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,040
my father and I will take our leave.

49
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,440
You can't leave!

50
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,320
Because you're not Lu Chen at all.

51
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,360
What...

52
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,150
What... What...

53
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,470
What's going on here?

54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,800
Father,

55
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,460
no,

56
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,170
Master Lu, I...

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,079
Lord.

58
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,460
This man is Xie Tianxing,

59
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,030
the notorious Commoner Thief in the martial arts world.

60
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,050
He's committed all sorts of crimes and atrocities.

61
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,100
He took advantage of his resemblance to Mr. Lu

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,130
to take his place.

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,620
His intentions are despicable.

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
That's not the truth.

65
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,870
In fact, from the very beginning, he...

66
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,710
If it wasn't you...

67
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,750
then who killed Mr. Lu?

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,420
What are you all standing there for?

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,350
Seize this criminal at once

70
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,020
and await judgment.

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,270
Xiu...

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,120
You...

73
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,750
You are my Xiu.

74
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,480
Xiu.

75
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,700
He... he is my Xiu!

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,520
Xiu...

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,380
I failed to carry out the task

78
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,440
and couldn't bring back the booklet.

79
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,740
Please punish me, Young Lord.

80
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,250
You've known him for a long time, right?

81
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,580
No.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
If that were the case,

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,360
I would have reported it to you early on.

84
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,070
I only found out about it at the Shenyin Sect.

85
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,750
Such a beautiful face.

86
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,500
Such a deceitful tongue.

87
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,830
Lu Chen might be bewitched by beauty,

88
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,240
but Xie Tianxing might not be.

89
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,340
If you weren't old acquaintances,

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,770
why would he risk exposure

91
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,750
by asking me to let you go?

92
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,890
Indeed, nothing escapes your eyes.

93
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,360
But does it truly matter

94
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,700
when I met him?

95
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,620
Young Lord, don't you always care about results,

96
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,690
not the process?

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,970
You still have a way to get the booklet?

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,430
Yes.

99
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,040
As long as you

100
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,420
hand over Xie Tianxing to me.

101
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,570
Brother Xie.

102
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,720
I've come to see you.

103
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,590
Look,

104
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,900
I've brought you your favorite osmanthus wine.

105
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,690
Does it hurt?

106
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,810
Do you know how many times

107
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,140
I've been whipped like this

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,160
over these years?

109
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,240
Brother Xie,

110
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,290
look.

111
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,250
My skin is smooth.

112
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,110
There's not a single scar.

113
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,640
Do you know why?

114
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,630
In the brothels,

115
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,650
they raise a kind of parasitic worm called the Ice Skin Worm.

116
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,500
It eats away at your wounds,

117
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,830
but every bite...

118
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,909
makes you wish you were dead.

119
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,770
I'm already dying.

120
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,870
Just give me a quick death.

121
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,480
But I don't really want you to die!

122
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,740
Brother Xie.

123
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,880
Come away with me, won't you?

124
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
As long as you're willing,

125
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,690
I can...

126
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,270
I won't go with you.

127
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,720
I won't.

128
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,680
How dare you still come here?

129
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,740
Release Tianxing.

130
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,560
If I remember correctly,

131
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,050
Master Xie is the murderer who killed Mr. Lu.

132
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,120
Why would you plead for him?

133
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,000
Unless...

134
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,670
you were his accomplice.

135
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
What if I trade the booklet for him?

136
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,430
[To the Execution Officer]

137
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,400
[Something is off. Suspend the execution.]

138
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
Xie Tianxing is already dead,

139
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,970
and the booklet is also in your hands, Young Lord.

140
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,650
You're still one step ahead.
