[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,520
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,590
Commoner Swordsman.

4
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,870
How about I call you Brother Xie?

5
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,960
Whatever works.

6
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,789
Since both are fine wines

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,800
and Brother Xie likes them both,

8
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,300
why don't we drink both together?

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Give that back to me.

10
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,390
He’s still alive.

11
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,000
There’s no need to mourn prematurely.

12
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,440
What did you say?

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,160
Brother Xie is still alive?

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Last night, two thieves broke into the mansion.

15
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,670
One of them used

16
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,870
the Lingxiu Point technique.

17
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,480
Tell me,

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,520
besides that Brother Xie of yours,

19
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,350
who else could it be?

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,120
That's great.

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,560
He's still alive.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,720
I wonder if you would

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,200
still be so happy if you knew he appeared to save

24
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,110
his beloved woman, Cui Xiaojing?

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,640
It's her again.

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Why is it her again?

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,200
Don't be angry.

28
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,850
I came here

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
to give you a chance

30
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,870
to personally break them up.

31
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,590
To think it was Lord who saved you

32
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,250
and even sent you to steal the booklet.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,240
Actually,

34
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,980
it wasn’t entirely because of Lord.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,260
I used to think that

36
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,450
as long as I lived freely on my own,

37
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,290
that was enough.

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,280
I'd help those in need when I came across them.

39
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,440
But later,

40
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,610
after being with you, I realized

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,520
two people can do much more together.

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,040
I wasn't planning to tell you I was still alive

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
because I was afraid of I'd get you into trouble.

44
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,930
But now...

45
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,990
♫Following the path you've walked♫

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,060
♫Through the cracks, across the tides of time♫

47
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,370
♫Resting gently in your hand♫

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,339
♫Awaiting the break of dawn♫

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,760
What's wrong?

50
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,960
Xiaojing,

51
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,220
the last time we were in the dungeon,

52
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,159
you said that Master Lu acknowledged me.

53
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,080
What did you mean?

54
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,000
You still don't know?

55
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
I only know that Master Lu called me Xiu'er,

56
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,920
but...

57
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,120
It's just as you suspect.

58
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,900
He is indeed your biological father.

59
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,730
And your name is Lu Xiu.

60
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,160
Lu Xiu...

61
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,160
When I was a child, I often dreamed of

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,480
someone who looked exactly like me

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,360
pushing me into the river.

64
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,130
I always thought those dreams were absurd,

65
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,460
but I never imagined they were real.

66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,880
According to the information Master received,

67
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,890
he did indeed push you into the river.

68
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,030
He even bribed a fortune teller

69
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,940
to say that you two couldn't grow up together,

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
or else one of you would surely meet misfortune.

71
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,000
He really...

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,960
Tianxing,

73
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
justice will prevail in the end.

74
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,530
Perhaps his death before you

75
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,690
was his retribution.

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,920
Xiaojing.

77
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,010
When all of this is over,

78
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,950
let's take Father and leave this place.

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,520
Alright.

80
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,760
You go ahead.

81
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
Aren't you going in to see your father?

82
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,760
No.

83
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,080
The less

84
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,760
Father knows about my affairs, the safer he'll be.

85
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,650
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

86
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,660
But I still feel uneasy.

87
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,630
How about now?

88
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,800
Who gave you permission to kiss m—

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
You're allowed to kiss me,

90
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,240
but I'm not allowed to kiss you?

91
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm leaving.

92
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,960
How dare you come here again!

93
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,580
I even dared to kill your Master.

94
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,460
What wouldn’t I dare to do?

95
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
I failed to retrieve the booklet last night.

96
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
And I reunited with Xiaojing to save someone.

97
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,550
Please punish me, Lord.

98
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,970
Master Xie, you're not a reckless person.

99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
I trust your judgement.

100
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,800
Rise.

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
But this mission has failed.

102
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,830
It must have alerted our enemies.

103
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
I'm afraid Young Lord Yu is now prepared.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
Master Xie, proceed with peace of mind.

105
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,120
Tonight, I will find a way to distract Xiaolin.

106
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,720
Understood.

107
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,210
I almost forgot about you.

108
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,160
Xiaojing.

109
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,880
Why are you here?

110
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,560
It's dangerous.

111
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,280
Come with me.

112
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,720
Xiaojing.

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,340
You...

114
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
As expected,

115
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,770
the smarter a person is,

116
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,430
the more complicated their thoughts become.

117
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,880
Brother Xie,

118
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,280
I told you.

119
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,490
She will only hurt you.

120
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,200
Yunyun.

121
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,000
How should I praise you?

122
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,760
Your schemes work brilliantly every time.

123
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,680
As long as the goal is clear enough,

124
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,960
and the hatred is deep enough,

125
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,460
anything can be done.

126
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Brother Xie,

127
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,700
why do you still not hurt her after she did that to you?

128
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,950
Because what she's doing now

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
is not of her own will.

130
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
If she truly loved you,

131
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,930
she wouldn't have been bewitched by the Heart-Piercing Powder.

132
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,920
Sun Yunyun,

133
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,680
I've never regretted saving someone so much in my life.

134
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,710
You can stop now.

135
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,850
Young Lord Yu never acts without purpose.

136
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,720
Tell me.

137
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,410
What exactly do you want?

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,520
I would like to ask Master Xie

139
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,160
to do me a favor.
