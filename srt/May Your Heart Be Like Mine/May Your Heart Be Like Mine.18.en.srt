[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,360
[Episode 18]

3
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,640
Master,

4
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,710
I've got the booklet.

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,710
Good.

6
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,840
Wait!

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,560
Tianxing,

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,710
what are you doing here?

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,789
Greetings, Sect Master.

10
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,850
I can't hand this booklet over to you.

11
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,890
Master Lu has been captured by Yu Xiaolin's men.

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,390
I need this booklet to exchange for his release.

13
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,760
What?

14
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,160
This matters a lot.

15
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,840
Yu Xiaolin has been scheming to get his hands on the booklet.

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,570
It must not fall into his hands.

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Otherwise,

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,110
the world will plunge into chaos.

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,750
The lives of the people in the world are important,

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,640
but the life of one person isn't?

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,420
Xiaojing, believe me.

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,410
I will bring back both the person and the booklet.

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,880
Miss Yunyun.

24
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,040
Miss Yunyun.

25
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,750
Guards!

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,470
Lock them up.

27
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,990
Yes.

28
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,990
Master, why did you take Tianxing away?

29
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,660
It's none of your business.

30
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,030
I will handle

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,590
the matters from now on.

32
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,240
I...

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
Senior,

34
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,650
don't blame Master.

35
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,380
She's only thinking of the greater good.

36
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,320
You should rest here for now.

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,590
I'm not trying to scare you.

38
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,200
I really want to set you guys free.

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,400
Please get up.

40
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,940
If I win,

41
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,840
you must not only release my wife

42
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,630
but also not harm Miss Yunyun.

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,320
The lives of the people in the world are important,

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,280
but the life of one person isn't?

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,430
Xiaojing,

46
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,150
believe me.

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,460
I will bring back both the person and the booklet.

48
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,190
Tianxing was right.

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
The lives of the people in the world are important,

50
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,560
but the life of one person is too.

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,680
Master is also afraid that if the booklet falls into Yu Xiaolin's hands,

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
it will harm the common people.

53
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,750
If I talk to her properly

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,800
and find a way to protect the booklet,

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,430
she will surely understand my and Tianxing's urgency to save Master Lu

56
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,000
and might even give me the booklet.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Master,

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,040
do you really not plan to tell Senior about this?

59
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,670
You've seen it too.

60
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,180
That day, she put herself in danger for Xie Tianxing.

61
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,180
Today, she almost forgot the Sect's rules.

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,310
If she were to find out

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,270
that Lu Qingxuan is Xie Tianxing's biological father,

64
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,030
who knows what she might do?

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,720
From now on, all the household matters

66
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,430
will be managed by Wan'er.

67
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,540
No matter how delicious this food and wine are,

68
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,320
it's not as pleasing as

69
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,320
holding my grandson.

70
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,240
The men of our Lu family

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,140
must be loyal to one woman for life.

72
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,970
Miss Yunyun,

73
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,000
are you alright?

74
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,810
Why are there no guards?

75
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,600
Xiaojing?

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,670
The sleeping drug only lasts for one incense stick's time.

77
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,730
Come with me.

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,270
Tianxing.

79
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,580
What's wrong?

80
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,020
You're right.

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
Everyone's life is important.

82
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,070
Even a single life cannot be sacrificed.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,310
Wait for me here.

84
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,040
I'll go get the booklet.

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,360
Let's go save Master Lu.

86
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,050
But if we do that,

87
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,590
you...

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,120
Wouldn't you be betraying your sect?

89
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,270
No.

90
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,520
I believe

91
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,570
you can save Master Lu

92
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,010
and protect the booklet as well.

93
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,710
♫A sudden encounter stirs the heartstrings♫

94
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,480
♫The east wind makes our red threads intertwined♫

95
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:01,970
♫In the glow of red candles, a glance spans eternity♫

96
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,310
♫Silent, we hold our secrets close♫

97
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,240
♫Hearts flutter in that fleeting gaze♫

98
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,430
I'll wait for you.

99
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,500
♫The year the crabapple bloomed, memories linger sweet♫

100
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,000
♫Tonight, beneath the full moon, can you see my love?♫

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,000
♫Does your heart mirror my deepest wish?♫

102
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,000
♫Let fate's twists scatter the stars♫

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,260
♫An amulet lock guards cherished ties♫

104
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,810
I'll be back.

105
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:41,450
♫Despite the twists and turns of life, we remain bound♫

106
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,360
♫A single lantern lights the shadow of the past♫

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,100
♫Flowers fade, and people change♫

108
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,159
♫You know my heart, and we'll journey through life under one umbrella♫

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,410
Master usually keeps important items by the bedside.

110
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Tianxing, I'm coming.

111
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,750
Why hasn't Xiaojing returned yet?

112
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,830
Sect Master, please listen to me.

113
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,670
If you come back with me,

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
I will spare your life.

115
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,070
I'm afraid I can't comply.

116
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,270
No!

117
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,580
No!

118
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,600
No!

119
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,790
Master.

120
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,900
Master.

121
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,500
Master.

122
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,870
Master.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,550
Master.

124
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,770
Master.

125
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,360
Master.

126
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,050
Master.

127
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
Master.

128
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,260
Master.

129
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,020
Master.

130
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,030
Master, wake up!

131
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,740
Master.

132
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,670
Xiaojing.

133
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,440
Master!

134
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,750
I...

135
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,390
Master!
