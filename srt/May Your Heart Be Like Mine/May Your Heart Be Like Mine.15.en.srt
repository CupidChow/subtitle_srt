[Episode 15]

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,520
Mrs. Lu!

4
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,280
Come here and take a look.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,170
Is this the Marsdenia longipes?

6
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,330
Where is it?

7
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,560
-Where is it?
-Here.

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,050
Yes.

9
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,230
I'll go and pick it.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,960
Be careful.

11
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,590
Mrs. Lu!

12
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,450
Give me your hand.

13
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,120
You won't be able to apply any force like this.

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,590
Give me the herb.

15
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,190
Help!

16
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,890
Mrs. Lu!

17
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,820
Help!

18
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,880
Don't worry.

19
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll take good care of Brother Xie.

20
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,000
No!

21
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,840
No.

22
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,810
Brother Xie, you finally woke up.

23
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,750
Your pulse is stable.

24
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,340
The remaining toxins have been cleared.

25
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,640
Where am I?

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,829
I'm not sure either.

27
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,970
After you fainted,

28
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,510
Mrs. Lu brought you here.

29
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,690
The people here

30
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
call her...

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,440
Xiaojing.

32
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,010
Xiaojing?

33
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,920
I have some extra food.

34
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,870
If you don't mind,

35
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,160
you can have it.

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,160
Xiaojing, it's time to go.

37
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,130
Coming.

38
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,080
Xiaojing?

39
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,940
Turns out she's Xiaojing.

40
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,180
Where's Xiaojing?

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,430
Where did she go?

42
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
The poison in your body has just cleared.

43
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,970
Your body is still weak.

44
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,230
You still need to rest.

45
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,050
Did something happen to her?

46
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,600
Say something!

47
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,670
Where did she go?

48
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Brother Xie,

49
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,190
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,220
I failed to protect Mrs. Lu.

51
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,950
Yesterday, I went with her to find the Marsdenia longipes,

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,520
and she accidentally

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
fell off a cliff.

54
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,820
I tried my best to save her,

55
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,270
but...

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,600
What did you say?

57
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,480
It's impossible.

58
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,740
How could she...

59
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,700
She...

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,690
It's impossible.

61
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,830
She's so skilled in martial arts.

62
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,380
No.

63
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,720
I have to find her.

64
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
I have to save her.

65
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I have to find her.

66
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,840
I have to find her!

67
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,470
Your poison has just been cleared.

68
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,310
How are you going to find her?

69
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,890
Let go of me!

70
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,100
Brother Xie!

71
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,120
I also went to find herbs.

72
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,750
I also got injured.

73
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,300
Why can't you stay for me?

74
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,850
I love Xiaojing.

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,250
How could I bear to give up on her?

76
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,470
Xiaojing!

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,510
Xiaojing!

78
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,600
Xiaojing!

79
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
Xiaojing!

80
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,410
♫A sudden encounter stirs the heartstrings♫

81
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,180
♫The east wind makes our red threads intertwined♫

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,659
♫In the glow of red candles, a glance spans eternity♫

83
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,090
Xiaojing!

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,010
♫Silent, we hold our secrets close♫

85
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,250
Xiaojing!

86
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,940
♫Hearts flutter in that fleeting gaze♫

87
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,200
♫The year the crabapple bloomed, memories linger sweet♫

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,700
♫Tonight, beneath the full moon, can you see my love?♫

89
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,700
♫Does your heart mirror my deepest wish?♫

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,700
♫Let fate's twists scatter the stars♫

91
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,690
♫Flowers fade, and people change♫

92
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,320
♫You know my heart, and we'll journey through life under one umbrella♫

93
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,540
She should be right around here.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,150
Why can't I find her?

95
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,560
Tianxing,

96
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm here.
