[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,290
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,430
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,790
I still woke you up.

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,120
It's okay.

6
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,700
Did you find anything?

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
But there's one thing

8
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,200
I need to confirm.

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,510
Xiaobao.

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:22,920
Over here.

11
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,640
Young Master.

12
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,560
Young Madam.

13
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,140
What are you doing in the pavilion in the middle of the night?

14
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,820
Nothing much.

15
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,300
I have something to ask you.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,750
Do you remember the important thing you once told me?

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
I've told you many things.

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,990
How would I know which one?

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,460
It was when I just lost my memory.

20
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,039
You told me

21
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,479
about my past habits.

22
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,780
I remember now.

23
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,060
I said you were delicate and precious,

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,840
extremely particular.

25
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,759
Even your bathwater was spring water carried from the mountains by servants.

26
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,200
It's not that.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,229
You were skilled in business,

28
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,310
-You are fair and just...
-That’s not it.

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,540
I said you were

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,430
extremely filial.

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,580
You recently renovated the ancestral hall

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,450
and even had a custom urn made for your younger brother.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,920
Stop.

34
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,250
I understand now.

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,230
Alright.

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,500
You can go back to sleep now.

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,560
What have you found out?

38
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,610
Have you seen anything in Lu Chen's journal

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,120
about him mentioning his brother?

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,280
No.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,500
For someone who values family so much,

42
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,490
there's not a single word about his brother in the journal.

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,500
So you're saying

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,880
he wasn't close to his brother at all.

45
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,500
Therefore,

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,570
renovating the ancestral hall so extensively

47
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,680
is very suspicious.

48
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,430
That's right.

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,980
Let's split up and search.

50
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,020
[Beloved Son, Lu Xiu]

51
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,800
Brother.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,840
Go away!

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm not your brother.

54
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,700
Xiu..

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,480
What's wrong?

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,750
It's nothing.

57
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,840
I just suddenly have a headache.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,160
Why can't I move?

59
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,710
I never thought Lu Chen

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,930
would hide the booklet here.

61
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,240
Finally found it.

62
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,160
I'll take it back to my master.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,610
Okay.

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,150
I can't believe you actually found the golden booklet.

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
It seems we need the Young Lord to step in.

66
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,360
Chen.

67
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,930
Why did you

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,920
suddenly want to drink with me today?

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,120
Father,

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,590
I'm ashamed to say,

71
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,150
since I married Wan'er,

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,680
I've either been busy accompanying her

73
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,600
or busy with business.

74
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,000
I've neglected you.

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,040
It was Wan'er who reminded me today

76
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,390
that I finally remembered.

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,820
Father,

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll punish myself with a drink first.

79
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Wan'er.

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,740
You're the thoughtful one.

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,870
But I

82
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,050
understand these.

83
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,820
You're newlyweds,

84
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,070
naturally sweet and loving.

85
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,750
No matter how fragrant this wine and food is,

86
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,100
it's not as sweet as

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,680
holding my grandson.

88
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,270
Father.

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,990
It's too early to talk about this.

90
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,650
Let's drink first.

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,600
Come on.

92
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,830
Let's drink.

93
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,220
Finally found it.

94
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,460
I'll take it back to my master.

95
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,720
What's wrong?

96
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,360
You seem troubled.

97
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,070
Tell me.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
Are we leaving?

99
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,530
Since the matter is settled,

100
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,680
we naturally have to leave.

101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,210
After all,

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,280
we're not the real Lu Chen and Qiao Wan'er.

103
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,160
What's your concern?

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,310
I'm worried about Father.

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
No,

106
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,610
I mean Master Lu.

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Since I entered the household,

108
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,550
he has been truly kind to me.

109
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,750
But now that Lu Chen is dead,

110
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,750
if we just leave like this,

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't know if he can bear it.

112
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,320
Master Lu is indeed a good person.

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Once we hand over this booklet

114
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,780
to Shenyin Sect,

115
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,240
when Yu Xiaolin finds out,

116
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,230
he surely won't spare the Lu family.

117
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,830
You want to take him with us?

118
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,400
The situation is urgent now.

119
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,050
Explaining the matter of Lu Chen is too complicated.

120
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,580
He may not be willing to leave with us.

121
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,190
I've got it.

122
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,420
Young Master.

123
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,120
The master has already fallen asleep.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,440
Good.

125
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,040
Xiaobao,

126
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,760
take Miss Yunyun and my father to the suburban post station to wait for me.

127
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,510
Yes, Young Master.

128
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,430
Brother Xie.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,510
Will you come back?

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,750
I will.

131
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,190
Don't worry.

132
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,710
Take care of yourselves.

133
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,020
Go now.

134
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,200
Xiaojing, are you sure you don't want me to go with you?

135
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,419
Don't you know yet?

136
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,630
Master doesn't like outsiders going to Shenyin Sect.

137
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,270
Alright.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,870
Then tomorrow at 7 p.m.,

139
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,240
if you haven't returned,

140
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,390
I'll come looking for you.

141
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,630
Okay.

142
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,790
Be careful on your way.

143
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,280
Wait for me to come back.

144
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,960
Why is time passing so slowly?

145
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,150
Could it be

146
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,370
that this is what they mean by "a day apart feels like three autumns"?

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,150
It's still one, two, three hours

148
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,690
until 7 p.m....

149
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Brother Xie!

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,130
Miss Yunyun.

151
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,920
Why have you returned?

152
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,550
Why are you in such a disheveled state?

153
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,330
We were almost at the relay station,

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,160
but suddenly a group of people appeared.

155
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,770
I recognized their martial arts style.

156
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,700
They were Young Lord Yu's men.

157
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,760
They kidnapped Master Lu.

158
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,040
And they said

159
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,630
if you want to save Master Lu,

160
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,540
you need to exchange it for some kind of booklet.

161
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,520
What?

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Booklet?

163
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,220
Wait here.

164
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,130
I'll be right back.

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,960
Master,

166
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,000
I've got the booklet.

167
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,340
[Golden Booklet]

168
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,200
Good.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,570
Wait!
