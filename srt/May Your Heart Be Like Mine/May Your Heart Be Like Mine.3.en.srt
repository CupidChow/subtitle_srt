1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,350
I've taught you for so long

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,940
to make you steal things,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,600
not to help others.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,640
You show kindness to others,

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,510
but will they treat you the same?

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,280
If you come to terms with it, come back to find me.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,710
Don't waste your talent.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,190
Get lost, you stinking beggar!

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,230
No?

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,640
Move aside!

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,110
Get out of my way!

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,600
You little brat.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,200
Next time I see you, I'll kill you!

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,960
From now on,

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,640
I'd rather betray the world

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,610
than let the world betray me!

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,000
I have some extra food.

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,430
If you don't mind, you can have it.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,950
Xiaojing, it's time to go.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,840
Coming.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,900
Take this umbrella too.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,230
If you encounter any difficulties,

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,760
come to Tianshu State and find me.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,920
My name is Cui Xiaojing.

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,890
Master,

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,200
you were wrong.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,960
Someone will show kindness to me.

28
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,130
[May your heart be like mine]

29
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,880
[Episode 3]

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,710
Father, please have some tea.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,240
Wan'er,

32
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,840
our Chen is careless.

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,630
If he ever mistreats you,

34
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,000
you must tell me.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,430
I will certainly stand up for you.

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,020
Thank you, Father.

37
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,240
Chen, now that we have some free time,

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
let's go to the count room together.

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,460
Now that you're married,

40
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,400
from now on, all the household affairs

41
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,200
will be managed by Wan'er.

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,150
Managed by...

43
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,950
her?

44
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,180
If you don't let her manage,

45
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,060
are you planning to let Miss Rong manage instead?

46
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,530
I'm not.

47
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,990
Alright then, let's go.

48
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,170
Lead the way.

49
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,490
Young Master.

50
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,710
The keys.

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,420
Why are there so many keys?

52
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,660
Chen.

53
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,670
Open the door.

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,960
Did you forget which key it is?

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,790
I didn't.

56
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm Commoner Swordsman.

57
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,020
I never use keys to open doors.

58
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,120
It's open.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,750
So many books?

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,190
How do I know which one is the account book?

61
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,480
Honey, are you reluctant?

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
Hurry up and give it to her.

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,570
Xiaobao.

64
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,350
What are you waiting for?

65
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,190
Get the account book.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,070
Do you want me, your young master, to get it myself?

67
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,080
Honey, here.

68
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,310
Honey, don't worry.

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,940
I will definitely manage the accounts thoroughly.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,870
The records for these years are all here.

71
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,600
If this continues, it will be exposed sooner or later.

72
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,720
I must find it as soon as possible.

73
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,920
There aren't many places in the Lu residence to hide things.

74
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,940
Why can't I find it?

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,560
Where on earth did Lu Chen hide the booklet?

76
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,240
You bumped into me!

77
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,110
I bumped into you?

78
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,140
What's your attitude?

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,280
I know you are the Young Madam of the Lu family.

80
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,490
But I'm pregnant

81
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,970
with the Lu family's eldest grandson.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,610
What? Are you scared now?

83
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,630
Let me tell you the truth.

84
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,280
Mr. Lu married you

85
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,240
only because of your childhood engagement.

86
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,970
He had no choice.

87
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,390
He doesn't love you.

88
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,190
And among all the women he has,

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm the only one who's pregnant.

90
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,660
It's enough to show that I'm his true love.

91
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,270
Why are you laughing?

92
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,770
I'm laughing at your naivety.

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,390
If you were his true love,

94
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,860
he wouldn't have married someone else,

95
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,510
and there wouldn't be any other women.

96
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,190
So, since there are,

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
how sincere can this love be?

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,040
This Qiao Wan'er is surprisingly insightful.

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,940
It's really a shame that she married Lu Chen.

100
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,560
Everyone in Qinghe Town knows

101
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,680
that the Qiao family has fallen from grace.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,070
You shamelessly married into the family.

103
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,190
Let me tell you,

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,159
if it weren't for you,

105
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,390
I would be Mrs. Lu.

106
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,870
Don't go!

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,710
Mr. Lu!

108
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,480
Honey?

109
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,560
Doctor,

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
how is Chen?

111
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,250
Master Lu,

112
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,630
the young master's pulse is very steady.

113
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,190
He should be fine.

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
It's just...

115
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,300
Doctor,

116
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,070
since you said the young master is fine,

117
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,210
-why is it that when I pinch him so hard,
-It hurts!

118
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,030
he doesn't react at all?

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Well...

120
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,159
Your grip is really strong.

121
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,060
Mr. Lu.

122
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Master, he's awake.

123
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,310
Chen,

124
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,680
are you alright?

125
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,080
Honey,

126
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,190
are you alright?

127
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,660
Mr. Lu, I didn't do it on purpose just now.

128
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,760
Who are you?

129
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,500
Take care, doctor.

130
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,490
If Lu Chen really has amnesia,

131
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,400
no one will know where the booklet is.

132
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
The doctor said that

133
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,150
once the blood stasis clears, he will regain his memory.

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,840
How long will it take, Father?

135
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,700
A few days at best,

136
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,720
or a year or more at worst.

137
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,000
A year or more?

138
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,880
No. I...

139
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,850
Wan'er, I know you're worried about Chen.

140
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,200
Actually, I heard of a secret recipe before

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,510
that can open the meridians, directly targeting the brain,

142
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,390
with the hope of bringing him back to his senses.

143
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,650
But...

144
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
Tell me, Father.

145
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,480
What's this recipe?

146
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,640
No matter what the cost,

147
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,910
I must cure my husband.

148
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,770
Does Qiao Wan'er really like Lu Chen that much?

149
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,150
How come I didn't realize it before?

150
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,930
I must praise myself

151
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,300
for coming up with this idea of pretending to have amnesia.

152
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,610
Oh, right, Xiaobao.

153
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,090
I have something to ask you.

154
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,210
What can I do for you, Young Master?

155
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,590
Now that I have amnesia,

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,540
I have no memory of my past habits.

157
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,790
Can you tell me what kind of person I am?

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,750
Young Master, you are delicate and precious,

159
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,670
and extremely picky.

160
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,630
The water you normally use for bathing

161
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,080
is mountain spring water that the servants fetch early in the morning.

162
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,440
Also,

163
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,790
your clothes are all custom-made at Jinxiu Pavilion,

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,630
and even the fabric is...

165
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,630
Extravagant

166
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,120
and indulgent.

167
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,030
Young Master,

168
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,080
I didn't mean it.

169
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,780
It's alright.

170
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm not angry.

171
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,930
Don't just talk about these material things.

172
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,080
Tell me about my family.

173
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,510
Young Master, you are... very filial

174
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,480
and value family.

175
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,420
Every year on your father's birthday,

176
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,550
you hold a grand celebration.

177
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,900
By the way, recently, you even repaired the ancestral hall

178
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,920
and had a custom-made urn for your younger brother.

179
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Young Master...

180
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Did I say something wrong again?

181
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,500
No,

182
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,530
I shouldn't have placed my hopes on you.

183
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,200
Never mind, I'll go and take a bath first.

184
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,390
Young Master!

185
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,710
Why does this water taste a bit sweet?

186
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,150
Honey?
