[Episode 5]

00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,880
[Rouge Shop]

4
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,390
Master,

5
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,560
I've been at the Lu mansion for days,

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
but I still haven't made any progress with the booklet.

7
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,430
Lu Chen has also lost his memory.

8
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,660
Here.

9
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,789
Mrs. Lu.

10
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,789
Mrs. Lu.

11
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,039
Young Lord Yu invites you to his mansion for tea.

12
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,570
Yu Xiaolin?

13
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,720
Mrs. Lu, please.

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,009
Young Master,

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,199
did you really dismiss all the tea maids?

16
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,300
How are we going to explain this to Young Lord Yu, Young Master?

17
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,500
Young Master.

18
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,820
Young Master.

19
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,079
This was sent by someone from Young Lord Yu's residence.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,280
Young Lord Yu, what do you mean by this?

21
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,090
Mrs. Lu, you are indeed extraordinary.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,710
Suddenly being invited away,

23
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,510
yet showing no sign of fear.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Young Lord Yu, you are the younger brother of the lord,

25
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,780
and you have known my husband for a long time.

26
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,520
I don't think you will give me any trouble.

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,280
So why should I be afraid?

28
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,600
Mrs. Lu, I'm afraid you don't remember.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,470
Your appearance

30
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,840
just happened to ruin the business between Mr. Lu and me.

31
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,900
Tell me,

32
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,850
how should I deal with you?

33
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,580
Business naturally has its ups and downs.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,910
There are partnerships and separations.

35
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,470
Besides,

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
how come I don't know

37
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,020
which legitimate business the teahouse has lost?

38
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,100
Good.

39
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,340
Very good.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,560
Mrs. Lu, you are indeed strong-willed.

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Wan'er.

42
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,660
Mr. Lu.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,110
If you want to see Mrs. Lu,

44
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,030
you must be blindfolded first.

45
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,690
Nice dance.

46
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,490
So beautiful.

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
Yun,

48
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,200
it seems Mr. Lu likes you very much.

49
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,110
I am grateful for Mr. Lu's favor.

50
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,870
Where is my wife?

51
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,820
Mr. Lu, you truly care about your wife.

52
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,330
Si Xuan.

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
He really came?

54
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:31,980
Wan'er.

55
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,580
Wan'er.

56
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,980
Are you alright?

57
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
Honey, I'm fine.

58
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,230
Young Lord Yu.

59
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,590
What are you doing?

60
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,190
Mr. Lu, you're a smart man.

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,950
You must know

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
the tea maids you withdrew

63
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,040
which means you've stopped doing business with me.

64
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,000
Naturally, I need an explanation.

65
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,010
But this has nothing to do with Wan'er.

66
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,180
It was my doing alone.

67
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,850
Mr. Lu, you truly take responsibility.

68
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,600
However, in our industry, there's a rule.

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
If you want to quit,

70
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,250
you must bear the consequences.

71
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,950
Unless...

72
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,020
You and I have a gamble.

73
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,190
If you win,

74
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,680
I'll let the matter drop.

75
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,490
But if you lose,

76
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,530
you'll have to do something for me.

77
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,820
Honey,

78
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,970
don't agree to his terms.

79
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,840
Don't worry.

80
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,920
Trust me.

81
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,950
I won't lose.

82
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,570
Alright.

83
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,610
Let's gamble then.

84
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,040
Come on.

85
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,170
Best two out of three. The rules are simple.

86
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,080
We each roll our own dice.

87
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,380
The lower number wins.

88
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,570
Mr. Lu, you go first.

89
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,050
One, one, two.

90
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,780
Mr. Lu, I won.

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,270
There's a punishment for losing here.

92
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,120
What are you going to do?

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,360
You!

94
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,530
Stop!

95
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,210
Stop!

96
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,290
Mr. Lu, calm down.

97
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,810
There's Moon-and-Sun Grass in this wine.

98
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,320
If you drink one cup,

99
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,170
at most it will drain some energy.

100
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
It's no big deal.

101
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,820
But if she drinks a second cup,

102
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,570
her internal organs

103
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,910
will turn into pus and blood.

104
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,030
Honey!

105
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,840
Honey.

106
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,170
I'm fine.

107
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
Don't lose your composure.

108
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,000
Again!

109
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,270
Wan'er.

110
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,190
For this second round,

111
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
I'll open first.

112
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,560
Wait.

113
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,600
My husband is not ready yet.

114
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,700
How can he open it?

115
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,270
Fine.

116
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,480
I'd like to see

117
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,250
what tricks he can come up with.

118
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,040
Honey,

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,690
I know you and Young Lord Yu are old family friends,

120
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,070
but now my life is at stake.

121
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,650
You can't go easy on him.

122
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,240
When you taught me to roll dice,

123
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,600
you told me that all efforts should be focused in one direction.

124
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,170
Use force in the wrist

125
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,030
to achieve a perfect roll.

126
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,580
Good thing Wan'er reminded me.

127
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,110
Let's open it.

128
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,160
It seems I'm a bit luckier.

129
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,250
You lost.

130
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,840
The rules of the game state

131
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,330
that the sum of all three dice counts.

132
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Why didn't you say that earlier?

133
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
Young Lord Yu, could it be

134
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,530
that you can't handle losing?

135
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,620
Fine.

136
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
Then this round goes to Mr. Lu.

137
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,930
But this won't happen again.

138
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,130
Come on, Mr. Lu.

139
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,430
Let's start the third round.

140
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,000
The final round.

141
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,290
Let's open it.

142
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,840
Wait.

143
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,520
Since it's the last round,

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,170
why don't we raise the stakes?

145
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,600
If I win,

146
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,950
you not only have to release my wife,

147
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,690
but also can't harm Miss Yun.

148
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,820
If I lose,

149
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,160
I'll additionally agree to do three things for you.

150
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,580
Mr. Lu, you truly care for the ladies.

151
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,880
Alright,

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I agree.

153
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,380
Come on,

154
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,190
let's open it.

155
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,070
Honey.

156
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,100
I know you have a strong sense of justice

157
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,530
and want to save me and Miss Yun.

158
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,450
If you really lose,

159
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,850
I won't blame you.

160
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,280
If I have to blame someone,

161
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
I'll blame Young Lord Yu for his incredible gambling skills,

162
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,850
always rolling three ones.

163
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,750
Wan'er is right.

164
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,160
I just need to prevent Young Lord Yu from rolling three ones.

165
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,860
Well then, Young Lord Yu,

166
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,190
you go first.

167
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,850
I'll go first?

168
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,870
It seems I'm a bit luckier.

169
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,850
I won.

170
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,280
You're too kind.

171
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
I hope you'll keep your word, Young Lord Yu.

172
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,630
Please release my wife.

173
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,970
And please don't harm Miss Yun.

174
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,260
Wan'er.

175
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,130
Be gentle...

176
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,240
Young Lord Yu.

177
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,560
What are you doing now?

178
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,630
Mr. Lu, please forgive me.

179
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,080
My subordinate,

180
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,220
seeing us turn against each other,

181
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,360
couldn't help but intervene.

182
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,410
Young Lord Yu, your words are tantamount to distancing yourself from this.

183
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,030
No.

184
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,900
Young Lord.

185
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,160
The lord requests your presence.

186
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,030
Mr. Lu,

187
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,790
today,

188
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,440
I originally wanted to invite you for tea

189
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,600
and a little gambling,

190
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,360

Let's call it a day.

192
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,080
Please feel free to come and play again, Mr. Lu.

193
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,790
Please.

194
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:10,960
Honey.

195
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,120
Are you alright?

196
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm fine.

197
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,160
What a coincidence, brother.
