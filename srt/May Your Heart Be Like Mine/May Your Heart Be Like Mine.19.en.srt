00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,290
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,470
Master.

4
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,390
Master!

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,480
Xiaojing.

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,870
-Master!
-I…

7
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,370
Xiaojing.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,680
I...

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,710
Why did you kill my master?

10
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:26,920
I...

11
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,860
Xiaojing,

12
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,100
how can you blame Brother Xie?

13
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,400
Your master attacked first just now.

14
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,210
Brother Xie was just trying to defend himself.

15
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,990
With your skills, if you were just trying to defend yourself,

16
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,009
she wouldn't have died.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,430
I had already gone to get the booklet

18
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,970
and agreed to go with you to save Master Lu.

19
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,680
Why did you kill my master?

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,910
Why?

21
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,850
Xiaojing, listen to me!

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,020
I didn't mean to kill your master.

23
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,160
Trust me.

24
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,340
That strike of mine didn't...

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,560
Brother Xie.

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,400
Why?

27
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,490
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,920
Master!

29
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,190
Master!

30
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,000
Senior,

31
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,940
what on earth happened?

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
You killed our master!

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,800
All disciples, listen to my command!

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,760
Attack!

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,310
Senior.

36
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,680
How could you?

37
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,240
Get lost!

38
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,090
I don't want to see you again.

39
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,160
Get lost!

40
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's go.

41
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,720
Xiaojing, trust me.

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,790
I will bring back both the person and the booklet.

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,550
I believe you can rescue Master Lu

44
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,730
and protect the booklet as well.

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,360
No!

46
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,950
Why did it turn out like this?

47
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,269
Brother Xie,

48
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,709
does it hurt?

49
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,120
I killed her master in front of her.

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,040
If I were in her shoes,

51
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,800
I might do the same.

52
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,930
You wouldn't.

53
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Besides,

54
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Yinniang kept pushing you.

55
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,040
To defend yourself, so you...

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,610
Yinniang had strong martial skills.

57
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,390
That strike of mine wasn't lethal.

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,070
Tell me.

59
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,350
Why didn't she dodge?

60
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,510
No matter what,

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,630
Xiaojing and you have known each other for a long time.

62
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,970
She knows what kind of person you are.

63
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,370
How could she hurt you without asking why?

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
Xiaojing's martial skills are not poor,

65
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
but when she went up the mountain with Miss Yunyun,

66
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,040
she fell off the cliff.

67
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,570
Miss Yunyun.

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,470
I'm a bit thirsty.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Can you go get me some water?

70
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,360
No problem.

71
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,900
Brother Xie, wait for me.

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,160
Brother Xie,

73
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,950
why are you following me?

74
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,720
Yinniang died

75
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,680
because of you, right?

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,350
Brother Xie,

77
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,010
is there some misunderstanding between us?

78
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,250
Misunderstanding?

79
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,190
She was highly skilled in martial arts.

80
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
My attack wasn't lethal.

81
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,159
How could she possibly be killed by that strike of mine?

82
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,659
It must have been this dart

83
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,400
that killed her.

84
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,600
Brother Xie, I...

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
Just tell me yes or no!

86
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,710
Yes.

87
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,750
But I did that

88
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,950
for you.

89
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,750
Ever since you saved me,

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,110
I've been in love with you.

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
When I was kidnapped again by those from the brothel,

92
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,170
I didn't choose to kill myself.

93
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,750
Because I believed you would come to save me again.

94
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,480
I've suffered so much

95
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,130
and undergone so much cruel training.

96
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,659
I survived all of that,

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,670
and I finally met you again.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,190
But why are you in love with someone else?

99
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,159
But what does that have to do with Yinniang?

100
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
If it weren't for her death,

101
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,560
you wouldn't have broken up with Cui Xiaojing.

102
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,230
No.

103
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,550
Brother Xie!

104
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,980
Cui Xiaojing doesn't want you anymore.

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,230
I can save Master Lu.

106
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,360
Come with me, okay?

107
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,720
You're unreasonable

108
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,920
and unrepentant!

109
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,360
Senior,

110
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,580
we're about to place Master in the coffin.

111
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,170
Go see her for the last time.

112
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,670
Master.

113
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,150
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,150
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,370
I'm sorry!

117
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,480
This is...

118
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,000
Master was poisoned.

119
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,660
So,

120
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,970
this is why she died.
