[May your heart be like mine]

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,360
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,750
There are only three days left

4
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,550
till the Nine Nights of Hell takes effect.

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,620
I don't know if I can find the booklet.

6
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,590
Why is it in the same position as yesterday?

7
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,620
Could it be that the Chiyan Powder

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,060
has neutralized its toxicity?

9
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,950
That's not right.

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,190
If so, this should have disappeared completely.

11
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,550
Looks like the toxicity...

12
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,030
has been suppressed.

13
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,330
Dear, what are you looking at?

14
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,830
I injured my arm a few days ago.

15
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,590
It's nothing.

16
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,110
What did your master say?

17
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,220
She...

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,220
Let's talk in our room.

19
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,539
If you hadn't discovered it,

20
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,470
I would still have been kept in the dark.

21
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,550
Master,

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,260
could it be that Miss Rong made a scene before

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,830
and Young Madam felt unhappy?

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,860
So she...

25
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,420
So she wouldn't consummate the marriage with Chen.

26
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,470
It was all a misunderstanding.

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,380
She has been driven away.

28
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,660
It made Wan'er upset.

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,220
It seems I'll have to help Chen myself.

30
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,500
Yeah.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,660
Cui'er,

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,620
go.

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,190
Go.

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,100
Yes, Master.

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,990
Hurry!

36
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,840
They're coming.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,410
Let's go!

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Let's go! Hurry!

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,500
Let's go.

40
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,540
Can you tell me now?

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,430
Master said you're the Commoner Swordsman.

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,220
Your reputation precedes you.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,540
You're someone we can trust.

44
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,690
If you're willing to help us,

45
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,000
that would be perfect.

46
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,310
I told you.

47
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,430
Working together

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,100
is certainly better than fighting alone.

49
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,220
But you have your own mission to accomplish.

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,030
So after we get the booklet,

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,710
Shenyin Sect can handle the transaction.

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,190
In that way, you won't be breaking your promise.

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,340
What do you think?

54
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,480
They can't be trusted.

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,780
But I should focus on finding the booklet now.

56
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,990
I can deal with the rest later.

57
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,990
Of course.

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,579
Why do I feel some tightness in my chest?

59
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,540
Why are you...

60
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,740
looking at me like that?

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,950
Nothing.

62
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,220
I suddenly feel a bit dizzy.

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,740
Be careful.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,980
♫A sudden encounter stirs the heartstrings♫

65
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,750
♫The east wind makes our red threads intertwined♫

66
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,930
Why did you hit me?

67
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,330
Why do you think?

68
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,230
♫In the glow of red candles, a glance spans eternity♫

69
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,580
♫Silent, we hold our secrets close♫

70
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,860
Why is this happening?

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,510
♫Hearts flutter in that fleeting gaze♫

72
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,540
I can't do this.

73
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,770
♫The year the crabapple bloomed, memories linger sweet♫

74
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,270
♫Tonight, beneath the full moon, can you see my love?♫

75
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,270
♫Does your heart mirror my deepest wish?♫

76
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,270
♫Let fate's twists scatter the stars♫

77
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,520
♫An amulet lock guards cherished ties♫

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,720
♫Despite the twists and turns of life, we remain bound♫

79
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,620
♫A single lantern lights the shadow of the past♫

80
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,370
♫Flowers fade, and people change♫

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:40,930
♫You know my heart, and we'll journey through life under one umbrella♫

82
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,750
♫Together, we'll marvel at the countless stars♫

83
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,950
Do you believe me now?

84
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
This fool.

85
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,270
Well done.

86
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,270
You'll be rewarded.

87
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,070
Thank you, Master.

88
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,490
What are you doing?

89
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,230
You're aware of what Master Lu did yesterday.

90
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,830
I don't want to go through that again.

91
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,260
So,

92
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,470
we'd better pretend to be a loving couple.

93
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,220
You're here.

94
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,130
The dishes are so spicy.

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,430
How am I supposed to eat them?

96
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,220
Dear,

97
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,400
you've worked hard.

98
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,390
Eat more.

99
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,340
Have some more.

100
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,600
Here.

101
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,820
Thank you, Honey.

102
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,650
I'm not hungry.

103
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,630
You should eat even though you're not hungry.

104
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,810
Enjoy the spiciness.

105
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,150
Wan'er,

106
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,270
here.

107
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,780
Try this.

108
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,030
This was made specially for you.

109
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,660
Thank you, Father.

110
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,070
This is not Red Dates and Lotus Seeds Soup.

111
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,860
This is called "May You Have a Baby Soon".

112
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,510
It's nutritious

113
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,630
and auspicious.

114
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,870
Last night,

115
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,539
you both were exhausted.

116
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,630
Thank you, Father.

117
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,059
I know

118
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,700
what you mean.

119
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,270
That's good then.

120
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,710
What do you know?

121
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,150
It's none of your business.

122
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,030
You and I have searched everywhere in Lu Residence,

123
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,300
but we still haven't found the booklet.

124
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,700
Now that Lu Chen is dead,

125
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,350
could it be that the killer took the booklet?

126
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,660
That's unlikely.

127
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,700
I saw Lu Chen that night.

128
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,910
His clothes were in perfect condition.

129
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,590
The room didn't look like it had been searched either.

130
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,270
It would have been impossible to find it

131
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,460
unless

132
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
that person knew exactly where it was.

133
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,350
Young Master!

134
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,580
Young Master.

135
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,390
What's up?

136
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,910
Today is Young Lord Yu's birthday celebration.

137
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,110
He specially sent an invitation letter to you and Young Madam.

138
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,870
Got it.

139
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,660
After what happened last time,

140
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,390
why would he still invite us?

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,420
He's up to no good.

142
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,050
We can't go.

143
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,760
Master once said

144
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,910
Young Lord Yu has a booklet.

145
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,110
I can take this opportunity to investigate.

146
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,220
Dear,

147
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,940
we should go.

148
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,910
Why?

149
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,350
Lu Chen was reluctant to hand over the booklet.

150
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,390
It must be because he was worried Yu Xiaolin would get rid of him after getting the booklet.

151
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,820
If we don't go this time,

152
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,370
it'd be like we're forcing him into taking extreme actions.

153
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,230
In that case,

154
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,060
we have no choice but to go.
