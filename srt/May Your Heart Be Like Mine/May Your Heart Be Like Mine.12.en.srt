00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,200
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,230
You little rascal.

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,030
Father.

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,430
Father.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,200
Why did you hit me?

7
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,010
You have the nerve to ask me?

8
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,880
We finally sent Miss Rong away,

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,850
and now here comes Miss Yunyun.

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,550
What are you up to?

11
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,640
Father,

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,560
please calm down.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,230
Listen to me.

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,400
What is there to say?

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,310
How many times have I told you?

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,539
The men of our Lu family

17
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,600
must be loyal to one woman for life.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,150
I've been a widower

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,280
for as long as your mother has been gone.

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,920
Wan'er,

21
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,700
help me explain.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,030
Explain what?

23
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,520
You indeed didn't discuss with me beforehand.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,450
That's not what you just said.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Oh, you.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,590
Father, Father,

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,770
I really don't intend to take a concubine.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,860
Miss Yunyun and I are old acquaintances.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,350
I saw she was in trouble,

30
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,430
so I gave her a hand.

31
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,000
I have no other intentions.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,000
You

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,710
just give up on the idea of taking a concubine.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,350
I...

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,310
Old man,

36
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,120
you won't accept me, huh?

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,960
Let's see how long you can keep this up.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,430
Miss Yunyun,

39
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,789
you're a guest.

40
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,000
How could we trouble you?

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,710
Have a seat.

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Wan'er,

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,710
have a seat.

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:16,960
Yes,

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,360
Father.

46
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,970
Miss Yunyun,

47
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,079
I heard from Chen that

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
you two are old acquaintances.

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,950
Then you are an honored guest of our Lu family.

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,920
Our family

51
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,470
treat our guests well.

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,770
Thank you, Master Lu.

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,880
I will try not to disturb you for too long.

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,710
Father,

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,800
let's eat.

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,590
I'm hungry.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,960
Come on.

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,610
Father.

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,030
The Lu family's dishes are usually quite spicy.

60
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,930
Why have they become sweet today?

61
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,870
This braised pork is delicious.

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,310
Sweet but not cloying.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,680
Rich but not greasy.

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,600
Madam Zhang,

65
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,360
your cooking skills have improved a lot these days.

66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,120
Look at these dishes,

67
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,079
they're not only exquisite

68
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,720
but also tasty.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
To be honest,

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,820
I accidentally hurt my hand

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
while cooking today.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,880
Actually, these dishes

73
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,950
were all kindly prepared by Miss Yunyun.

74
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,460
Miss Yunyun,

75
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,650
both the master and young master

76
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,560
are very satisfied with your cooking.

77
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,850
When you have time,

78
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,230
could you teach me some?

79
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm flattered, Madam Zhang.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,750
How could I compare to you?

81
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,530
It's just that Master Lu and Mr. Lu

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,440
are used to your cooking.

83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,710
Today they tried something new

84
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,050
and found it interesting.

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,840
Is it that delicious, honey?

86
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,220
You can't even hold your chopsticks steady.

87
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,930
No,

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,330
I'm...

89
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,450
I'm not.

90
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,769
Staring blankly when hungry.

91
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,649
Feeling drowsy when full.

92
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,060
I'm already sleepy now.

93
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,360
Get up.

94
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,970
What's wrong?

95
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,780
You've been here for so long and still haven't found the booklet.

96
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,230
Do you really want to stay and be Lu Chen?

97
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,720
I certainly don't want that.

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,510
But we've already

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,730
searched the study, haven't we?

100
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,700
With so many items, there might be oversights.

101
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Search again.

102
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,750
Me?

103
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,800
You've eaten so much; it's good for digestion.

104
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,750
Go quickly.

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,310
Search.

106
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,710
This Lu Chen

107
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,750
is truly cunning and sly.

108
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,620
I've been searching for all day and still haven't found it.

109
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,820
Where on earth did he hide it?

110
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,830
I'm exhausted.

111
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,310
If I hadn't eaten so much for dinner,

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,770
I'd probably be starving by now.

113
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,450
Open the door.

114
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,890
Why have you locked me out again?

115
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
Aren't you full?

116
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,250
Go digest some more.

117
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,720
Stop it.

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,360
Open the door.

119
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,550
Open the door.

120
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,370
Young Master,

121
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,280
stop calling.

122
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,270
Young Madam won't let you in.

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
You startled me.

124
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,800
What are you doing here?

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
I was going to the outhouse.

126
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,920
Just passing by.

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,750
If you don't want to see me,

128
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,800
I'll leave right away.

129
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,300
Come back.

130
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,730
You just said...

131
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,550
Wan'er won't open the door for me.

132
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,550
Do you know why?

133
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,270
Isn't it obvious?

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,950
Young Madam is jealous.

135
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,150
Honey,

136
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,430
we haven't even had our wedding wine yet.

137
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,170
Wan'er.

138
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,170
There's no connection between us.

139
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,980
You don't have to stay for me.

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,890
You got trapped for saving me.

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,430
I can't just leave you.

142
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,530
Brother Xie.

143
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,680
Miss Yunyun,

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,159
what brings you here?

145
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,030
I just saw you

146
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,490
sitting alone in the pavilion.

147
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,500
I thought you might want a drink,

148
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,080
so I had someone bring some over.

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,050
You came just in time.

150
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,600
I do have something troubling me.

151
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,550
A drink might help ease my mind.

152
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,450
What's troubling you?

153
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,610
You can tell me about it.

154
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,250
Nothing big.

155
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,580
It's fine to share with you.
