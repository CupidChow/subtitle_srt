00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,440
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,570
Congratulations! Congratulations!

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,560
The auspicious moment has arrived.

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,970
Time for the wedding ceremony.

6
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,680
First, bow to heaven and earth.

7
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,100
Second, bow to your parents.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,289
Finally, the couple bows to each other.

9
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,770
Young Master Lu,

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,050
don't you want me anymore?

11
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,400
Isn't this Miss Rong, who had a thing with Lu Chen?

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
No wonder, she's here to ruin the wedding today.

13
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,770
This ceremony cannot proceed.

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,440
Miss Rong,

15
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,960
what's the meaning of this?

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,020
Please leave.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,710
Miss Qiao, before the wedding,

18
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,150
was no longer a virgin.

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,410
Therefore, this ceremony cannot proceed.

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,930
That can't be true.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,650
The Qiao family may have fallen on hard times, but they wouldn't...

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,430
However,

23
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,150
I did hear people in Qinghe Town gossiping about Miss Qiao.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,040
Shut up!

25
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,240
The Qiao family is a respected scholarly family.

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Wan'er has been betrothed to my son, Chen, since childhood.

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,590
Don't talk nonsense here!

28
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,329
Miss Rong, you can't make such reckless accusations.

29
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,720
This isn't something I made up.

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,690
Everyone in Qinghe Town knows

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,250
that Qiao Wan'er only appears to be well-mannered on the surface,

32
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,070
but in private, she behaves no differently from a courtesan—

33
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,150
she's depraved

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,670
and would stoop to anything.

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,630
Do you have any evidence for these claims?

36
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,800
You and I are both women.

37
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,110
You should know

38
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,079
how difficult it is to protect our reputation,

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,460
yet how easily it can be destroyed by mere words.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,130
Just a single word from anyone can do it.

41
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,970
Although Miss Qiao has been sheltered at home,

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,940
her thoughts are quite unique.

43
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,150
I think Miss Qiao is right.

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,310
Yes, everything needs evidence.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,470
Although I don't have evidence,

46
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,590
as a woman from my background,

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,710
I know best how to verify a woman's virtue.

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,800
Miss Qiao just needs to follow my instructions,

49
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,750
and you'll know whether what I'm saying is true or false.

50
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,710
That won't be necessary.

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,470
I, Lu Chen, am not a foolish person.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,030
Since Wan'er is now married to me,

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,510
I cannot allow her to suffer even the slightest grievance,

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,150
let alone

55
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,650
deliberately let her harm her reputation to prove her innocence.

56
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,400
This farce ends here.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,650
Xiaobao,

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,650
see her out.

59
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,480
Miss Rong, please.

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,770
Such a fickle and irresponsible man;

61
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,450
he is really a villain.

62
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,690
You can't drive me away.

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm already

64
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,750
carrying Mr. Lu's child.

65
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,330
What?

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,550
What?

67
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,140
Wan'er,

68
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,050
please sit.

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,269
Yes.

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,600
Chen.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
What do you think we should do about this?

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,740
Father,

73
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,490
about this, I...

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,310
If she enters the household, it may not be a bad thing.

75
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,040
Master Lu, may I say a few words?

76
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,170
Go ahead.

77
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,770
Mr. Lu,

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,230
I'm still carrying your child.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
You mustn't let her cast me out.

80
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,470
Every additional person who knows Lu Chen

81
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,320
coming here puts me at greater risk of being exposed.

82
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,390
Miss,

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,750
If my wife wants to drive you out,

85
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,210
there's nothing I can do about it.

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,260
Who said I wanted to drive her out?

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,690
Since you're carrying my husband's child,

88
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,980
you are now part of our Lu family.

89
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,310
However, you disrupted the wedding ceremony today,

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,530
showing complete disregard for our family's reputation.

91
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,090
Therefore, you can only stay in the side quarters for now.

92
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,190
After the child is born, we'll perform the concubine ceremony.

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,910
This way, we keep both propriety and moral standing.

94
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,870
Master Lu,

95
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,170
Honey,

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
what do you think?

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,590
Good.

98
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,010
Wan'er, you truly live up to your noble upbringing,

99
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,600
with an extraordinary capacity for tolerance.

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,950
Good.

101
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,780
You're already married.

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,270
The booklet...

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,270
The Nine Nights of Hell is indeed powerful,

104
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,680
inflicting pain once every day.

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,510
I need to find that thing quickly.

106
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,480
Shoot.

107
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,130
Where on earth is that thing?

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,100
That was close.

109
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,310
Honey.

110
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,170
Darling.

111
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,370
Why did this fellow get here so fast?

112
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,490
Showing your true colors already?

113
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,870
Honey,

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,000
we haven't even had our cross-cupped wine yet.

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,040
We haven't had the wine yet?

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,840
I'll go pour the wine.

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,890
Okay.

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Bro,

119
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,830
if things get exposed, I won't be able to clear my name no matter what.

120
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,310
Honey?

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,040
Honey, here.

122
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,620
What should I do tonight?

123
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,740
You lecherous man.

124
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,730
If you dare to act recklessly,

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,040
I won't show any mercy.

126
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,160
Dear.

127
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,560
We've had our drink.

128
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,860
It's getting late.

129
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,480
Why don't we rest early?

130
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,060
The night breeze is crisp.

131
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,320
Could you close the window for me?

132
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,120
Sure.

133
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
This can't go on.

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm sorry,

135
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,830
Miss Wan'er.

136
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,950
I'd like to see what you're up to.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,159
He didn't touch me at all last night.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,830
What am I thinking?

139
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,970
Finding the booklet is more important.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,510
Lu Chen doesn't have the booklet on him.

141
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,430
Could it be hidden in this room?

142

Wan'er.

143
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,020
Are you alright?

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,670
Cui Xiaojing,

145
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,080
you must not be fooled by Lu Chen's disguise, the lecher.

146
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,160
Young Master!

147
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,210
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,630
Wait!

149
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,760
What is it?

150
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,690
The Master has sent me

151
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,480
to ask you and Young Madam to pay respects with tea.

152
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,550
Got it.

153
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,690
Wan'er,

154
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,160
why don't you go ahead?

155
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,720
I'll change my clothes and be right there.

156
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,650
Okay.

157
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,050
Where on earth did you hide the booklet?

158
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,090
This candlestick is suspiciously clean.

159
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
Such tight security...

160
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,520
The booklet must be nearby.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,330
Impressive, Lu Chen.

162
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,070
All this gold and treasure...

163
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,390
Let me help share some of the burden.

164
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,580
It isn't too much, right?

00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,960
This will ensure your corpse doesn't decay.

Once I find what I'm looking for,

168
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,360

[Elegant Pavilion]

171
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,170
Young Lord, this is the latest white tea from our pavilion.

172
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,960
You think serving tea would distract me?

173
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,350
Useless thing.

174
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,790
What are you afraid of?

175
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,480
Go on.

176
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,430
Couldn't even handle such a small matter.

177
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,440

178
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,510

[Sun Yunyun; Young Lord's Slave]

180
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,670
I heard that Mr. Lu just got married recently.

181
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,590
He's busy accompanying his new bride

182
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,330
and doesn't have time to come to Tianming Pavilion,

183
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,930
so naturally, there are no new tea maids coming in.

184
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,550
I don't believe that Lu Chen would leave the teahouse

185
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,670
unattended for a woman.

186
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,670
Young Lord, would you abandon your principles

187
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,510
