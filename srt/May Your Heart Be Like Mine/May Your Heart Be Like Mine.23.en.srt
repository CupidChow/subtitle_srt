1
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,190
[May your heart be like mine]

2
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,410
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,210
Thank you for your trouble, Master Xie.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,640
It's my duty.

5
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,710
No need to thank me.

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,430
If there's nothing else,

7
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,230
I'll take my leave.

8
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,840
What's going on?

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,400
Others,

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,280
protect the lord.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Come, come, over here, over here.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,280
Go check over there.

13
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,450
Go check over there.

14
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,640
I'd like to ask you, Master Xie,

15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,560
for a favor.

16
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,310
I've found the location of the booklet,

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,870
but unfortunately,

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,950
my brother

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,390
has installed an intricate mechanism.

20
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,640
As soon as the box hiding the booklet

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
changes in weight,

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
the entire Lord's mansion

23
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,740
will sound an alarm.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,030
Only Master Xie's Lingxiu Point

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
can perform such a sleight of hand.

26
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,570
The Lord's mansion is heavily guarded.

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,710
Even with my superior martial arts skills,

28
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,400
it's impossible for me alone

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,870
to steal something without anyone noticing.

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,780
Don't you enjoy creating diversions?

31
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,790
I've brought you what you wanted.

32
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,120
Why haven't you released Xiaojing yet?

33
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,710
If I release her,

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,870
will you go back on your word?

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,760
What else do you want?

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,910
The two booklets in my possession

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,630
can basically confirm the approximate location of the treasure.

38
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,240
While what you and this lady have

39
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,600
is the exact location of the treasure.

40
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,280
So,

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,150
I kindly request that you, Master Xie,

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,329
accompany us on this journey.

43
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,270
Young Lord,

44
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,870
the treasure should be right here.

45
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,630
Start digging.

46
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,510
How is this possible?

47
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,510
My treasure.

48
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,870
My treasure.

49
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,270
Where's the treasure?

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,270
Where's the treasure?

51
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,270
My treasure.

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,720
Where's my treasure?

53
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,480
Young Lord.

54
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,480
Brother.

55
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,310
Lord,

56
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,810
I have a request.

57
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,440
Master Xie,

58
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,310
what's the meaning of this?

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,040
Please get up.

60
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,870
Stand up first, then we'll talk.

61
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,480
Lord,

62
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,480
I'd like to borrow this booklet

63
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
to save someone important.

64
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,750
The person you want to save,

65
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,680
is it Miss Cui from Shenyin Sect?

66
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,040
How did you know?

67
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,130
Just as Xiaolin planted spies in my mansion,

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,670
I have done the same.

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,560
He

70
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,530
must have a plan, right?

71
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,310
You should follow his plan.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,220
Aren't you afraid...

73
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,440
The lives of the people in the world are important.

74
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,240
So is that of a single person.

75
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,430
Moreover,

76
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
I'm well prepared.

77
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,560
I won't let him succeed.

78
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,270
Thank you, Lord.

79
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,040
The show must go on.

80
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,270
Otherwise, my brother

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
won't release her.

82
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,950
I understand.

83
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,720
You still came.

84
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,190
You planned all of this.

85
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,750
You've been meticulously plotting against me!

86
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,390
Xiaolin,

87
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,190
the one who set this trap wasn't me.

88
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,030
It was Father.

89
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Father has always valued you highly.

90
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,070
He saw you as his pride.

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,870
But he also felt your ambition was too great.

92
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,490
You can start a business,

93
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,030
but you're not the talent to maintain it.

94
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,920
So he set up this trap with the treasure.

95
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,790
If you were content being the Young Lord,

96
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,510
you'd live a life of wealth and honor.

97
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,300
We brothers would govern Tianshu State together.

98
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,660
But if you harbored rebellious thoughts

99
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,630
and touched the treasure...

100
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,360
Brother,

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,510
please stop.

102
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,940
You think I'm not prepared?

103
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,070
Si Xuan!

104
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,110
Why did you...

105
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,790
Brother Xie,

106
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,820
do you really regret saving me?

107
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,630
What I said that day was out of anger.

108
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,340
This is the antidote for the Heart-Piercing Powder.

109
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,120
Consider it repaying the life of Xiaojing's master.

110
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,409
Please don't hate me, okay?

111
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,840
Miss Yunyun.

112
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,910
How could I?

113
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,480
Miss Yunyun

114
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,550
Miss Yunyun!

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,600
Miss Yunyun!

116
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,710
Protect the Lord!

117
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,960
Tianxing,

118
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,010
what's going on here?

119
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,720
I'll explain to you later.

120
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,040
Keep him alive.
