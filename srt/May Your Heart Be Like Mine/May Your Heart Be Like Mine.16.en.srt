[Episode 16]

00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,700
[Three days later]

4
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,170
Got it.

5
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,970
Brother Xie.

6
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,340
Miss Xiaojing,

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
seeing you're alright

8
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,960
is such a relief.

9
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,680
I have to thank Tianxing for not giving up.

10
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,640
Xiaojing.

11
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,420
Master.

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,509
I made you worry.

13
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,410
Please punish me.

14
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,710
You silly girl.

15
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,590
Come in with me.

16
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

17
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,479
Xiaojing.

18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,990
Master.

19
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,280
Are you hurt?

20
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,490
When I fell off the cliff,

21
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,800
a few trees broke my fall

22
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,470
and then I fell into the river.

23
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,510
I only got a few scrapes,

24
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,370
nothing serious.

25
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,950
That's good.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
Don't take such risks again in the future.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,150
Understood.

28
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,220
Take Brother Xie and that woman away

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,550
and find the booklet as soon as possible.

30
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,570
Yes.

31
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,100
[Lu's Mansion]

32
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,560
Dear.

33
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,840
I have something to discuss with Miss Yunyun.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,670
You can go back to your room first.

35
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,310
What's wrong?

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,590
Are you worried about me

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,640
or Miss Yunyun?

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,430
No.

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,710
Well,

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,190
you two talk.

41
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,410
Miss Yunyun, please have a seat with me.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,080
Miss Xiaojing,

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,910
what do you want to discuss with me?

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,870
You let go on purpose, didn't you?

45
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,360
Why would you think that?

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,370
I genuinely wanted to save you.

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,460
It's okay if you don't admit it.

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,110
I don't have any evidence anyway.

49
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,560
I know Tianxing is kind-hearted,

50
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,579
and I won't put him in a difficult position.

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,190
However,

52
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,280
what I want to tell you is that

53
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,240
if there's a next time,

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,050
I won't let you off so easily.

55
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,800
Miss Yunyun must have been up all night.

56
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,760
Go get some rest.

57
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,910
You're back.

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,030
What did you two talk about?

59
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,209
Why are you so uneasy?

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,149
Don't worry.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,089
We just had a casual chat.

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Let's get back to business.

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,030
There's been so much going on that I hadn’t given it much thought,

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
but now that I think about it,

65
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,510
someone deliberately said something happened to you

66
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,710
to lure me out.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,450
In fact, I was their real target.

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,830
Who do you think it could be?

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Now that you mention it,

70
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
it does seem odd.

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,300
Could it be that Young Lord Yu is losing his patience

72
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,200
and wants to capture you to threaten me into handing over the booklet?

73
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,560
That's probably it.

74
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,480
To avoid any further escalation,

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,830
we need to find the booklet as soon as possible.

76
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,360
Did you bring the notebooks?

77
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,320
These

78
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,180
are all the notebooks I brought back from the teahouse.

79
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,750
I didn't expect Lu Chen to be so meticulous.

80
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,040
We’ve got a lot to go through.

81
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,240
Time is of the essence. Let's get to it.

82
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,660
There’s nothing useful here.

83
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,360
Stay focused.

84
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,310
Okay.

85
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,650
No, no.

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,120
Stay focused.

87
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,220
What's wrong?

♫A sudden encounter stirs the heartstrings♫

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,150
♫The east wind makes our red threads intertwined♫

♫In the glow of red candles, a glance spans eternity♫

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,970
♫Silent, we hold our secrets close♫

92

♫Hearts flutter in that fleeting gaze♫

93
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,150
Why did you get so close all of a sudden?

♫The year the crabapple bloomed, memories linger sweet♫

95
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,400
I couldn't help it.

Look...

100

♫Does your heart mirror my deepest wish?♫

Brother Xie.

111
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,170
You and Miss Xiaojing...

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,390
Miss Yunyun,

113
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,320
do you remember

114
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,870
what I told you about the wine?

115
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
I've just realized

116
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,610
that both types are actually the same kind of wine.

117
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,160
You should understand what I mean.

118
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
I understand.

119
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
If there's nothing else,

120
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,550
I'll take my leave now.
