00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,229
Father,

5
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,150
You should go back first.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
What about you?

7
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,270
I want to stay here

8
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,789
and be with him for a while longer.

9
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,479
Alright.

10
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,640
Alright.

♫As the sky scatters points of light♫

24
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,560

♫Your touch will heal all my wounds♫

27
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,190
I couldn't bring you back,

28
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,870
so I could only set up a cenotaph for you.

29
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,680
Wait for me to fulfill our wish

30
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,590
and bring eternal peace to Tianshu State City.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520

wait for me.

45
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,170
The sooner I get the booklet,

46
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,830
the sooner I can reunite with Xiaojing.

47
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,370
It's not safe to talk here.

48
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,720
Let's go.

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,690
Are you Tianxing?

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Miss,

51
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,290
you misunderstood.

52
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,790
I'm just a guard from the City Lord's Mansion,

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
acting on orders.

54
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,400
If you're just a guard from the City Lord's Mansion,

55
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,870
how could you reveal your identity?

56
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,790
If you're truly not Tianxing,

57
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,430
it means Tianxing is dead.

58
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,310

I'm not dead?

78
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,810
City Lord.

79
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Master Xie,

80
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,540
no need for such formality.

81
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,290
Are you wondering

82
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,550
why you didn't die?

83
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,820
Actually,

84
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,510
I already knew

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,910
that Lu Chen's death had nothing to do with you,

86
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,340
and you've been helping me search for the booklet all along.

87
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
So, both emotionally and rationally,

88
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,870
I had to save you.

89
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,330
Thank you, Lord.

90
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,420
Don't thank me yet.

91
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,330
I actually have one more favor to ask.

92
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,270
City Lord, you flatter me.

93
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,450
I'm just a little thief.

94
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,150
What could I possibly help you with?

95
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,039
Help me stop someone from...

96
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,120
starting a rebellion.

97
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,270
Yu Xiaolin?

98
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
I've been frail and sickly since childhood.

99
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,040
My younger brother is healthy

100
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,260
and talented,

101
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,960
so he was more favored by our father.

102
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,320
So, the entire city thought

103
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,910
he would be the next city lord,

104
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,570
and even I thought so.

105
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,290
I believe the former city lord

106
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,340
must have seen Yu Xiaolin's cruelty and viciousness,

107
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,590
which is why he didn't pass on the position

108
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,150
of the city lord to him.

109
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,270
That's right.

110
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,510
But my younger brother doesn't think so.

111
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,220
My father left behind a treasure

112
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,510
and split the map into three parts.

113
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,570
When my brother found out,

114
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,760
he started searching for them.

115
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,510
If he truly finds them,

116
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,970
this era of peace

117
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,580
may soon come to an end.

118
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,670
I finally understand

119
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,510
why you asked the Shenyin Sect to go to any lengths

120
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,910
to stop Yu Xiaolin from getting the booklet.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
So now,

122
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I need you to do the same thing for me.

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Master Xie,

124
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,390
please go to Yu Xiaolin's mansion

125
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
and steal the booklet from him.

126
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,320
To make things easier,

127
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,390
starting today,

128
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,310
you will be a dead man.
