[May your heart be like mine]

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,490
[Episode 1]

3
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,810
The lord of Tianshu State governs the state with wisdom,

4
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,230
fostering peace and prosperity among the people.

5
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,590
However, the lord's younger brother

6
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,560
has colluded with unscrupulous merchants,

7
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,060
harboring sinister intentions.

8
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,560
The seemingly elegant and pleasant Tianming Pavilion

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,210
is actually a den of criminal activities.

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,910
It rumors that the former lord left three gold-foil booklets,

11
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,560
one of which has fallen into

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,630
the hands of Lu Chen, the owner of Tianming Pavilion.

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,370
High-ranking officials and martial artists

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,090
all covet the booklets.

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,030
Who is it?

16
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,180
I heard that the Commoner Thief has incredible skills

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,009
and is very clever.

18
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,740
Then go steal something for me.

19
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,020
After you find it, go to the pavilion in the northern outskirts of the state.

20
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
[A gold-foil booklet
Lu Chen]

21
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,120
And ring the wind chime three times.

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,220
Lu Chen from Tianming Pavilion.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,270
This is strange.

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
There is actually no one in the teahouse.

25
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,150
Girls,

26
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,260
our distinguished guest has arrived.

27
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,530
Today's girls look so pretty.

28
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,200
This teahouse actually...

29
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,829
The one in the middle,

30
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,820
stay.

31
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,850
Let's go.

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,320
Let's go.

33
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,800
Don't run.

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,180
Come on.

35
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,110
See no evil.

36
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,190
Where do you want to go?

37
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,430
Oh no!

38
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,070
[Gold-foil booklet]

39
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,710
She also wants the booklet.

40
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,850
Leave the booklet!

41
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,030
Who are you?

42
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,440
Let go!

43
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,340
Miss, I didn't expect to meet a fellow professional.

44
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,390
Miss,

45
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,370
although we accepted the same mission,

46
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,180
there's no need to kill him, right?

47
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,100
Cut the crap.

48
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,790
Give me the booklet!

49
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,060
Oh no! This is a trap!

50
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,080
Two more people came to ask for death for the booklet.

51
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,830
That person is the real Lu Chen.

52
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,290
What are you waiting for?

53
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,450
Kill them.

54
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,330
Miss, see you around.

55
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,930
Why didn't you tell me

56
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,050
Lu Chen has many skilled martial artists around him?

57
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,300
You almost got me killed.

58
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,890
I quit this job.

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,520
Once the mission is accepted,

60
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,190
it can't be canceled.

61
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,330
Now it's not up to you

62
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,200
whether you want to do it or not.

63
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Well, I'm sorry.

64
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,490
What I dislike the most

65
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,090
is being controlled by others.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,810
Is that so?

67
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,080
You might want to look at your left arm.

68
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,050
The Nine Nights of Hell?

69
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,450
You have eight days left.

70
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,260
You win.

71
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,960
It won't take eight days.

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
One day is enough.

73
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
I don't understand Lu Chen.

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,960
He has worked with you for a long time.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
Tianming Pavilion's prosperity today

76
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,490
is all thanks to your help and support.

77
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,840
He's got the booklet, but how could he

78
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,250
keep it for himself?

79
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,370
This shows you don't understand human nature well enough.

80
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,790
Once I become the state's lord,

81
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,370
he will be of no use.

82
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,350
I failed in my duty,

83
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,810
please punish me, Master.

84
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
Lu Chen has always been cunning

85
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,400
and full of tricks.

86
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,440
Besides, there was someone else involved this time.

87
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,530
It's not your fault.

88
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,290
Master,

89
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,490
I don't understand.

90
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,890
Are the booklets really that important?

91
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,170
Why do so many people want them?

92
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,320
It's said that the former lord

93
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,050
hid the secret of the great cause in the booklets.

94
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
Whoever has the booklets can rule the world.

95
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,490
Since you failed to assassinate Lu Chen,

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,930
he will undoubtedly be on higher alert.

97
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,690
Don't worry, Master.

98
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,810
I have another plan.

99
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,490
Wan'er, I know you're reluctant.

100
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,630
But the Qiao family is now on its last legs.

101
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,890
The Lu family is still willing to uphold the marriage contract.

102
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,490
It's already a blessing for you.

103
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,000
Anyway, tomorrow,

104
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,780
whether you are willing or not,

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,240
you have to get in the bridal sedan chair.

106
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
Why hasn't she come yet?

107
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,490
Put the things over there.

108
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,270
Be careful.

109
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,510
The Lu family's mansion is really big.

110
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,680
Today is Lu Chen's wedding day?

111
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,020
Why hasn't he come yet?

112
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,450
Why hasn't he come yet?

113
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,950
Why hasn't he come yet?

114
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,930
Yeah, this...

115
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,060
Master, I'm going to take a look.

116
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,030
Go now.

117
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,530
Help.

118
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,440
Why does he look exactly like me?

119
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,650
How come it's you?

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
How is this possible?

121
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,400
Young Master.

122
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,780
Young Master,

123
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,670
the bride has arrived.

124
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,010
You go first.

125
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,010
I'll... be right there after getting changed.

126
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,530
Okay.

127
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,730
Young Master,

128
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,840
I'll wait for you at the door.

129
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,720
If you still don't go, Master will send someone to take you there.

130
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,340
Hurry up, Young Master.

131
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,290
Young Master.

132
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,500
He's here. He's here.

133
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,120
Hurry.

134
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,270
Congratulations.

135
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,210
Chen, you're finally here.

136
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,060
I was so anxious.

137
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,840
Master, Young Master is getting married.

138
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,090
It's inevitable that he's a bit nervous.

139
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,720
Nervous?

140
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,120
Yes.

141
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,080
Nervous.

142
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,720
Chen,

143
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,480
I understand

144
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,910
how you're feeling.

145
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,350
Don't be nervous.

146
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,390
Go welcome the bride now.

147
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,100
Don't keep her waiting.

148
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,920
Go now.

149
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,270
-Young Master.
-Go.

150
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,200
Go now.

151
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,010
He's coming.

152
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,320
The bridegroom is coming.

153
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,170
Finally, he's coming.

154
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,370
Congratulations.

155
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,050
The bride gets out of the sedan chair!

156
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,690
[Lu's Mansion]

157
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,090
Don't worry, Master.

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,200
I will kill Lu Chen and get the booklet.
