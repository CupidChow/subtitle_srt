00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,250
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,280
Brother Xie, what's troubling you?

4
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,350
You can talk to me about it.

5
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,820
Nothing.

6
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,490
But it's okay to tell you.

7
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,560
As you know,

8
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,680
I love drinking alcohol.

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,940
There was a type of wine

10
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,150
I was very fond of.

11
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,789
But I only encountered it once.

12
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,539
And there has been nowhere to buy it ever since.

13
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,600
Later,

14
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,250
I came across another type of wine.

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,070
At first, it tasted extremely spicy.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,430
But now...

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,240
I can't really describe how I feel about it.

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Tell me.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,270
What should I do?

20
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,900
♫Following the path you've walked♫

21
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,140
♫Through the cracks, across the tides of time♫

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
In my opinion,

23
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,750
♫Resting gently in your hand♫

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
since both are fine wine

25
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,630
and you love drinking alcohol,

26
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,650
♫Awaiting the break of dawn♫

27
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,500
why don't you drink both?

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,560
No way.

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,800
I am not a fickle person.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,930
♫I always thought I could see through the night♫

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,600
♫Staying by your side♫

32
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,910
We're just talking about alcohol.

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,520
How does that make you fickle?

34
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,210
♫Without being noticed by you♫

35
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,160
♫While stars shine in the sky♫

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,360
Forget it.

37
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Let's drink.

38
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,710
♫I soar to be near you♫

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,710
♫This faint glimmer is barely visible♫

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,510
♫Compared to others♫

41
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,460
♫I'm not that radiant♫

42
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,210
♫The distance between us isn't far♫

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,960
♫Flying back to where it all began♫

44
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,210
No more for me.

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,000
No more.

46
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,360
Brother Xie,

47
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,360
this time,

48
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,800
I definitely won't let you leave me.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,770
I wonder how he was last night.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,680
Wan'er.

51
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,020
It's you.

52
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,000
Are you here to ask me to go back to our room?

53
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,310
Do you still want to go back to our room?

54
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,370
I think this pavilion is perfect for you.

55
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,680
Mrs. Lu,

56
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,430
please don't misunderstand.

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,120
Last night, I came to Mr. Lu for a drink.

58
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,190
-He was drunk, so...
-Miss Yunyun.

59
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,030
As a woman,

60
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,830
you asked a man to drink with you late at night.

61
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,130
Did you do that because

62
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,980
you're straightforward or you want others to misunderstand?

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,500
Mrs. Lu,

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,560
I didn't mean that.

65
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,920
I guess...

66
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,040
it's because of my background.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,480
It indeed can easily make you misunderstand.

68
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,950
That's all in the past.

69
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,470
Shut up!

70
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,630
Go back to our room with me.

71
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,420
I have something to tell you.

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,190
Okay.

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,020
Is she really jealous?

74
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,600
We still have no clue about the booklet.

75
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,120
What do you plan to do next?

76
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,240
You asked me here

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,760
to tell me that?

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,360
What else do you expect?

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,040
I've been busy these days.

80
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,730
Indeed, I didn't pay much attention to it.

81
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,340
I thought about it last night.

82
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,530
Although Lu Residence is large,

83
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,350
it's still limited in size.

84
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,730
We can't find it

85
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,720
because we don't know him well enough.

86
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,240
But Lu Chen is already dead.

87
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,390
How can we make a dead man speak?

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,720
We can start by delving into his life.

89
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,830
He had a habit of writing notes.

90
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,950
Today, you'll handle the shipment.

91
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,310
You can stop by the teahouse.

92
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,480
There might be some manuscripts he left there.

93
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,700
I'll

94
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,670
continue to search Lu Residence.

95
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,680
Miss Qing, you're clever.

96
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,580
Leave the teahouse to me.

97
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,390
Now I don't feel nervous at all

98
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,840
about pretending to be Lu Chen.

99
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,940
It's been a few days since you entered Lu Residence.

100
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,290
Have you made any progress?

101
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,430
Young Lord, as you expected,

102
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,760
although Lu Chen took me to Lu Residence,

103
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
his wife is the only one he cares about.

104
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
It's hard for me to make a move.

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,790
Is it that difficult for you

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,600
to handle Qiao Wan'er?

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
It's not that difficult.

108
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,740
But I need your help.

109
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,600
Once Qiao Wan'er is dead,

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,680
I am confident I can win Lu Chen's heart.

111
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
Then I'll have him personally deliver the booklet

112
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,190
to you.

113
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,630
The antidote for this time.

114
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
Remember to come back regularly for it.

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,380
[Lu's Mansion]

116
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Young Madam!

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,350
Bad news! Someone just came and said

118
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
when Young Master was handling the shipment,

119
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,270
he ran into bandits right after he left the city.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,510
And...

121
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,430
And he got injured.

122
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,160
What?

123
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,190
Could it be Hell Sect?
