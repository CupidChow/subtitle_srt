1
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,330
Let's speak frankly and openly.

2
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Frankly, as you say.

3
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,830
Ask away.

4
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,660
Mr. Jang Tae-young, What is your occupation?

5
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,910
I run an export company.

6
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,160
My friend also owns an export company,

7
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,290
he gets nervous without his phone.

8
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,870
But not you.

9
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,870
He must have a small company.

10
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,910
Your mannerism is quite courteous.

11
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,540
You know how to dress,
wearing nothing but luxury goods.

12
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,910
Even your neck tattoo is of
the highest quality.

13
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,120
So what do you think I do?

14
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,200
My first impression was a
smart gangster with a rich backer.

15
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,290
But after our chat, I thought I might be wrong.

16
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,410
You're a natural-born leader
and an ambitious man.

17
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,830
You should be a leader, not a henchman.

18
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,250
I crippled a town bully and went to the juvie.

19
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,000
I met him there again and a fight broke out.

20
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,000
So I castrated him.

21
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,160
With GED, I went to a decent college.

22
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,830
Then...

23
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,410
He came after me and stabbed me in the waist.

24
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,200
I cut his face in return and
he died from shock.

25
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,500
I did 3 years for that,

26
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,580
I was made after meeting my backer
and did a stint in prison again.

27
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,410
But now, that backer works under me.

28
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,910
Is this what you wanted to hear?

29
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,910

30
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,910
On the surface, I look like a hooligan.

31
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,660
This was a gunshot from someone else's fight.

32
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,330
I got a scratch so I filled it in with tattoo.

33
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,290
A crazy bitch bit off my nipple
so I had it sewn back on.

34
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,830
Fucking bitch...

35
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,580
Got stabbed in the thigh by a loanshark.

36
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,330
Got my dick pierced.

37
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,830
Both testicles in tact.

38
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,750
That is all, doctor.

39
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,950
That was quite enlightening.

40
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,790
Being this honest will work?
With your treatment.

41
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,910
If you don't strip often.

42
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,160
Aren't you afraid of me?

43
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,160
Should I be?

44
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,500
That's what I'm used to.

45
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,330
Yes, a little bit.

46
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,870
You're looking for someone
with the same tattoo,

47
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,200
could you explain why?

48
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,790
My woman was raped.

49
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,200
Okay, we'll get to that later.

50
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,330
These are Russian nesting dolls.

51
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,080
Pick 2 that you fancy.

52
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,450
Biggest and 2nd biggest.

53
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,910
- Between the 2?
- Biggest.

54
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,830
Different faces and colors,
so why pick by size?

55
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,540
Which one do you think was made first?

56
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,290
- Well...
- Please tell me.

57
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,660
- I'm not sure.
- Just blurt it out.

58
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,910
"Not sure," is my answer.

59
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,200
But just one.

60
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,580
I said I'm not sure.

61
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,370
Your action was a good answer.

62
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,080
I went overboard.

63
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,580
No, you're a patient and I'm a doctor.

64
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,910
I'm responsible for anything during a session.

65
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,120
Let's get back to you.

66
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,080
I have Mr. Jang's charts from the rehab center.

67
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,620
After removing the pins,
the collarbones went up.

68
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,540
Ms. Song Yoo-hwa from the rehab center.

69
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,160
Yes?

70
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,330
My shoulder's giving me trouble,
could you take a look?

71
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,910
Do I need physiotherapy?

72
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,080
The ligament is damaged quite a bit.

73
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,080
You should get it examined properly.

74
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,160
Thank you.

75
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,540
How long have you treated him?

76
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,250
Over 6 months.

77
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,540
Thank you.

78
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,870
Never knew our clinic had such a beauty.

79
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,200
How long have you dated her?

80
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,120
How did you know?

81
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,370
Trade secret.

82
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,950
Only 4 weeks left of your treatment.

83
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,250
Are we going to chit chat the entire time?

84
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,700
You exhibit symptoms of
dissociative identity disorder.

85
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,910
As you know your being is divided into 2 egos,

86
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,410
and you share the name,
age and gender with the other ego.

87
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,700
When it takes over,
you suffer short term amnesia,

88
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,700
this condition cannot be treated
even with modern technology.

89
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,200
So why did you guarantee a full recovery?

90
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,540
You've committed murder, have you not?

91
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,790
What I do is something similar.

92
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,540
For the next 4 weeks,
we'll murder your other ego.

93
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,870
I'm getting the chills.

94
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,160
Will you consent?

95
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,870
Please lie down and we'll get started.

96
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,540
I'll try to keep you here when you wake up.

97
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,410
I know, there's a place he goes to.

98
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,160
The other ego is still part of you,

99
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,910
were you not insulted by
the use of word 'murder'?

100
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,790
Not at all.

101
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,750
Answer my questions freely
with memories that pop up.

102
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,660
You can sleep if you want to.
Please close your eyes.

103
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,000
You've seen your other ego with your own eyes.

104
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,520
When...

105
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,190
was that?

106
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,060
(Councilor Choi proposes a Resort-Casino Combo)

107
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,560
Mr. Jang, you're our best fixer.

108
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,060
Can you see?

109
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,230
Let's continue our chat.

110
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,190
First time waking up since last week?

111
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,270
Staying away from drugs?

112
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,270
Made some money as gonzo journalist?

113
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:39,770
I sold stories to stations
and magazines as a freelancer.

114
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,980
No name or photos on your profile.

115
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,520
Reporting must be done discreetly.

116
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,690
How can someone believe
that you're real with this?

117
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,560
Doesn't matter.

118
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,480
Philip Marlowe...

119
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,060
"If I wasn't hard, I wouldn't be alive.

120
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,440
"If I couldn't ever be gentle,
I wouldn't deserve to be alive."

121
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,020
Did you live that way?

122
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,190
No.

123
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,560
I wished to live that way.

124
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,810
I've seen cases where egos transform,

125
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,350
but in your case,

126
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,270
there's no contact between the two.

127
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,310
How does it feel to have a body?

128
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,810
What was it like to see him for the first time?

129
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,810
Afraid?

130
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,020
If you die here,

131
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,190
another being will die too.

132
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:30,350
Your ego was killed
3 years ago after overdosing,

133
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,520
so you're untreatable.

134
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,190
There are 2 options:

135
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,480
overdose again, or commit suicide while high.

136
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,020
But there are 2 of you in there.

137
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,770
So it's murder.

138
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,980
There's a way for you to die alone.

139
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
- Who is he?
- Car accident victim.

140
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Let's move him.

141
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,770
We cannot exclude willful negligence,

142
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,100
upon his death, the government
may seize his assets.

143
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,560
It's too early to judge whether he'll die.

144
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,770
You're thinking too far ahead.

145
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,650
But go ahead with the trial.

146
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,900
Even if he's brain dead,

147
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,230
our law firm will handle
his inheritance as per contract.

148
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,650
(A man came in.)

149
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,480
2 people cannot exist in a single body.

150
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,520
A man lives in my body,

151
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,310
I should not die.

152
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,310
Doctor's method for killing just me

153
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,690
was rather simple.

154
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,980
I will now enter your body

155
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,150
and confirm that death.

156
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,480
You're going to die as a vegetable anyway.

157
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,600
When I first saw you,
your body was in shambles.

158
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,480
How did you stay alive with so much pain?

159
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,310
Don't worry.

160
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,230
I will now choke you to death.

161
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,150
When you die, I will die too.

162
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
If you wanted to live,

163
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,190
I'm sorry.

164
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,440
I don't fucking believe this!

165
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,910
Leaving already?

166
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,080
What the...

167
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,000
(6 months later)

168
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,660
Alright, everybody, enjoy Siesta!

169
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,620
Let's all chant and get things started!

170
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,000
-Everybody...
-Let's go...Siesta!

171
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,710
Yes, doctor.

172
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,620
What's certain is,

173
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,040
he witnessed a patient
he regarded as a friend die.

174
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,330
So your insomnia went away 6 months ago.

175
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,460
I'm sure the other ego is gone.

176
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,790
As I promised.

177
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,040
It went away when the vegetable died.

178
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,960
Enjoy your game.

179
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,000
Thank you for everything.

180
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
So?

181
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,250
How else would I know Cho
and the governor's arrangement?

182
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,290
Why must I...

183
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,040
hand over half of the casino stake to Cho?

184
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,120
Let me take this.

185
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,040
What did I say I'd do
if you ever touch drugs again?

186
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,960
I'll never give my stake to that bastard.

187
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,580
(Freelance journalist Jang Tae-young)

188
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,250
Shall we stop tailing?

189
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,330
If you're willing to pay the
premium, I can get you anything.

190
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,580
Name change is done, asset
distribution is almost done,

191
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,870
but you're free to spend your money.

192
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,710
The plastic surgeon said that the
surgery was a success,

193
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,000
and the forehead came out
exactly as you wanted.

194
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,120
And vocal cord will be worked
on next Wednesday.

195
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,750
Mr. Jang Tae-young.

196
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,080
May I ask why you changed your name to his?

197
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,290
It was actually my name.

198
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,580
Call me that name again.

199
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,750
Sure, I actually like that name.

200
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,120
Mr. Jang Tae-young.

201
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
You're complicating things.

202
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,620
No greetings?

203
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,910
Shouldn't you lay low a lot longer?

204
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,830
I heard you killed people.

205
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,870
You know me?

206
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,540
"You know me?"

207
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,260
Don't be curt, Mr. Jang.

208
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,390
What happened was...

209
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,820
How about we start with an apology?

210
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,370
'Siesta' is a name I gave.

211
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,240
You look like a small-time hooligan,

212
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,030
why not keep to yourself?

213
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,530
Getting agitated shouldn't be
the only thing you do.

214
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,370
Name?

215
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,370
Who cares about that.

216
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,950
Regardless of who built it,

217
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,320
I bought it,

218
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,490
so it's mine.

219
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,530
If it's unfair, then buy it back.

220
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,660
Don't be a crybaby if you don't have the goods.

221
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,320
Fucking bitch.

222
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,070
I really like your fighting spirit.

223
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,410
Do whatever it takes to
put together a war chest.

224
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,660
Who knows,

225
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,410
I may lose.

226
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,530
I'm off.

227
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,160
Interesting.

228
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,490
Look into brokers around Cho.

229
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,660
What is it?

230
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Stress.

231
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,450
There are others, so please be quiet.

232
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,740
Looks like you got wrecked.

233
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,950
Indeed.

234
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,070
I'm rebuilding it.

235
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,990
What's with the voice?

236
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,820
It's temporary until my voice is reworked.

237
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,950
Mr. Jang Tae-young.

238
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,120
You two have same names.

239
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,820
Mr. Jang, please follow me to the rehab pool.

240
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,700
Good to meet you, Mr. Jang Tae-young.

241
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,370
I'm Jang Tae-young.

242
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,570
Mr. Baek, I'm sorry...

243
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,070
It's...all my fault.

244
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,910
Please...Mr. Baek...

245
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,660
I can put together $6 million by tomorrow!

246
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,240
Don't kill me!

247
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,700
It's all my fault!

248
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,240
I'm a fucking bastard!

249
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,450
Please...Don't kill me...

250
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,030
Excuse me.

251
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,160
My client is interested in Siesta Casino.

252
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,570
Who should I be talking to?

253
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,450
I crippled a town bully and went to the juvie.

254
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,780
I met him there again and a fight broke out.

255
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,820
So I castrated him.

256
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:50,530
I cut his face in return
and he died from shock.

257
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,490
He's an enthusiastic type,
so he bit the offer immediately.

258
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,160
His condo was empty.

259
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,030
Due to his casino business,
he lives at a hotel nearby.

260
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,320
One of my men found this in the condo.

261
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,200
He was a gonzo reporter.

262
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,530
It was quite a find.

263
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,820
It's a 24-hour access key to the rehab center.

264
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,450
Ms. Song Yoo-hwa will be assigned to you.

265
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,240
This is something I put together,

266
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
you'll find it interesting.

267
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,370
This is real.

268
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,160
It's the real pasta.

269
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,740
Good?

270
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,370
This is real.

271
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,620
It's the real pasta.

272
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,530
Is your insomnia really gone?

273
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,120
And no more therapy?

274
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,200
Yeah, migraine's gone too.

275
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,410
Siesta...

276
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Why did you call it that?

277
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,700
I don't know, it just came to mind.

278
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:06,700
Win or lose at the casino, it's all just a nap.

279
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,120
I thought you'd say something spectacular.

280
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,620
The only thing spectacular is right here.

281
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,030
It's too bright here. Let's go to bed.

282
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,410
Then put this on.

283
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,280
Amazing.

284
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,530
You look like an action movie star.

285
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,660
So we meet again.

286
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,530
Do you know each other?

287
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,620
Probably a coincidence. Your voice is...

288
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,540
I'm getting used to the new vocal cord.

289
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,330
Very interesting.

290
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,870
What's with the camera?

291
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,830
A professional habit.

292
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,700
I'm a freelance gonzo reporter.

293
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,740
- That's unexpected.
- What is?

294
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,830
Being a millionaire, I thought you didn't work.

295
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,910
I'll let you two talk in private.

296
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,580
As your lawyer mentioned,

297
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,620
match Sewon Idea's $60 million investment,

298
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,870
and just collect the dough every month.

299
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,830
It's a good deal.

300
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,660
I heard the terms.

301
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,830
A recently released gang boss stole
capital you were working on.

302
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,790
I could be in danger if we partner up.

303
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,490
Are you backing out?

304
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,080
I didn't have to come if you did.

305
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,830
Don't misunderstand.

306
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,200
Dangerous, perhaps,
but there's work we must do.

307
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,120
How about dinner on the weekend?

308
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,660
Happy birthday and I love you!

309
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,160
Come here!

310
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,740
These are people I work with.

311
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,200
Good to meet you. Welcome!

312
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Good evening, welcome.

313
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,410
This is the greatest dish from my hometown.

314
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,790
It's called Beggar's Chicken.

315
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:02,910
A beggar stole a chicken,
and hid it in the mud,

316
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,990
Qing dynasty emperor was passing
by and tried it,

317
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,910
and instantly became a hit.

318
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,910
How is it?

319
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,200
It may look disgusting,
but the taste is top-notch.

320
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,240
Dishes and people
shouldn't be judged based on looks.

321
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,540
I may feel like a sore thumb to you,

322
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,870
but we must partner up for us to survive.

323
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,370
No, you need to bail to survive.

324
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,910
Even if you start a war against me,

325
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,330
we're still just pawns.

326
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,830
You got the brand, I got the history.

327
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,040
We split the casino half-half.

328
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,200
I got your back from now,

329
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,870
this is my gentle proposal.

330
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,410
No, sounds like a threat.

331
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,080
I know you don't have the funds.

332
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,660
Bluffing doesn't suit you.

333
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,410
Choi said that?

334
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,540
I'll give it a thought.

335
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,990
By the way...

336
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,370
I saw this tattoo somewhere.

337
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,950
I heard you're looking desperately for it.

338
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,290
Where?

339
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,910
Daddy!

340
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,290
My baby!

341
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,160
You were hiding here?

342
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,620
See you again.

343
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,200
Did you hide long?

344
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,450
Let's go!

345
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,600
So the old lady took off her denture and said,

346
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,810
"we swapped teeth and did it."

347
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,560
We got many older patients,
so we start the day with these jokes.

348
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,440
Same jokes never get old.

349
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,690
Speaking of dentures, I got a story too.

350
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,270
My partner Noh is an ex-homicide detective.

351
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,770
He was quite a character.

352
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,600
We listen in on the police radio,

353
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,980
and arrive at crime scenes before they do,

354
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,690
so we wear diapers in the car during stakeouts.

355
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,190
Is this you?

356
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,150
I'm usually behind the camera.

357
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,480
We were caught doing it,
so we played the crazies.

358
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,900
Why do you do this?

359
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,730
I'll save the shoptalk.

360
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,270
Well, anyway...

361
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,190
- This is...
- I'm Han Ye-won.

362
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,770
Sorry for being late.

363
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,770
She's my girlfriend.

364
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,980
Is this a joke?

365
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,480
What is?

366
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,810
You appear suddenly and ask to partner up,

367
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,270
same name, same rehab, and now this woman.

368
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,440
You're playing with fire.

369
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,060
It's a trendy dress, I feel terrible.

370
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,400
Shall I go change?

371
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,690
I should be saying that to you.

372
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,270
From where I stand, you're just a name,

373
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,900
and you came to me desperate for funding.

374
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,980
Yoo-hwa, my apologies.

375
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,940
I'm slightly drunk.

376
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,020
We'll let you two chat.

377
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,350
Ye-won, let's go to the bar.

378
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,350
Cheese gratin here is amazing.

379
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,810
To be honest,

380
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,520
I wasn't interested in casino business.

381
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,810
Is that so?

382
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,730
Don't misunderstand,

383
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,730
you'll get the money.

384
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,850
But there is a condition.

385
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,940
I've been after a mob boss for years,

386
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,150
he was recently released.

387
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,310
Cho Won-geun?

388
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:53,060
Yes, I need him to dig even deeper.

389
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,270
Yeah?

390
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,100
Is this a coincidence too?

391
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,560
I need to fuck him up too.

392
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,650
That's why I want to partner up with you.

393
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,770
What is it that you're after?

394
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,270
Cocaine.

395
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:09,690
Fuck...

396
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,770
You are grotesque and unnerving,

397
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,980
but we just click.

398
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:23,690
It's weird...

399
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,230
Let's do it.

400
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,020
Got any other requests?

401
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,850
I want to carve your face out,

402
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,440
and put it on my face.

403
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,520
This face is rather troublesome.

404
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,940
I could forgo the contract and kill you.

405
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,980
It was a joke.

406
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,440
My apologies, if I offended you.

407
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,690
This is the contract.

408
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,100
I heard Jang's funds dried up,
where did he get the money?

409
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,350
What happened?

410
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:54,230
This casino deal's making me mad.

411
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,270
Bon appetit.

412
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,940
Frying it lightly removed some poison,

413
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,810
but there's enough to kill you in 3 days.

414
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:21,310
I'm sorry, sir.

415
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,440
Have a great meal.

416
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,400
Should I start now?

417
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,900
Ready, action.

418
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,480
Siesta...

419
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,850
Why did you call it that?

420
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,650
I don't know, it just came to mind.

421
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:36,230
Win or lose at the casino, it's all just a nap,

422
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,400
I thought you'd say something fantastic.

423
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,440
Wrong.

424
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,690
"Something spectacular."

425
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,190
Try again.

426
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:06,350
Win or lose at the casino, it's all just a nap,

427
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,270
I thought you'd say something spectacular.

428
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:20,190
The only thing spectacular is right here.

429
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,900
It's too bright here. Let's go to bed.

430
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,650
Then put this on.

431
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,400
Amazing.

432
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,480
You look like an action movie star.

433
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,440
Okay, gonna be late?

434
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,230
I brought something good,

435
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,440
could I come in for a bit?

436
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
How could you not drink this?

437
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,480
Speak your mind and please leave.

438
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,560
Where did you work 2 years ago?

439
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,940
A private hospital.

440
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,150
You had a husband then.

441
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,650
Get out!

442
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,070
Should I call the police?

443
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:00,020
Since you're assigned to me,
my lawyer vetted you.

444
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,900
He was a CRPS patient.

445
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Incapable of love, land always in pain.

446
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,520
It was a paper marriage,
for insurance purposes.

447
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,900
Fell in love when he was in pain,

448
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,480
and left him after his treatment was over.

449
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,570
You're dating Jang for similar reasons.

450
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,150
In summary,

451
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:31,480
I was told to watch out
since you love men in pain.

452
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,150
It was something like that.

453
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,940
Quite a story.

454
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,820
If I don't take this med,
you'll hear my scream.

455
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,730
That was not in your chart.

456
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,940
Left out, so you wouldn't know.

457
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
But that's...

458
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,150
Come take this off.

459
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,650
I came to ask you that.

460
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,610
I was afraid to look at it alone.

461
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,690
Why didn't you take the pill?

462
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,570
Because you love men in pain.

463
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,440
Got any more?

464
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:29,780
Look at my face.

465
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,070
What do I look like?

466
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,690
Leave it on, it might not heal.

467
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,610
Take the rest off.

468
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,280
Banker 0, player win.

469
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:33,900
You should get some sleep.

470
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,780
I lost half in 2 days.

471
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:44,070
Song displayed maternal instinct
when I was in pain.

472
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,610
How did you know?

473
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:52,400
Those who look after sick parent
or animals as children,

474
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,860
grow up to have strong maternal instinct,

475
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:59,740
I thought Song was such case.

476
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,530
So, to Song, is Jang Tae-young

477
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,900
someone readily replaceable?

478
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:14,900
She'll always fall in love with
a ferocious man who needs her.

479
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,900
Why?

480
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,860
Wanna steal his woman?

481
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,570
$100,000, as promised.

482
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,400
Please send me Jang's charts by next week.

483
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,030
Cho Won-geun, you fucking bitch.

484
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,610
Are you going to blame me for it too?

485
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:46,030
Your lawyer friend is exceptional.

486
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,400
Because he's expensive.

487
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,860
Here's a card key.

488
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,900
(Jang Tae-young)

489
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,280
You wore glasses back then?

490
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,990
Your questions are irritating.

491
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:11,820
With this condo over to you,
the contract's fulfilled,

492
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,150
- so now...
- Now,

493
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,490
we go after Cho.

494
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,490
I'm already on it.

495
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,110
Let me know when you're ready.

496
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,940
Want one?

497
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,110
I'm dying to know what you look like.

498
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,990
You'll find out soon enough.

499
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,440
I hope you like it.

500
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,150
If there's validity to that tip,

501
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,110
Shouldn't we get the intelligence?

502
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,940
We wouldn't be enough.

503
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,530
They'll bring a warrant
to the immigration office.

504
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,440
Did you send the warrant?

505
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,690
Yeah, I just sent it.

506
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,050
How did you know Cho was hiding here?

507
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,210
You're very forthcoming.

508
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,050
This is a raid from the immigration office!

509
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,750
Hurry! Hurry!

510
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,340
Move it!

511
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,550
This should be a death sentence for Cho.

512
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,380
Know how to use it?

513
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:58,820
Our contract ends here,
so we don't need to meet.

514
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:02,860
Casino accountants can settle the rest.

515
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,820
Do you hate me that much?

516
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
Did you think I'd like you?

517
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,360
That face, and how should I put it,

518
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,410
you feel like my imitation.

519
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,280
A stalker, maybe?

520
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:25,490
Or did you get close to me for a story?

521
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,410
I heard you changed your name.

522
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,370
I'm your imitation?

523
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:40,660
Stop wasting our time,

524
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,160
if you mimic me again, I won't let you breathe.

525
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:48,240
And don't come near my woman.

526
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,200
When did you start using?

527
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,200
Did you go through my locker?

528
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,780
It's a synthetic drug, side effect is terrible.

529
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,780
My woman was raped.

530
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,340
1,2,3.

531
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,250
Siesta, its effects will be felt in 7 seconds.

532
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:43,380
Fishy taste will roam in the mouth,
and hallucination will be felt.

533
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:52,090
With lower body temperature,
memory loss can be prevented.

534
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:59,380
This is documentation for my report.

535
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,170
Documentation for my report.

536
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,790
I can conquer myself.

537
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,420
This is...

538
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,880
documentation for my report.

539
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:32,380
I can...conquer myself.

540
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,680
(Choi Nak-hyun)

541
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,010
(Cho Won-geun)

542
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:20,790
(Prof. Kim?)

543
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,210
Oh, and...

544
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,340
this too.

545
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,090
How is it?

546
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:53,790
Is it the face you wanted?

547
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,710
Like something out of a movie,

548
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,840
a domestic mob was caught for producing

549
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,670
and distributing illicit drugs.

550
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:33,210
Seoul Prosecution Office called for
immediate arrest of the mob boss

551
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:36,290
and his henchmen for distributing
a large quantity of cocaine...

552
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,750
A lot of suits upstairs will
get the axe over that.

553
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,250
But I'm good.

554
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:47,540
How did they know the exact location?

555
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,460
Who helped you to go after Cho?

556
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,460
He's a Russian businessman,

557
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:01,370
Sergei, he's a Korean-Russian.

558
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,750
I'll introduce you.

559
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:04,830
Sergei...

560
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:15,200
This case was investigated for many years
by our station's reportage freelancer

561
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,410
Jang Tae-young, who was
instrumental in the arrest...

562
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:23,160
Having investigated violent,
and drug crimes for many years,

563
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:29,790
I realized that the addicts of these crimes
were the real monsters.

564
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:36,450
The woman I love went missing due to this case.

565
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:44,290
It's been 3 years but I will not give up.

566
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:50,330
I don't know if he's here,
but I'd also like to thank

567
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:56,080
my partner-in-crime Det.
Noh Yum for this honor.

568
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:57,620
Thank you.

569
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:16,120
It's been a while.

570
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,000
Thank you for coming.

571
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,700
Thank you for the invite.

572
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,040
Love the game, right?

573
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:24,250
We opened this VIP room.

574
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:28,200
Do I look like a leader now?

575
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,120
Congratulations.

576
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:38,660
There's someone who's trying to mimic me,

577
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
what kind of condition is that?

578
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:47,000
It's called Giovannini Mirror Syndrome,

579
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:53,160
one mimics mannerism and
habits of those around him.

580
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:58,700
It feels appalling,
like out-of-body experience.

581
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,750
I don't think this is something
I can help with.

582
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:09,660
Making someone disappear
in real life is your specialty.

583
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:11,790
That's quite creepy.

584
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,450
Take care.

585
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,830
What's so funny?

586
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,290
It was awkward since we're the same.

587
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:11,950
I said I'll kill you if you mimic me again.

588
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:23,290
Ever think that you're the one mimicking me?

589
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,790
You better leave right now.

590
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:31,830
Why should I?

591
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,620
Don't forget, I own half of this.

592
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,290
What?

593
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:42,500
You better just enjoy this.

594
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:48,080
Shall we toast?

595
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,370
Raise your glass.

596
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,200
Cheers, everyone.

597
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,830
Goddammit!

598
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,080
A drink would be nice.

599
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,700
Old man,

600
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,120
give yourself up and get a private cell.

601
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,450
I'll bring some Beggar's Chicken.

602
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,580
Who wants to bury me?

603
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,040
You don't even suspect me?

604
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,120
You like me.

605
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:51,120
Tell me which Russian was behind it.

606
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,370
If that reporter testifies, you're dead.

607
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,500
If you want to live, you'll have to help me.

608
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,530
After the party,

609
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:03,730
I could get the bustard reporter to go
wherever you want.

610
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:05,940
Isn't that enough?

611
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,400
Hey, listen.

612
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,480
Where did you see the man with the same tattoo?

613
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,230
I'll call back.

614
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:30,730
It's been too long, you feel like a stranger.

615
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:37,530
How are these missing person cases related?

616
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:41,900
They were the addicts
of the drug we've been after.

617
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:45,690
The truth will come out when Cho is caught.

618
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:52,820
The one who worked under Cho
was Prof. Kim's right-hand man.

619
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:59,030
Prof. Kim is Cho's hostile rival drug dealer.

620
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:02,070
No, Russian mafia to be precise.

621
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,900
Real name is Sergei.

622
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,570
Evidence?

623
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,480
He's in the country right now.

624
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,980
Come with me.

625
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,320
Let's dig together.

626
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:35,690
1, 2, 3, 4...

627
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:37,110
Crazy bastard...

628
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:39,150
5, 6

629
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,530
7..

630
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:57,820
Did you...

631
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:00,530
give me drugs?

632
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:03,610
Feels good, doesn't it?

633
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:04,980
What?

634
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:11,260
Crippled a town bully and went to the juvie,

635
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:13,300
Did you really do that?

636
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,970
Wanna hear the truth?

637
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:19,300
You went to a regular school,
and a model student at that.

638
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:23,260
A crazy bitch bit off your nipple?

639
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:29,470
You actually got hurt while on a case.

640
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:33,550
You knew, didn't you?

641
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:37,050
That you're my imitation.

642
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,390
Shut up!

643
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:44,300
You became an addict 3 years ago
while chasing the drug.

644
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:48,890
So you emerged from me to play a gangster.

645
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:54,300
Do you know how old you are?

646
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,550
3 years old.

647
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,390
My woman was raped.

648
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:06,140
Buddy!

649
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,510
You never had a woman.

650
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:16,010
How dare you try to kill the real thing?

651
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,260
You cannot become me.

652
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,430
But I can though.

653
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,890
Mimicking isn't good enough.

654
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,890
Everything is inside me,

655
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:30,680
it's all mine!

656
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:42,640
I'm real.

657
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,840
Yoo-hwa.

658
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,430
Where's the next party?

659
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:41,180
Party?

660
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:31,720
Buying drugs on the streets?

661
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,470
Why can't you quit?

662
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,680
What does it matter to you?

663
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,680
You're a fake.

664
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:46,140
No.

665
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:52,590
I'm someone who loves you,
despite knowing the truth.

666
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,550
I'm your real.

667
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:14,180
Do you know why you love
a schizophrenic 3-year old?

668
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:22,800
Because he's an ego derived
from wanting to quit drugs.

669
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:26,970
Don't be like him.

670
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:29,640
Conquer it.

671
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,760
Like me.

672
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,720
Get out!

673
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,260
Get up, get up!

674
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:05,390
You want to call it even for
killing that fucking reporter?

675
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:11,750
Find out who came after me and bring him to me.

676
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:15,710
Or she's dead.

677
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:19,210
(Det. Noh Yum)

678
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,290
(3 months later)

679
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:11,880
Baek.

680
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,750
Baek Jong-gu.

681
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,210
Tae-young,

682
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:40,210
stop pressuring the Russians, they're partners.

683
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,460
You're embarrassing me.

684
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:55,040
She's been kidnapped for 3 months,

685
01:40:57,370 --> 01:40:59,620
it's unlikely that she's still alive.

686
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:05,160
She's alive.

687
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,540
How can I help you then?

688
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,620
Hand Ryu Kil-su over to Cho.

689
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:17,660
Planting Ryu in his mob was
the source of trouble.

690
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,330
That may be difficult.

691
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:33,290
If you don't want to lose all
and flee to Russia,

692
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:35,790
you better produce him.

693
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:43,330
Where's the bastard?

694
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,080
I'll help you up to here.

695
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:48,910
I can't do anything more.

696
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:52,450
Be careful.

697
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:14,580
You came back after greenlighting me?

698
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:17,620
I know Cho,

699
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:22,160
let me contact him, I'll get it done.

700
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:25,620
She's mine, I'll take care of it.

701
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:31,740
If you come back, I will kill you.

702
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,620
Tae-young.

703
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:14,370
Stay out of this case.

704
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:17,240
It's my work.

705
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:42,830
(Euphoria That Changed the World)

706
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,790
Who have you brought?

707
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,740
Just a single rat?

708
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,080
Do you really have the balls to sell me off?

709
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,830
Who do you work for?

710
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:05,910
Sergei...

711
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,370
Kil-Su,

712
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:12,860
look at my eyes.

713
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:17,860
You know me well.

714
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:25,320
Boris...Boris...

715
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,940
Where's the girl?

716
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,390
You feel different.

717
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:50,230
Talks like a douche,

718
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:52,640
you're a different man.

719
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:13,390
What's with this faggot outfit?

720
01:46:17,230 --> 01:46:18,770
Boris...

721
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:24,850
Bring me Boris right away.

722
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:59,100
Did you bring it?

723
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:06,100
Walther PPQ Striker,

724
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:10,230
it's the best polymer pistol.

725
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:17,850
Next up, Sergei Kim.

726
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:21,350
He was an infamous character.

727
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:29,890
I assigned a 24-hour bodyguard to you.

728
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:33,440
Former Spetsnaz officer and mafia enforcer,

729
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,310
and known as Prof. Kim.

730
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:58,390
(Det. Noh: 2 New Messages)

731
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,690
Who are you?

732
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:24,690
So you're real,

733
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:27,940
and the one I dealt with is a fake?

734
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,280
Fucker

735
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:45,030
You're confusing me.

736
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:50,650
Hello?

737
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:53,650
Let me ask you something.

738
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:57,650
What's my favorite dish?

739
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:06,490
You shot the wrong one.

740
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:09,900
I know I shot the writer.

741
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,110
Fuck, I'm so confused.

742
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:17,280
Where's the girl?

743
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:51,080
Sergei...

744
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:54,660
Boris, know them?

745
01:53:56,950 --> 01:53:59,450
Let's start with Sergei.

746
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:02,540
He's working with that reporter.

747
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:13,490
Kill anyone who gets in the way!

748
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:17,330
Kill anyone who hurts me!

749
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:46,660
Hey, councilor.

750
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,080
Who's Boris?

751
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,410
Answer me.

752
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:00,790
(Boris)

753
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:03,370
This Siesta...

754
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:08,200
Fucking amazing.

755
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:17,120
You asked about a man with the same tattoo.

756
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:19,740
It's my family doctor.

757
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:22,580
He's safely guarding your woman.

758
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:27,370
(Lawyer: Boris Rognof, Choi Jin-ki)

759
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,540
So you're Boris?

760
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:09,040
No, I'm not Boris.

761
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:13,160
Just a doctor, who develops new meds.

762
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:16,620
Drugs, you mean.

763
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:23,830
So the meds you got while here were drugs?

764
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:27,200
Did you take them to get high?

765
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:28,620
No.

766
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,910
You received salvation.

767
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:35,450
See? You are reborn.

768
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,410
Siesta.

769
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:22,990
This gave you a new life.

770
01:57:23,330 --> 01:57:27,240
Depending on how it's used,
it could save or kill a man.

771
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:31,290
Siesta, it means "nap."

772
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,540
Isn't it funny?

773
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:39,830
Even in vegetative state, you were an addict.

774
01:57:40,370 --> 01:57:43,950
To survive the addiction,
you created a new ego,

775
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:47,450
and used it to witness your own survival.

776
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:49,530
That was intriguing.

777
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:53,070
Then something interesting happened.

778
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:57,780
The new ego that was created
to exist in painful hell,

779
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,440
went to you, who was suicidal.

780
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:06,280
Coincidence? Fate?

781
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:11,190
Existing in a shell, like a ghost,

782
01:58:11,570 --> 01:58:18,150
you latched onto the ego, like this magnet.

783
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:29,820
Where's Yoo-hwa?

784
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:36,900
Right here,

785
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:41,530
but the person who left her
didn't say she was 3-month pregnant.

786
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:46,990
She's a filthy rat, who stole painkillers.

787
01:58:47,190 --> 01:58:49,780
She was already a Siesta addict.

788
01:58:56,860 --> 01:59:00,400
The only ones who got over
Siesta's addiction are you, me,

789
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:03,190
and Jang Tae-young.

790
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:07,900
You see what's real by losing everything.

791
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:11,530
When we become addicted to it,
you'll find the real you.

792
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:16,070
Die off, or the survival instinct
brings out the real you, like Jang.

793
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,900
We'll all die.

794
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:22,240
Once balance is lost,
even bigger balance is achieved.

795
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,740
It's okay, it's okay.
