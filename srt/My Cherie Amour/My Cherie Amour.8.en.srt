00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
<i>It's my present to Anong.</i>

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,480
I'll propose to her tonight.

4
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
That's Prapat. Anong's dream guy.

5
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,600
Isn't he a perfect match for her?

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,040
Will you marry me?

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,320
I can only think of you as a friend.

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,200
Have you seen Wichai?
I haven't seen him yet.

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,040
He's probably with Chantorn.
They're here together.

10
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
Here's your birthday present.

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,080
I bet that you didn't
even pick this yourself.

12
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,040
Chantorn picked it for you, right?

13
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,160
<i>This whole situation is complicated.</i>

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,199
You must accept that
this love is impossible.

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,720
This is dangerous.

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,960
I don't care if I die.

17
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,840
Chut left the party last night
and didn't come home.

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
Are you sure
you're not here to see Chantorn?

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,080
Here's the train ticket
you asked me to book for you, sir.

20
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,720
SAWANKHALOK

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
<i>Chut hasn't come home yet.
I wonder where they went.</i>

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you think they got into an accident?

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
He's so irresponsible.

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,480
Who knows what trouble
he got himself and Chantorn into?

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,680
This could hurt her reputation.

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,360
What was Chut thinking?

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,440
Choy, call me right away
if Chut comes home.

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,720
Okay.

29
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Sir!

30
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
Please help us.

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,640
Our car broke down.

32
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,079
So what are you going to do next?

33
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
What can I do?

34
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,840
I'll have to move to Korat.

35
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,240
No woman would be willing

36
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,400
to live a life of hardship

37
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,320
in such a remote place like that with me.

38
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
Especially…

39
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,800
a spoiled, rich girl like Anong.

40
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,840
If you have lived
in the countryside before,

41
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
you'll find it's not so bad.

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Hey.

43
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,640
Chantorn.

44
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
Life in the countryside
isn't full of hardships.

45
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,640
In the countryside,

46
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
you can always find things to eat.

47
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Give it a try.

48
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Thank you for talking some sense into me.

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,760
I might've gotten myself killed
if it weren't for you.

50
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
Just think of this as your chance

51
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,440
at a new life.

52
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,920
People can always start over.

53
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
Chantorn.

54
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
Where have you two been?

55
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Why are you back at this hour?

56
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you okay?

57
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,120
Yes.

58
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,880
Did you know you crashed
into someone's car last night?

59
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
I panicked.

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
You made everything worse

61
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,520
by running away.

62
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
Why would you drink and drive?

63
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,360
It was really an accident.

64
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,040
I was there with him.
I know he didn't mean for it to happen.

65
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll be happy to explain
to the car's owner what happened.

66
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,480
What about the fact that

67
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,520
you were out all night with Chantorn?

68
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Did you mean to do that?

69
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,200
Nothing happened.

70
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,960
Chut behaved like a true gentleman.

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
I can vouch for him.

72
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,080
Most importantly, it was me
who got into the car with him.

73
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Please don't blame Chut for this.

74
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,640
I was just worried,
so I decided to go with him.

75
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,880
No one pressed charges,
but you still caused trouble.

76
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,520
You need to learn

77
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,640
to behave more responsibly.

78
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,160
Anong turned me down

79
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,920
and said she loved someone else.

80
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,360
I didn't know what to do.

81
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
That's your business.

82
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
Just deal with your problems.

83
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,320
Don't take your anger out on others.

84
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,520
People aren't your punching bags.

85
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,480
Stop being selfish.

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Just say you're jealous.

87
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,680
You're mad I took Chantorn with me, right?

88
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,200
You wouldn't be this mad
if I were with someone else.

89
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,000
You're the one who's lashing out.

90
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Don't point a finger at me.
This is all on you, Chut.

91
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,920
You're just jealous.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,320
You're afraid I'll steal your girl, right?

93
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,280
So you're making a big deal

94
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,120
out of absolutely nothing.

95
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,559
I'm trying to warn you.

96
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,799
- You're the one lashing out.
- You're mad at me.

97
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,120
You're just afraid that
this will affect your career.

98
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,280
You're afraid the trouble I caused
will hurt your reputation as a judge.

99
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,640
You crashed your car.

100
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,480
Don't think you can just get
the car fixed and things will be okay.

101
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,520
Anong's family is against you
because of how immature you are.

102
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,280
You don't deserve her.

103
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,280
No wonder a perfect girl like Anong
doesn't want to be with you.

104
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,400
What's going on?
Why are they fighting about girls?

105
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I never thought this would happen.

106
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
It's strange.

107
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
I have everything,

108
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,000
yet my life feels empty
all because of one person.

109
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,960
That's what adulthood is.

110
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,280
We don't always get everything we want.

111
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,640
Then that means

112
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
I am an adult now.

113
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,800
I can't stand being
secretly in love with someone.

114
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,320
I can't stand seeing
the person I love with someone else.

115
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,640
No one can be wise
and be in love at the same time.

116
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,680
When you're in love with someone,

117
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,320
you become blind to their true intentions.

118
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
And no one can talk sense into you.

119
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,840
But it's worth it to be blindly in love
even just once.

120
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,120
Think about it.

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,280
How many people in your life

122
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,320
can make you smile like that?

123
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Those were my words.

124
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,120
He remembers.

125
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
Don't be sad.

126
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,240
It's worth it to have loved someone
that much once in your life.

127
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,960
I am now 23 years old.

128
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,240
This is the first time I feel grown up.

129
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,880
Get it together.

130
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
I just spoke with Mr. Pong.

131
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,560
He's at the bank with a client,
so it will be a while

132
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
before he comes home.

133
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Is there something urgent?

134
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm here to talk
about the car that was damaged.

135
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,440
I want to pay for the damages Chut caused.

136
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,880
I see. The guest found out
that Chut was your brother.

137
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,720
- He didn't want compensation.
- I insist.

138
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
My brother was at fault.
Let me take responsibility.

139
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,360
At least give me his number
so I can call to apologize.

140
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm not sure if I have it.

141
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,280
I can try to find it for you.

142
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,400
Is this Wichai, the man you told me about?

143
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,560
I heard that
you are a good judge of character.

144
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160
I'm Prapat.

145
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,120
I heard that you are very good
at reading people.

146
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
So I want to see for myself.

147
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,760
I'm not a mind reader
or anything like that.

148
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,960
How can you be sure
you won't misjudge someone?

149
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,720
When you're too sure
of your own thoughts and judgment,

150
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
you might not see the good qualities
in someone. Right, Anong?

151
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,840
Let's not bother him anymore.

152
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,080
I used to wonder whether Anong's dream guy

153
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,600
would turn out to be her nightmare.

154
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Now I got my answer.

155
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,440
You're prejudiced against rich people.

156
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,640
Pong knows that about you.

157
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,560
So he asked you to help screen
the men that want her money.

158
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,040
But let me tell you. I'm not one of them.

159
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,560
There are other things
you could take from her besides money.

160
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,240
If you're trying to pit
Anong and I against each other,

161
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,560
it won't work.

162
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,320
I also hope that
I'm just imagining things.

163
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
You want to marry a mine owner.

164
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
You might strike out
before you strike gold.

165
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,240
Let's drink, guys.

166
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,560
I almost didn't see the glass.

167
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,480
Maybe it was too close.

168
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,320
Hey.

169
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,840
You just caused an accident.

170
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,640
You're on probation. You shouldn't be out.

171
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,400
My friends are throwing me
a farewell party, so I had to come.

172
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,440
I'll give you ten minutes.

173
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,400
If you won't leave,
you can pay for the car repairs yourself.

174
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
- Thanks, guys. See you later.
- See you.

175
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
I didn't expect to see you
at a place like this.

176
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
I went to see you at your house.

177
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,840
I wanted to talk
about last night's accident.

178
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
He sure looks remorseful.

179
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,080
He finally shows his true colors.

180
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
Anong's lucky
to have dodged a guy like him.

181
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,080
This is when you see
who someone really is.

182
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,760
You're right that Chut
isn't a good match for Anong.

183
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,560
But you didn't have to go to such lengths

184
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,040
to get him out of Anong's life.

185
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
You and Prapat already know each other.

186
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,320
Every time another guy
came into Anong's life,

187
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
you'd ask me to look into that person.

188
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
With Prapat, you didn't.

189
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,720
Prasit was the only one

190
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,920
who asked me to find out
about Anong's secret admirer.

191
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,960
You already called off our deal.

192
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,760
I know Prapat was a junior
that you were close to in college.

193
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,240
I saw that you have his number.

194
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,600
PRAPAT 10801

195
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,560
<i>This guy must be very special to you</i>

196
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,480
<i>to make you open that wine.</i>

197
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,840
You once said that
you were saving that bottle of wine

198
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,760
to drink with someone special.

199
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,640
Put it in my office.

200
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,760
Yes, sir.

201
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,079
It's a good wine.

202
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
You should drink it with someone special.

203
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Is Prapat that person?

204
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
You already knew

205
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
that Prapat was the man on the ship

206
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,880
since you two were close.

207
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,480
Once Prapat knew Anong was your sister,

208
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,200
<i>he took care of her
throughout their journey.</i>

209
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,120
<i>The reason you didn't tell anyone
that you knew each other</i>

210
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,000
was probably
because you two had a falling-out.

211
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
How did I know you two became estranged?

212
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
<i>I saw the photo in your office</i>

213
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,080
<i>that you kept on the bookshelf.</i>

214
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,640
<i>The photo was ripped in half</i>

215
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,040
because you didn't dare let anyone see it.

216
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
You're still single

217
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,720
and unmarried.

218
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,920
I think it's because you have a love
that you can't tell anyone.

219
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,080
It would be wrong

220
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
if you tried to push Anong
to be with your guy

221
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,960
only to get rid of me and Chut.

222
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,800
Don't talk nonsense.

223
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
Do you have proof?

224
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,440
I bet that the other half of the photo

225
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,160
is probably in your wallet.

226
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,680
Shall we see if I'm right?

227
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,840
What are you interrogating me for?

228
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,480
Sompong, let me tell you something.

229
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,000
Chut isn't the only one
who doesn't deserve Anong.

230
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,840
You also don't deserve her.

231
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
You want to keep your love hidden

232
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,680
and you'll make that guy
your brother-in-law as a cover.

233
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,880
Anong is too good
to be sharing a guy with anyone,

234
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,920
especially with her own brother.

235
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,160
Are you looking out for Anong

236
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,800
because you want to win her heart?

237
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
If that's what I want to do,

238
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,840
I can just go to her
and tell her the truth.

239
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,800
You act like Anong
would lower herself to be with you

240
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,240
if you could keep her
from seeing other guys.

241
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,200
We can wish someone well

242
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
without wanting anything in return.

243
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
I may be horrible,

244
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,040
but I've never made Anong cry.

245
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,640
A saint like you

246
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,000
has hurt her countless times.

247
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,000
You'll always choose to do what's right

248
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
because you care too much
about your integrity.

249
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,440
Your self-righteousness is the reason
why you can't love anyone.

250
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,200
Master!

251
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
Boi! Come take Chut inside.

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,760
My gosh!

253
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
You should go answer the phone.

254
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,480
Warathabut's residence.

255
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,280
What were you trying to do
earlier this evening?

256
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,600
What did I do?

257
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,320
What did you find out
to give me that kind of warning?

258
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,960
You said you wouldn't let me
put ideas into your head anymore.

259
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>So why are you losing sleep
over this tiny matter?</i>

260
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,600
Wichai, you need to stop.
I've never once judged

261
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,320
<i>anyone you like.</i>

262
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,160
<i>Yet you take it upon yourself</i>

263
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,080
<i>to always find fault with the guy I like.</i>

264
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,680
I've never judged you.

265
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,040
I can tell from the look in your eyes
that you're judging us.

266
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,760
Do you think I'm judging you?

267
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Listen.

268
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,120
Don't you normally have
a tendency to assume things?

269
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,840
Wichai, please just get out of my life

270
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,480
and leave me alone from now on.

271
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
Sure.

272
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,480
<i>And please stay out of my business.</i>

273
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,960
No problem.

274
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,280
Do you think you're so much better
than everyone else?

275
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,720
I hope you fall in love
with a lousy woman.

276
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,200
<i>Then I'll talk so much trash about her</i>

277
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,080
that you can't love her anymore.

278
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,680
Here you go.

279
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,760
Master!

280
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,440
Doesn't it hurt?

281
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
What?

282
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,040
My gosh! Your hand is burned!

283
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,880
Choy! Wichai got burned!

284
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,880
His hand is burned!

285
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,880
Choy!

286
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,480
You should've at least called
instead of disappearing like this.

287
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,160
See that? All she does
is try to look pretty for customers.

288
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,360
She's especially eager
when the customer is Mr. Chut.

289
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,840
Get back to work.

290
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,120
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,880
You're right.

292
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,880
Do you know

293
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,320
which lamp is the most popular
with our customers?

294
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
This one.

295
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,880
People like this lamp because it's pretty.

296
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,360
It's made from a single piece of glass

297
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,240
which makes its light
more pleasant to the eyes.

298
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,280
However,

299
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,880
it's so expensive
that most people can't afford it.

300
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,320
As for these two lamps,
they are of the same quality.

301
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,640
But people tend to buy
the second-most expensive one

302
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,600
and disregard the cheapest one.

303
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,840
5 BAHT

304
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,880
It's the same with people.

305
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,360
People want what's best for themselves.

306
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,200
But if what's best is out of their reach,

307
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,800
they will choose to settle
for second best.

308
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
We set a higher price for this lamp

309
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,680
to make people feel good about buying it.

310
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,280
It gives them consolation

311
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,440
that at the very least,

312
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,520
the lamp they get isn't the cheapest one.

313
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,600
What about you?

314
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,440
Which lamp do you like?

315
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,680
20 BAHT

316
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,080
20 BAHT

317
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Here, ma'am.

318
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,760
Chut is taking me
to a concert after work today.

319
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,040
Can you come get me once he's here?

320
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,160
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,520
Thank you.

322
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,440
Hello. Welcome to Deco Plaza.

323
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,960
How can I help you?

324
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm here to see--

325
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
I thought you would be so mad at me

326
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,480
that you wouldn't want to be my friend.

327
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,120
You asked me to come, so here I am.

328
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Thank you for your understanding.

329
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,520
You're still my best friend.

330
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,000
Where are you going?

331
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm going home.

332
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,520
I've been here too long.

333
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,680
You said you'd find a way to move here.

334
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,720
I came here because you reached out to me.

335
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,280
I thought you changed your mind,

336
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,480
but you just called me here for Anong.

337
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,120
You still can't bring yourself
to tell people about us.

338
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,240
Don't you see the position that I'm in?

339
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,400
I have to keep us a secret.

340
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,600
It doesn't matter why you called me here.

341
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,560
I'll never lie to Anong.

342
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,160
I want her to be happy.

343
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,160
I don't want to see her get used like me.

344
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,880
Someday,

345
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,760
I'll make you cry like you made me.

346
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,160
<i>I bet that the other half of the photo</i>

347
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,960
<i>is probably in your wallet.</i>

348
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,240
Your car is in the repair shop.

349
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,960
I took a rickshaw here.

350
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,880
Is that so?

351
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,120
I'll get my driver to drive us.

352
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,000
Are you embarrassed

353
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,400
to ride on a rickshaw with me?

354
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,680
Did you lend me your car

355
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,480
because you were embarrassed
that I didn't have one?

356
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,360
Are you picking a fight with me?

357
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,160
I should've realized since then

358
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
that you disdain me.

359
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,720
So you're still mad at me.

360
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
You won't forgive me?

361
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,280
If you want us to be friends,

362
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,240
get on a rickshaw with me

363
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,760
to show that you sincerely
want to be my friend.

364
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,200
Chantorn.

365
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,400
Where are you going?

366
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,720
Let me take you.

367
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,640
What about Ms. Anong?

368
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,880
We'll go our separate ways.

369
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,000
<i>You're not the person she wants.</i>

370
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,120
<i>You're just her second choice.</i>

371
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,040
Chut isn't home.

372
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,280
Mom made him go apologize to Sa-Ang.

373
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,560
Lady Mayom said that
if those two get engaged,

374
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,400
she will talk to the general
into letting Chut stay in Bangkok.

375
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,080
Does this mean that

376
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,800
Chut is already over Anong?

377
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,560
Here you are, Chut.

378
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
Please wait a moment.

379
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,840
If you don't want to wait long,

380
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,680
come do my nails for me.

381
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,320
Excuse me.

382
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,640
You can go do my sister's nails.

383
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,600
This is much better
than being out in the countryside.

385
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,320
Come on, then.

386
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,960
Hang on.

387
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Looks like my nails are done.

388
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,520
Well, then.

389
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,840
You can wash my feet.

390
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,920
In your eyes,

391
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,400
do you think I'm good enough for you?

392
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
<i>Considering my family's history,</i>

393
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,440
<i>you're too good to be marrying
into the Warathabut family.</i>

394
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,080
When people fall in love
for the first time,

395
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,400
they often assume that
that love will be their last.

396
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,880
But when they find a new love,

397
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
it often makes them feel like

398
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,280
they're falling in love
for the first time.

399
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,800
<i>Why don't you give love another chance</i>

400
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,680
<i>and start over with someone new?</i>

401
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
<i>Who knows?</i>

402
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,280
<i>Maybe this person
will really be your first love.</i>

403
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,000
Mr. Wichai is here to see your aunts.

404
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,400
I already told him they're not home.

405
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,480
I'm here to return the car.

406
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,600
I meant to leave it here with your aunts.

407
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,200
I already had the car fixed.

408
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,600
I apologize it took so long.

409
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,280
I plan to leave the car here
so my aunts can use it.

410
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,240
You can leave the key on the table.

411
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,400
Thank you.

412
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,960
Are you here
to pick up your dress, Ms. Anong?

413
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,640
We got lots of orders for the dress
you had us tailor last time.

414
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,080
Everyone wants to wear
what you're wearing.

415
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,040
They will probably want this dress too.

416
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Thank you.

417
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,080
I'll come back later for the dress
that I brought in for alterations.

418
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,560
Maybe you can pick it up for me, Chut.

419
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,440
All right?

420
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,280
Let's go, Payom.

421
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,560
Can you fetch my dress
from the dressing room?

422
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,680
I got it.

423
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
All right.

424
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,480
If you won't forgive me
just because I turned you down,

425
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,400
then we're not really friends.

426
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,840
And if you're seeing other women
just to provoke me,

427
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,760
then you clearly don't know me.

428
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,840
You should know that
those women can't get under my skin.

429
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,240
Maybe I really don't know you.

430
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,840
I couldn't even tell
you kept me around as an option.

431
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,280
If you're this angry with me,
it shows that you still care about me.

432
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,560
When can we move on and be friends again?

433
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,840
Well?

434
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,680
You can call me a sore loser.

435
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,760
In your eyes,

436
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,199
I'm not much of a man anyway.

437
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,639
Go ahead and reject my friendship
if it will make you feel better.

438
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
It might give you

439
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,120
the satisfaction
of getting to hurt me back,

440
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
but it still won't get you love.

441
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,280
What a coincidence.
What are you doing here?

442
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm running errands.

443
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,120
Do you want to pick Nid up
from school with me?

444
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,760
I'm busy. I'm sorry.

445
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,600
That's okay.

446
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,400
Are you back together with Sa-Ang?

447
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Since I can't marry the girl I love,

448
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,120
it makes no difference who I marry.

449
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,120
Do you think that's fair to the woman?

450
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,720
You don't want me seeing Chantorn.

451
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,160
Now you have a problem
that I'm with Sa-Ang.

452
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm staying away from Chantorn
for your sake.

453
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,880
What more do you want?

454
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,800
What is it?

455
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,640
You have a guest, sir.

456
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,560
So what brings you to Bangkok, Urai?

457
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm worried about Chantorn.

458
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
I've received word that

459
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,200
Chantorn is seeing someone.

460
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
They say he often comes to her house

461
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,800
and that she even lets him
stay over sometimes.

462
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,160
I'm here to see if it's true.

463
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Who's the man she's seeing?

464
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,360
I meant to ask you whether
you know anything about him.

465
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,120
Maybe it's one of her colleagues.

466
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,120
I'm worried that she lets a man
have his way with her so easily.

467
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,360
<i>I came to Bangkok to find out
who Chantorn is seeing.</i>

468
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,120
<i>When I asked her,</i>

469
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
<i>she said that she wasn't seeing anyone.</i>

470
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,960
<i>I'm worried that the man she's seeing
might already be married.</i>

471
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,880
Here's some water.

472
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,000
Hey.

473
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,400
Your sock has a hole in it.

474
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,360
Let go.

475
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,120
I used to go visit Chantorn at her house.

476
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,320
I would pick her up and drive her to work.

477
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,840
I'm not sure if I'm the man
that people are talking about.

478
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,080
Really?

479
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,840
If it's you,
then let those gossipmongers talk.

480
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,520
At least if that man is you,

481
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm confident that
you won't do anything inappropriate.

482
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,920
Okay.

483
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,040
Well…

484
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,720
Nid ate all of the chocolate you gave her.

485
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,560
She really loved it.

486
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,120
She's been asking me

487
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,720
to get her some more.

488
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,160
Go ahead.

489
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,160
Thank you.

490
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,720
Ms. Anong.

491
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,400
Is this the chocolate you asked for?

492
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
Shall I gift-wrap it for you?

493
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,760
That won't be necessary.
You can put it away.

494
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,320
Please tell Choy to let me know
if she needs anything else

496
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,040
from the store.

497
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,760
Thank you for the trouble.

498
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,680
Choy shouldn't have bothered you.

499
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
So they're really seeing each other.

500
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,560
I thought I was important to him

501
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,440
when I was actually just an outsider.

502
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,880
But he's always been nice to us.

503
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,560
I don't believe that
he likes that woman more than you.

504
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,200
You won't know how he feels
if you keep playing coy.

505
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,160
Come on, Anong.

506
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,040
I'll move on

507
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,320
if he doesn't want me.

508
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,680
I just feel betrayed.

509
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,280
I hope the same thing
happens to him someday.

510
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,360
Well, I'll talk to you later.

511
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
See you.

512
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,640
See you later. Thank you.

513
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,680
I walked past Chut earlier,

514
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,840
but he didn't see me.

515
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,880
He was with a woman,
so I didn't dare go up to him.

516
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,120
When did he break up with his girlfriend?

517
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,440
He jumps from one girl
to the next like it's a game.

518
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,000
This is so typical of a player like him.

519
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,560
Let's go home.

520
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,280
Thank you for dinner.

521
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,000
The food was delicious.

522
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,400
Chut, where should we go for drinks?

523
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,560
Between the two of them,

524
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,960
Wichai is a much better man than Chut.

525
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,160
He's not a flashy guy,
but he's consistent.

526
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,520
And he's also loyal.

527
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,920
He makes a woman feel safe.

528
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,560
When you choose a partner,

529
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,240
don't let yourself be fooled
by a man's sweet words.

530
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,680
So what do you think?

531
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Are you interested in Wichai?

532
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,600
Wichai has never shown any interest in me.

533
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,480
What if he asks you to marry him?

534
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,000
Will you say yes to him?

535
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,240
At this moment,
I'm willing to marry whoever

536
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,480
that proposes to me first.

537
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,040
Marriage doesn't always bring happiness.

538
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
If you marry someone you love,

539
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,760
your love for that person
will eventually fade.

540
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,360
But if you marry a good man,

541
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,040
you'll forever be happy.

542
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,120
This is for you.

543
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,280
Why are you giving me this?

544
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,960
Congratulations on your new job.

545
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,680
Men like women
to follow them around like shadows.

546
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
On the other hand,

547
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,880
they can't stand

548
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,880
to be under anyone's shadow.

549
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,200
That's why Chut and I aren't a good match.

550
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,200
When it comes down to it, he doesn't like
to be overshadowed by anyone.

551
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,880
This is why

552
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Chut will never follow Sa-Ang around
and live under her shadow.

553
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,360
Do you also know about those two?

554
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,640
I want Chut to be
with the person he loves.

555
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,320
I don't want him to have any regrets.

556
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,240
Wichai dropped by to see you.

557
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,400
Go get him some water.

558
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,720
Okay.

559
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,760
Luang Turakit forced me
to take Chantorn back to Sawankhalok.

560
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,680
A man back home has approached him
and asked for Chantorn's hand

561
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,920
in marriage.

562
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,640
I don't think I should let
Chantorn stay here any longer.

563
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,920
She must come back with me
no matter what happens.

564
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,920
Chantorn hasn't yet taken a lover.

565
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,640
It looks like I'll have
to arrange a marriage for her.

566
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,560
Why is that?

567
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,560
A beautiful woman like her
will attract plenty of men.

568
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,360
But if no one is willing
to commit themselves to her,

569
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,160
she will only become a toy for them.

570
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,600
Wichai.

571
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,520
Can you help convince Chantorn
to settle down and start a family?

572
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,040
How can I convince her to do that?

573
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,000
Or maybe you can find
a good man in Bangkok for her.

574
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,800
Can you think of anyone?

575
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,160
Do you want to go back to Sawankhalok?

576
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,240
I can help talk to Luang Turakit
to let you stay.

577
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,120
I don't want to trouble you.

578
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,240
Or if you don't want to be alone,

579
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,280
I'd like you to come live at my house.

580
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,160
Your family might be less worried

581
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,120
with Choy there to look after you.

582
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,040
It's okay.

583
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,200
I think

584
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,240
I can solve this problem on my own.

585
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,960
The madams are at the temple, sir.

586
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,760
I know they went to the temple
to make merit. I'm here to see--

587
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,600
You play beautifully.

588
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,800
Thank you.

589
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,920
Nid was so excited.

590
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,560
She wanted me to ask you

591
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,720
if you could play every day.

592
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,920
I thought you all
would be annoyed by my playing.

593
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,080
If it's possible,

594
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,040
I'd like to hear you play every day.

595
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,640
You should come play again.

596
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
I love listening to you play.

597
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,040
This is the first time I have a reason
to want to come home early.

598
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,120
I'm not forcing you to do it.

599
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,560
I'm just asking.

600
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,760
I think you're asking the wrong person.

601
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,400
I can only play one Thai song.

602
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,760
I'm afraid that

603
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,120
you might get tired

604
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,560
of hearing it by tomorrow.

605
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,120
I'm sure you can play
other songs just as beautifully.

606
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,200
Why are you complimenting me
all of a sudden?

607
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,360
Well…

608
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,240
Because it's true.

609
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,000
Or maybe

610
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,200
you don't really mean anything by it.

611
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,360
You need to watch what you say.

612
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,080
You might make someone think

613
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,160
that they're important to you

614
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,000
when you don't actually feel
that way about them.

615
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,640
Your casual remarks

616
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,320
can affect others more than you think.

617
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,120
Anyway, thank you
for always showing me kindness.

618
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,600
Thank you.

619
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,400
Where are you going?

620
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,040
I'm moving to Korat.

621
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,520
I thought you'd do anything
so you could stay here.

622
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,000
I'd rather move away than marry a woman

623
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,760
who treats me like a servant.

624
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,000
Mom already got an auspicious date
for your wedding.

625
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,000
If you want to leave,
you need to go talk to her.

626
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,800
Don't just run away like this.

627
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,280
What auspicious date?

628
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,720
Do you have to be in court
the day after tomorrow?

629
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,520
Can you take a day off?

630
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,880
I'm off work that day.

631
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,520
I have to take Nid
to apply to a new school.

632
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,120
Choy asked me to be her guardian.

633
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,600
Since you have the day off,

634
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,080
can you come with me
to ask Sa-Ang to marry Chut?

635
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,720
I want you to ask for her hand
on behalf of him.

636
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,120
Mom is asking Sa-Ang to marry you

637
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,360
so you can be married next month.

638
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,760
Are you sure?

639
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,640
Have you told Chut?

640
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,160
<i>He will never ask her himself.</i>

641
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,160
<i>This is all I ask of you.</i>

642
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,080
<i>Just go ask for her hand for Chut.</i>

643
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,000
As for the dowry, I'll pay for it myself

644
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,640
<i>no matter how much they ask.</i>

645
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,080
<i>I'm sorry for causing you trouble.</i>

646
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,360
<i>Choy must've told your family about us.</i>

647
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,040
<i>I just want to say goodbye.</i>

648
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,040
<i>We probably won't see each other again.</i>

649
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,320
<i>Please take care of yourself.</i>

650
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,480
<i>A guy like Chut</i>

651
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,040
probably wants a woman who worships him

652
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,280
and devotes her life to him.

653
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,960
<i>I happen to know him too well.</i>

654
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,920
<i>So I know that</i>

655
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,840
<i>Chut is a total softy.</i>

656
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,680
<i>If you want to win his heart,</i>

657
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,160
you can't push him around
like Sa-Ang does.

658
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,000
Hello.

659
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

660
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,680
- Are you also giving alms?
- Yes.

661
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,800
Carry on, then.

662
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,680
Well, I haven't seen Chut around lately.

663
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,560
I guess he's still avoiding me.

664
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,680
Actually,

665
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,960
Chut is moving to Korat.

666
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,120
Wait.

667
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,400
I don't know if it's a coincidence,

668
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,640
but Chantorn just quit her job as well.

669
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,240
Did Chantorn say why she quit?

670
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,400
She didn't.

671
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,680
She must have a reason to not want
to stay in Bangkok anymore,

672
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,440
but I don't know
if it has anything to do with Chut.

673
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,960
Master.

674
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
What about the alms?

675
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,560
I'd rather move away than marry a woman

676
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,600
who treats me like a servant.

677
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,120
<i>She just quit without giving any notice.</i>

678
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,480
She left after handing in her resignation.

679
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,800
It was so disrespectful to you
since you gave her this job.

680
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,640
Is Wichai home yet?
I don't want to wait long.

681
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,200
- Mom.
- What?

682
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,040
Don't go see Lady Mayom just yet.

683
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,240
I think Chut ran away to Korat.

684
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,240
<i>You're enjoying seeing him suffer.</i>

685
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,720
Your evil thoughts will bring
suffering upon you one day.

686
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,960
I'll move on.

687
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,200
I won't let this person
affect my life anymore.

688
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,320
Let's live happily together.

689
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,440
<i>Does Chantorn love you?</i>

690
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
<i>She had been waiting for me all this time.</i>

691
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,520
But once Anong and I broke up,
you became the problem.

692
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,440
Are you saying that
I'm the one standing between you two?

693
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,400
<i>Don't betray me by asking
another girl to marry Chut.</i>

694
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,520
They love each other.

695
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,960
I can't stop them.

696
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,360
<i>If you can't be happy
for others when they find happiness,</i>

697
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,360
maybe the problem is you.

698
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,000
Are you preaching to me right now?

699
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,800
<i>You didn't get to be my sister-in-law,</i>

700
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,720
but you can be like a little sister to me.

701
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,520
Wichai!

702
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,160
<i>We're told to prepare for the worst.</i>

703
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,960
<i>Wichai may never fully recover from this.</i>

704
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,880
