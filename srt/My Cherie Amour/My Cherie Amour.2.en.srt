00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,680
<i>That's Anong Suntorapong,</i>

3
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,160
<i>the heiress of Sinthai Bank.</i>

4
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>We met at school back in England.</i>

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,640
She just came home after graduation.

6
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,320
Turns out you just went there
to have fun with that party girl, right?

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,240
Her name is Anong.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,760
- I know.
- I know.

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,560
If anyone wants to marry you,

10
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,000
they should get approval
from all of us first.

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,880
Since you're here,

12
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,120
can you lend your expertise
and help me judge something?

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,720
Everyone knows his family.

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,600
Their embezzlement case
was quite scandalous.

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,040
If what people say isn't true,

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,080
why didn't you tell everyone
what really happened?

17
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,320
Because it's no use.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
What is it now?

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,960
<i>Is it that tramp again?</i>

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,480
You shouldn't let
those hurtful words get to you.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
Especially if they're from someone
who doesn't know you.

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,080
Come with me.

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
What's with you?

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Look there. It's that tramp.

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,480
Don't feel bad if you find
someone better than Chut.

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,640
I won't tell him that
you keep him around as an option.

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,560
I don't see Chut as an option.

28
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,880
It's not wrong to choose
what's best for yourself.

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,880
It shouldn't be hard for a perfect girl
like you to find someone worthy.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,920
It's you who thinks I'm not worthy
to be with your brother.

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,680
She's probably here to see Chut.

32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,840
No.

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,160
She said she's here to see you, ma'am.

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
What does she want from me?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Thank you.

36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Madam isn't available to see you.
You can leave a message with me.

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
My mom is about to go out.

38
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,680
Chut will be down soon.

39
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,600
- Well…
- Yes?

40
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,840
Ever since your family moved
into the neighborhood,

41
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,520
I haven't once come and properly
introduced myself to your mother.

42
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
So I'm here to introduce myself to her.

43
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,840
I brought her a gift basket
from the store.

44
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
- Actually--
- Don't bother.

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
We don't want your gift.

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,760
We're all acquaintances here.
I appreciate the gesture.

47
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Goodness, Wichai.

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,600
I know that we got off on the wrong foot,

49
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,000
but we can get to know each other better.

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
I'll let my mom know.

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,880
She'll be happy that you stopped by.

52
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,400
It's such a shame.
I'll call in advance next time I come.

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Hold on. Won't you wait to see Chut?

54
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,120
No. I'm only here today
to pay my respects to your mother.

55
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,800
She's pretty.

56
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,560
Bring me my suit.

57
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
Wait.

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
Madam asked me to give you this.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,480
She said the gift basket you brought
was meant to be for sale.

60
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,280
She couldn't just accept it.

61
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,080
Think of this as our way
to help support your store.

62
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,560
Our family lives by Thai traditions.

63
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,680
We're not accustomed to Western cultures.

64
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,120
And if you want to offer Chut a dowry,

65
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,840
that basket alone won't be enough.

66
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
Anong!

67
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,080
- Wait.
- Chut.

68
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,200
Please tell your mother

69
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,840
that I never intended
to offer a dowry to anyone.

70
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
Hey.

71
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,880
What?

72
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
Goodness. She rocks.

73
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
I like her.

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,440
What a foul-mouthed girl.

75
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,040
Bye.

76
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,840
<i>That girl is something
to dare lock horns with Mom.</i>

77
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
If she marries into our family,

78
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,480
she and Mom will probably
fight three times a day.

79
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,360
I think it's a good thing.

80
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,960
It will teach Chut to stand up to Mom
instead of letting her control him.

81
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,760
Mom will get to learn to let go.

82
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
She needs to know she can't control
all her children's lives.

83
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,480
Could Anong and Chut be a perfect match?

84
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Anyone who can make Chut more mature
is a good match for him.

85
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Hey, there. What are you writing?

86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,600
Is that how you spell "snake?"

87
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
You keep worrying about Chut.

88
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
You should find a girl
to look after you too.

89
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,800
I already have one.

90
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Though she's not good at doing chores.

91
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,360
I can only help you dress
and make you look respectable.

92
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,480
But you need a girl
to help take care of you.

93
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,160
<i>"Aunt Chan."</i>

94
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
AUNT CHAN

95
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,560
It's Chantorn.

96
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,800
She's Samarn's stepsister.

97
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,240
She's been coming here
to nurse her brother.

98
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,600
She's been a big help to me.

99
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,080
She reads to Samarn and Nid
when you're not here.

100
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
You two always miss each other.

101
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,920
You'll get to meet her someday.

102
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,560
It fits you perfectly, ma'am.

103
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Your body looks like
it comes straight out of a magazine.

104
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,640
Well, honey.
Should we get you a wedding dress too?

105
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
I saw a man driving by the store
a few times.

106
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,360
Is he that handsome man
you've been talking about?

107
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,080
Has Chut been here?

108
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,440
He looks so sophisticated.

109
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,360
He's turning all the ladies' heads
each time he passes by.

110
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,600
Chut's become so popular
ever since he returned from England.

111
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm considering letting Sa-Ang marry him.

112
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,600
You're so protective of me.
Who would dare propose to me?

113
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
We're ready for you, Ms. Payom.

114
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,800
Can I browse through the catalog?

115
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
Sure, ma'am.

116
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,320
You need to play hard to get.

117
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,160
Drive him crazy
and make him chase after you.

118
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Chut has so many girls
lining up to be his girlfriend.

119
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,160
You need to show him

120
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
you're a diamond
while those girls are just gravel.

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,440
Those rich girls are shameless.

122
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,920
They want him
though he's not theirs to have.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,760
What kind of dress would you like today?

124
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,760
I'd like this one.

125
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,200
Goodness.

126
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,960
Oh, my.

127
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,200
Do you like the dress, ma'am?

128
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm leaving now.

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,280
This is Ms. Anong Suntorapong.

130
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,520
She's the owner of Sinthai Bank.

131
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,320
This is Lady Mayom.

132
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,120
She's the wife of General Promsak.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
This is Ms. Sa-Ang

134
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,840
and Ms. Payom, their two daughters.

135
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,840
It's nice to meet you.

136
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,040
It seems we have similar tastes
in quite a few things.

137
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,960
But it doesn't matter
who sees the dress first.

138
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,360
What matters is
who looks more memorable in it.

139
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,880
Also,

140
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,400
you need to let others
be the judge of that.

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
You can't decide it for yourself.

142
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,920
I thought this store
sold custom-made dresses.

143
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It seems they are made in bulk.

144
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm leaving.

145
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,080
Women these days are so strange.

146
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,320
They're possessive of something
that's not even theirs.

147
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,080
Anong.

148
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
I thought I wouldn't get to see you.

149
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm glad I waited around.

150
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,360
Here you are, Chut.

151
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,840
Are you here to pick up someone?

152
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,120
Lady Mayom. Hello.

153
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,520
Have you been here long?

154
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
You know Lady Mayom?

155
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,400
In that case,

156
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,480
have you met Sa-Ang?

157
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
Sa-Ang?

158
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,520
Which one is she?

159
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
The left or the right one?

160
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,400
Goodness.

161
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,040
You've become so popular
that girls flock to you like flies.

162
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,680
Goodbye, ladies.

163
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,320
Anong, let me get the door for you.

164
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Here you go.

165
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,520
I'll pay for the dress.

166
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,600
Anong.

167
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
Mom, why does Chut have
such bad taste in women?

168
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,680
Someone's here to see you, sir.

169
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
Another suitor?

170
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,960
Haven't you learned your lesson?

171
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,560
Hasn't your brother been courting Anong?

172
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,720
If you want Anong as your sister-in-law,

173
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,720
help Chut eliminate the competition.

174
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,480
You should let your sister decide
who she wants to marry.

175
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,320
It's clear that
Sa-ngad isn't a suitable choice.

176
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,480
If you think Chut is the best man,

177
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,280
you can help him
eliminate the competition.

178
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,160
And I'll help talk him up.

179
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,880
It's none of my business.

180
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,160
Do it as a favor to me.

181
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,840
Anong only deserves what's best.

182
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,040
So you're already involved with someone.

183
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,560
It's no wonder why
your mom doesn't like me.

184
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm sorry that my mom
was being rude to you this morning.

185
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Does your mom think
that I'll try to ruin your wedding?

186
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,640
I swear.

187
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,880
I have no feelings for Sa-Ang.

188
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,960
This is why Wichai is encouraging me
to see other people.

189
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,280
It's because he knows
you also have other options.

190
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,240
<i>We've agreed that</i>

191
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,000
we'll find suitable guys
for Anong to consider.

192
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,960
So we're competing to find the best guy

193
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,800
to be our brother-in-law.

194
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,560
And you think
that Sa-ngad guy from yesterday

195
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,840
is the best guy for Anong?

196
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
That's my point.

197
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,680
That's what worries me.

198
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,400
I don't know what Sawaeng is thinking.

199
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
Anong isn't stupid.

200
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,360
She won't lower herself to be with him.

201
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,440
You also want to see your brother happy.

202
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,920
So why don't we work together?

203
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,880
Help him eliminate the competition.

204
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,760
I'm just an outsider in this matter.

205
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,400
It's not my place to have an opinion.

206
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,760
I trust your judgment.

207
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
If we work together,

208
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm confident we can find
the right guy for Anong.

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,120
Who knows?

210
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,160
That guy might be your brother.

211
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
- Damn it.
- Gosh, Prasit.

212
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,800
Focus.

213
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,680
You need to keep
the appointment you've made.

214
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
But we had our talk yesterday.

215
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
I didn't ask you to come yesterday.

216
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,640
Come on.

217
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,080
Have you guys been here long?

218
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
Where are you guys going?

219
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,760
Wichai wants to join us.

220
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,160
He's excellent at tennis.

221
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,920
He's asked to play with us today.
I'll go get changed.

222
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,040
Let's go change.

223
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Come on.

224
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,800
Pong is so weird for being friends
with a guy like that.

225
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,560
I think Sawaeng's choice
of friends is even weirder.

226
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,720
You'll soon be charmed by my eccentricity.

227
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,520
You might be so charmed

228
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
that you decide to settle down with me.

229
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,599
What are you doing?

230
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,359
I'm looking for a charm.

231
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
There's a lucky ball in here.

232
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,839
I see.

233
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,160
Do you believe in juju?

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,560
Yes. That ball has magic powers.

235
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,800
It always helps me win.

236
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,960
Is it this one?

237
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,600
That's right. This is the one.

238
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,040
The Meteor.

239
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,200
It can knock all your opponents out.

240
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,320
Here. You keep it then.

241
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,400
You should keep it.

242
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,520
It's a gift from me.

243
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,960
Good things aren't for me.

244
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,400
You should keep it.

245
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Here.

246
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,360
You are one strange guy.

247
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,760
Gosh.

248
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
Hey, you two!

249
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
How about a game?

250
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,680
If you don't believe me,

251
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,760
try it for yourself.

252
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,600
Wichai.

253
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,040
Hey!

254
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
Wichai, are you okay?

255
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm all right.

256
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,240
Watch out!

257
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,840
Wichai.

258
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
Pong!

259
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,800
I don't want to play anymore.

260
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,160
He's all bruised up.

261
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,360
You should sit down. Let me see.

262
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
That must've hurt.

263
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
You're bleeding.

264
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,760
Sawaeng, give me your handkerchief.

265
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,760
Hurry. He's bleeding.

266
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
Tilt your head back.

267
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
Is your family doing well?

268
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
How is Sa-Ang doing?

269
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,840
Why don't you ask Chut?

270
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,760
He's been driving her around.

271
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,080
Anong, has Chut ever told you
that he's close with my sister?

272
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,520
He's not hiding anything from me.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,560
And how is Payom?

274
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,960
Payom likes to keep to herself
and prefers to stay home.

275
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Sawaeng.

276
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,960
I imagine you must get lonely.

277
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,800
Me?

278
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,600
Why would I be lonely?

279
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,840
If you like to spend time
with your girlfriend,

280
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,600
you should invite her to join us.

281
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,240
Hold on.

282
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,960
Sawaeng.

283
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,640
Do you have a girlfriend?

284
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,800
- No, I…
- I knew nothing about this.

285
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,400
- Why haven't you told me?
- You have it wrong.

286
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
- When did this happen?
- It's a misunderstanding.

287
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,880
What misunderstanding?

288
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,040
Gosh.

289
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,760
I can clearly smell perfume.

290
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
It's the scent of Thai flowers.

291
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,720
It's not a scent any man would wear.

292
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,960
Someone must've sprayed it
on the handkerchief.

293
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,960
You're right.

294
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,680
Payom is Sa-Ang's younger sister
and the youngest sister of Sa-ngad.

295
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,920
I know I've smelled this perfume before.

296
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
Are you secretly seeing Payom?

297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,240
Of course not.

298
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,840
It's all nonsense.

299
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,480
Wait, Anong.

300
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,040
Is that embroidered <i>payom</i> flowers?

301
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,760
You didn't have to keep it a secret.

302
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,280
You should introduce her to us.

303
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
He probably believes the superstition.

304
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,600
What superstition?

305
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,240
There's an old superstition
that if a younger child

306
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,360
gets married before their older siblings,

307
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,880
the older siblings will
forever remain unmarried.

308
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,800
So you cannot let Payom get married
before Sa-ngad and Sa-Ang.

309
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,600
Payom is the youngest
among the three siblings.

310
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,240
If she gets married first,

311
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,720
it could mean that Sa-ngad and Sa-Ang
will never be married.

312
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,440
This must be why
Lady Mayom is in such a rush

313
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
to have Sa-Ang marry Chut.

314
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,560
She fears the superstition might be true.

315
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,400
This guy is the eldest brother, right?

316
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,800
Is this all your plan, Sawaeng?

317
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
No. That's not it, Anong.

318
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
Anong, wait.

319
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,080
Anong!

320
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,280
Anong!

321
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,760
Anong, you're reading too much into this.

322
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,400
I was wondering

323
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,320
where did you find
a thug like that to be my suitor.

324
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
What he did to Prasit was unacceptable.

325
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
You're too prejudiced against him.

326
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,600
Sawaeng, you're only thinking
about yourself.

327
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,160
If you wanted what's best for me,

328
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,520
you wouldn't try
to set me up with that man.

329
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
You should be protecting me
from a thug like him.

330
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,840
You wouldn't let me be with Chut

331
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,120
just so Lady Mayom would let you
marry her youngest daughter.

332
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,160
Even if Sa-ngad isn't in the picture,

333
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,760
Chut is still not good enough for you.

334
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
I don't really care

335
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,720
if I can't find a good man
to spend my life with.

336
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,560
But it will break my heart

337
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
if my own brother

338
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,680
can't even love me.

339
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
Anong.

340
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,240
Anong, I'm sorry.

341
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
Prasit.

342
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,760
Where have you been?

343
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,440
Are you hurt anywhere else?

344
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,120
Prasit, don't you let anyone
bully you like that again.

345
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,200
You have to fight back.

346
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,480
I may not be lucky in the game,

347
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,080
but I'll definitely be lucky in love.

348
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't be too confident.

349
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm going to find a good husband for you.

350
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,200
Don't lose hope yet.

351
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,960
You'll see.

352
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,640
All my brothers are so protective of me.

353
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,880
I'll probably end up as a spinster.

354
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,560
Anong is a pitiful girl.

355
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,240
Our parents died in an accident
not long after she was born.

356
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,560
<i>She became an orphan when she was young.</i>

357
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,240
<i>So we were raised by our aunt.</i>

358
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,360
<i>There were five of us.</i>

359
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,600
<i>Our aunt feared that Anong
would become rowdy like her brothers,</i>

360
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,480
<i>so she sent her to a boarding school.</i>

361
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,800
<i>She then tried to make it up to Anong</i>

362
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
<i>by giving her everything she wanted.</i>

363
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,400
You and I, we're both the eldest
among our siblings.

364
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,160
We're the closest thing

365
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,640
that they have to a dad.

366
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,880
We are all unfortunate orphans.

367
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,000
I just want Anong to find a guy
who can love her right.

368
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,080
At least, she and Chut
have something in common.

369
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,760
It can't be a coincidence, Dad.

370
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,560
Wichai.

371
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,440
Please look after my kid for me.

372
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,680
I don't know how long I have left.

373
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
You still have lots of time left.

374
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,000
You're the only person I trust

375
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,840
to help care for my child.

376
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,240
I promise.

377
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
I'll help take care of everyone.

378
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
If I'd known
Choy had such a difficult life,

379
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
I would've come here sooner.

380
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,960
Having laughter in the house
is already a big help to Samarn.

381
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
How will Choy and her kid
live without Samarn?

382
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, I'll come visit them again soon.

383
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,880
That's good. This is our duty as men.

384
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,120
We can't leave our family behind.

385
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,120
It's like what Samarn is doing.

386
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,760
He's trying to hold on and be strong

387
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,480
for his family.

388
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,640
You sound like an old man.

389
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,520
You even smell like one.

390
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,360
Don't forget your promise.

391
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,400
What promise?

392
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,160
That you'll talk me up to Anong's brother.

393
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,120
Go buy yourself a new suit.

394
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,320
You're giving me this?
I'm not giving it back.

395
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,880
Wait.

396
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,760
Let me borrow your car.
I won't look respectable on a rickshaw.

397
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,480
- What?
- See you later.

398
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,840
Hey.

399
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
Taxi.

400
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,640
LITTLE WOMEN

401
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,680
Hey, whose car is that?

402
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,280
- Stop. Pull over.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,240
Anong. Are you okay?

404
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,120
Just wait here.

405
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,680
Go ahead and back it up.

406
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,000
Keep going straight.

407
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,840
Keep going.

408
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
The path's clear.

409
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,480
Keep going straight.

410
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,760
Thank you so much.

411
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,080
- Sure.
- You can drop me off here.

412
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,400
Yes, sir. Please wait a moment.

413
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Right. Thank you.

414
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,800
Good luck, sir.

415
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,440
Are you hurt anywhere?

416
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,760
No.

417
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,680
We should go before it rains.

418
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,000
Right.

419
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
Thank you, Wichai.

420
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,520
I lost control of the car.

421
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,440
A beginner like you shouldn't drive alone.
It's dangerous.

422
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,040
I wouldn't know what to do
if you weren't there to help me.

423
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,840
All I could do
was wait for someone to pass by.

424
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,040
You were my knight in shining armor.

425
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,280
What's this?

426
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,480
Who is this?

427
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Well…

428
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,280
They are the men
that my brothers found for me.

429
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,160
But I've learned my lesson, so I asked
to see the men's profiles first.

430
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,640
Anyone interesting?

431
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,720
This one graduated
from a school in Thailand.

432
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,520
We probably have different lifestyles.

433
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,560
As for this one,

434
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,680
he has even more siblings than me.
It probably won't work out.

435
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,640
And this one.

436
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
The way he parts his hair
makes him look bald.

437
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,960
That's it?

438
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,320
It shows that he has no true friends
who would tell him the truth.

439
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
Let's see here.

440
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,160
You didn't make any notes.
Does that mean he passed?

441
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,440
He got cut for being a widower.

442
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,920
His marriage failed.
He might have personality issues.

443
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Then who would be good enough?

444
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,280
I know, right?

445
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Right now, I still haven't found
a man who makes my heart race.

446
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,120
Your book is all wet.

447
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,840
Let me help you close the window.

448
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Well…

449
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,280
Let me do it.

450
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,080
All right.

451
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,120
Let me help.

452
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,760
It's the liniment.

453
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,800
My back still hurts
after that tennis match.

454
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,360
I know I smell like an old man

455
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,160
and I know you hate it.

456
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,320
What's that on your hand, Wichai?

457
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,720
My niece drew it for me.

458
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,480
It's a wind wheel.

459
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,080
You're not old.

460
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,720
That drawing makes you look like

461
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,320
you're not yet four years old.

462
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,000
You're the first person to say that.

463
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,960
When you smile,

464
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,600
I almost don't believe it's really you.

465
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,400
You're a sweet talker.

466
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,720
So you're not really
that snarky after all.

467
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,720
I'm a nice person.

468
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
You just didn't see it.

469
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,600
Let's take a picture together.
Smile at the camera.

470
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,440
I drove you all the way here.

471
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,880
- Can I go now?
- No.

472
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,400
You must get back in Sa-Ang
and Lady Mayom's good graces.

473
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,720
There will be an auction
to raise funds for the annual function.

474
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,440
You're going to bid on the item
that Sa-Ang brought here tonight.

475
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
Smile.

476
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,640
And this is the prized possession

477
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,960
that Ms. Sa-Ang has kindly donated
to our auction tonight.

478
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,520
I'm sure you all can see
how beautiful this picture is.

479
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,280
What a narcissist.

480
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,520
The starting price is 100 baht.

481
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,480
With this picture in your home,

482
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
it will be like you have
Ms. Sa-Ang there with you.

483
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,800
Will you put her picture
on the altar and pray to it?

484
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,560
Gosh.

485
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,320
120 baht.

486
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,600
We have an offer of 120 baht.

487
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,760
150 baht.

488
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,320
Good. She can take her picture back home.

489
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,680
150 baht going twice.

490
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,160
I want double what I'm paying.

491
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,760
150 baht going--

492
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,040
200.

493
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,920
200 baht.

494
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,520
We have an offer of 200 baht.

495
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,960
200 baht going thrice.

496
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,720
And this beautiful picture
of Ms. Sa-Ang is sold

497
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,520
at 200 baht.

498
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,640
Congratulations to the lucky winner.

499
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,280
Let's move on to our next item.

500
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,320
This special vase is donated to us
by Ms. Anong Suntorapong.

501
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,480
We will start the bidding
on this vase at 100 baht.

502
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,040
I'll help you get out
of marrying the general's daughter.

503
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,640
How?

504
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,280
But you must help me get rid
of all the men my brothers found for me.

505
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,400
That's easy.

506
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,880
I would gladly do anything for you.

507
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,080
The two of us won't marry anyone
we're not willing to marry.

508
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,800
Let's get everyone off our backs
by pretending to be together.

509
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,520
200 baht.

510
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,280
Are you crazy? Are you trying to ruin me?

511
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,000
You're throwing our money away.

512
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,280
The bid is now at 200 baht.

513
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,160
Is there a higher bidder?

514
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,520
250.

515
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,400
250 baht.

516
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,200
The bid is now at 250 baht.

517
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,600
Is there a higher bidder?

518
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,080
That's 250 baht for this gorgeous vase.

519
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,360
Look how beautiful
the flowers are arranged.

520
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Don't do it.
How would it make Sa-Ang feel?

521
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,000
I don't care.

522
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,440
300 baht.

523
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,280
The bid is now at 300 baht.

524
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,680
300 baht going once.

525
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,640
300 baht going twice.

526
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,760
300 baht going thrice.

527
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,600
And the beautiful Qing Dynasty vase

528
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,840
is sold at 300 baht.

529
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,160
Congratulations once again to the winner.

530
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,480
When did the association
let that new money become a member?

531
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
She probably bought her way in

532
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,760
as a major sponsor of the association.

533
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,360
These rich people
like to flaunt their wealth.

534
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,840
They contribute nothing to our country.

535
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,480
Chut really disrespected Sa-Ang.

536
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,400
I'll have to reconsider their engagement.

537
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,680
No, ma'am. Chut is probably just too shy

538
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,120
to show Sa-Ang how he really feels.

539
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,560
You can't fool me,
but you can keep fooling yourself.

540
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I don't want a son-in-law
with such low taste.

541
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,560
Let's go, honey.

542
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,800
This new case is a romance scam
that's currently rampant.

543
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,440
The plaintiff is a millionaire
who got tricked into marrying a man.

544
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,080
The scammer is suspected
to be working together

545
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,800
with a jewelry shop.

546
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,280
There are several female victims

547
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,160
who got scammed
after being tricked into falling in love.

548
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,120
The scammer didn't exactly commit theft,

549
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,480
but he tricked the women
into giving him money out of love.

550
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,040
Based on the evidence,

551
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,480
should we issue a subpoena
for an investigation?

552
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,720
The grilled egg vendor asked me
to sell this to Madam for him.

553
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,360
He meant to give it to his lover
as an engagement gift,

554
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,640
but she left him for someone else.

555
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,400
He couldn't bring himself to keep it,
so he decided to sell it for cheap.

556
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,480
PETCHARAPANICH

557
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,040
Would you like to try this one on?

558
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,360
It's just as beautiful as the other one.

559
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,840
How much is it? Tell me the price first.

560
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,160
Please wait a moment.

561
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,920
Madam.

562
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,600
The customer wants to know
the price of this ruby ring.

563
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,480
That'd be 300 baht.

564
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,400
It's 200 baht.

565
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,960
- Are you sure it's 200?
- Yes.

566
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
Madam said it was 200 baht.

567
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,160
- Would you like to buy it?
- Yes.

568
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,440
Here you go.

569
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,040
Thank you so much.
I'll put it in a box for you.

570
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,200
There's no need.

571
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,800
I'll wear it now.

572
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,560
Thank you, ma'am.

573
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,720
That worked.

574
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,280
Or else, she'd still be here.

575
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,560
She couldn't buy the ring fast enough
thinking she'd saved 100 baht.

576
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,480
Yes, ma'am.

577
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,320
It's an antique gold bracelet.

578
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,480
I'll take it if you want to sell it.

579
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,280
Do you have a price in mind?

580
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,600
Well, I'll have to ask the owner first
how much they want for it.

581
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,520
We're here to search for evidence.

582
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,200
We've been informed that your shop
bought stolen jewelry from a criminal.

583
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,720
That's not true.

584
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Who told you that?
I've never bought any stolen goods.

585
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,360
What's going on? Why are the cops here?

586
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,600
They accused us of buying stolen goods.

587
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,960
<i>I checked with the jewelry shop.</i>

588
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,640
It's not a fake.

589
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,800
You can't be too sure
with people these days.

590
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,880
Good appearances can be deceptive.

591
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,160
You might get fooled
if you're too dumb to see it.

592
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,400
Just like this vase.
You'd have to be a fool to buy it.

593
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,840
You can scold me, Mom.
But there's no need to be sarcastic.

594
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,080
Are you going to throw away your career
because of one woman, Chut?

595
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,840
It's better than leeching off a woman

596
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,960
and using her connections
to move up the ranks.

597
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,920
Let me tell you something about Anong.

598
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,400
You're not the only one she has.

599
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,720
If you can't see it,

600
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,760
then go ahead
and make that tramp your wife.

601
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,120
Madam, no!

602
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,040
I heard you paid 300 baht for this.

603
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,120
When will Mom stop meddling in my life?

604
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,160
Probably when you stop
chasing after that dream girl of yours.

605
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,600
Why can't Mom just let me love who I love?

606
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,960
She's just afraid
that you'll forget about her.

607
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,720
Can you give me your word

608
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,680
that you won't abandon Mom
if you get to marry Anong?

609
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,960
That you'll take care of both of them.

610
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,920
Are you sure you can handle it?

611
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,560
If I marry Anong,
she won't need me to provide for her.

612
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,760
I can take care of Mom.

613
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,600
Then go tell Mom that.

614
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,080
So she can stop blaming Anong
for stealing your love from her.

615
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,800
You said you'd talk
to Anong's brother for me.

616
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Have you talked to him?

617
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,120
Promise me you'll talk to him
or I'll pester you in your dream.

618
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,840
- Gosh, Chut.
- Promise me first.

619
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,080
- Give me your word!
- Stop it.

620
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,560
- Get out of my bed.
- Promise me first.

621
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,040
Give me your word!

622
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
Chut!

623
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,320
Then I'll sleep here.

624
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,040
Gosh.

625
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Hey.

626
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,080
Stop clinging onto me.

627
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,200
You don't have to bring up marriage.

628
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,640
Just tell him my good qualities.

629
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,920
We have an established tailor
from London working for us.

630
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,920
His specialty is cosmopolitan fashion.

631
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,200
The students going to study abroad
come here to have their uniforms tailored.

632
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,480
- Look at that suit.
- You see that?

633
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,840
I already have another competitor.

634
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,400
You're welcome to try it on.

635
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,600
This way, sir.

636
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,280
Hi.

637
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,880
Hello, Wichai.

638
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,320
Hello.

639
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,840
I'll let you two talk.

640
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,240
Who was that man?

641
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,080
Is he someone your brothers found for you?

642
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,560
I have something to tell you.

643
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,960
I'll tell you later.

644
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,280
Kacha, this is Chut.

645
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,200
Chut, this is Kacha.

646
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,640
He graduated from Oxford
two years after me.

647
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,600
That's right.

648
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,720
He's now the Secretary
of the Italian Ambassador.

649
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,960
It's nice to meet you.

650
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,400
Kacha, let me show you
the clothes over here.

651
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,400
Our store not only…

652
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,960
This is a referral letter.

653
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,000
Give it to the hospital.

654
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,600
The doctor will provide treatment
for your brother-in-law.

655
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,400
Thank you for your help.

656
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,400
This place is big.

657
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,320
It's why my brothers don't want Anong
to take over the business.

658
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,840
They're afraid she might not be able
to keep it going with a lousy husband.

659
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,120
Is that her new suitor?

660
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,040
We all know that

661
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,840
Anong is against the matchmaking.

662
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,360
So we try to keep things casual.

663
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,600
But I'm suspecting that
that guy is sent here by someone

664
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,840
to talk business with Anong as a cover.

665
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,360
Anong is trying to prove
that she can look after herself.

666
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,320
She's enjoying running the business.

667
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,880
Jamlong and Sawaeng might use this chance
to have their guys befriend Anong.

668
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,520
Your brother doesn't care about business.

669
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,800
He has a stable job.

670
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,640
At least I can trust that
he won't try to take over the store.

671
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,480
You can rest assured.

672
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,920
Chut is not a greedy man.

673
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,040
All he has to do now
is try to beat his competition.

674
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,240
KACHA CHINNAWORN

675
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,160
Since you're here, are you interested
in buying something from our store?

676
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,160
This perfume

677
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,800
can cover up old people's smell.

678
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,640
We also offer light perfumes
suitable for dignified gentlemen.

679
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,640
Or perhaps you might want to buy
something as a gift for your wife.

680
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,960
Well…

681
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,960
That won't be necessary.

682
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,520
No woman would refuse
a gift from the man she loves.

683
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,360
So you'll take it?

684
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,040
How about

685
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,120
I come to buy it some other time?

686
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,360
You should bring your wife next time
so she can choose what she likes.

687
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,160
Wichai doesn't have a wife.
Haven't I told you?

688
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,360
He's a widower.

689
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,520
- A widower?
- Yes.

690
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,280
He's been alone for years.

691
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,600
You didn't make any notes.
Does that mean he passed?

692
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,760
He got cut for being a widower.

693
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,960
Is being a widower a bad thing?

694
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,800
Yes. It shows that

695
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,600
his marriage failed.
He might have personality issues.

696
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,200
I didn't mean to rub salt into his wound.

697
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,480
He wouldn't take it personally.
You didn't know.

698
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,720
I have to apologize
or he will think I'm rude.

699
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,040
Anong.

700
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,320
Don't run.

701
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,600
Hey.

702
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,000
Where did he go?

703
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,320
You made a small faux pas.
Wichai won't be offended.

704
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,240
Why do I always embarrass myself
every time I see him?

705
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,680
Our mother also arranged
for Wichai to marry someone.

706
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,640
So his marriage ended badly?

707
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,680
They were only married for a year.

708
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,280
Then his wife died.

709
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,520
She died?

710
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,480
That's why he became a widower
at such a young age.

711
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,440
I don't know much about his wife.

712
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,800
<i>From what I know, she was a homemaker.</i>

713
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,760
<i>She didn't talk much.</i>

714
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,120
<i>And she was a sickly woman.</i>

715
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,440
<i>Their marriage didn't last long.</i>

716
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,440
<i>I was in military school then
and didn't come home much.</i>

717
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,640
<i>So I never got to know her.</i>

718
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,480
<i>All I know is that she died of an illness.</i>

719
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,520
Wichai is probably traumatized
by what happened.

720
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,200
Since then, he's never been
interested in any women.

721
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,640
When you put it like that,

722
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,120
Wichai is actually a very loyal man

723
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,200
who's committed to love.

724
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,440
He found love,

725
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,240
but fate took her away from him.

726
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,240
That's what I call unfortunate.

727
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,640
Stop.

728
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,600
Did you swallow it? Spit it out.

729
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,440
I said spit it out.

730
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,560
<i>If something unexpected happens,
it's called a coincidence.</i>

731
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,760
But when coincidence keeps happening,

732
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,400
it's called destiny.

733
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,640
Another coincidence.

734
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,360
<i>Can I have a consolation prize?</i>

735
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,520
I can't tell anymore

736
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,160
who is kissing who.

737
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,000
It wasn't even a big deal.

738
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,960
Then how come…

739
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,280
It's your first time in court.

740
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,800
Are you scared?

741
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,040
<i>Do it now. The guy fessed up.</i>

742
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,360
Where is Anong?

743
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,280
