00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
<i>Just say you're jealous.</i>

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,200
<i>You're afraid I'll steal your girl, right?</i>

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,600
No wonder a perfect girl like Anong
doesn't want to be with you.

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>Why are they fighting about girls?</i>

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,800
<i>It would be wrong</i>

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,440
<i>if you tried to push Anong
to be with your guy</i>

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,600
only to get rid of me and Chut.

9
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
<i>I'll move on if he doesn't want me.</i>

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,160
You should come play again.
I love listening to you play.

11
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,880
This is the first time I have a reason
to want to come home early.

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
Why are you complimenting me
all of a sudden?

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,280
Well…

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,320
Because it's true.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>So what do you think?
Are you interested in Wichai?</i>

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
<i>At this moment,
I'm willing to marry whoever</i>

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,920
that proposes to me first.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Mom is asking Sa-Ang to marry you

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
so you can be married next month.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't know if it's a coincidence,

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,120
but Chantorn just quit her job as well.

22
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,520
Is Wichai home yet?
I don't want to wait long.

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,480
- Mom.
- What?

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't go see Lady Mayom just yet.

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,560
I think Chut ran away to Korat.

26
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,280
That's impossible.

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,480
Why would he go there?

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,160
Lady Mayom is having
his transfer order revoked.

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,600
But when Chut left,

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,760
he said he was only going to work.

31
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,080
Chut ran away
because he doesn't want to marry Sa-Ang.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
No way.

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,640
Why would he do that?
He seemed fine with the arrangement.

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,440
We'll have to go see Lady Mayom.

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,560
Mom.

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Urai just told me that
Chantorn ran away from home.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,760
She asked whether Chantorn had come here.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,280
What does she mean?
Why would Chantorn come here?

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
Let's try to stay calm.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
I'll go bring Chut back.

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,000
Cancel your appointment
with Lady Mayom for now.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
No, we have to go see her!

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
And why would that woman call us?

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,800
Calm down, ma'am.

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Boi, get over here!

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
Boi!

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,720
- Bring me the car key!
- Master!

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,040
Master, wait for me.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,160
Here's the key.

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
The way is clear.

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Keep going straight.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
- Boi. Get in.
- Yes?

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,760
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Why are you in such a good mood?

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,920
This is the first time
I've believed in karma.

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,080
The guy who rejected me
is about to get turned down.

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,600
He'll finally get what he deserves

58
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
for falling for the wrong girl.

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
You're enjoying seeing him suffer.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,920
Auntie, I'm not a saint.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Can't I take pleasure in this?

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
The belief that you are superior to others

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,200
is considered a kind of vice.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Someday,

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
your evil thoughts
will bring suffering upon you.

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
This is all I want to see happen.

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
I'll move on.

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
I won't let this person
affect my life anymore.

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,520
Chantorn.

70
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,520
I'm so glad I got here in time.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,800
This is for you. Please take it with you.

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,400
Thank you for coming to see me off.

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,440
At first, I wasn't going
to tell anyone I was leaving.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
I don't know why I told you.

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
I guess

76
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,480
I want to have someone to say goodbye to.

77
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Wait. What's this?

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Can I come with you?

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
We've been through
a near-death experience together.

80
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,320
And we both made it out alive.

81
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,120
Let's live happily together.

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,240
Chantorn…

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,400
I'll leave my life in your hands.

84
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,240
I promise

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,160
to take care of you

86
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,440
as best as I can.

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
Boi, come on.

88
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,000
Master! Be careful.

89
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,120
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

90
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
Go and help me find Chut.
Don't let him get on the train.

92
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,040
Hurry.

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,160
We won't let others
make decisions for us anymore.

94
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,400
Has the train to Korat left yet?

95
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,720
It left just a moment ago.

96
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,280
Let's put our bags here.

97
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
Watch out!

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
Honey!

99
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,840
Get back!

100
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,640
Oh my gosh. He fell onto the track.

101
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,480
Please step aside, everyone.

102
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
Are you okay, sir?

103
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
Get up slowly.

104
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,840
Let me help you get up. Come on.

105
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,960
Get up slowly.

106
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,800
Thank you so much. Say thank you, honey.

107
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,320
Are you all right, sir?

108
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
It's okay, everyone.

109
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
There's nothing to see here.
Move along now.

110
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,520
Wichai.

111
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,240
Did you resign from government service?

112
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
That's right.

113
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm going to marry Chantorn.

114
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm sick of trying to redeem Dad's name.

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm done taking orders from people
just to redeem our family's honor.

116
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,400
Have you thought this through?

117
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,840
Or do you want to get married
just to escape your problems?

118
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,120
That's not it.

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Even if Chut and I don't get married,

120
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm ready to spend my life with him.

121
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,360
I've never realized
that I had this option for myself.

122
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,880
Everyone treats marriage as if

123
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,000
it's the indicator of my success.

124
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,200
So are you addressing the problem
or are you running away from it?

125
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,440
That's easy for you to say.

126
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,080
You didn't have to carry
our family's hopes on your shoulders.

127
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
Please give us a moment.

128
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,080
<i>What about love?</i>

129
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
You didn't say anything about that.

130
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
Do you and Chantorn love each other?

131
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,600
We love each other.

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,680
Since when?

133
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Before this, you only had eyes for Anong.

134
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
Anong loves someone else.

135
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,960
She doesn't feel the same way about me.

136
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,480
- Does Chantorn love you?
- She does.

137
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,880
She had been waiting for me even
when I was blindly in love with Anong.

138
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,800
But once Anong and I broke up,
you became the problem.

139
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,800
She couldn't show her love for me
since it might cause problems between us.

140
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Are you saying that
I'm the one standing between you two?

141
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,960
What about you?

142
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,160
Don't you think it's wrong
to keep switching between girls?

143
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,640
I wouldn't have to do that
if it weren't for you.

144
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,960
I stayed away from Chantorn
and went after Sa-Ang because of you.

145
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,360
You left us no choice
but to run away together.

146
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,560
If you could just accept
that Chantorn doesn't love you

147
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,600
and stop chasing after her,

148
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
no one would've gotten hurt.

149
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,080
I'm here to beg for your forgiveness.

150
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,840
I want to ask for your permission
to let Chantorn marry Chut.

151
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,760
What do you mean?

152
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,720
Chut was the reason
Chantorn left home today.

153
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,440
He wants to take responsibility
for what happened.

154
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,560
So I'm here to ask for Chantorn's hand
on behalf of my brother.

155
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
But I heard that

156
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,960
Chut is to be engaged
with the general's daughter.

157
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
That decision is up to Chut.

158
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,000
I've talked to both him and Chantorn.

159
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
They said they loved each other.

160
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
I really didn't see this coming.

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,120
I thought you were the one
who was courting Chantorn.

162
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,920
But now you're asking for her hand

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
on behalf of someone else.

164
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,560
It's not that Chut isn't a good man.

165
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm just worried for Chantorn.

166
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,080
She might not be able to keep up with him.

167
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
Before I make my decision,

168
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
I need to talk to my husband about this.

169
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
I need to discuss this with my family

170
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
before I can give you an answer.

171
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
You'll throw away your future
because of a girl?

172
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,280
Who is this woman?

173
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,760
I won't approve if she's the reason
you're fighting with Wichai.

174
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm not asking for your opinion.

175
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,640
I'm just telling you that I'll marry her.

176
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,640
Hey.

177
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,560
You said you'd help
redeem your dad's name.

178
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,600
Look how low you've fallen right now.

179
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,120
How could you stoop so low

180
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,840
as to agree to marry
a wretched woman like that?

181
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,320
How can I show my face to anyone?

182
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,440
Mom.

183
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,120
When will you stop being so controlling?

184
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,240
It's embarrassing.

185
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,120
Can you take Nid with you?
I don't want her to see this.

186
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,200
No good woman would want

187
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,600
a stingy woman like you
as a mother-in-law.

188
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,680
Wichai, wait.

189
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,040
Listen.

190
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,760
Did you agree with all of this?

191
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,520
Don't betray me
by asking another girl to marry Chut.

192
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,760
They love each other. I can't stop them.

193
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,160
Goodness. I didn't realize
that you're the kind of man

194
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,960
who would betray his own mom.

195
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,760
Be reasonable, Mom.

196
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
Chut wouldn't dare do this

197
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,200
if someone didn't encourage him.

198
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,080
Are you jealous of your brother?

199
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,360
Do you want him to marry that tramp

200
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,840
to ruin his chance
of ever becoming successful?

201
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,840
Why would I be jealous of Chut?

202
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,360
Because he's got everything that you want.

203
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,600
You couldn't become a soldier
because you had to provide for him.

204
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,400
And you don't like that I try
to find a good woman for him

205
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,960
because you want to have
a better wife than he does.

206
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
That's why you went behind my back
and humiliated me like this.

207
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,560
Do you think I'm happy doing this?

208
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,200
It's also difficult for me
to see Chantorn marry Chut.

209
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,960
If she's so great,

210
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,480
why don't you marry her yourself?

211
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,920
Why did you let Chut get involved
with a low-class woman like that?

212
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,040
I wouldn't object at all
if it were you who married that cow.

213
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,800
Would everyone's life be better

214
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,320
if I was gone?

215
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
Don't you dare get sarcastic with me.

216
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,160
I'm just wondering.

217
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,040
If I'm such a bad person,

218
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,640
am I even needed here anymore?

219
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,720
You wouldn't mind if it were Wichai

220
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,599
who married that woman?

221
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
Just wait a minute.

222
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,920
What kind of mom
talks to her son like that?

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
Isn't it a bit biased

224
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,240
to shower praises on one of your sons
and tear the other to shreds?

225
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,920
And how is this your business?

226
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,960
Wichai is a modest man.

227
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,920
He actually deserves
a much better life than this.

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,400
He deserves better than to be
your emotional punching bag.

229
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,320
Why are you so angry
about how I talk to Wichai?

230
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,040
I just think it's sad.

231
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
It's sad that no one appreciates him.

232
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,880
There's no one who is sincere to him.

233
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,000
You only think of yourself.

234
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,320
You and Chut are exactly the same.

235
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,120
Who do you think you are?

236
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
How dare you come here
and speak to me like this?

237
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,400
Wichai is never jealous.

238
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,000
The ones who are jealous
are the rest of us.

239
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,720
We can't stand to see him happy
when we suffer.

240
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,760
If we're hurt, we have
to make him feel hurt just like us.

241
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,280
I actually see myself in you.

242
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,360
Maybe

243
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,280
we are the ones

244
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,920
who don't deserve Wichai.

245
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,280
She spoke as if she was Wichai's wife.

246
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Did she misunderstand something?

247
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,040
<i>- Does Chantorn love you?
- She does.</i>

248
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,720
She'd been waiting for me even
when I was blindly in love with Anong.

249
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,960
But once Anong and I broke up,
you became the problem.

250
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,680
<i>She couldn't show her love for me
since it might cause problems between us.</i>

251
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,840
<i>Here's your ring, Dad.</i>

252
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
<i>I got it back for Mom.</i>

253
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,880
WICHAI WARATHABUT

254
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,200
BANGKOK - SAWANKHALOK

255
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,560
There are tons of women out there.

256
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,320
Why must Chut marry the girl you like?

257
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,440
Chantorn and I are just friends.

258
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,560
If the two of them are really in love,

259
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I can't stop them.

260
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
You let Chut take everything from you.

261
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Haven't you given him enough?

262
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,280
I don't believe that Chut could love
an ordinary girl like Chantorn.

263
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,840
You should steal her back.

264
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,080
Don't be crazy.

265
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,880
Do you want me to act dishonorably?

266
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,920
Wichai, come here.

267
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
Take a look at yourself.

268
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,560
You look like a walking corpse.

269
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,840
She's the girl you love,

270
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,640
yet you had to ask for her hand
on behalf of your brother.

271
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,800
Then Mom yelled at you because of it.

272
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,520
Mom just loves Chut the way I love her.

273
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,800
And she loves me
the way she used to love Dad.

274
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
This is why Mom and Chut are so alike.

275
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
- They're both selfish.
- Don't blame Mom.

276
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,840
You can't force people to love you
the way you love them.

277
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,920
For God's sake.

278
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,880
This is why

279
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,880
you always end up heartbroken.

280
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,320
You can't let Chut be with Chantorn.

281
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,280
I won't allow it.

282
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,240
Are Chut and Chantorn getting married?

283
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Wichai bought a train ticket
to Chantorn's hometown.

284
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,720
I think he planned to propose to her,
but Chut beat him to it.

285
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,560
Did…

286
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,720
Did Wichai actually think about
asking Chantorn to marry him?

287
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,480
He's been in love with her for so long.

288
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,360
He just doesn't want to show it

289
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
since he's a widower.

290
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,120
But isn't your mom

291
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,440
against the idea of having
Chantorn as her daughter-in-law?

292
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,920
Mom blamed Wichai for bringing Chantorn

293
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
into Chut's life

294
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
when Chut was the one
who chased after her.

295
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,280
Chantorn is just as bad.

296
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,760
She changes her mind
like the wind changes direction.

297
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,880
I can't believe that
she chose Chut over Wichai.

298
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,720
She's ready to give her heart
to whoever that shows her love.

299
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
<i>Those two aren't the kind of people
who would die for love.</i>

300
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,440
<i>It's Wichai who would die for them.</i>

301
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,320
<i>He looks like he hasn't slept in days.</i>

302
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,320
<i>He must feel like exploding</i>

303
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
<i>from having to swallow his feelings.</i>

304
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,520
And he can't be mad at Mom or Chut.

305
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,400
Wichai is the one
who will die of a broken heart.

306
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,040
Should I set the table for dinner?

307
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,280
I'm not hungry.

308
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,040
Just eat without me.

309
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,520
Are you still thinking about Wichai?

310
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,640
One day, you'll realize that
it might be your luck

311
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,520
to not get something you want.

312
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,040
It might lead you to meet someone better.

313
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
<i>For today's Folk Law,</i>

314
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
<i>we'll be talking about dowries.</i>

315
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,520
I have a letter
from our listener with me, Wichai.

316
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,440
Prasit, turn off the radio.

317
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
It's okay.

318
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,160
I…

319
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I want to hear what Wichai has to say.

320
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,440
<i>The woman had the man
give her money every month</i>

321
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,160
<i>as savings for their wedding.</i>

322
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,280
But then the woman got pregnant
with another man's baby.

323
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,720
So the man asked for all the money back.

324
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
As a result, he was branded

325
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,320
as a shameless coward.

326
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Oh my goodness.

327
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,320
So tell me, Wichai.

328
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,040
Is there any way

329
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,920
that this man can get
his money back from the woman?

330
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,960
What should the man do?

331
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,320
- Let me explain.
- All right.

332
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,440
A dowry is actually a payment
that the groom gives to the bride's family

333
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,000
whereas an engagement gift
is given to the bride by the groom

334
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
as a promise of marriage.

335
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,040
If something happens that makes them
unable to marry each other,

336
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,560
<i>the groom can ask for the dowry
or the engagement gift back</i>

337
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,600
if it's the bride who breaks the promise.

338
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,760
They're talking about a love triangle.
It's like rubbing salt in the wound.

339
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
What love triangle?

340
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,560
What are you talking about?

341
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,320
Chut just stole Chantorn from Wichai.

342
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,240
Wichai got stabbed in the back by Chut.

343
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,720
<i>Anything given by one person to another
voluntarily is considered</i>

344
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
<i>a gratuitous gift.</i>

345
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,360
<i>I have a question, Wichai.</i>

346
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
<i>Can we take legal action</i>

347
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,640
<i>against the person
whom our partner cheated on us with?</i>

348
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,960
In my opinion,

349
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,880
I think that

350
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,560
if a woman is unhappy

351
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,600
to be with me,

352
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,440
then letting that woman go

353
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,520
is what a gentleman should do.

354
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,280
<i>Thank you so much, Wichai.</i>

355
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,280
My gosh. What a saint.

356
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,200
That woman broke his heart,

357
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,640
but he still doesn't think badly of her.

358
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,000
He wants to make him
sound like a good guy.

359
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,000
It's because he really is a good guy.

360
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,440
This is why Anong fell for him.

361
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,000
Anong.

362
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,320
Just forget what he said.

363
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,960
He can't even solve his own problems.

364
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,960
Let's go have dinner.

365
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,640
Anong.

366
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,640
Let's drive around town.

367
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,960
Stop getting upset over this.

368
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,720
Come on.

369
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,960
Let's go.

370
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,920
Come on.

371
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,680
Hey.

372
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
Hey, Prasit.

373
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,480
I think it's him, Anong.

374
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,160
Prasit.

375
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,400
Prasit, what are you doing?

376
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,360
That's Wichai.

377
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,560
Don't call him.

378
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Wait. Stop.

379
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,280
My sister is having a love problem.

380
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Can you help her out?

381
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,200
You just got dumped too.

382
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,120
Maybe you can cheer each other up.

383
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,560
Come on.

384
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,240
Please look after Anong
and take her home for me.

385
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
Prasit.

386
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,360
Have fun, Anong.

387
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,480
Thank you, Wichai.

388
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,360
Chut hasn't moved to Korat yet.
He's now living at home.

389
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,400
Will Chut and Chantorn really get married?

390
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,920
Choy told you about that?

391
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,600
Will you really let those two
marry each other?

392
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,480
Are you mad

393
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,520
that Chut has already moved on?

394
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,360
If a woman is unhappy to be with you,

395
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,480
you'd rather let her be with someone else.

396
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Is that what you really think?

397
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,200
Or did you just want
to sound like a gentleman?

398
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,880
If you can't be happy for others
when they find happiness,

399
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,400
maybe the problem is you.

400
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,720
You might have to reflect on yourself

401
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,040
and think about why
you're so upset to see others happy.

402
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,680
You can call me selfish.

403
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
I don't want anyone to be happy
if I'm not.

404
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Anong.

405
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,640
Anong, wait. Get back in the car.

406
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,880
It's about to rain.

407
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
Why would you let the girl you love
be with someone else?

408
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,280
Aren't you afraid
that people will call you a fool

409
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,640
for asking the girl you love
to marry your own brother?

410
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,480
Do you think those two
will be touched by your action?

411
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,520
Trust me.

412
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,640
Chut won't even think
that you did him a favor.

413
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,240
I understand why you're mad.

414
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,040
Chut is acting like
you mean nothing to him.

415
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,440
Chantorn betrayed you.

416
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,360
Anong.

417
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,240
No one owns anyone.

418
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
No one.

419
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,400
Everyone has the right
to choose what's best for themselves.

420
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,400
I know it hurts.

421
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,960
Maybe it's because the one you love
chose to love someone

422
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,120
who is inferior to you.

423
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,040
It hurts

424
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,680
because you and Chut
keep siding with Chantorn.

425
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,120
What's so great about her?

426
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,160
Why do you want those two
to be happy together?

427
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,400
Your ego

428
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,320
will turn a small issue
into a big problem.

429
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,400
But kindness

430
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,440
can make any big problem
seem like a small issue.

431
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,000
You need to let go.

432
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,280
Those two didn't
fall in love just to hurt us.

433
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,720
If you stop thinking only about yourself,

434
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,680
you'll see that their love
has nothing to do with outsiders like us.

435
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,280
Are you preaching to me right now?

436
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,200
If you want someone you love to be yours,

437
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,440
that's lust.

438
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,960
Though you don't get
to have the one you love,

439
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,720
it doesn't mean
that your love will disappear.

440
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
Your love for that person

441
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,680
is still there inside of you.

442
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,400
Are you still sane?

443
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,720
I don't understand.

444
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,920
Why do you let people
hurt you over and over?

445
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
Even my own mom
doesn't love her kids equally.

446
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,880
This is how I was raised,
so I understand how these things work.

447
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,400
I'm not my mom's favorite child.

448
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,800
It taught me to learn
how to live without love.

449
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,080
Not everyone

450
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,800
is worthy of being loved, Anong.

451
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,360
Am I right?

452
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,960
I see it now.

453
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
The reason you are this way

454
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,560
is because your mom

455
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,800
has brainwashed you.

456
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,640
The reason I've been so miserable

457
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,600
is because

458
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,560
I'm in love with a guy like you.

459
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
Are you okay?

460
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,560
Are you cold?

461
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm starting to understand
why I got my heart broken.

462
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,840
Now I feel like such an evil person.

463
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
It's no wonder the man I love rejected me.

464
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm a selfish and egotistical person.

465
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Who could love someone like me?

466
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,480
Why would you say that about yourself?

467
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,880
Because I'm a sore loser.

468
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,920
I can't stand being second-best to anyone.

469
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,920
Maybe it's Chut
who is not good enough for you.

470
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
After everything that happened,

471
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,360
do you still think
I regret letting Chut go?

472
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,280
You didn't get to be my sister-in-law,

473
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
but you can be like a little sister to me.

474
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Are you sure about that?

475
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,000
I have a sharp tongue.

476
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,680
I'm narrow-minded and vengeful.

477
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,240
You don't mind that?

478
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,680
I don't.

479
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,920
Think of me as your brother from now on.

480
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,520
Anong.

481
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,080
Give me some time to think about it.

482
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,560
I already have a lot of brothers.
I'm not sure if I want another one.

483
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,640
Anong, be careful.

484
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Hey.

485
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm glad you guys made up.
Be careful, Anong.

486
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,040
The ground is slippery.

487
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,080
<i>I'm starting to understand
why I got my heart broken.</i>

488
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,920
<i>Now I feel like such an evil person.</i>

489
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,960
<i>It's no wonder the man I love rejected me.</i>

490
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,760
<i>I'm a selfish and egotistical person.</i>

491
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,960
<i>Who could love someone like me?</i>

492
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,280
I've just realized

493
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
how despicable I am

494
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,360
in Wichai's eyes.

495
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,000
Did he say that to you?

496
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,080
I didn't actually say it.

497
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
But he made me realize that

498
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,960
Chantorn is better than me in every way.

499
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,120
This is getting out of hand.

500
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,480
I thought you two
could finally be together

501
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,880
now that there's no more obstacle.

502
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,760
Even if he didn't have anyone,

503
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,880
he would still only think of me
as his little sister.

504
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,800
He would never be interested

505
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,400
in being with a horrible woman like me.

506
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,480
Why are you all drenched?

507
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,040
You always work late
and have no time to rest.

508
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Is the money really worth it?

509
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,440
When you lived in the countryside,

510
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
your life was much more peaceful.

511
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,560
What did I ever do?

512
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,360
Why are you so nice to me?

513
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,720
I've never met anyone as pitiable as you.

514
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
I feel sorry for you.

515
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,640
I'm not sure if it's a good thing

516
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,920
that you're a judge.

517
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,640
Your life is so shitty.

518
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,520
Maybe it's better to be poor like me.

519
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,200
Thank you, Boi.

520
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,040
She was waiting for you
to put her to bed and fell asleep.

521
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,760
I'll wake her up.

522
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,520
It's okay.

523
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,520
She can sleep here.

524
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,960
I should wake her
so you can sleep comfortably.

525
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,200
I don't mind.

526
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,160
I wish I could sleep soundly like this.

527
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,440
<i>Even my own mom
doesn't love her kids equally.</i>

528
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,200
<i>This is how I was raised,
so I understand how these things work.</i>

529
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm not my mom's favorite child.

530
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,760
It taught me to learn
how to live without love.

531
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,360
Not everyone

532
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,080
is worthy of being loved, Anong.

533
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,240
<i>Am I right?</i>

534
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,600
How could he think that?

535
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,440
How did he turn out this way?

536
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,160
Everyone wants to be loved.

537
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,440
What did Urai say?

538
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,880
Did she agree to let Chantorn marry me?

539
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,600
She said she needed
to talk to Luang Turakit first.

540
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,640
He's only Chantorn's brother-in-law.

541
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,400
He shouldn't have a say in this.

542
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,000
Urai has asked for you
not to contact Chantorn

543
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,680
while she considers the proposal.

544
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,680
Try to prove to her

545
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,080
that you're willing
to treat her sister with respect.

546
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,040
How long must I wait?

547
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,360
You quit your job so suddenly.

548
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,040
Now you're out of work.

549
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,400
It's up to you to prove
to Urai that she can trust you.

550
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,040
You should be ashamed of yourself

551
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,360
for pressuring Wichai
to get an answer for you.

552
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,400
What do you want?

553
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,920
How can you be so shameless?

554
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,080
Wichai gives you everything you ask for

555
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,120
and all you do is take and take.

556
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,840
It's not like
Wichai could marry Chantorn himself.

557
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,440
I'm looking for Nid's birth certificate.

558
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,480
I remember I have a copy of it.
I don't know where I put it.

559
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,720
- Nid's birth certificate?
- Yes.

560
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,560
Why are you looking for it?

561
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,040
I have to take her
to apply to a new school today.

562
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,920
I remembered that
the school asked us to bring it.

563
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,720
I already took her yesterday.

564
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,600
You were really busy yesterday,
so I took her myself.

565
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Did you forget?

566
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,320
What's wrong, Wichai?

567
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,920
You're burning up.

568
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,240
You have a fever.

569
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,720
Wichai, why don't you rest today?

570
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,000
I was in the rain yesterday.

571
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,040
I'll go wash up
and I'll probably feel better.

572
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,760
Right, Choy.

573
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
Can you bring me some medicine?

574
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,320
Wichai!

575
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,400
Wichai!

576
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,880
Wichai! Can you hear me, Wichai?

577
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,920
- Help!
- Wichai!

578
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,560
Wichai! What happened?

579
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,040
He's burning up. Wichai.

580
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,560
Boi! We need to go get a doctor!

581
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,360
Wichai, can you hear me? Wichai.

582
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,240
You're scaring me.

583
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,400
Wichai.

584
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,040
Wake up, Wichai!

585
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,760
Wake up!

586
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Nid.

587
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,480
What are you doing here?

588
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,480
Uncle Wichai is dying.

589
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,440
Wichai, wake up! I said wake up!

590
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,960
Wake up!

591
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
- Wichai.
- Wichai.

592
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,240
- Wichai, please wake up.
- Wichai, wake up.

593
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,480
Wake up, Wichai.

594
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,920
Please wake up, Wichai.

595
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,000
Wichai won't wake up.

596
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,640
What happened to him?

597
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,640
What happened to my son?

598
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,880
Wichai has to be okay.

599
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,840
I won't let anyone
take my son away from me!

600
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,200
Go see how Wichai is doing
and come tell me. Go.

601
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,560
- Please calm down, ma'am.
- Hurry.

602
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,760
What happened?

603
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,440
Wichai passed out.

604
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,120
He's still unconscious.

605
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,400
Wichai.

606
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,120
Will he be okay?

607
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,920
My son cannot die before me.

608
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,600
You can't do that to me, Wichai.

609
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,320
Wichai.

610
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,080
Let's pray for him, ma'am.

611
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,000
- Wichai.
- He'll be okay.

612
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,560
Please don't leave me, Wichai.

613
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,480
Wichai.

614
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,640
You cannot leave me.

615
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,640
You have to be okay, Wichai.

616
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,440
Wichai.

617
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,520
Wichai.

618
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,320
I've never been this scared in my life.

619
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,520
Wichai.

620
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,080
Please be okay, Wichai.

621
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,440
I won't be mad at you anymore
even if you don't love me back.

622
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,040
Just live, Wichai.

623
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,480
It seems he's sustained damage
to his nerves.

624
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,280
Several years ago, he wrote to consult
with me about his neuropathy.

625
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
He was stationed outside Bangkok,

626
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,240
so he didn't get it treated.

627
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,520
The wounds on his body indicate that

628
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,560
he has muscle weakness
in his legs and arms.

629
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,480
Doctor, does Wichai have
a chance at recovery?

630
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,280
I can make a more detailed diagnosis
once he regains consciousness.

631
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,880
He also has a fever.

632
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,440
We need to get his fever down.

633
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,880
My worry is that
he might also have pneumonia.

634
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,720
Why did he let it get this bad?

635
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,760
Will Wichai wake up, Doctor?

636
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,200
His body is very weak,
so his symptoms are taking a toll on him.

637
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,800
I'll leave him medicine
and I'll come by every day.

638
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,920
Right now, I still can't say
whether he'll make a full recovery.

639
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,520
Wichai.

640
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,960
Please wake up, honey.

641
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,760
Tell me if you're hungry
or if you feel pain anywhere.

642
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,320
Tell me so I can help you, Wichai.

643
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,520
<i>We're told to prepare for the worst.</i>

644
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,760
Wichai may never fully recover from this.

645
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,280
Has Wichai woken up yet?

646
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,720
He just woke up this evening.

647
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,000
But he still can't get up.

648
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,600
He kept rambling on and on.

649
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,960
All the problems he was dealing with
probably broke his spirit.

650
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,320
He talked as if he was about to die.

651
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Can you get Luang Turakit here?

652
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,960
Wichai.

653
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,520
Why do you want me to get him?

654
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,640
I need to ask him
to let Chantorn marry Chut.

655
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,720
If I'm gone,

656
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,200
Mom will never ask him.

657
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,800
Why would you worry about Chut?

658
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,720
You should think of yourself right now.

659
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,120
If I don't do it,

660
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,160
I won't be able to face Dad after this.

661
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,280
I promised him
that I would look after Chut.

662
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,720
Stop worrying about Chut already.

663
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,080
Right now,
you should focus on getting better.

664
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
I shouldn't be with anyone.

665
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,040
I know I'll live a short life like Dad

666
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,640
ever since I found out
I have this disease.

667
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,280
I don't want anyone to suffer
because of me.

668
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,640
I don't want anyone to be sad

669
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,680
once I'm gone.

670
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,760
Wichai believes that
he won't live a long life,

671
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,440
so he doesn't let himself
fall in love with anyone.

672
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,800
That's why he let Chantorn be with Chut.

673
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,440
He doesn't want to get attached to anyone.

674
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,280
I can't believe

675
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,960
that someone can be so selfless.

676
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,960
This world is so cruel to him

677
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,640
for hurting him this badly.

678
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,120
Having a niece

679
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,400
makes me realize

680
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,080
what it's like to have someone
love you unconditionally.

681
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,120
<i>Nid loves me when she doesn't even know
what kind of person I am.</i>

682
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,600
<i>She loves me though I'm not her dad.</i>

683
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,800
<i>She has never left me.</i>

684
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,560
Thank you so much

685
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,440
for letting her be in my life.

686
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,360
How could anyone not love
someone like him?

687
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,800
Wichai should know

688
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,480
that there are
so many people who love him.

689
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,240
It's like he has lost the will to live.

690
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,520
Both Chut and Mom
have made him feel brokenhearted.

691
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,720
I don't know if it means anything.

692
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,840
Wichai tried to comfort me
about Chut last night

693
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,320
when his heart was also in pieces.

694
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,920
He kept worrying about me

695
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,960
that I wouldn't be able
to move on with my life.

696
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
What did Wichai say to you?

697
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,320
If you want someone you love to be yours,

698
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,760
that's lust.

699
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,120
Though you don't get
to have the one you love,

700
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,720
it doesn't mean
that your love will disappear.

701
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,960
Your love for that person

702
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,840
is still there inside of you.

703
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,560
I get it now.

704
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,520
I know now
what you tried to run away from.

705
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,320
So you understand now

706
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,840
what it feels like
to not have anyone love you.

707
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,240
"The person who gives love

708
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,280
is the one who must bear its weight."

709
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,320
I'll never forget that.

710
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,760
My life was like a living hell

711
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,120
because I had to live with that feeling.

712
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,600
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

713
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,720
Please forgive me.

714
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,960
<i>The doctor said
Wichai has peripheral neuropathy</i>

715
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,720
<i>which affects his motor functions.</i>

716
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,720
<i>So we don't know
whether he'll be able to walk</i>

717
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,720
<i>once he wakes up.</i>

718
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,480
<i>Wichai got sick because of that girl.</i>

719
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,480
<i>Why are they in such a hurry
to get married now?</i>

720
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,000
I'll never accept her
as my daughter-in-law.

721
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,440
I don't care what anyone else says.

722
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,560
They can't change my mind.

723
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,440
Thank you for being here.

724
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,960
Can you promise me

725
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,920
that you'll live a long life
so that I can keep loving you?

726
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,080
You don't have to love me back.

727
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,880
Just stay with me and don't go anywhere.

728
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,160
