1
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,000
I mortgaged our house to the bank.

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,560
I needed money for my business.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
He has a cash flow problem.

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,520
He might even need to file for bankruptcy.

6
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,480
You forced Chantorn into debt
without her consent.

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
I can't let my sister
marry a reckless guy like you.

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
Someone tried to break us up.

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
Was it Anong?

10
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,440
So that's why she came to the wedding.

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,320
Did you talk to Chantorn's family today?

12
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,840
Maybe Anong isn't the one behind this.

13
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,200
They couldn't leave fast enough

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
once they know that Chut is in debt.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,720
<i>We once exchanged secrets
to make us closer.</i>

16
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,880
<i>Why don't you tell me
about the secret you're keeping?</i>

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,640
I can't stand seeing you
love someone else.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,560
I don't know what to do
to make you love an evil girl like me.

19
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Are you here to see Wichai?

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Yes.

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,320
Wichai went to Chut's house.

22
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,360
Chut.

23
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
Get up.

24
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,440
Why are you just lying here?

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm trying to figure out
what to do with my life.

26
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,480
Why did Anong betray me?

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Anong didn't tell Chantorn's family
about the mortgage contract.

28
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,360
How do you know that?

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,200
She came to congratulate you.

30
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,040
She didn't come to ruin your wedding.

31
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,600
As for how her brother
took over your business,

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,840
maybe he didn't do it to hurt you.

33
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
He just wanted to teach me a lesson.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Why would he do that to you?

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,760
Aren't you two friends?

36
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
I saw the photo in your office

37
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,720
that you kept on the bookshelf.

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
The photo was ripped in half.

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
You're still single.

40
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,320
I think it's because you have a love
that you can't tell anyone.

41
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,120
He's a businessman.

42
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,480
He prioritizes profits
before anything else.

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,280
Getting to tear us down
is probably just a bonus.

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,800
But he said he was rooting for me
because of you.

45
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,800
Right.

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,760
But since I've burned bridges with him,

47
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
he no longer feels like
he has to respect me.

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
I won't let the debt
that I got myself into

49
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,240
affect your career in any way.

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,600
I admit that I made a mistake.

51
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,720
But I won't let anyone suffer
because of it.

52
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,960
Wichai. Just leave it there. I will…

53
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm here to get my things.

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,760
I thought you already went back
to Sawankhalok.

55
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,920
Urai went home without me.

56
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
Then you don't need to leave.

57
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,520
Because this is your home.

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
Here's the monthly payment
for the mortgage.

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,560
This is my problem.

60
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,840
I don't expect you
to help me pay off my debt.

61
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,040
If you're too embarrassed
to accept this money,

62
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
then you don't really want
to spend your life with me.

63
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,680
It's my duty as a man to make sure
my wife lives comfortably.

64
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,760
I never expected you
to live in poverty with me.

65
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,720
That's what others think you should do.

66
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,040
Have you ever asked me what I want?

67
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
I know

68
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,680
that I'm not a good guy.

69
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
But this is my duty as a man.

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,080
So you lied to me and everyone

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,320
out of pride?

72
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,160
If I want someone to provide for me,

73
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,440
I can just marry some other guy.

74
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,680
But I want to marry someone I love.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,920
I want someone I can trust.

76
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
Money

77
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,240
means nothing to me.

78
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,400
This is nothing compared
to what you've done for me.

79
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,400
You've helped me with my marriage.

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
You're even building a house
for me and Chut.

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,320
I don't know what I can ever do

82
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
to repay you for the kindness
you've shown me.

83
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,400
You can repay me

84
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,160
by giving Chut all your love.

85
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,920
That's all I want from you.

86
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,120
I will take care of you

87
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
and I'll make you happy every day.

88
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
Please don't leave me.

89
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,720
Urai believes
that I'm being fooled by you.

90
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
Please prove her wrong.

91
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,120
My family already cut me off.

92
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You're all I have left.

93
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,960
Please don't lie to me ever again.

94
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,680
Thank you for still thinking of me.

95
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,840
I really appreciate it.

96
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
I've finished cleaning up the place, sir.

97
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,320
Shall we go home?

98
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
You've been out all day.

99
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,680
You haven't eaten anything.
You might fall ill again.

100
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I have to go pick Nid up first.

101
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,720
I'll be damned.

102
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,880
What's gotten into him this time?

103
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,320
Come take these inside.

104
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,920
- Hey, look.
- What is it?

105
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
Are you feeling all better, Wichai?

106
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,680
I haven't had a chance to thank you

108
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
for all the gifts you sent me.

109
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
We're neighbors.
There's no need to thank us.

110
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,480
We think of you as our own family.

111
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,200
It's us who should apologize
for all the trouble Anong caused you.

112
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,960
I actually want to talk to you about that.

113
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,560
There's a letter for you, ma'am.
Your aunts said to read it immediately.

114
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
It's a letter from Wichai.

115
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,280
<i>First of all, I must apologize to you</i>

116
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>for how I acted out of anger.</i>

117
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,040
<i>I just realized
I was being incredibly rude to you,</i>

118
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,480
<i>but my intentions came from a good place</i>

119
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,120
<i>and I did not mean to offend you.</i>

120
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
<i>What happened wasn't your fault.</i>

121
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,600
<i>It was my fault for losing my composure.</i>

122
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,520
<i>I apologize from the bottom of my heart.</i>

123
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,680
I APOLOGIZE
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

124
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,120
<i>I've thought carefully
about what you said to me.</i>

125
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,760
<i>I truly appreciate
the feelings you have for me.</i>

126
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,560
<i>It means so much to me
in this moment when I'm feeling weak.</i>

127
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,960
<i>But I'm afraid you might be too optimistic</i>

128
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,240
<i>to hold me in high esteem
and regard me as a perfect man.</i>

129
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,000
<i>Maybe you've forgotten that I'm a widower.</i>

130
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
<i>My late wife committed suicide.</i>

131
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,360
<i>That should be enough proof
that I'm not a very good lover.</i>

132
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
<i>I'm not sure if you would want
to spend your exciting and joyful life</i>

133
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,520
<i>with such a boring person like me.</i>

134
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,960
<i>Even if you don't mind that,</i>

135
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,120
<i>you have to think
about your family's approval.</i>

136
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
<i>They may not approve
of the two of us being together.</i>

137
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
<i>I don't want to rush you</i>

138
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,680
<i>to make a decision based on your feelings.</i>

139
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,640
<i>I want you to think about
your future happiness as a priority.</i>

140
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,040
<i>I'd like you to take some time
to reconsider this.</i>

141
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,560
<i>I will not accept an answer from you
until one month has passed.</i>

142
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,160
<i>Let's give each other some space.</i>

143
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,040
<i>You may come to find
that I'm not that important to you.</i>

144
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,440
<i>No matter what you decide to do
one month from now,</i>

145
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,600
<i>I won't forget
the kindness you've shown me.</i>

146
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
<i>I'll remember it for the rest of my life.</i>

147
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,720
<i>Though we may not end up together,</i>

148
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
<i>I'll treasure these feelings forever.</i>

149
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
Aunties.

150
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
Wichai came to ask our permission.

151
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,040
How should I put it?

152
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,720
It's more like he came
to ask us for some advice.

153
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,200
Let's say he was trying to see

154
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
whether we would like him

155
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
to take responsibility for what happened.

156
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,040
Take responsibility for what exactly?

157
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
Did Wichai do something to you

158
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,280
that could be considered inappropriate?

159
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,160
No. Not at all.

160
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,200
Wichai is making
a big deal out of nothing.

161
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,920
He doesn't have
to take responsibility for me.

162
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,320
Anyway, he would like to know

163
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,720
whether we'd be willing
to welcome him into our family.

164
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
What did you say to him

165
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,680
to make him chase me away like this?

166
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,960
He said nothing negative about you
in his letter.

167
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,960
He is being generous

168
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,320
in letting you reconsider his proposal.

169
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
He didn't say it directly,

170
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,680
but I know he's judging me.

171
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,040
That's why he tries
to distance himself from me.

172
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
What happened is in the past,
you can't do anything to fix it.

173
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,880
There's no point worrying
about what he thinks of you.

174
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,280
He's only asking you
to think things through.

175
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,040
You should try thinking with your head
and not your heart for once, Anong.

176
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,720
Sometimes we have to learn
to live without the things we want

177
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,160
and learn to endure the things
that make us unhappy.

178
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,880
This could be a test for you
to learn to control yourself.

179
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,480
If you can't do it,

180
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,960
then that means

181
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,080
you might not be the right person
for Wichai.

182
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
I won't put up with this.

183
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
Are you here about the letter?

184
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,640
I'm here because

185
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,120
I want to talk to you about--

186
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,480
Anong.

187
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
Do you want to help me make potpourri?

188
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
Anong.

189
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,080
Anong.

190
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
Come make potpourri with me.

191
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,920
- Come on.
- Okay.

192
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,040
Let's go.

193
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,520
Someone asked me to make potpourri
for them as wedding gifts.

194
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,040
So I want to make some for you as well.

195
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,040
Come have a look.

196
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm actually drying the flowers.

197
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,359
Wichai.

198
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Isn't your school the sponsor

199
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,440
for this year's fundraising play?

200
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,240
I didn't receive a ticket this year.

201
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,200
Lady Mayom who is part
of the Women's Association

202
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,240
must've tried to exclude me.

203
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,520
Back when she wanted Chut
to marry her daughter,

204
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
she invited me to every social event.

205
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Now that Chut is married,

206
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,440
she couldn't care less about me.

207
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,040
She's taking all the credit
when I'm the one making the donation.

208
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I can't believe it.

209
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,120
How could she do this to me?
Are you listening to me, Wichai?

210
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm listening.

211
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm not in Bangkok much,
so I probably won't get to go.

212
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm very upset about this.

213
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
Just calm down.

214
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,840
This is me being calm.

215
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,480
How could she do this to me?

216
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
What do you think, Wichai?

217
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,160
- I think you should sit down.
- Come sit with me.

218
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,360
I don't understand
how things turned out like this.

219
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,240
She's such a horrid woman.

220
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,320
I thought we agreed

221
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,320
not to see each other for a month.

222
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,440
I don't want you to marry me
out of some obligation.

223
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,720
Why must you make a big deal out of it?

224
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,000
If I just wanted the thrill of the chase,

225
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,480
I didn't have
to chase after a man like you.

226
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,320
There are men who are younger,
more sophisticated,

227
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
and more stylish than you
who are ready to marry me.

228
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,160
You think too little of me.

229
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,240
You think that I pursue you
because of fleeting feelings.

230
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,080
Hey.

231
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
I never thought that about you.

232
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,840
I just want you to think
about this more carefully.

233
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,040
Even now, you think that I'm mean.

234
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
That's one aspect of me

235
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,680
that you'll have to live with.

236
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,160
I accept your challenge.

237
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,320
I will go into hibernation.

238
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,000
I won't show my face here for a month.

239
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,360
You just try to stay away from me.

240
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,800
Come on.

241
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,240
This isn't a competition.

242
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,160
I just want you to try
to live your life without me.

243
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,160
I've waited for you for this long.

244
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,800
One month

245
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,680
won't make me change my mind.

246
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,840
It's you

247
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,120
who might not be able
to stay away from me.

248
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,320
You'll see in 30 days.

249
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,200
One of us will change our mind

250
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,360
and it won't be me.

251
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,280
Watch your step. We're almost there.

252
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,640
Surprise!

253
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
What is all this?

254
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
It's our honeymoon.

255
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,400
I brought Hua Hin here to you

256
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,760
to save money.

257
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,680
Today, we'll celebrate
like we're at a hotel in Hua Hin.

258
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Come have a seat.

259
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,840
What would you like to drink, ma'am?

260
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,000
I'd like some coconut juice
since we're at the beach.

261
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,040
Coconut juice? Right away, ma'am.

262
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,360
Please wait a moment.

263
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Gosh.

264
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,560
Will I get to drink
my coconut juice today?

265
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,600
I didn't know it would be this hard.

266
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,360
I thought you said
you wouldn't let me starve.

267
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,840
Let me do it, city boy.

268
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,240
Wait.

269
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,120
Be careful not to cut yourself.

270
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,440
Just let me do it.

271
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
There you go.

272
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,080
How did you do it?

273
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,840
I grew up in the countryside.

274
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,840
A city boy like you can't compete with me.

275
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,320
Whenever I'm with you,

276
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,880
you always make me feel so incompetent.

277
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Let me see.

278
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
Let's test your vocabulary.

279
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,680
Energetic and agile.

280
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,240
To find something funny.

281
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,800
To be on one's own.

282
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,760
Loudly.

283
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,040
Full of anger.

284
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,680
Great job.

285
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,480
Why did you circle these words?

286
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,280
Uncle Wichai had me memorize words
that are related to my mom.

287
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,960
Those words are easier for me to memorize.

288
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
Your uncle taught you these words?

289
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Yes.

290
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,280
He said it's like a game.

291
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,400
This way, I'll be able
to memorize the words quickly.

292
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,560
Well then.

293
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,280
How about I teach you
some new words today?

294
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,680
Okay.

295
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,840
Let's start with this word.

296
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,200
Do you know what it means?

297
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,920
You're so hardworking.

298
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,640
Shouldn't you be in bed?

299
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Hold on.

300
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,800
Do you know the meaning
of the word you're writing?

301
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,680
It means the love of your life.

302
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,000
And do you know
what the love of your life means?

303
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
It means you.

304
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,320
Aunt Anong taught me words
that are related to you.

305
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,080
Why would she teach this to a kid?

306
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
Aunt Anong said today is Valentine's Day.

307
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,760
So she's allowed to tell you
she loves you.

308
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,840
Are you ready, ma'am?

309
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,800
One, two, three.

310
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,200
That's very beautiful. We're all done.

311
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,720
Is this yours, ma'am?
Someone asked me to give it to you.

312
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,800
It's mine.

313
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,480
You can pick up your photograph
in three days.

314
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,840
Hey, Wichai. Thank you so much

315
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
for getting me a ticket to the play.

316
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
It's even a front-row seat.

317
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,800
I know I could count on you.

318
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,440
Please come this way, ma'am.

319
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
Thank you so much.

320
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
This way, ma'am.

321
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,000
Wichai isn't home.
He's in Trang right now.

322
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
Trang?

323
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,400
He moved there a while ago to recuperate.

324
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
How could he just leave?

325
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,120
Why didn't he tell us?

326
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,680
He has been planning
to move there for a while.

327
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
I just got a letter from him yesterday.

328
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,600
WICHAI WARATHABUT
152 WISESKUL ROAD, TRANG PROVINCE

329
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,280
Anong.

330
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,000
Master!

331
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,240
Master!

332
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,760
Come down here.

333
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
- Sir.
- Yes?

334
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,080
Take this contract.

335
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,560
- And give it to the buyer.
- Okay.

336
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,080
Have him confirm that
he will pay you the agreed price.

337
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
- Then you can give him the rice.
- Okay.

338
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,120
If he doesn't do as he agreed,

339
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,880
you can take this contract
to the court and file a complaint.

340
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,480
Okay. All right.

341
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,040
Give it a read first.

342
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
Okay.

343
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,800
Here's an envelope.

344
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,000
Thank you so much.
I brought something for you.

345
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,760
It's really good stuff.

346
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,040
Here you go.

347
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,080
You can share it with your helper.

348
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,880
It's really delicious.

349
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,840
Thank you.

350
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
Thank you for your help.

351
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
Is coming here a mistake?

352
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,920
You haven't made a single baht
since you moved here.

353
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,920
Instead of getting to stay
in a fancy state residence,

354
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
you have to live in this stuffy place.

355
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,040
I can't live in a state residence
since I quit my job.

356
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Why would you quit
if you still want to take on cases?

357
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,840
I'm not fully recovered yet.

358
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,280
I can't fully commit
to my job in this state.

359
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,840
Are you sure
you're earning enough to get by?

360
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,080
Hey, Boi.

361
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,360
You've become a snob
after spending a while in the city.

362
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,120
Now you're complaining
about some small hardships.

363
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,720
Do you want fried fish?

364
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,920
Let's go with fish stew.

365
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,000
Prasit.

366
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,120
Now that I think about Sa-Ang

367
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,760
and how she tried so hard
to find herself a man,

368
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,200
she actually reminds me of myself.

369
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,200
If a good man is so hard to find,

370
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,400
I think maybe I don't need to get married.

371
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,680
Prasit.

372
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,440
Why don't we go away
somewhere for a while?

373
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,240
Maybe we can go to Hua Hin.

374
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,880
PRA ATTHAKADEE WICHAI

375
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,840
Master.

376
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Master, a new court officer
just moved in next door.

377
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,360
Come have a look.

378
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,840
She looks familiar.

379
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,320
Maybe my eyes deceived me.

380
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,560
It's her, right?

381
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,120
How did you get here?

382
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm here to give you my answer
like I promised.

383
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,480
How did you know I'm here?

384
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,520
If you want to go away,

385
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,760
don't just go to Hua Hin.

386
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Let's go here.

387
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,000
WICHAI WARATHABUT
152 WISESKUL ROAD, TRANG PROVINCE

388
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,000
My gosh.

389
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,600
One month has passed

390
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,880
and I haven't changed my mind.

391
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,080
Why did you run away from me?

392
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,080
I didn't run away from you.

393
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,280
I just wanted you to know that
my job requires me to move constantly.

394
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,480
We won't be apart for just one month.

395
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,320
We might not see each other for months.

396
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,840
It's something you have to accept.

397
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,400
I know that.

398
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,600
That's why I came here.
This way, we can be together.

399
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,120
Hey.

400
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,280
Will you really stay here?

401
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,680
I don't believe you can live here.

402
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,199
I'm not leaving.

403
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,440
The court will have to fire me
to make me leave.

404
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,159
I saw there was a job opening

405
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,080
for a court officer position
right here in Trang.

406
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,400
So I took the job

407
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,440
knowing that
you're working as a judge here.

408
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,400
I already quit my job.

409
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,280
- You quit your job?
- Yes.

410
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,280
Then why are you here
if it's not for work?

411
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,719
I came here to recuperate.

412
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
All your effort might be in vain.

413
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,320
Prasit.

414
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,360
Prasit.

415
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Hey! Wichai!

416
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,960
Stop unpacking.

417
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
You'll be leaving soon.

418
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,360
We're here to try to get you
to come back with us.

419
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,280
Listen.

420
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,240
How did you guys get here?

421
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
What did you tell your family?

422
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,880
We told them
we were vacationing in Hua Hin.

423
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,880
No one knows that we followed you here.

424
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,280
Listen.

425
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,400
You can't lie to everyone like that.

426
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
This is a serious matter.

427
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,960
We know it's a serious matter.

428
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,880
We're seriously moving here.

429
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,680
Let me help you.

430
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,840
Please go home. You can't stay here.

431
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,880
Do you want people to say
that you ran away with a man?

432
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,040
Come on.

433
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,000
Hey.

434
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,480
You left me no choice
since you ran away from me.

435
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,480
If you don't want
my reputation to get tarnished…

436
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,440
Here's what you can do.

437
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,320
You and I can get married.

438
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,440
Hold on.

439
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,000
Are you asking me to marry you?

440
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
That's right.

441
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,080
This is the only way
that we can be together.

442
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Hey.

443
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,320
You know full well

444
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,040
that we can't do that.

445
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,040
Why not?

446
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,320
Because what you're doing isn't love.

447
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
You just want to win

448
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,920
because no one
has ever rejected you like I did.

449
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,560
You don't want to lose
so you refuse to accept the truth.

450
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,120
I think I've heard that before.

451
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,600
If it were a few months ago,

452
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,240
I would've left
if you said you didn't like me.

453
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,840
But I'm a changed woman

454
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,880
and I won't run away from you.

455
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,080
If you're not ready,

456
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,720
then it's okay.

457
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,320
We can try

458
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,760
dating each other first.

459
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,680
What?

460
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,880
Do you realize
that you're asking for trouble?

461
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,600
Sompong is going to kill me
if he finds out about this.

462
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,240
You can't go back on your word.

463
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,280
You said you'd accept my decision
no matter what I decide.

464
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,000
We said we'd give each other space.

465
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,440
You didn't do as we agreed.

466
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,160
You didn't either.

467
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,000
I saw you follow me

468
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,640
to the photography studio.

469
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,800
Let me tell you something.

470
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,120
A police officer was going
to give you a ticket.

471
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,280
I was just trying to help you.

472
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,080
Is this your car, sir?

473
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,080
Well, I'm very sorry.

474
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,960
The road is a public property.

475
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,840
You can't just park where you please.

476
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,840
Yes, sir.

477
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,720
You couldn't stand
to see me in trouble, right?

478
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
I see.

479
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,160
You knew I helped you,

480
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,560
so you repaid me

481
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,080
by sending my mom
a ticket to the play, right?

482
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,560
Hey, Wichai. Thank you so much

483
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,800
for getting me a ticket to the play.

484
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,760
I know I could count on you.

485
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,600
The ticket was addressed to you,
so Mom took it.

486
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,680
WICHAI WARATHABUT

487
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,320
You didn't try to do as we agreed
during that one month.

488
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,720
You didn't either.

489
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,360
You asked that beggar
to help keep an eye on me.

490
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,320
<i>Most people only give
spare change to that beggar.</i>

491
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,320
<i>I'm the only one who likes
to give him big notes.</i>

492
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,680
<i>But then,</i>

493
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,440
<i>I saw someone give him money before I did.</i>

494
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,200
Do you remember the car
that's always parked here every day?

495
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,120
Yes, I remember.

496
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,640
From now on, can you keep an eye
on the lady who owns that car?

497
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,320
She can't drive very well.

498
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,880
I know it was you

499
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,920
who asked that man
to help keep an eye on me.

500
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,720
Come park right here, ma'am.

501
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,040
You've never stopped looking out for me.

502
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,520
So how can I stop loving you?

503
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
You won't change my mind

504
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,760
no matter how many times you reject me.

505
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,360
I know it has nothing to do with me.

506
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,640
You're rejecting me

507
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,160
because you're still afraid

508
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,000
to let yourself
fall in love with someone, right?

509
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,920
You can't change my mind.

510
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,320
Just go home.

511
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,040
What is this?

512
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,920
If you have no feelings for me,

513
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,760
why do you have this picture with you?

514
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,680
I gave this picture of me to your niece.

515
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,600
Why is it here with you?

516
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,200
Do you have these too?

517
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
These are the words about me

518
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
that you taught your niece.

519
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,640
Aunt Anong is kind like an angel.

520
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,320
Well then.

521
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,280
How about A for Angel?

522
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,600
Aung Anong is also pretty.

523
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
She's beautiful.

524
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,560
These are the words that
Uncle Wichai picked to describe you.

525
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,280
He said you make him want to cuddle you.

526
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,040
You're lively and you live
in a big house like a princess.

527
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,160
Uncle Wichai also said you're very lovely

528
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
and that you're gorgeous.

529
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,520
You're very chatty

530
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,960
and you're a charming person.

531
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,160
He also said that you are

532
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,600
a confident person.

533
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,960
Gosh.

534
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you

535
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,640
for letting me know how you feel about me.

536
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,720
Stop trying to fool yourself

537
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,840
that you have no feelings for me.

538
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,040
PRA ATTHAKADEE WICHAI

539
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,200
Master!

540
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,160
We have a problem.

541
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,760
It's really bad.

542
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,720
The power went out.
We couldn't see anything.

543
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,160
Why didn't you light some candles?

544
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,960
We couldn't find any matchsticks.

545
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,840
It was so dark that
we couldn't even see our own hands.

546
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,000
It was pitch black like we were in a cave.

547
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,920
I also heard
the sound of some animal crying.

548
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,920
But you still managed
to find your way here.

549
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,720
Very well then.

550
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,920
You two can stay over at my house tonight.

551
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,360
Don't you see she's trying to seduce you?

552
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,920
You can't run away from us.

553
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,760
We'll follow you everywhere.

554
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,920
We'll always be there even in your dreams.

555
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,400
Move!

556
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,280
Get out of the way!

557
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,160
I'll go buy you some food.

558
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,000
You didn't have to shout.

559
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,720
Your family must be worried about you.

560
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,160
No one was worried about me
when I was living abroad.

561
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,520
Being in a boarding school is different
from living on your own like this.

562
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,520
Do you remember what I wrote
in the guidebook about myself?

563
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,640
You must live with someone

564
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,560
in order to get to know them.

565
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,920
You can see someone's true colors
only after you have a fight with them.

566
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,760
I'm not worried about us fighting.

567
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,680
I know we can get past it.

568
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,000
But when it comes to spending
a few days living together,

569
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,520
I'm not sure we can do that.

570
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,720
If we try dating each other

571
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,320
and things don't work out between us,

572
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,320
will you be okay with that?

573
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,120
In Western cultures,
people don't just date each other.

574
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,160
They actually try living together
before they get married.

575
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,360
You don't actually plan
on doing that, right?

576
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,640
Come on, Wichai.

577
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Are you scared it will be inappropriate?

578
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
I'm not asking you to commit murder.

579
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,200
It isn't even against the law.

580
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,680
Anong.

581
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,240
Come look at this.

582
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
TRANG'S ROASTED PORK

583
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,120
- Anong, look.
- Hello.

584
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,080
Look at these turtles, Anong.

585
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,960
What can I get you?

586
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,360
Well, I'd like two cups of coffee
and some fried dough sticks.

587
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,800
They're so adorable.

588
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,600
Are they tasty?

589
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,640
Here you go.

590
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,640
I'll go buy some roasted pork.

591
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,800
Look at these, Wichai.

592
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,520
They're adorable.

593
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,760
These are called <i>Ang Ku Kueh</i>.

594
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,880
They are red tortoise cakes.

595
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,160
Hey.

596
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,640
You're a lady. You need to be more careful

597
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,360
when you're out in public.

598
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,240
Are you listening to me?

599
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,640
I don't see any danger here.

600
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,800
Everyone seems friendly.

601
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,280
Here's the food you ordered.

602
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,720
Two cups of coffee and fried dough sticks.

603
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,840
And here.

604
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,200
A gentleman bought you coffee.
He said you're pretty.

605
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,120
I see.

606
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,440
Thank you.

607
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,640
He's a stranger.

608
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,160
Don't be too friendly with him.

609
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,080
I don't want to be rude.

610
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Stop flirting with him.

611
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,520
You'll get yourself in trouble.

612
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,280
I've always been flirty,

613
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,560
but this is the first time
that you got jealous.

614
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
It finally worked.

615
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,480
Hey.

616
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,440
Is it so hard for you

617
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,200
to not flirt around?

618
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,600
Hello. Would you like to buy some fruit?

619
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,840
Look at these mangoes.

620
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,000
- Would you like some?
- You want one, Anong?

621
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,160
- Can I have a bite?
- Sure.

622
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,320
Thank you.

623
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,080
Do you like it?

624
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,680
- How much is it?
- It's okay.

625
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,320
The mirror looks pretty with you.
You can have it for free.

626
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,440
Just take it.

627
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,880
Thank you.

628
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,920
You're welcome.

629
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,600
You don't have to worry
that I'll have a difficult time here.

630
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,360
I already feel at home
after being here for a day.

631
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,160
She only complimented you to be polite.

632
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,200
Those compliments only show
that these people are kind-hearted.

633
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,800
Don't let the praise get to your head.

634
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,800
Don't you think at least
one of those compliments is true?

635
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,320
When people call you pretty,

636
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,720
they only say that to make you feel good.

637
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,480
But if they say that

638
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,320
you're very beautiful

639
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,640
or that you're very lovely,

640
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,120
you can tell that those compliments
come from the heart.

641
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,360
When people praise you
to make you feel good,

642
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,800
it's not the same as when
they truly mean what they say.

643
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,600
What are you saying?
I don't understand what you mean.

644
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,840
If you want to stay here,

645
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,320
your presence here
should serve some kind of purpose.

646
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,800
If you can get the people here

647
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,640
to give you five compliments
with the word "very" in them,

648
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,760
then I'll believe
that you truly belong here.

649
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,640
Only five compliments?

650
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,080
You're really underestimating me.

651
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,320
But they must come from the heart
and have the word "very" in them.

652
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,360
If you receive five compliments like that,

653
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,680
we'll get married and live here together.

654
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,480
You'll marry me?

655
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,960
You cannot take that back.

656
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,960
I won't.

657
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,040
Just don't give up too easily.

658
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,360
It doesn't count if people only say
that you're pretty or sweet.

659
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,360
I can easily get five people
to compliment me.

660
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,840
You might be one of those five people
to compliment me.

661
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,280
Doesn't she look pretty?

662
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,800
How pretty do I look?

663
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,040
You look pretty.

664
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,480
But how pretty?

665
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,600
You're pretty.

666
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,120
We'll take this sarong.

667
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,240
All right.

668
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,640
Let me help you.

669
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,840
Thank you so much.

670
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,080
Doing that won't get you compliments.

671
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,320
I'd like to buy all of these, please.

672
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,840
Do you want to buy all of them?

673
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,840
My gosh.

674
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,480
You've got good eyes, pretty lady.

675
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,480
Here you go.

676
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,560
Thank you.

677
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,440
Here's your money.

678
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,800
Thank you, sir.

679
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,640
How thankful are you?

680
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,160
- Well…
- What?

681
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,200
Get used to it.

682
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,520
You need to learn
to handle disappointment.

683
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,440
It will make you tougher.

684
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,120
Prasit.

685
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,240
Prasit.

686
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,520
Ma'am, are you all right?

687
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,240
I'm okay.

688
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,720
Let me buy all of these
to make it up to you.

689
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,040
Considering the nature
of the defendant's action,

690
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,400
the defendant committed
an unreasonably dangerous act.

691
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,120
I therefore sentence him
to three years of imprisonment.

692
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,640
Thank you so much, miss.

693
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,400
What are these snacks?
They look so appetizing.

694
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,720
They're toasted coconut flakes.
They're Trang's local sweets.

695
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,880
- Would you like all of them?
- Yes, ma'am.

696
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,920
Thank you so much.

697
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,080
Do you have other sweets?

698
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,600
<i>Do you know this woman?</i>

699
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,600
<i>I was the judge
who presided over her case.</i>

700
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,800
<i>I'm ashamed for handing someone
a prison sentence</i>

701
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,680
<i>when they didn't deserve it
and I just got away with it.</i>

702
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,200
It wasn't your fault.

703
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,560
You're very sweet.

704
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,960
What did you say?

705
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,440
<i>You deserve compliments
when you do nice things</i>

706
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,080
<i>without expecting anything in return.</i>

707
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,800
<i>People already think badly of me</i>

708
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,760
that my wife still has to work.

709
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,920
I want to pick you up
every day so people can't say

710
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,640
that I don't take care of you.

711
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,800
I don't know what else to do.

Everyone is equal in the court of law.

00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,880
The justice system was created
to provide everyone justice.

because there's a witness from Penang.

involved in this case?
