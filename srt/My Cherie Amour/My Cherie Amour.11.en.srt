00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,200
Don't think you have to live
because of your obligations.

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
You've helped pay our family's debt
since you were in school.

4
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,480
You've provided for all of us.

5
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,400
You're my son. I can manage
to look after you just fine.

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,920
From now on, I guess it's finally
my turn to take care of everyone.

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,320
Anong and I made these charms for you.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,200
We wrote messages on them
and Nid read them out loud to you.

9
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,960
Every time Anong came to visit you,
you were always asleep.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Ever since Chut quit his job,
he suddenly has a lot of money to spend.

11
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,640
I know where Chut got his money from.

12
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
Chut must be investing
in a business with his friend.

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
It's probably Prach.

14
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
He and Chut are close friends.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
There's something different

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,840
about her information
in the job application form.

CHANTORN WARATHABUT
HEAD OF SALES DEPARTMENT

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,200
People are still not used to seeing

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,040
a half-naked mannequin
in the display window.

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,640
Lingerie is a type of clothing.

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,360
You don't wear it

22
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,760
just for your eyes only.

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,880
A husband should buy
nice lingerie for his wife

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,280
so he can feast his eyes on her.

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,160
I think most women

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,760
are still quite embarrassed

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,560
to say they want to buy lingerie
to show it off to their husbands.

28
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,880
So on your wedding day,
apart from the wedding dress,

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,600
have you thought about
what kind of underwear you'll be wearing?

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
Don't forget.

31
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,040
Your wedding night is just
as important as the wedding ceremony.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Am I right?

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,400
Well, I haven't really thought about that.

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
Just pick one from the store.

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,880
It will be my wedding gift to Chut.

36
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,480
Don't be embarrassed.

37
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
We should be able to talk about this.

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,560
I want all my female customers
to feel comfortable about this

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,040
and treat it as a normal thing.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
I want to return these.

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
These shoes hurt my feet.

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
When did you buy them?

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Do you have the receipt?

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,000
You sold us a low-quality product.
Won't you take any responsibility?

45
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,120
It was that woman who sold me these shoes.

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,720
She tricked me
into buying defective shoes.

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
You there. Can I have a word?

48
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
Do you remember selling these shoes to me?

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,079
I want a refund.

50
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,280
You sold me bad shoes.

51
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,640
You scammed me.

52
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
Excuse me.

53
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,720
Our store doesn't have
a refund policy for used items.

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,680
I see you're a money-grubber
just like your employee.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,200
But if you and Lady Mayom insist
on getting a refund for the shoes,

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,960
I'll make an exception for you
as a gesture of goodwill.

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,080
You should take responsibility
for selling these shoes to my daughter.

58
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,320
I heard that it was Chut
who paid for these shoes.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,280
I'll give the money back to him
since he's the customer.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll have Chantorn

61
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,720
who is our Head of Sales
take care of this matter.

62
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
CHANTORN WARATHABUT
HEAD OF SALES DEPARTMENT

63
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,320
I hope you don't mind
that I'm giving the money to Chut.

64
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,840
Because the fact of the matter is,
you're the one who paid for these shoes.

65
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,960
Are you really defending this snake?

66
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,880
It's beyond me why you keep her around.

67
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
You dare steal someone else's man.

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,520
You really have no shame.

69
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Mom.

70
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,920
Give me that.

71
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
Screw the refund. Let's go, honey.

72
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
Here, ma'am.

73
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,680
You chose to marry
a ladies' man like Chut.

74
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,960
So you must live with the consequences.

75
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
I don't know if he's worth it though.

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,280
CHANTORN WARATHABUT
HEAD OF SALES DEPARTMENT

77
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,480
Don't you need to help Chut
with the wedding preparations?

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm pretending to be oblivious to it
to get back at him and Chantorn.

79
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
They can still have a wedding

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,280
though everyone is against it.

81
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,120
I want to show those two

82
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,240
that I'm on Wichai's side.

83
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,040
Chut didn't even care
when Mom threatened to cut him off.

84
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,000
If Chantorn chose to marry Wichai,

85
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,440
would your mom still disapprove?

86
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,680
If Chantorn chose Wichai,

87
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,120
Mom wouldn't object
though she may not like the idea.

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,560
She's really spoiling Wichai right now.
She won't go against his wishes.

89
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,080
Chut and Chantorn came
to order things for their house.

90
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,800
I'm thinking about whether to give
those things to them as wedding gifts.

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
They must live a lavish lifestyle.

92
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,440
If you want me to be on Wichai's side,

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,960
I don't have to be nice to those two.

94
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,360
I'll go prepare snacks for you.

95
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,920
Thank you.

96
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,920

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

98
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
PURCHASER: CHANTORN WARATHABUT

99
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
Are they already married?

100
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,000
This is why that woman told everyone
Chut is her man.

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,400
Chut told me that he's not going
to invite the district chief

102
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,240
to the wedding.

103
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
I thought he wasn't going
to register the marriage.

104
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,960
Turns out he already did.

105
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,280
Chut is falling
head over heels for that tramp.

106
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,920
She has him completely hooked.

107
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,520
It's because Chut knew

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
that you'd try to ruin his wedding.

109
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,080
That's why he did this.

110
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,240
What about the house?
Did Chut give it to her?

111
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Wichai asked me to handle
the property transfer.

112
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,800
But Chut said he'd do it
and took the deed with him.

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,760
It's possible that he already
transferred the house to Chantorn.

114
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,760
My gosh! Are you kidding me?

115
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,440
How can my son be so stupid?

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,840
I found it.

117
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,680
I found proof.

118
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
What? Let me see.

119
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Chut already registered his marriage.

120
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,840
We can't stop them
from having their wedding now.

121
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
I lost Chut to that woman,

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,960
but I won't let them have the money
that's supposed to be your inheritance.

123
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,480
Sir, I found this letter in the mailbox.

124
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,720
No one's moved in here yet.

125
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,160
Who would send a letter here?

126
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
FROM SANGCHAI BANK

127
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
TO CHUT WARATHABUT

128
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,440
It's for my business.

129
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,560
I asked for the letter to be sent there
since I'll be moving into that house soon.

130
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,600
But that's a debt collection letter.

131
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,360
It's for the business
that I'm doing with my friends.

132
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,040
It's no big deal.

133
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
Are you sure there isn't a problem?

134
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,640
You're no businessman,
so you don't know these things.

135
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,680
This is normal for a business.

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,920
The bank gave us a loan
because they see that

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,040
our business is financially viable.

138
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
You're about to start a family.

139
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
You should think these things through.

140
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,760
I promise you.

141
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,760
-I won't let this affect your career.
-Chut.

142
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,280
I won't do anything
that will hurt my family.

143
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
TO ANONG SUNTORAPONG

144
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Chut asked me to give you
an invitation to our wedding.

145
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,920
We really want you to come.

146
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,440
We're having a small wedding at our place.

147
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,360
Of course, I'll be there.

148
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,280
CHANTORN AND CHUT, DECEMBER 10, 1947

149
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Chut was so worried

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,960
that it'd make you uncomfortable.

151
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,280
So I offered to bring you
the invitation myself.

152
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
What a coincidence.

153
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,120
There are two weddings
happening so close to each other.

154
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,280
You see, I went to see my friend recently.

155
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
She told me that

156
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,400
Chut is having his wedding
just a few days before her big day.

157
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,280
I've been planning my wedding
for the longest time.

158
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Then Chut suddenly announced
that he's also getting married.

159
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,200
All the men made a bet.

160
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,920
Each put in 5,000 baht.

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,880
Whoever gets married first

162
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,440
will win the bet
and get that 100,000 baht.

163
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,720
Chut made a bet with his friends?

164
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,840
The day you two registered your marriage,

165
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,960
did Chut bring his friend to be a witness?

166
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,920
That's right.

167
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,560
His name is Prach.

168
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,360
He owns the movie theater.

169
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,320
Congratulations, man.

170
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,600
Chut got a large sum of money
from winning the bet.

171
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,200
That's how he got the money
to invest in a business with his friends.

172
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,520
I know nothing about this.

173
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,160
Chut never told me.

174
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,160
This is why Chut wanted
to be the first one among his friends

175
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,680
to get married.

176
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,760
Has Chut ever told you about his business?

177
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,800
He's never told me anything.

178
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
He has a cash flow problem.

179
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
The palace owner is furious.

180
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,480
Does this mean
they won't be able to start their club?

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,160
If they don't have the money,
they will have to give up on the project.

182
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,440
That mogul is also struggling financially.

183
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,760
He might even need to file for bankruptcy.

184
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
That will put Chut in trouble.

185
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,400
Your husband got himself into debt.

186
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,800
As his wife, you have
the right to know about this.

187
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,920
Because as his wife,

188
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,960
legally speaking,

189
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,040
you're also responsible for that debt.

190
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,920
It's like I said.

191
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
Since you chose to marry a man like Chut,

192
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,360
you must live with the consequences.

193
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,400
You don't have to believe me.

194
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,720
Let Chut be the one to tell you.

195
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,200
It was just a silly bet
I made with my friends.

196
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,080
What did you hear?

197
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,040
Did someone tell you
something bad about me?

198
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm just surprised that you never told me.

199
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,200
Are you worried that I won't be able
to provide for you since I quit my job?

200
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
It's not that.

201
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,800
But if we're going
to spend our lives together,

202
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,280
you shouldn't keep things from me.

203
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,040
If you hide things from me,

204
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,960
that means you don't trust me.

205
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,960
Is there anything else I should know?

206
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I mortgaged our house to the bank.

207
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,160
I needed money for my business.

208
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,760
Do you mean…

209
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,320
the house that my family asked you
to give me as a dowry?

210
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,320
The house will still be yours.

211
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,480
That land belongs to my family,
so I'm going to get it back.

212
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,200
Urai should know about this.

213
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,600
You need to tell her what happened
before we have our wedding.

214
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Does money mean more to you than love?

215
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,640
This isn't about the money.

216
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,240
This is about the sincerity
that you need to show to my family.

217
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,600
All right.

218
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
I'll handle this.

219
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,640
I know. I still can't contact him.

220
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,600
Give me some time.

221
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,480
I'll keep you updated.

222
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
Is there a problem?

223
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,080
It's just wedding stuff.

224
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,640
I'll move into my house
to prepare for the wedding.

225
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
This is Chut and Chantorn's house.

226
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,160
It's beautiful, right?

227
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,640
Let's go inside.

228
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,200
My friends aren't coming
to the wedding ceremony today.

229
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,680
They all couldn't make it.

230
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,360
Did something happen?

231
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,160
It's nothing.

232
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,840
My friends are busy with work,
so I didn't want to bother them.

233
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,320
That's fine.

234
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,400
We already agreed
to invite only our family members.

235
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,400
Well? Do you like it?

236
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,280
It's the rocking chair
that you kept insisting for me to get.

237
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Thank you so much
for helping me build this house.

238
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,040
This is the first house you ever built

239
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,840
and it's not even for you.

240
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
I'll help you build the next one
for you to live in.

241
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,480
This place is quiet.

242
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,360
They can live a peaceful life here.

243
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,720
You have nothing to worry about
now that Chut is married.

244
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
So when are you going
to find yourself a wife?

245
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,560
Hey. Is that Anong?

246
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,960
Is she really here?

247
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,760
It's not just Anong.

248
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,960
Look. Your mom is also here.

249
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,800
She blasted Chut every day.

250
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,400
Yet she's still here for him.

251
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,720
This is the best place

252
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,240
to get away from the crowd.

253
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,800
You probably want to be left alone.

254
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,680
I won't bother you.

255
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
It's okay.

256
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,040
You're not bothering me.

257
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I should go.

258
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Please have a seat.

259
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,680
Of all the guests here,

260
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,840
we're probably the two people

261
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,760
who understand each other best

262
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,400
since we're in the same position.

263
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,760
I'm not as good an actor as you.

264
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,200
I can't hide my feelings.

265
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,000
Do you think I'm being fake?

266
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
You may be able to swallow your anger,

267
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,120
but I can't stand to have
people look at me with pity.

268
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,680
So you're just going to keep running away?

269
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Thank you.

270
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,720
Thank you for the paper flowers

271
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
and the messages you wrote on them.

272
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,080
Thank you for playing the piano

273
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,160
for me to hear at night.

274
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,600
Thank you for still thinking of me.

275
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,960
I really appreciate it.

276
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,120
I may not know how to hide my anger,

277
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,640
but I think I've managed
to hide my other feelings pretty well.

278
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,360
Your other feelings?

279
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,640
What are those feelings exactly?

280
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,840
If you still can't tell,

281
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,840
that means I'm doing
a very good job at hiding them.

282
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,200
Some people count to a hundred
when they are angry.

283
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,280
But with my feelings,

284
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,120
I have to count to 10,000
or even 100,000 to get over them.

285
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
What about you?

286
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,520
What's the highest number
you've counted to?

287
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,960
From what I remember,

288
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
I've never even started counting.

289
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
I already told you.

290
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,680
I'm always honest about my feelings.

291
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,560
I don't want to lie about how I feel,
but it's necessary.

292
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,720
We once exchanged secrets
to make us closer.

293
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,680
Why don't you tell me
about the secret you're keeping?

294
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
If I tell you this secret,

295
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,240
it will only drive you away from me.

296
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,120
It will be better for both of us

297
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,600
if I keep my feelings to myself.

298
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
You'll thank me for this one day.

299
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,480
This is the house deed. It's in your name.

300
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,560
Didn't you mortgage the house to the bank?

301
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,360
I haven't told your family about that.

302
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,320
So I plan to show them this document.

303
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,920
Is this a fake title deed?

304
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,920
It's just for the ceremony
to make your family happy.

305
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,280
You said you'd talk to Urai about this.

306
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,200
She won't let you marry me

307
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,400
if I can't even give you
the one thing she asked for.

308
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
No one will find out

309
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,680
if we keep this to ourselves.

310
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,320
Marriage is between two people.

311
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,680
Let's not drag anyone else into this.

312
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,960
I'm here to congratulate you.

313
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,560
I wish you a happy marriage.

314
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,600
Thank you so much for coming.

315
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,120
I'm actually thinking I'll leave soon
after seeing the looks from everyone.

316
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,240
Please stay.

317
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,200
I might need to ask you to be my best man.

318
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Gosh.

319
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
Can you ask me something else?

320
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,880
I don't think I should be the one
to lead the groom's wedding procession.

321
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,160
Well, then.

322
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,320
Can you be Chantorn's maid of honor?

323
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Hey.

324
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,080
Why did she even come to this wedding?

325
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,320
Everyone knows that she got dumped.

326
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,640
I'm glad you decided to come.

327
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,640
People will talk if I don't come
to my own son's wedding.

328
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,640
You can't leave early.

329
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,560
You must stay until the ceremony ends.

330
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I'll stay if no one here kicks me out.

331
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,680
You need to take your medicine.

332
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,120
Okay.

333
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,160
Are you sure you're okay?

334
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm okay.

335
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,560
Hey, where is Anong? Where did she go?

336
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,640
She has no reason to stay.

337
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,600
She probably left.

338
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,440
Let's go. We're leaving.

339
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,080
Wait. What's going on?

340
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,600
Just walk away from him.

341
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,160
He's making a fool out of you.

342
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,200
What happened?

343
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,200
Tell me what happened.

344
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
It's over.

345
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,960
Chantorn's family found out
about the house.

346
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,800
MORTGAGE CONTRACT

347
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,720
You mortgaged this house to the bank?

348
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
I don't know how
the contract ended up here.

349
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Someone must've brought it here
and showed it to Urai.

350
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Someone tried to ruin my wedding.

351
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
Was it Anong?

352
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,480
So that's why she came to the wedding.

353
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,960
Anong must've told Chantorn
something about me.

354
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,040
MORTGAGE CONTRACT

355
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,040
Has anyone seen Anong?

356
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
Where is Anong?

357
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
I think she already left.

358
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,640
Chut and that woman
aren't meant to be together.

359
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,920
That's why their wedding was ruined.

360
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,400
What did Chut do to make
Chantorn leave him like that?

361
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,600
Do you think it's possible that

362
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
this is Anong's doing?

363
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,120
About what you asked me,

364
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,000
it turns out that it was
Sinthai Bank who bought the palace.

365
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,880
Chut's friend was declared bankrupt.

366
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,360
Boi! Come here!

367
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,520
Are you leaving?

368
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,639
Master!

369
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,880
Mr. Wichai. What brings you here?

370
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,080
I'm looking for Anong. Where is she?

371
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,800
She just got home.

372
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,520
Didn't you see her at the wedding?

373
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,440
Wait. Please wait. Don't go, Chantorn.

374
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,960
You couldn't do what you promised.

375
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,560
You can't marry her.

376
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,600
You already showed your true colors

377
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,760
even before you're married.

378
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
I'm sorry.

379
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm sorry I lied to you.

380
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,320
But that house will be Chantorn's one day.

381
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,320
We don't see how you'll be able

382
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,200
to pay off your debt.

383
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,880
I needed money for my business.

384
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,680
I wanted Chantorn to live comfortably.

385
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,920
You forced Chantorn into debt
without her consent.

386
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,800
I can't let my sister marry
a reckless guy like you.

387
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,600
-Let's go.
-Come on.

388
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
Chantorn.

389
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,200
Are you leaving me?

390
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,880
Why didn't you tell everyone the truth?

391
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,840
I'm sorry.

392
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,200
Don't listen to those
who don't mean us well.

393
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
Don't listen to him.

394
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,160
-Come on.
-Let go of her.

395
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,560
Someone tried to break us up.

396
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,880
You have to trust me.
Don't listen to others.

397
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,960
I got set up.

398
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,280
Stop lying.

399
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,160
You need to own up to what you did.

400
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,520
If you didn't do anything wrong,
you'd have nothing to hide.

401
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,680
You can't even give us the dowry.

402
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,960
Do you expect us
to just let Chantorn marry you?

403
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,400
I only agreed to this marriage
because I trusted Wichai.

404
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,040
You have nothing of value to offer anyone.

405
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,800
Go leech off some rich woman.

406
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
A man like you

407
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,880
isn't good enough for our sister.

408
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Let's go.

409
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,480
Come on.

410
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,880
The wedding is ruined.

411
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,120
Are you happy?

412
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,360
Is that why you're here?

413
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,680
If this is your doing,

414
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,480
then you're very cruel.

415
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,600
You can't stand to see them happy.

416
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,160
Why did you have to break them up?

417
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,040
You were too afraid
to steal Chantorn back.

418
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,760
So I did it for you.

419
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
When did I ask for your help?

420
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,960
You were heartbroken for months
because of that couple.

421
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Those two didn't seem to care
how much they had hurt us.

422
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,160
What I did is nothing

423
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,560
compared to what they did.

424
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,120
They deserve so much worse
for the pain they've caused.

425
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,920
You don't know how to love anyone.

426
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
The only one you love is yourself.

427
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,480
You hurt people for your own pleasure.

428
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,480
You're right.

429
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,880
I know I have no good qualities
for anyone to love me.

430
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,360
I already know that.

431
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,240
I know that you hate to lose.

432
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,280
I can see it from the way
you decorate your store.

433
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,520
Your life is like a product
in the display window.

434
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,800
You always want
to be the center of attention.

435
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,320
You felt humiliated
when Chut left you for someone else.

436
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,520
So you put up a cheery front
to fool everyone that you're happy.

437
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
You put on an act

438
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,880
like you're this perfect girl
who never loses to anyone.

439
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,520
You're weak.

440
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,840
Or you wouldn't feel
the need to hurt others.

441
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,400
If you were strong, you would admit defeat

442
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
instead of going around hurting people.

443
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,200
You're right.

444
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,800
I admit that I'm a sore loser.

445
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,480
But Chut was the one who lied to his wife.

446
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,320
Isn't he the one at fault?

447
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,720
Even if you're right,

448
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,320
it's still wrong for you
to try to ruin him like that.

449
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
You've crossed the line today.

450
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,040
How come you were never mad at Chantorn

451
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,480
when she betrayed you?

452
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,840
Yet you said these hurtful things to me
when I did something to upset you.

453
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
It's not that I don't get angry.

454
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,680
But when I'm angry,
I try not to take my anger out on others.

455
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,560
You should be happy they broke up.

456
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,520
Is it that hard to be selfish
for once in your life?

457
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,080
Should I thank Sompong as well

458
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,840
for taking over Chut's business?

459
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,520
Think about it.

460
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,320
Haven't you people gone too far
to get back at Chut?

461
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
What does Pong have to do with this?

462
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
You let him take over Chut's business.

463
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,640
Then you told Chantorn about it
to make her leave Chut.

464
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,480
If you think what you did is right,

465
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,640
ask Prasit what he thinks.

466
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
He's probably the only one
with a conscience in this house.

467
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920
What did Pong do?

468
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,680
Are you here to see Anong?

469
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,720
Are you starting to see the good in her?

470
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
Where did you get the contract?

471
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,360
What contract?

472
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,760
The mortgage contract
that you showed Chantorn's family.

473
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,600
Is it real?

474
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,520
I want to know who else knows about this.

475
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,240
Miss Anong brought her jewelry
for the bride to wear.

476
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,640
I fetched it back once I heard
that the wedding wasn't happening.

477
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,960
Maybe Anong isn't the one behind this.

478
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,800
CHUT WARATHABUT

479
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,840
They couldn't leave fast enough
once they knew that Chut was in debt.

480
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,920
You used the bribe money
to buy that palace?

481
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,680
It's no wonder why Chut was so mad at me.

482
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,680
LOVE AND MISS YOU ALWAYS

483
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,280
Did you talk to Chantorn's family today?

484
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,560
So what did you do today?

485
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,400
You want the person you love to be happy.

486
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,280
I want the same thing.

487
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,600
I want Chantorn to see the good in you.

488
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
Why?

489
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,320
You have a wound in your heart.

490
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,600
I want to help you heal.

491
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,040
I want Chantorn to see how good you are.

492
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,600
I want her to see…

493
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,600
I want her to see your good qualities
that made me fall in love with you.

494
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,760
I'm not asking you to love me back.

495
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,560
I want you to be
with whoever that makes you happy.

496
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,480
Just take a look at me.

497
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
Who could love someone like me?

498
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,240
You've been hurt for long enough.

499
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,320
I can't stand to see you get hurt anymore.

500
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,440
Have you been avoiding me

501
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,520
for the past two months?

502
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,880
I can't stand seeing you
love someone else.

503
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,360
I don't know what to do
to make you love an evil girl like me.

504
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,040
So you wrote down your feelings
on those paper flowers?

505
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,000
I meant to burn those flowers
like how you taught me.

506
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
I thought Chut was the one in your heart.

507
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,800
I've never felt that way about Chut.

508
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,600
You're a better man than him in every way.

509
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,000
If I'm so great, why do you want me
to be with Chantorn?

510
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,560
You're the one who told me

511
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,720
that love isn't about possession.

512
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,800
We should let the person we love
be with someone better.

513
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,520
And you also said that
you only think of me as a sister.

514
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,800
Since when did you do as you're told?

515
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,760
You shouldn't believe everything I say.

516
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,360
Ever since you offered
to help find a good man for me,

517
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,440
I still haven't found anyone
who is as good as you.

518
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,600
You're the best man for me,

519
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,400
yet you kept pushing me
to be with your brother.

520
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Chut was head over heels for you.

521
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,480
You were also mean to me.

522
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,360
You never once expressed
your interest in me.

523
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,880
I even wrote a guidebook
about myself for you

524
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,440
and you still didn't get it.

525
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,280
I didn't think I had a chance
with a perfect girl like you.

526
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,240
You counted yourself out

527
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,800
before you even gave us a chance.

528
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,400
You and Chut just seemed
like a good match.

529
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,920
You're too good for me.

530
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,280
You're always so humble
and you think so little of yourself

531
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,280
when you're perfect in every way.

532
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,520
What's up with you?

533
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,960
I like you just the way you are.

534
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Is his fever spiking again?

535
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,440
People who are book smart
are often clueless when it comes

536
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,480
to simple things in life.

537
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,640
You can read other people like a book,

538
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,720
yet you don't even know your own heart.

539
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,480
But I forgive you
since you just recovered from an illness.

540
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,680
I'm sorry.

541
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,880
I didn't realize I hurt your feelings.

542
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,880
You should stop doing things for others

543
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,600
and start doing things
that make you happy.

544
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,320
It makes me feel worthless
to see you suffer because of other people.

545
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,200
Then what should I do
to make it up to you?

546
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,920
You can be my man.

547
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Then I'll forgive you.

548
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,880
OUR LAST CHANCE TO LOVE

549
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,760
OUR LAST CHANCE TO LOVE

550
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,760
My brothers will freak out if they know

551
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,480
that we've made up.

552
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,040
Does Pong know about this?
Does he know about you and me?

553
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,840
Of course he does.

554
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,280
If you want to become a part of my family,

555
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,360
then you'll need my brothers' approval

556
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,320
before you can be with me.

557
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,280
Girls these days are so shameless.

558
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,200
You know how Anong is.

559
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,760
She's the raciest girl in town.

560
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,240
She always dresses so provocatively.

561
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,640
I heard that Chantorn is helping her
sell raunchy outfits at the store.

562
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,520
Chut broke up with Anong
and ended up marrying Chantorn.

563
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,200
Why couldn't I have a decent girl
as a daughter-in-law?

564
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,920
Wichai went to Chut's house.

565
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,960
I was waiting for him.
I thought he'd come to see me.

566
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,560
Did you two have plans?

567
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,320
Wichai didn't mention anything.

568
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,920
My gosh.

569
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,760
Did you tell Wichai that you love him?

570
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,160
So that's why.

571
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,280
Auntie, why can't I tell him I love him
if I have feelings for him?

572
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,320
Did he also say he loves you?

573
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,080
Well…

574
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,480
He also feels the same way about me.

575
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,920
Did he actually say it?

576
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,760
He said it with his actions.

577
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,680
His actions? What actions?

578
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,520
Since when did you do as you're told?

579
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,080
You shouldn't believe everything I say.

580
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,560
Well, you know, he acted like

581
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,600
he also loves me.

582
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,320
But I don't understand
why he's avoiding me.

583
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,320
You told him point-blank
that you love him.

584
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,520
You didn't leave him any choice
but to accept your love.

585
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,680
Wichai is a gentleman.

586
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,240
He wouldn't dare hurt your feelings.

587
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,480
You might've put him
in a difficult position

588
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,440
by throwing yourself at him
when he isn't interested in you.

589
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,720
I didn't throw myself at him.

590
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,840
I was just…

591
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,960
I was just trying
to give him encouragement.

592
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,920
Did you want to give him encouragement?

593
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,920
He's going to think
that you're flirting with him.

594
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,760
Who knows? He might even think
that you flirt with every man you meet.

595
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,680
I've never flirted with anyone

596
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,640
except Wichai.

597
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,680
You've gone to see him
no matter if it's night or day.

598
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,560
Don't you think that counts as flirting?

599
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,480
Auntie, I wasn't trying to flirt with him.

600
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,400
Really.

601
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,600
What you did is called flirting.

602
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,200
You're too forward-thinking
and you just live the way you want.

603
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,760
This is why people think you're easy.

604
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,600
Maen.

605
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,560
You're being too harsh.

606
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,560
Come sit down.

607
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,960
In Western cultures, people live together
before they get married.

608
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,400
You don't actually plan
on doing that, right?

609
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,040
There's a letter for you, ma'am.

610
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,720
Your aunts said to read it immediately.

611
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,400
I'm not a very good lover.

612
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,960
I'm not sure if you would want
to spend your exciting and joyful life

613
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,120
with such a boring person like me.

614
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,120
I don't expect you
to help me pay off my debt.

615
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,280
If you're too embarrassed
to accept this money,

616
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,760
then you don't really want
to spend your life with me.

617
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,040
Please don't leave me.

618
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,320
Wichai isn't home.

619
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,240
Master!

620
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,480
We have a problem.

621
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,760
The defendant committed a dangerous act.

622
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,160
I therefore sentence him
to three years of imprisonment.

623
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,560
I'm here to give you
my answer like I promised.

624
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,120
You and I can get married.

625
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,480
