1
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,840
I found a letter in one of the books.

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,440
<i>Soon didn't die of an illness.</i>

4
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,880
You made sure
Wichai didn't get her letters.

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,920
I want him to get his happy ending.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,760
<i>On the 11th of this month,</i>

7
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,040
you must come to my birthday party.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,400
<i>"The person who gives love</i>

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
is the one who must bear its weight."

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
This is what it means.

11
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
I got the ring.
I'm now one step closer to my dream.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
Try writing a guidebook about yourself.

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,160
It will let Anong know in a subtle way
that you're serious about her.

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,920
Why did you do this to me?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
You did this to get back at me, right?

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,800
I meant to teach him a lesson.

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,200
Once he hits rock bottom, he'll learn
that there's more to life than love.

18
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,960
<i>I plan to propose at the theater.</i>

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,600
Will you come with me?

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
<i>I can't imagine my future</i>

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,520
<i>without you in it.</i>

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,920
Get a hold of yourself.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,880
Let's get ready, guys.

24
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
So, where is Anong?

25
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,120
Anong, stop. Don't come over here.

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Too late for that now, Prasit.

27
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
Did you do all this for me?

28
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,160
Yes. It's my birthday present to you.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Thank you, Prasit. I really love it.

30
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,720
So you have somewhere private
to spend time with your guy.

31
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
I…

32
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,040
I know what present he's going to give me.

33
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,880
<i>He secretly tried to get the size</i>

34
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
of my ring finger.

35
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Anong! That's…

36
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
I'll bring him over here.

37
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,120
This is where I'll confess my love to him.

38
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Anong.

39
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
Can I talk to you for a minute?

40
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,520
I have something important
to talk to you about.

41
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,360
Well, let's hear it then.

42
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,640
What?

43
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,680
It's a private matter.

44
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,880
You can say it in front of Prasit.

45
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,960
You stood me up today.

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,280
Can you make time for me tomorrow?

47
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,360
I want to thank you
for working overtime yesterday.

48
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,360
You should get some rest today.
I'm giving you a day off.

49
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,960
Thank you.

50
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,880
So about your surprise…

51
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,720
I'll ask Anong to marry me.

52
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,400
Excuse me.

53
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,200
You're a year older.

54
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,000
I wish you happiness

55
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,360
and I hope you make
the most of your adult life.

56
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
- Thank you, Auntie.
- I love you.

57
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,800
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Thank you.

58
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,240
Anong.

59
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,040
Happy birthday.

60
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
This is my present to you.

61
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Put down any number you want.

62
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
Goodness.

63
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,760
- This is a real check.
- Of course.

64
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,320
Thank you.

65
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
My turn now.

66
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,600
This is all I can give you.

67
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
You already have a car.

68
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,160
So I bought you a yacht.
The real one will be here soon.

69
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,840
My gosh.

70
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,840
My goodness! Thank you so much!

71
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
You're welcome.

72
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm getting a yacht.

73
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
- It's gorgeous, Anong.
- There's my name on it.

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
What about you, Pong?
What did you get your sister?

75
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,640
You'll all see it at the party.

76
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
I know what it is.

77
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,600
You must've invited
a special guest to the party.

78
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,840
Maybe I'll get a sister-in-law
as my present.

79
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
- Well, well. Pong.
- Pong.

80
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,320
I'm so happy
to be having two in-laws soon.

81
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,280
This is huge.

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,720
Who is it, Pong?

83
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,080
You'll all get to meet this person
at the party.

84
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,000
I'd like to ask you all a favor.

85
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Once I introduce you to my guy,

86
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,160
please be nice to him.

87
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,200
Do not try to chase him away.

88
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,720
Because if I lose this guy,
I won't have anyone left.

89
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
- Yes, dear.
- Okay.

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,360
Prepare to say goodbye to your angel
who's going to leave you.

91
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,480
Why won't you leave me alone?

92
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,480
You should be proud
that Wichai is a respectable judge.

93
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,120
A judge isn't a wealthy profession.

94
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
That won't get people's respect.

95
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,440
Yet you're unhappy
that I'm dating a rich girl.

96
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,400
I want you to marry a girl
from a noble family.

97
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,440
Someone with money and honor

98
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
and the power to protect you.

99
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
And she'll use her power
to keep me in line.

100
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,280
The world is changing.

101
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,600
No one is superior to anyone.

102
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,280
Even if you threaten
to send me to the moon,

103
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,720
you can't change how I feel
about the general's daughter.

104
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,840
Choy.

105
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
You don't have to work anymore.

106
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,520
You should have fun tonight.

107
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,920
Is there any man you'd like
to dance with? I'll arrange it for you.

108
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,280
Well, there's one man.

109
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
Really? Which one?

110
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,040
That one.

111
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Hey. That man…

112
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,720
See you.

113
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,960
We finally meet again.

114
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,920
Happy birthday.

115
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
How did you get here?

116
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
- I heard that--
- So you two found each other.

117
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,200
Anong, this is my birthday present to you.

118
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
This is your present to me?

119
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
Yes.

120
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,440
I've looked high and low
until I found your dream guy.

121
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,680
There's nothing I can't do for my sister.

122
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Thank you.

123
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,360
You're still as pretty as ever.

124
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,200
And you're still a sweet talker.

125
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,480
You've charmed me once again.

126
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,720
I still remember
how crazy I was about you.

127
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,280
It was probably because
you were seasick on that ship.

128
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
Gosh.

129
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,360
I was so helpless on that ship.

130
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,720
I was seasick all the time. It felt like…

131
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,640
<i>I was half-dreaming.</i>

132
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,680
<i>I was lucky you were there to help me.</i>

133
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,240
Better to get dizzy from drinking
than from seasickness.

134
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,560
Excuse me.

135
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Are you trying to get me drunk?

136
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Trust me. It saves me every time.

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,920
If I could choose, I would want
to work as a bartender here.

138
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,880
I wouldn't mind

139
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
spending years living like this.

140
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,480
Is this what it's like

141
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
to have a crush on someone?

142
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,160
If it's a crush,
you can't let the other person know

143
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,600
or you might end up losing them.

144
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,640
Then I'll keep my feelings to myself.

145
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,280
I want things to stay like this.

146
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,840
Cheers.

147
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,960
<i>That was the first time</i>

148
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,160
that I dared to get drunk
in front of a stranger.

149
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
You made me feel safe.

150
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,040
I don't think we ever hung out
when we were sober.

151
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,480
I was either drunk or seasick
when I was with you.

152
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
I think you called me your dream guy

153
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,480
only because you were delirious.

154
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,880
That's not true.

155
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,520
I really did have a crush on you.

156
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,680
I nicknamed you "Secret Admirer."

157
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,400
I was young then, so it was fun for me

158
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
to be secretly in love with someone

159
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,600
without wanting anything in return.

160
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,560
It's like what you said.

161
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Hidden love is the truest form of love.

162
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,720
Because you love
without expecting anything in return.

163
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,720
I'm actually in love with someone.

164
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,080
He makes me feel
like I'm a teenager again.

165
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,240
But I don't want
to keep my feelings to myself.

166
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,680
I want him to love me back.

167
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,600
What man would dare reject you?

168
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,120
You did.

169
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,320
I'm not good enough for you.

170
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,480
That's not true.

171
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,800
Hello.

172
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,400
Thank you very much. Please head inside.

173
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,440
Hey, Mr. Wichai. Welcome.

174
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,440
Prasit is asking about you.

175
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
I see.

176
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Wichai.

177
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
Hey.

178
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,160
Why are you so late?
Let's go be with Anong.

179
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
Hey, wait.

180
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,800
Actually,

181
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm here with Chantorn.

182
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,200
Never mind that.
You should go say hi to Anong.

183
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
- Come on. Hurry.
- Wait.

184
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
Another third wheel.

185
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,960
Hey, Wichai.

186
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
Sorry! I'm so sorry!

187
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
Chut.

188
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,600
Damn.

189
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,840
You look like a mess.
Go get it cleaned up.

190
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,040
Keep this safe for me.

191
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,720
It's my present to Anong.

192
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,640
I'll propose to her tonight.

193
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,960
The coast is clear.

194
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Chut.

195
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,880
What happened to Mom's ring?

196
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,360
I sold it and used the money
to buy this one.

197
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,080
You said you'd use that money
to build a house.

198
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,200
I spent it all on this ring.

199
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,440
We won't be getting married soon.

200
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,800
Also, Anong doesn't want a big house.

201
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,440
She already has such a luxurious house.

202
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
Anong likes to have
something she can show off.

203
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,160
She can wear this ring wherever she goes
without feeling embarrassed.

204
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,880
Are you sure that's how Anong feels?

205
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,720
I know Anong
better than she knows herself.

206
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,160
You just wait for the good news.

207
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,760
We have a new designer
working for us at the store.

208
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,960
He makes sure
to use the softest fabric possible.

209
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,640
I believe our customers
will love his designs.

210
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Excuse me. Anong.

211
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,080
What are you still doing here?

212
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,880
Wichai is here
with a special present for you.

213
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
Okay.

214
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,800
What?

215
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,320
Let's go find him.

216
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,760
Anong.

217
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,320
Happy birthday.

218
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,920
Thank you.

219
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,960
Do you see that man?

220
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,000
That's Prapat, Anong's dream guy.

221
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,880
So you've found him.

222
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,680
He's looking to start
a business in Bangkok

223
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,560
and he wants to buy the house
that our bank foreclosed on

224
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,200
since Anong likes it.

225
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,000
Maybe he plans
to live there with her one day.

226
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,680
Isn't he a perfect match for her?

227
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,840
He's the one who taught her
how to mix drinks.

228
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Anong is crazy about him

229
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,440
since he's such a cool guy.

230
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
I heard that Wichai is here.

231
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,720
I haven't got a chance to say hi to him.

232
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,680
A guy like Wichai probably
won't ask me to dance with him.

233
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,720
So I…

234
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,920
I'm planning to--

235
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,680
Will you marry me?

236
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
What did you say?

237
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
I have to move to Korat for my job

238
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,320
and I know you won't move there with me.

239
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
So let's get engaged first.

240
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,040
Why should we be engaged?

241
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,240
I want you to wait for me until I'm back.

242
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,960
Will you wait for me?

243
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,160
Gosh, Chut.

244
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,960
I can't live without you.

245
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,280
If you feel the same way,
please say you'll marry me.

246
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,760
This is my promise

247
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
that I'll stay faithful to you.

248
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,640
You'll be the only woman for me.

249
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,200
Here. I made you a guidebook about me.

250
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,640
If you read it and you're okay with it,

251
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,080
let's become life partners.

252
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,920
My gosh.

253
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,920
Wichai.

254
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Hey.

255
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,080
Come with me. Anong is waiting for you.

256
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,360
- But--
- Come on.

257
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,600
My gosh. I'm so sorry.

258
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
It's my birthday present to Anong.

259
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Wait. What about the box I saw?

260
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
What box?

261
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,160
Chut.

262
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,960
Thank you for the good feelings
you have for me.

263
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,680
But…

264
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,680
But things between us
are good the way they are.

265
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,360
What do you mean?

266
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,120
We are friends.

267
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
That will never change.

268
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,480
Even if we are apart,

269
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,880
I will still be your friend.

270
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
So you won't wait for me?

271
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,560
I've found someone that I truly love.

272
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,000
It made me realize that

273
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,400
I can only think of you as a friend.

274
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,920
But I must thank you

275
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
for making me realize that

276
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,400
this person is the one
I've been waiting for.

277
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,560
Are you in love with someone else?

278
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
But it won't be possible

279
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,360
for me to be with this guy
if you're not okay with it.

280
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,360
Can there be anyone
who loves you more than I do?

281
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,320
I don't know how much
this guy will love me.

282
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,040
He may not love me as much as I love him.

283
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
All I ask

284
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,960
is that he accepts my love
and doesn't turn me away.

285
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,200
I don't mind being the one
who initiates the relationship.

286
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Chut.

287
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,280
You don't have to be happy for me.

288
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,880
I just want you to understand.

289
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
I can't choose who I fall in love with.

290
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,920
I didn't want to hurt anyone

291
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,000
in order for me to find happiness.

292
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,040
What?

293
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,480
- Choy.
- Yes?

294
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,360
I think I just saw Chantorn here.

295
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,160
That's right.
Chantorn is here with Wichai.

296
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,840
Have you seen Wichai?
I haven't seen him yet.

297
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,080
He's probably with Chantorn.
They're here together.

298
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,440
He's been courting her.
She's his date for tonight.

299
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,920
Let's keep our fingers crossed
that Wichai will finally find love.

300
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,120
What…

301
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,520
What do you mean?

302
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,960
Wichai and Chantorn?

303
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,640
Wichai has been visiting
the department store

304
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,040
in order to see her.

305
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,520
Haven't you noticed?

306
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,960
I didn't notice anything.

307
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,760
Wichai is good at hiding his feelings.

308
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,120
He doesn't make it obvious
when he likes someone.

309
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,480
He's not an ardent lover.

310
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,520
He's very subtle
in the way he shows his love.

311
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
Please excuse me.

312
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,000
Ms. Anong, please come with me.

313
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
Is Anong making her special drink?

314
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,520
So whoever gets this drink
will be our brother-in-law.

315
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,800
Hey.

316
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,600
I hope it's this guy.

317
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
Yes.

318
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,760
If he's the one she chooses,
then that means I win.

319
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Wait.

320
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,040
Is this the guy you found for Anong?

321
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,480
I made this special drink

322
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,080
for someone I love.

323
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
A strong drink like this

324
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,600
probably isn't for a lightweight like you.

325
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,520
You like easy and simple things

326
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,680
that don't require any effort to get.

327
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,520
That's why your life is so bland.

328
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Since this person
doesn't appreciate my love for him,

329
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,920
from now on,

330
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll just focus on loving myself more.

331
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,040
Anong, wait.

332
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,200
All right. Here's what's up next.

333
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm going to make a special drink
for everyone tonight.

334
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,120
Wait.

335
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,920
Here's your birthday present.

336
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,680
I hope you like it.

337
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
<i>Wichai doesn't like women who wear makeup.</i>

338
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,000
He often calls women
who wear thick makeup catalog models.

339
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,160
He especially doesn't like it

340
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
when women paint their nails.

341
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,720
Gosh.

342
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,040
You don't like women who wear makeup,

343
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,120
but you got me makeup to wear
so I could look like a catalog model.

344
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,960
I don't know

345
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,440
if I should be happy or sad
that I'm everything you don't like.

346
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,080
I think you're drunk.

347
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm sorry if you don't like what I said.

348
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,320
But I know this is from my store.

349
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,120
I even know how much it costs.

350
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,400
I bet that

351
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,960
you didn't even pick this yourself.

352
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,520
Chantorn picked it for you, right?

353
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,280
I just don't know what color you'll like.

354
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,480
To me, all colors look the same.

355
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
That guidebook.

356
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,480
You told Chut to write it, didn't you?

357
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
I'd rather read a guidebook about you.

358
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,200
I want to know if it will say

359
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,560
that you're color-blind.

360
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,040
Will it say that you're the kind of person

361
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,040
who wants it easy

362
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,240
and just grabs what's close at hand?

363
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,400
You're nice and kind to everyone

364
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,520
and you also have bad taste.

365
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,320
If I had known this,

366
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,920
I wouldn't have gotten so invested.

367
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,120
What's wrong?

368
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,680
- Did you fight with Chut?
- Stop acting like you care.

369
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
You don't really care about me.

370
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,040
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

371
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,159
It's bad to drink on an empty stomach.

372
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
It's not just an empty stomach.

373
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,320
My heart also feels empty.

374
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,280
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?

375
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,240
It's over.

376
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Are you okay?

377
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm going home.

378
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,480
Are you sure you can manage?

379
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Why don't you wait for your brother?

380
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,560
Chut.

381
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,760
If this happened yesterday,

382
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,000
I would be so happy
to be here in your arms.

383
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,360
But what's the point

384
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,560
of getting to be this close to you

385
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,840
when this is as far as I'll ever get?

386
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,800
Let's go.

387
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
Get up slowly.

388
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,080
Stop acting like a gentleman.

389
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,080
You're actually really mean.

390
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,920
Hey.

391
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,240
If it were someone else,

392
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,240
they could take advantage of you.

393
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,200
I know you're not interested.

394
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
Stop rubbing it in.

395
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,440
I can tell from the way you look at me.

396
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
Let's head back.

397
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,960
Someone might get
the wrong idea if they see us.

398
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,720
They all got the right idea.

399
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm the one who got it all wrong.

400
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,920
If you fought with Chut,
you shouldn't take it out on me like this.

401
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,960
Come on. Get up.

402
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,680
Anong.

403
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Let's go.

404
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,920
Hey!

405
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Prasit.

406
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,800
Stop it! Stop!

407
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,400
Get your hands off of her.
Stay away from her.

408
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,560
Anong, are you hurt anywhere?
Come on. Get up.

409
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,200
Anong. My gosh. Be careful, Anong.

410
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
You stay away from her.

411
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,200
Leave her alone from now on, you traitor.

412
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,640
Come on, Anong. Watch your step.

413
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,320
Walk slowly.

414
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,560
Come on.

415
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Chut. Where are you going?

416
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,000
Where are you going?

417
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,800
You're drunk. Please get out of the car.

418
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,000
Chut.

419
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,120
Please get out of the car.

420
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,280
This is dangerous, Chut.

421
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,520
Chut.

422
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,040
Chut, where are you going?

423
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,440
Chut!

424
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,400
Watch your step, Anong.
We're almost there.

425
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,680
Come on.

426
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,520
Anong, wait! Anong!

427
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,640
We're almost there, Anong.
Come on. Get up.

428
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,160
Why did everything
turn out like this, Prasit?

429
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
Why did he choose Chantorn?

430
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,960
Why can't it be me?

431
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,800
Did I do something wrong?

432
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,800
Anong.

433
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,640
It's Wichai who's too blind
to see how great you are.

434
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,320
He's been courting her for a long time.

435
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,800
I'm the one who didn't see it.

436
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Isn't it pathetic?

437
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,560
I helped him choose the perfume
he gave to her.

438
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,120
I didn't realize
he was buying it for his lover.

439
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,920
Not only did I not see it,

440
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,920
but I also made a fool of myself
by coming on to him.

441
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,320
He didn't play along with me
out of respect for his woman.

442
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,600
He must think I'm a shameless woman

443
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,240
who throws herself
at a man who doesn't want her.

444
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,280
I've never felt
so worthless before in my life.

445
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,080
Anong.

446
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,000
It's okay, Anong.

447
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,640
I was a fool for picking this guy for you.

448
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,760
I made a mistake.

449
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,160
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,800
Please don't cry.

451
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,040
I'm a fool, Prasit.

452
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,480
No, you're not.

453
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,040
Please don't say that, Anong.
This is all my fault.

454
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,880
What's going on there?

455
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,360
Chut.

456
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,480
- I told you it's dangerous.
- What?

457
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,880
Go ahead and drive.

458
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,320
Stop right there! Stop!

459
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,040
Hey! Stop!

460
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,080
Hey! Stop right there!

461
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
What happened?

462
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,760
Someone committed a hit-and-run.

463
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,480
Did the man drive off alone
or was someone with him?

464
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,680
Please be careful.

465
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
Just stop if you can't see the way.

466
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,960
We'll get lost.

467
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
This is dangerous.

468
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,200
I don't care if I die.
There's no point in living anyway.

469
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,200
- Damn it! Stop!
- My gosh!

470
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,120
There's a tree! Look out!

471
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,360
Don't hit it! Gosh!

472
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,080
It's okay, Anong.

473
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,440
- Anong.
- Anong.

474
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,600
- Anong.
- Anong.

475
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,920
Don't cry.

476
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,720
Who does Wichai think he is
to break your heart like this?

477
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,800
I thought Chut was bad.

478
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,320
But his brother is an even bigger jerk.

479
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,160
It's okay, Anong.

480
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,280
That man has no good qualities.

481
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
How could you love him?

482
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Sawaeng, stop it.

483
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,920
Come here.

484
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's okay, Anong.

485
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,360
Listen.

486
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,360
Anong.

487
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,120
I know that we can't choose
who we fall in love with.

488
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,400
It's the fault of those
who encouraged you.

489
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,840
You should know better

490
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
than to listen to this numbskull.

491
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,080
You wanted to play Cupid

492
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,080
when you're just a stupid dork.

493
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,680
It's okay.

494
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,960
In my eyes,

495
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,240
Wichai is unlike any man I've met.

496
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,920
Before I knew it,
I loved him with all my heart.

497
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,080
Oh, dear.

498
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,640
What am I supposed to do now?

499
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,800
It's all right.

500
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,560
You turned Chut down.

501
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,080
So an upright man like Wichai
wouldn't dare get involved with you.

502
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
This whole situation is complicated.

503
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,600
You must accept that
this love is impossible from the start.

504
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,560
Hey.

505
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,160
It's okay.

506
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,600
Please don't cry.

507
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,440
Hey. Stop it.

508
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,560
It's okay, Anong.

509
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,440
GUIDEBOOK ABOUT CHUT

510
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,920
GUIDEBOOK ABOUT CHUT

511
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,520
<i>As you know, I'm the youngest
among my siblings.</i>

512
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,400
<i>You could say I'm a mama's boy.</i>

513
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,760
<i>My family,</i>

514
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,120
<i>they treat me like I'm a prince.</i>

515
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,320
That hurts!

516
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,360
Are you sure you can fix it?

517
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,800
Just give me the light.

518
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,720
<i>If you expect me to fix something for you,</i>

519
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,600
<i>I can never do it.</i>

520
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,960
My gosh! Damn it!

521
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,880
I can't get this damn thing fixed!

522
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,280
No wonder Anong doesn't want me!

523
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,240
I'm so weak.
I'll never be able to protect anyone.

524
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,080
What kind of soldier am I?

525
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,080
I can't even manage to change a tire.

526
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,280
You're still alive.

527
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,880
You should consider yourself lucky.

528
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,440
It means that
God still wants you to keep going.

529
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,120
Don't give up yet.

530
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,560
How can I not give up?

531
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,120
I gave her everything I had
and she still turned me down.

532
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,760
Even if I died,

533
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,080
she wouldn't…

534
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,680
She probably wouldn't even care.

535
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,640
Hey.

536
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,080
Did you really throw it away?

537
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,920
I gave up everything

538
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,760
so that Anong and I could be together.

539
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,160
But she…

540
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,160
She didn't want a future with me.

541
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,240
I got transferred out of Bangkok
and I have nothing left.

542
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,840
I fought for her as hard as I could
and it was for nothing.

543
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,200
<i>But I'd like you to try</i>

544
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,720
<i>and think of me as a puppy.</i>

545
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,920
<i>I'd like to be held</i>

546
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,640
<i>and pet by its owner.</i>

547
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,920
<i>It may sound needy,
but I'll always be loyal to you.</i>

548
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,240
<i>If anyone gives me love,</i>

549
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,560
<i>I'll forever be faithful to that person.</i>

550
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,120
IT WILL PASS

551
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,960
<i>I hate being alone.</i>

552
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,920
I'm always out and about.

553
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,920
If I have to move to the countryside,

554
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,440
I'll probably get lonely.

555
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,400
I can't imagine

556
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,600
how I'll survive
living in a remote place like that.

557
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,960
I'm the complete opposite.

558
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,680
I'm used to being alone.

559
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,120
Everyone says that

560
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,680
a girl like me will end up

561
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,720
as someone's mistress just like my mother.

562
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,800
Every time someone comes into my life,

563
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,760
I get so paranoid

564
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,240
that they may be insincere with me.

565
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,920
In the end,

566
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,520
I ended up
having never truly loved someone.

567
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,520
Especially if it's someone I like,

568
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,920
I get even more scared

569
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,160
that I'll be heartbroken.

570
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,920
I was on my way to work
and decided to drop by.

571
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,960
Chut left the party last night
and didn't come home.

572
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,840
I'm hoping he may be
around here somewhere.

573
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,960
Are you sure
you're not here to see Chantorn?

574
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,720
They left together.

575
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,120
You're welcome to stay
and wait for them if you're worried.

576
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,280
I don't know how I can help you.

577
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,600
What happened yesterday?

578
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,840
Did Chut do something to upset you?

579
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,360
It wasn't Chut.

580
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,720
Do you want to talk about it?

581
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,920
It was all because of you.

582
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,480
Can you explain?

583
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,560
Wait.

584
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Wait.

585
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,960
Does it hurt?

586
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,440
I'm not in tears.

587
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,760
So you didn't hurt me
as badly as I hurt you.

588
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,160
Your wound will heal.

589
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,200
As for my wound,

590
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,040
I don't know if it will ever heal.

591
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,720
It will forever leave a scar.

592
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
<i>Just say you're jealous.</i>

593
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,440
<i>You're afraid I'll steal your girl, right?</i>

594
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,240
Anong's family is against you
because of how immature you are.

595
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,160
No wonder a perfect girl like Anong
doesn't want to be with you.

596
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,520
What's going on?

597
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,440
Why are they fighting about girls?

598
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Did you lend me your car

599
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,160
because you were embarrassed
that I didn't have one?

600
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,560
<i>It would be wrong</i>

601
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,120
<i>if you tried to push Anong
to be with your guy</i>

602
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,080
<i>only to get rid of me and Chut.</i>

603
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,520
<i>Anong is too good
to be sharing a guy with anyone,</i>

604
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,280
especially with her own brother.

605
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,280
I thought I was important to him

606
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,080
<i>when I was actually just an outsider.</i>

607
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,840
<i>I'll move on if he doesn't want me.</i>

608
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,240
You should come play again.
I love listening to you play.

609
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,360
This is the first time I have a reason
to want to come home early.

610
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,160
Mom is asking Sa-Ang to marry you

611
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,920
so you can be married next month.

612
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,800
I don't know if it's a coincidence,

613
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,320
<i>but Chantorn just quit her job as well.</i>

614
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,720
