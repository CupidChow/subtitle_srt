00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,560
<i>Everyone knows this isn't the first time
Wichai has accepted a bribe.</i>

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,200
<i>That's how his family
could afford to send his brother</i>

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,000
to go study abroad.

5
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,040
<i>Mom needs to realize that
this won't do anyone any good,</i>

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
<i>especially Wichai.</i>

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,040
What is this? How did you get this?

8
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Don't let him get involved
with the general's case.

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,680
Wichai! Did you go
pick Nid up from school?

10
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,960
<i>Don't think you can treat people
like dirt just because you're a noble.</i>

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,640
What makes you think
you can get me to do as you say?

12
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,120
I didn't know how to fix what happened.

13
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,880
I swear on my life
that I never wanted that money.

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
<i>You asked the deceased to come see you.</i>

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
<i>Were there issues between you two?</i>

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm the one who should be
demanding for justice.

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,560
You'll have an easier time
once you're dismissed from service.

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,560
I wouldn't have become a judge
if I was afraid of hardship.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
Was he killed because
he betrayed Lady Mayom?

20
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,600
MURDER VICTIM FOUND DEAD IN A RIVER

21
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
He probably got silenced.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
That man was sent to terrorize you.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
But if we were to tell the police that,

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,960
then we would have
to tell them about the bribery.

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,720
Mom.

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Is it true that Lady Mayom owes you money?

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
She'd been borrowing money from me.

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,960
I lent her my ruby necklace,
but I never thought that

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
it'd come back to bite me.

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,320
If what I did causes you
to be investigated for misconduct,

31
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,480
I'll take the blame for everything.

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
I am a judicial officer.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,640
I still believe that
the law will give us justice.

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,480
Please don't worry.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm ready to prove
my innocence to everyone.

36
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,320
Wichai.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,320
I'm so sorry.

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,080
We'd like to know how you
and this ex-convict knew each other.

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
I met him nine years ago

40
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,440
when I was working in Lampang.

41
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,320
He should've asked me to be a witness.

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
Wichai had nothing
to do with the murder victim.

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
I'm the one who's responsible.

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,399
Wichai wouldn't want
to get you into trouble.

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,200
But we're the ones who got terrorized.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
Wichai isn't fighting
to protect himself right now.

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,160
He's trying to keep
his family out of this matter.

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
But I have nothing to lose.

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
Why would he worry for me?

50
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,080
If it was found that the banknotes
at the scene came from Sinthai Bank,

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,920
he could be suspected of corruption.

52
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,280
What's the worst that could happen?

53
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,160
Wichai might get dismissed
from government service

54
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,520
if it turns out that
he engaged in corruption.

55
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
If he's suspected of corruption,

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
people will assume he's guilty.

57
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Wichai's been through this before.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,400
He's probably used to it.

59
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,600
Time will tell that he's innocent.

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,240
Just like how his dad was granted
compensation after he died.

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,800
So Wichai has to die first
before he can be acquitted of the charges?

62
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,320
Then what would be the point
of the justice system?

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,840
As a judge, you're required
to conduct yourself

64
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,040
in an honorable manner
with a high degree of integrity

65
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,200
even more so than any other civil servant.

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,760
Upon considering the evidence
presented in the initial trial,

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,120
we found nothing that indicates that
you've committed any criminal offense.

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,680
What happened was
rather a political slander.

69
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,640
So we won't be taking
any disciplinary action against you.

70
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,760
Since your action has not caused
any damage to the government,

71
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,720
you may continue to serve
as a judicial officer of the court.

72
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,040
PRA ATTHAKADEE WICHAI

73
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Here's the summons against the creditor
who's been sued by a street vendor.

74
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,520
COURT SUMMONS

75
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,960
<i>May you remain firm
and steadfast in your principles.</i>

76
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,160
<i>We believe that we have selected
the most capable people</i>

77
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
<i>to serve our nation.</i>

78
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,800
<i>And it is our duty
to protect our judicial officers</i>

79
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,800
<i>so that they can do their duty
without being harassed or intimidated.</i>

80
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,200
<i>May you continue to do your duty
with integrity.</i>

81
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,640
Choy. Listen.

82
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Is Madam really not going
to accept the award?

83
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,960
She's adamant about it.

84
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,120
She's afraid it might cause
our family trouble later.

85
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,520
That's true. It wouldn't be worth it
if the matter were to affect Wichai.

86
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,520
Maybe Mom knows deep down
that she doesn't deserve this award.

87
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,520
She knows she only got the award
because of her connections.

88
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,720
I want to thank you.

89
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,240
Thank me for what?

90
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,640
In the past, I only focused on my work.

91
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,240
I never realized how much trouble
I caused those around me.

92
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Everyone says I'm selfless.

93
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,520
But what happened made me realize

94
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,280
how much my family
had to suffer because of me.

95
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
That's not true.

96
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,320
You promised me

97
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,440
you wouldn't keep secrets from me.

98
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,160
So why didn't you tell me
you were threatened?

99
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,840
You love your mom.

100
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
I didn't want you two
to fight because of this.

101
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,600
And deep down,

102
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,200
I also wanted to prove to your mom

103
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,400
that I'm good enough for her son.

104
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,680
You know.

105
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,800
Without you,

106
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,760
I would've remained an unfortunate man

107
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,160
who never knew what love was.

108
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
Thank you

109
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,760
for showing me that

110
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,480
a man like me can also find love.

111
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,080
Lady Mayom doesn't have that much
influence over the association anymore.

112
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
When you sent her
to talk to me about the award,

113
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,360
I thought you were trying
to make me a scapegoat.

114
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,520
So I worked out a plan

115
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,640
and got you to win the award instead.

116
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
I spent a long time

117
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,960
thinking what I could do
to make your plan blow up in your face.

118
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,720
<i>Then I saw Nid's essay
that she was writing for school.</i>

119
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
Hey.

120
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
Nid.

121
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
What are you writing?

122
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,240
It's my homework.
I have to write an essay about my mom.

123
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,080
I saw the announcement in the paper
about the Outstanding Woman contest.

124
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,680
So I submitted Nid's essay
to the association.

125
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,920
I tried to get you to win the award

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,280
knowing it'd make you a nervous wreck

127
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,720
after you tried to get the association
to give the award to me.

128
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,800
You're saying
I won this award because of Nid?

129
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,480
The association sent me a letter
before they announced the award winner.

130
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,960
Nid's essay was attached to the letter.

131
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,240
Maybe the association gave you the award
because of what Nid wrote about you.

132
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,160
I don't deserve to win that award

133
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,840
since I'm a lousy mom.

134
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,720
You're not lousy in Nid's eyes.

135
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
You should read the essay

136
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,080
that she wrote.

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,440
<i>"My mom</i>

138
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
<i>is the most outstanding woman.</i>

139
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,840
She cooks for everyone in the house.

140
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,960
But she always lets others eat
before she does.

141
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,600
She told me that

142
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,880
when she was a kid,

143
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,120
that's also what my grandma did.

144
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,080
My grandma has many children.

145
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,800
She would wait until her kids were full

146
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
before she started eating.

147
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,000
My mom has to work a lot.

148
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,600
My grandma also doesn't have
a husband to take care of her.

149
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,920
She had to work to earn money

150
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
to support the whole family.

151
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,040
My mom got married young
to help lessen my grandma's burden.

152
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,920
My mom didn't get to go to school.

153
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,360
But she said she became
wiser and more mature

154
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
from raising me.

155
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,560
<i>So did my grandma.</i>

156
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,280
<i>Both of them try to raise their kids</i>

157
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,320
<i>to have a better life than they did.</i>

158
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,880
<i>I don't understand my mom and my grandma.</i>

159
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,080
<i>I don't understand why
they're embarrassed by what they're doing.</i>

160
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,520
<i>I want to be a great cook.</i>

161
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,440
<i>I want to be good at doing laundry.</i>

162
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,320
<i>I want to earn lots of money
like my mom and my grandma.</i>

163
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,320
<i>I won't ask others for money.</i>

164
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
I'll provide for my mom and my grandma.

165
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,000
I want to become like them when I grow up.

166
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,160
I am proud to be born a woman."

167
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,720
Choy does a better job
at raising her kid than me.

168
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,280
Do you see now

169
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
why they gave you that award?

170
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,000
Kids always tell the truth.

171
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,200
That's what Nid really thinks.

172
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,080
Please go accept the award.
I'll take you myself.

173
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
I already got my award.

174
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
This is enough for me.

175
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,120
Deep down,

176
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
do you believe that no one
can love Wichai as much as you do?

177
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,080
Is that why you gave me such a hard time?

178
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,000
I know now

179
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,800
that I'm not good enough for anyone.

180
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,640
You can protect Wichai better than I can.

181
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,560
We both can love the same man
without having to compete with each other.

182
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm not looking to steal Wichai from you.

183
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,480
I want him to have lots of people
in his life who love him.

184
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,840
Nid was right.

185
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,640
You're the most outstanding woman.

186
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,400
You don't need to hide that from me.

187
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,360
I know you're taking classes.

188
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm not just taking classes.

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,200
I already got a job.

190
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm working for a newly released magazine.

191
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,320
I, CHOY UDOMWORRAKAN,

192
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,360
WOULD LIKE TO HAND IN MY RESIGNATION

193
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,040
Why are you quitting?

194
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm afraid you'll think
that I'm neglecting my kid.

195
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I just want to show my child that

196
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,119
women can be just as capable as men.

197
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,079
It's my fault

198
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,160
for making you feel insignificant.

199
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,920
I raised you the way I was raised.

200
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
So you don't see your worth.

201
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
Choy.

202
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
You're a capable woman.

203
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
You're more capable than me.

204
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,760
I keep depending on my sons
after I lost my husband.

205
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,920
But you're not like me.

206
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,160
You don't need anyone to provide for you.

207
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,760
That's something I couldn't do.

208
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,920
But you've proven to me that

209
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,880
it can be done.

210
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,640
If there were only people like me

211
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
ten years from now,

212
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,120
our world would be nowhere.

213
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,760
You helped me raise Chut
when he was young.

214
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,000
So I'll help you look after your kid.

215
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,600
Raising a child by yourself is hard.

216
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,800
Go and live your life.

217
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,720
So you're not stuck in a rut like me.

218
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,760
- Hurry up, would you?
- I'm doing it.

219
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,880
Put the box over here.
We still need to sort through the stuff.

220
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,360
Use your brain when you work.
Don't just use your muscles.

221
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm using my heart.

222
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
It's all thanks to you, Anong.
Our family is so different now.

223
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,040
That's right.
Chuen has gotten a lot kinder.

224
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,960
She even sent me vitamins at home.

225
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,520
She's a single mom
who raised four kids by herself.

226
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,480
None of us could do that.

227
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
People don't value momhood,
so Mom didn't value herself.

228
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,480
And she used her kids' achievements
as validations for her success.

229
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,360
If women stop putting each other down,

230
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,720
I think a lot of us can become
even more successful than men.

231
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,760
I agree.

232
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,920
- This is a nice color.
- Right?

233
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,320
We probably won't get
to see it in our lifetime,

234
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,600
but some things might change
in Nid's generation.

235
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Right.

236
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,240
- Put in lots.
- Lots of it?

237
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,280
- Is this enough?
- One more scoop.

238
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
- I'll put this much in.
- That's good. There you go.

239
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,080
- You're really good at this.
- Really?

240
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,760
That's it. Good job.

241
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,920
- You never know.
- Is this pretty?

242
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,160
Even Madam Chuen could change.

243
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,440
So anything is possible.

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
Just stay still.
Look at you. You're all dirty.

245
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,880
Let me wash off the dirt for you.

246
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,480
Now rub your hands together.

247
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,800
You got water in my face.

248
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,680
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

249
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
It's like I got another mom.

250
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,320
Those two are great together.
Mom has someone to fuss over.

251
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,560
It's no wonder
she hasn't bothered us much lately.

252
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,640
This is such a beautiful sight to behold.

253
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
It's a rare sight.

254
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,480
- Let me take your picture too.
- Really?

255
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,960
Come on.

256
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,680
One, two, three.

257
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,360
Prasit.

258
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,960
I…

259
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,360
- I told Wichai I'd meet him at the party.
- Yes?

260
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,440
But I had too much to drink
while I was waiting for him.

261
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,920
I see. So you came here to hide from him?

262
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,640
Yes.

263
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,920
I can't let Wichai find out

264
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,320
that I got drunk while I wasn't with him.

265
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
- Anong.
- Shush.

266
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,440
But you stink of alcohol.

267
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
Really?

268
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,600
I'll have to stay the night here.

269
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,760
Prasit. If Wichai calls,

270
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,680
just tell him I already went to bed.

271
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Anong, you should go rest.

272
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,720
- Your secret is safe with me.
- Okay.

273
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,680
Be careful!

274
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
Just go to bed.

275
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
- Go to sleep.
- Shush.

276
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,680
Okay.

277
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,680
Shush.

278
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,800
- Wichai!
- Prasit. Where's Anong?

279
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,120
Wichai.

280
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,400
Hey.

281
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,840
What did you do
to make Anong come back here?

282
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,720
I got the date mixed up
and I forgot to pick her up.

283
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
You haven't changed one bit.

284
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,560
Prasit.

285
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,360
Go tell Anong that
someone's here looking for her.

286
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,360
Right.

287
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,280
Thank you for your help with the letter.

288
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,800
Anong told me
how you helped take care of it.

289
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,720
Do you see now that money
can make some problems go away?

290
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,720
I had no idea
my family caused all that trouble.

291
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,480
If you go down,
Anong will go down with you.

292
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,880
We work in a bank. We need to show
our clients that they can trust us.

293
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,040
I couldn't let what happened affect Anong.

294
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

295
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,880
You've come this far.

296
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,240
Don't let what happened today
ruin things for you.

297
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,360
If she won't come down, that means

298
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,880
she must be really mad at you.

299
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,760
You want me to climb up to her room?

300
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,240
You can't always live by the rules.

301
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
Is this really necessary?

302
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,880
You just need to climb up there
and apologize to her.

303
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,280
Are you too scared to do it?

304
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
Maybe I gave Anong to you too easily.

305
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm glad I still kept her room for her.

306
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
Climb up slowly.

307
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,120
Gosh.

308
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,720
Anong.

309
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,600
Are you asleep?

310
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
Are you still mad at me?

311
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,760
I'm sorry.

312
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
I didn't know you'd leave so early.

313
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,640
I got caught up with work.

314
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,680
But I promise

315
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,600
I won't forget next time.

316
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,040
How about this?

317
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,760
We both can sleep here tonight.

318
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,280
Then we'll go home together
tomorrow morning.

319
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,760
Anong.

320
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,320
Don't come near me. You forgot about me.

321
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,720
Anong.

322
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,400
I climbed up here
just to apologize to you.

323
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,800
Please forgive me.

324
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,680
The whole house
is rooting for us to make up.

325
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,920
Everyone will make fun of me
if you make me leave by myself.

326
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,560
Get away from me. This will teach you
not to forget about me again.

327
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,680
We'll go home together
tomorrow morning, okay?

328
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,920
I wonder what the headline
for tomorrow's paper would say

329
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
if I had fallen and died just now.

330
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,880
Maybe it would say,
"A man lost his life for love."

331
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,960
Or maybe it would say,
"A woman became a widow

332
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,400
after refusing to forgive her husband."

333
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,680
I'll give you one night to be mad at me.

334
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
You'll have to forgive me tomorrow.

335
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,480
We can't be mad at each other
for more than a day

336
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,640
no matter what we fight about.

337
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,760
Okay?

338
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
That's right!

339
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,400
- Prasit.
- Prasit?

340
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,840
Carry on.

341
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,960
- Prasit.
- What?

342
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
Fine. I'll leave.

343
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,280
Good night.

344
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,160
I got a scholarship to study in America.

345
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,800
I see.

346
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,360
Don't work too hard while you're there.

347
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,280
Wichai.

348
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,600
My gosh.

349
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,880
Your arm is bruised.

350
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,040
Do your arms and legs feel weak again?

351
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Is your condition back?
Are you feeling sick again?

352
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,480
Calm down, Anong.

353
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,320
What will I do if you suddenly can't walk?

354
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,760
Anong.

355
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,720
I'm really fine. I know how I'm doing.

356
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,840
I managed to climb up
to your room last night.

357
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,640
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of myself.

358
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I promise we'll be together
for decades to come.

359
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,440
I shouldn't have helped you two make up.
Now I'm jealous.

360
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,360
Stop rubbing your love in our faces.

361
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,240
If you're jealous,

362
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
then just hurry and get married.

363
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,120
Feel free to give

364
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,800
Anong's bedroom to anyone who wants it.

365
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,840
Anong won't be needing it from now on.

366
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,600
Sawaeng can stay there after he's married.

367
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Sawaeng's getting married?

368
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,120
So they're letting Payom
get married before Sa-Ang?

369
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,720
They're about to go bankrupt,
so they need to marry off their daughters.

370
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,480
Jamlong no longer wants Sa-Ang,
so Sawaeng is their last hope.

371
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,240
It's too bad we'll have
to become family with those people.

372
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,200
Sawaeng really loves Payom.

373
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,040
Don't you feel bad for them?

374
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,520
Don't be so prejudiced against them.

375
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,320
Those two have been
through a lot just like us.

376
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,960
Gosh. You two lovebirds
are getting on my nerves.

377
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,920
You really are insufferable.

378
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,040
I've already talked to Pong.

379
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,480
I'll hire someone to help
manage the store while I'm away.

380
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,680
- All right.
- Pong actually offered to do it.

381
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
But I didn't want to bother him

382
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,240
since he's looking
to expand the bank's business.

383
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,320
You should hire someone.

384
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,880
Chantorn will be leaving soon anyway.

385
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,400
You need someone to help you.

386
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,320
I haven't found anyone I like yet.

387
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,440
I have someone in mind
who is perfect for the job.

388
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,520
Is there someone I haven't thought of?

389
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,080
There is.

390
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,080
The store will be in good hands
if you ask this person to help you out.

391
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,720
How do you think
this can help us increase our sales?

392
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,760
It shows us which brand of cigarettes
is popular with our customers.

393
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,200
I see.

394
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,280
Thank you.

395
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,800
You may leave now.

396
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,160
They're all useless.

397
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,640
We have one candidate left.

398
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,560
If you don't like this one,
you can come manage the store yourself.

399
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,480
He's here. Please come in.

400
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,280
Thank you for coming.

401
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm honored to be given this opportunity.

402
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
We meet again.

403
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,000
Please have a seat.

404
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,760
PRAPAT RATANAPANTAKUL

405
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,520
POSITION - MANAGER

406
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,000
So it's you.

407
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Try getting me to spend money
on something that I don't need.

408
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,880
Something may not be useful to you today,

409
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,960
but it can become
a worthwhile investment in the future.

410
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,200
That's why you should hire me.

411
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,680
Well…

412
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,960
Prapat.

413
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,680
What do you think of this?

414
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,280
If we know the brand of cigarettes
that our partners smoke,

415
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,080
it can help us please them
when we do business with them.

416
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,720
Someone once taught me this trick

417
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
as a way to win people over.

418
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,360
I can't believe we'd find
someone last minute.

419
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I told you that you'd like this one.

420
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,040
Pong won't have to worry
if he has someone he can trust.

421
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,080
Then he'll have time to find
a wife and build his own family.

422
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,920
Some people might need

423
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,600
a life partner
more than they need a family.

424
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,880
They need someone

425
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,719
whom they share
their hopes and dreams with

426
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,719
as their partner in life.

427
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,480
That might be more important
to them than having a wife.

428
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,040
You're talking like you know something.

429
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,320
- Well?
- Right.

430
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,280
There's a reason why Sompong
never showed interest in any women.

431
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,480
As the eldest brother,

432
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,440
do you think Sompong will dare
reveal his feelings to anyone?

433
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,680
Especially

434
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,080
if he has to tell his three brothers
about the person he loves.

435
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,200
That can't be easy.

436
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,680
Then I'm glad if this will give them
a chance to be closer.

437
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
I want Pong to be happy.

438
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,880
They're holding hands.

439
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
So are we.

440
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,040
Have you seen this?

441
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,880
The court declared
the general and Lady Mayom bankrupt.

442
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,280
Looks like karma caught up to them.

443
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
They got what they deserved.

444
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,640
We can't be the only one
who's happy to see their downfall.

445
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,440
You must see that this family is toxic.

446
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,080
No one is ever happy living in this house.

447
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,000
You're the one
who keeps our family together.

448
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,640
But I know you want
to get out of this hellhole.

449
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
That's enough!

450
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,160
Wichai.

451
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,160
Yes?

452
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,000
I heard that you're moving abroad.

453
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,880
Have you heard about that?

454
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,760
Your dad would be so proud

455
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,400
to see what you've achieved
despite our misfortune.

456
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,640
I don't see it that way.

457
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,680
If I had been born
with everything I needed,

458
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,120
I might've gotten so spoiled
and never made it this far.

459
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,360
You could say that

460
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,760
what happened was a blessing in disguise.

461
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,520
You always see the good
in every situation.

462
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,560
It's no wonder that
you've never been troubled by anything.

463
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,640
That's not true.

464
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
I often get stressed out.

465
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,360
I just try not to let my problems
bother me for too long.

466
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,960
I try to push them out of my mind.

467
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,680
That helps make my heart lighter.

468
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,560
Wichai.

469
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Thank you so much.

470
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,240
Thank you

471
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,520
for bringing happiness

472
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,600
and comfort to our family.

473
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,760
I'm so proud of you.

474
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,920
- Make your move, Nid.
- Is it your turn, Nid?

475
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,680
- Is that your move?
- Are you sure?

476
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
Let's see, then.

477
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,080
- Goodness. Looks like I won.
- No way.

478
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,880
- She won the treat.
- The treat is mine.

479
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm going to mix these together.

480
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,160
Doesn't it look delicious?

481
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,680
You want a bite, Nid?

482
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,280
Do you notice something about your wife?

483
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,200
There's something different about her.

484
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,600
I don't think she'll be able to travel

485
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
by the time October arrives.

486
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,600
Is Aunt Anong getting chubby?

487
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,040
You want to bet?
Five baht says she's pregnant.

488
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
- I think she's pregnant.
- I think so too.

489
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,320
- How can we bet then?
- I say she's pregnant.

490
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,680
They're here, everyone.

491
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,080
Wichai. Do you have good news for us?

492
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,520
Is she pregnant?

493
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,240
- Yes.
- Yes!

494
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Hooray!

495
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,240
Congratulations, Wichai.
You'll finally have your own baby.

496
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,560
It took you no time to get pregnant.

497
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,080
Maybe you'll have another one soon.

498
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,600
Everyone at the store is so excited.

499
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,960
I thought I was just getting lazy.
I've been eating and sleeping a lot.

500
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,640
She's been moody too.
We fight almost every day.

501
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,320
Wichai, do you want a son or a daughter?

502
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,240
Let's ask Nid.

503
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,680
Nid.

504
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,880
Do you want to have a brother or a sister?

505
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,880
I want a sister. I already have a brother.

506
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,040
- Nid, he's your uncle.
- Me?

507
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,800
Prasit is your uncle.
He can't be your brother.

508
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,040
He's my brother.

509
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,280
Am I your brother?

510
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,840
Well, then.

511
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,960
I guess you can be my sister.

512
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,400
How about that, Nid?

513
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,280
I'll be your brother.

514
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,680
Won't you come down to celebrate with us?

515
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,680
I'm afraid I'll ruin
the mood for everyone.

516
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,040
It reminds me of when I was a kid
when everyone is together like this.

517
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
The house was always lively.

518
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,960
Things will be quiet around here
once Wichai leaves to study abroad.

519
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,440
Will you be okay if I have to leave too?

520
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,480
I have to go abroad

521
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,040
with my boss to be his interpreter.

522
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,360
Chantorn will be going with me.

523
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,840
Really?

524
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,160
I'm so happy for you.

525
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,120
Mom.

526
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Will you be okay

527
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,360
without me and Wichai?

528
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,920
You should go.

529
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
I'll be fine with Choy.

530
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,280
You have a bright future ahead of you.

531
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,680
Don't let me hold you back.

532
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,360
What are you doing?

533
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,640
I'm looking at the first gifts
that my dad gave to all of us.

534
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,320
Have a look.

535
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,480
On our birthdays,
my dad would save the newspaper

536
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,800
that came out on that day for us.

537
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,440
At the time,

538
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,160
my dad was too sick to walk.

539
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,320
So he asked me to get the paper for Chut.

540
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,040
But I forgot.

541
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,080
My dad gave me an earful because of it.

542
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,120
I had to go ask the barber
for the newspaper.

543
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,040
He was about to throw it away
so he let me have it.

544
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,160
I've kept that newspaper until now.

545
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,960
That sounds like something you'd do.

546
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
You're just like this newspaper.

547
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,720
Do you mean I'm old-fashioned?
Or are you saying no one wants me?

548
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,760
You're like a relic.

549
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,280
You're something out of the past

550
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,720
which is now a rare find.

551
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,480
No one can be as modern as you.

552
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,280
That's why everyone thinks
we're a strange couple.

553
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,160
No one believed
that we could make it work.

554
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,040
Our kid may not be born here,

555
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,960
but I'll ask someone
to save the newspaper for him.

556
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,240
I feel a bit sad

557
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,720
that it's going to be
just the three of us.

558
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,240
It's a shame.

559
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,520
I wish our baby could be born
into a big family.

560
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,520
Wait.

561
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,880
I thought you'd be sad
if we didn't get to go abroad.

562
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,200
I'm afraid I won't know what to do
since this is our first baby.

563
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,800
If you're not ready to go,

564
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,720
how about I give up the scholarship?

565
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,320
Are you sure?

566
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,800
This is your opportunity
to progress in your career.

567
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,760
But being a dad
is also an important opportunity.

568
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,520
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

569
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,320
You keep letting
opportunities in life pass you by.

570
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,800
I don't know.

571
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,920
I think those opportunities

572
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
just come at the wrong time.

573
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Maybe I'm making the wrong decision.

574
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,720
In others' eyes,

575
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,400
I might be making a mistake.

576
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,680
But I don't think
I'll miss out on anything

577
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
by choosing my family over my career.

578
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
This is what I meant

579
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,040
when I said that
you're unlike any man I've ever met.

580
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,560
7 YEARS LATER

581
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,240
We're almost there.

582
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,600
Why is it so dark?

583
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,520
- Duck your head.
- Okay.

584
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,160
Don't tell me this is another nursery.

585
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,440
We're here.

586
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,160
I took a photography class
just so I could do this for you.

587
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,600
I can develop all the films myself.

588
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,520
This way, no one will see the pictures
that we want to keep to ourselves.

589
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,360
Is there such a picture?

590
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,800
Do you have to ask?

591
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,080
When did you take all these pictures?

592
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,240
Do you remember this day?

593
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,240
I do.

594
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,480
It was the day Prasit ran to tell me

595
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,400
you were having a baby.

596
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,080
Guys! You need to come now!

597
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,520
Come on! Anong said
she's ready to have the baby!

598
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,480
- Come on!
- Is Anong having her baby?

599
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,600
- Wichai!
- Anong's having her baby!

600
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,440
- Hurry, Wichai!
- Come on!

601
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
Hurry up.

602
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
- Don't take the hammer!
- The hammer?

603
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,960
Come on, Wichai.

604
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
We had our son that day.

605
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,400
Anong, which dish would you like to try?

606
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,000
They say you'll have a boy

607
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,480
if you have an appetite for savory dishes.

608
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,040
You can't be too sure.

609
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,840
Some say to look at the mom's hair.

610
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,120
Try and feel her hair
whether it's coarse or smooth.

611
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,600
Her hair feels smooth.

612
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,200
Then you'll have a boy.

613
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,360
Your dad said to look at the belly button.

614
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,520
See if it protrudes outward
or points inward.

615
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,280
Well?

616
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,080
I can't tell.

617
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,480
My gosh.

618
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
Nid.

619
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
Nid, where's your brother?

620
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,040
He's sleeping, Oncle Wichai.

621
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,800
You're not a little kid anymore.
Say "uncle", not "<i>oncle</i>".

622
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,960
Say it again.

623
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,200
Oncle.

624
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,520
Everyone was wrong.
It turns out we got a girl.

625
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,720
And she's as lovely as you.

626
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,320
When I developed the film,

627
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,960
I just saw that

628
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,640
you secretly took these photos.

629
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,400
We shouldn't let anyone see these.

630
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,880
We should let people see them.

631
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,680
These pictures

632
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,040
capture who you really are.

633
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,560
You're modest, sincere,
and true to yourself.

634
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,840
Thank you

635
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,160
for being willing to overlook
all my flaws.

636
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,640
I don't think they're flaws.

637
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,000
They're what makes you charming.

638
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,400
Those qualities are hard
to find in guys these days.

639
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,880
You never think

640
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,520
that you're superior
or more important than anyone.

641
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,560
You don't laugh at other people

642
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,480
and you don't really care
what other people think.

643
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,640
You don't think too much of yourself,
so you don't care how others see you.

644
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,680
You don't live your life
according to what others expect of you.

645
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,440
Being with you makes me feel comfortable.

646
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,520
Gosh. You find so many nice things to say
about me when I'm such a boring guy.

647
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,040
We've been together for this long.

648
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,680
You should know by now
that I don't care about that.

649
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,800
I'll take lots of pictures
to show you ten years from now,

650
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,760
so you can see for yourself

651
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,160
why I love you so much.

652
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,080
Do you remember this picture?

653
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,640
Who took this picture?

654
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,520
It was probably

655
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,200
Prasit.

656
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,560
I wonder

657
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,240
whether everyone realized

658
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,560
that you were

659
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,400
about to propose to me that day.

660
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,920
But now I wonder

661
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,520
whether you realize

662
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,320
that I still remember
the promise I once gave you.

663
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,440
We promised each other
we'd come back to watch the sunset here.

664
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,680
But we didn't have time.

665
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,400
It wouldn't be this special
if we came here every day.

666
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,720
That's a positive way to look at it.

667
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,640
No matter how many times you ask me,
I'll tell you I don't regret anything.

668
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,880
Thank you.

669
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,320
Thank you for being understanding
and for never asking me for anything.

670
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,560
Just promise me that
we'll get to do everything together.

671
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,160
That's all I want.

672
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,360
The first time we met
was also at the beach, right?

673
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,240
I lost my ring that day.

674
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,560
But now I got a new ring

675
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,320
which you bought for me.

676
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,560
It's funny thinking back on it.

677
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,240
I lost something precious to me.

678
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,840
But I ended up with something
even more valuable.

679
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,920
If you could change one thing between us,

680
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,560
what would you change?

681
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,720
I wouldn't change a thing.

682
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,960
I'm happy with the way things are.

683
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,280
I thought you'd choose
to fall in love with me faster.

684
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,280
Is that what you'd like to happen?

685
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,560
No.

686
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,800
I wouldn't dare hope for that.

687
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,640
I'm happy with how things are now.

688
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,520
But…

689
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,280
I'd like to go back

690
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,880
and take a better look at you.

691
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,160
You're so sweet and perfect.

692
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,640
I don't know

693
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,320
why I didn't notice you from the start.

694
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,240
Love and falling in love
are two different things.

695
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,640
We can fall in love with someone
without actually loving them.

696
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,640
So that's why.

697
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,960
I love you with my whole heart,

698
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,880
but you still make me
fall in love with you every day.

699
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,640
Just like right now.

700
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,240
And you're still not tired
of flirting with me.

701
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,160
You're not good at flirting.

702
