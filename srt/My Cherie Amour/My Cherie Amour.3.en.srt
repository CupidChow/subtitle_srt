BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,200
You also want to see your brother happy.

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
So why don't we work together?

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,000
Help him eliminate the competition.

5
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,320
It's the scent of Thai flowers.
It's not a scent any man would wear.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,720
If she gets married first,

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,960
it would mean that Sa-ngad
and Sa-Ang will never be married.

8
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Is this all your plan, Sawaeng?

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,680
Is that her new suitor?

10
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,920
Anong is trying to prove
that she can look after herself.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Jamlong and Sawaeng might use this chance
to have their guys befriend Anong.

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,720
Wichai doesn't have a wife.
Haven't I told you?

13
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,920
He's a widower.

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,280
Wichai is probably traumatized
by what happened.

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,920
<i>Since then, he's never been
interested in any woman.</i>

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
<i>He found love,</i>

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,800
<i>but fate took her away from him.</i>

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,840
That's what I call unfortunate.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,640
Don't forget that I invited Kacha
to come have dinner at our house.

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Kacha wants us to be his dealer
and find furniture for the embassy.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
A dealer?

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,160
Did you tell him you'd do it?

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,720
That's why I invited him.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
I want my brothers to help
talk to him about the contract.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,320
Hello.

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,600
Is it Choy? How is Samarn doing?

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
Is it Choy?

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,720
I wouldn't have to get up
if you came down sooner.

29
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,400
What is it?

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,400
<i>Do it now. The guy fessed up.</i>

MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,000
SUKNIWAS RESIDENCE, 5:00 PM

33
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,520
It's your first time in court.

34
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,120
Are you scared?

35
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,640
The court doesn't base
their ruling on appearances.

36
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
What you wear

37
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,200
doesn't affect
the weight of your testimony.

38
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
Don't be embarrassed.

39
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
No! Stop!

40
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
Stop it!

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
So you finally show your face?

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
You scammed me

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,600
and tricked me into marrying you.

44
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,440
- Damn you!
- Stop, ma'am.

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,240
- Please, ma'am.
- You're a monster!

46
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,640
Please calm down.

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
You can go to hell!

48
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
- Gosh!
- Anan!

49
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,040
Well, what do we have here?

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Are you the mistress
that helped him scam money from me?

51
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,800
- No!
- Stop it, ma'am!

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,720
Why have a trial at all
if you're going to resort to violence?

53
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,960
Take her away to calm down.

54
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,240
You need to keep
your client under control.

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,120
- Come on.
- Where are you taking me?

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,320
Let me go.

57
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't think baking would be this hard.

58
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
These aren't edible.

59
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Don't serve them. You can throw them away.

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,200
Let me prepare something else
for our guest.

61
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
Please help set the table
and take care of the flower arrangement.

62
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Everything has to be perfect today.

63
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,680
We must show Kacha that
we're accustomed to Western culture.

64
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,040
We must convince him
that we can work with the embassy.

65
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,320
He said he has an appointment
with Mr. Pong, so I let him in.

66
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
Another appointment?

67
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,880
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,840
I heard that Pong asked you
to meet with him today.

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,960
Are you sure
you got the date right this time?

70
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,880
He said all his brothers are busy,
so he asked me to come.

71
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
What's that?

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,480
Well, I saw someone

73
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,320
about to throw the scones away,
so I asked to have one.

74
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,280
I didn't want your staff
to have to prepare food for me,

75
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,880
so I told them I could eat the leftovers.

76
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Goodness.

77
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,680
Listen, Wichai.

78
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,320
Stop.

79
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,400
Did you swallow it?
Spit it out. I said spit it out.

80
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,840
Don't chew it. Wichai.

81
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Wichai, don't chew it.

82
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
Stop chewing.

83
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
Well, I…

84
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
This is quite good,

85
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,640
considering it's your first time baking.

86
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,400
Your guest is here.
Should I let him in, ma'am?

87
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,400
From the looks of you,

88
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,880
you probably tried
to bake for him yourself.

89
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,320
If I were him, I'd be very happy.

90
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,280
Please follow me to the living room.

91
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,680
This way, sir.

92
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,840
Actually, I have
urgent business to attend to.

93
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,200
- I have to go.
- Wait, sir.

94
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,600
Sir, wait a moment. Sir.

95
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,840
Your guest said
he had urgent business to attend to.

96
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
What did you say?

97
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,720
Mr. Kacha was here.

98
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,160
He apologized
that he couldn't stay for dinner.

99
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
He asked me to give you this.

100
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,160
But Mr. Wichai is still here.

101
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,880
Everyone is asking about you downstairs.

102
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,520
It's just Pong and his friend.
They can keep each other company.

103
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
But Wichai came all the way here.

104
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,320
You should come down for his sake.

105
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,200
How can I face him?

106
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,040
What happened earlier was so embarrassing.

107
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
Why must I embarrass myself
every time I see him?

108
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,320
I know.
You're so used to being this perfect girl.

109
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,480
Why don't you try to relax
and be yourself like when you're with me?

110
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
You know, you look kind of cute

111
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,720
when you're pouting like this.

112
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,480
There has to be a guy
who likes this side of you.

113
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,720
This guy has good taste.

114
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,040
I'd rather not drink today.

115
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,840
I have a mouth ulcer.

116
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Then you should drink Utaitip syrup.

117
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,440
It will make you feel better.

118
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,360
It can help cure mouth ulcers

119
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,400
and it's also refreshing.

120
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,560
All right then.

121
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,440
I'M SORRY, THE AMBASSADOR
REQUESTED MY ASSISTANCE

122
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,360
Anong didn't suspect at all that it was
Jamlong and Sawaeng who sent Kacha.

123
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,200
So how can we know whether
she's already given him her heart?

124
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
That's easy.

125
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,520
If Anong really likes this man,

126
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
she will never criticize
his taste in anything.

127
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,040
What's gotten into you today?

128
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,400
You're unusually clever.

129
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
We have to convince Anong

130
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,200
and make her believe
that this guy has bad taste.

131
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,080
We've been waiting for you to join us.

132
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,080
Cheers.

133
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,520
Cheers.

134
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a shame

135
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,400
the person who brought us
this wine couldn't join us.

136
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,520
Right.

137
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,840
You're right.
He brought us top-notch wine.

138
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Then let's invite him
to join us next time.

139
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,760
Sure.

140
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,120
But can we not drink
rotten wine next time?

141
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,320
I was wondering

142
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,160
how you could drink that.

143
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,080
It tastes horrible.

144
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
Or are you biased

145
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,640
because you know who brought it?

146
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,400
What's that?

147
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,880
- It's nothing.
- What is it?

148
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,400
- It's really nothing.
- Prasit.

149
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,040
- It's nothing.
- Stop, Anong.

150
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,080
- Anong.
- Come on, Anong.

151
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,040
- It's nothing.
- Leave Prasit alone.

152
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,000
You're upsetting him. Stop.

153
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Just take it. Gosh.

154
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
Utaitip syrup.

155
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,400
What's the meaning of this?

156
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,400
Well…

157
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,200
Is this another one of your tests?

158
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
I just said you were clever.

159
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
You blew it.

160
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,560
That was my idea.

161
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,040
Don't blame Wichai.

162
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,400
Do you also think
that I can't think for myself?

163
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,920
It's not like that.

164
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,360
I just wanted to know
how you really feel about that guy.

165
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,040
Why must you all try to find fault
with every guy I date?

166
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
Prasit.

167
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,680
If you also question me,

168
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,680
I'll have no one left
that's sincere to me.

169
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,360
No, we're all just looking out for you.

170
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,400
Please don't be mad, Anong.

171
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,240
I'll let you flick my ear if you want.

172
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,080
Flick my ear really hard. Go on.

173
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,760
Prasit.

174
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,920
We're siblings. We don't hurt each other.

175
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
Maybe just a little.

176
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,320
But you said you wouldn't hurt me.

177
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
Liar.

178
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,960
So do you forgive me?

179
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,280
Are you working on this case?

180
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,120
You're so good
at solving others' problems,

181
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,000
yet you're unbothered
by the problems in your own house.

182
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,880
DOZENS OF WOMEN GOT SCAMMED
BY THE SAME MAN

183
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,119
Are you talking about Chut again?

184
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,280
You're becoming
more and more like your father.

185
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,839
He protected his subordinate
and left his family to starve to death.

186
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,200
Take a look at this.

187
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,319
All these women are in debt
because of love.

188
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
When your dad got discharged
from government service,

189
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,720
it was me who had to borrow
people's money to care for our family.

190
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,680
Now you're turning a blind eye
to what's going on.

191
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,600
But I don't see
that Chut is in any kind of trouble.

192
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,960
Marriage and love
are two different things.

193
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,040
If you let Chut marry the girl he loves,

194
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
he's going to spend all his money on her.

195
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,640
Do you want to see
his life get ruined like that?

196
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,160
Didn't you see what happened to Choy?

197
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,760
She married that man
though his family despises her.

198
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,480
In the end, they both got cut off
by their families.

199
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,040
She will be left to pay off
his debt once he's gone.

200
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,520
She's throwing her life away
all because of love!

201
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,080
Did you fight with Mom again?

202
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,080
Hey.

203
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,600
Who's with Samarn if you're out here?

204
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,280
Samarn's sister quit her job
and comes to nurse him every day.

205
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
She's been a big help to me.

206
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Chantorn is Samarn's stepsister.

207
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,760
But their family won't let her
use the family name

208
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,760
because she was born out of wedlock.

209
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,160
Samarn's the only one
who stays in contact with her.

210
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,120
Everyone thinks that Chantorn
will become a mistress like her mom.

211
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
It's so hard being a woman.

212
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,840
It all depends on the man we marry

213
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,040
how our lives will turn out.

214
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,520
Here you go.

215
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,800
Hey.

216
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,160
It's you.

217
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
This is Wichai.

218
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,040
Choy's eldest brother.

219
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
I heard that Choy's brother is a judge.

220
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,520
So it's you.

221
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,040
I also didn't expect to see you here.

222
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,960
I suspected that
you might be nursing someone.

223
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,160
I saw potassium permanganate stains
on your dress the other day.

224
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,760
But I didn't think
that someone would be Samarn.

225
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,160
Why did you get fired from your job?

226
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,600
The jewelry shop owner thought
I double-crossed her

227
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,120
and gave the jewelry to the thief to sell.

228
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,440
You mean Sompob, the guy who was
at the court the other day?

229
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,760
I know him by the name of Anan.

230
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,520
<i>Anan is our customer.</i>

231
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,080
- Hello.
- <i>He knows a lot of diplomats.</i>

232
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,800
I'd like to speak to the owner.

233
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,120
<i>He often comes by to look for jewelry
for the ambassador's wife.</i>

234
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
<i>He's also a salesperson like me.</i>

235
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,280
<i>The difference is that I work at the store</i>

236
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,320
<i>while he takes the jewelry
and sells it to important people.</i>

237
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,280
ANAN KLAIKARN

238
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,520
<i>At first, he would take Madam
to meet the clients with him.</i>

239
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,640
<i>But lately, he would take
the jewelry to sell on his own.</i>

240
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>There were many occasions where
he asked me to prepare jewelry for him.</i>

241
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,240
<i>We had no idea</i>

242
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,520
<i>that he used those pieces
of jewelry to deceive women.</i>

243
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,320
<i>He even gave the jewelry
to those women as dowry.</i>

244
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,840
<i>When he returned the jewelry to us,</i>

245
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,400
<i>those women thought he stole</i>

246
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,920
<i>the jewelry from them to sell for profit.</i>

247
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,320
<i>Our shop then bought
the stolen jewelry from him.</i>

248
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>I only found out that day
that Anan stole our jewelry</i>

249
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,240
<i>to use for his own gain.</i>

250
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,200
<i>The shop owner accused me
of working together with him.</i>

251
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,320
<i>We all got duped by him</i>

252
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,680
<i>because he sometimes brought us
money for the jewelry he sold.</i>

253
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,360
<i>He probably got the money
from scamming women.</i>

254
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,800
<i>Then he would buy more jewelry
to trick his next victim.</i>

255
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,040
When he found out
that I would testify in court,

256
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,560
he wrote me a letter
begging me not to testify against him.

257
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,560
Can I see that letter?

258
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,240
Here.

259
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,400
DEAR CHANTORN,
PLEASE DON'T TESTIFY IN COURT

260
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

261
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,040
The police informed us that a famous hotel

262
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,320
is suing an embassy staff

263
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
who's been staying with them for months
without paying for the room

264
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,280
as well as the food and alcohol bill.

265
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,560
The police suspect that he may be
the same person as the thief in our case.

266
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,680
I feel like I've seen this before.

267
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,680
DEAR CHANTORN

268
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you still have his business card?

269
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,080
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

270
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Here you go.

271
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,320
ANAN KLAIKARN

272
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
I didn't dare throw it away.

273
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,680
I thought I could use it
to prove my innocence.

274
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,680
BANGKOK, TEL. 32254

275
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
BANGKOK, TEL. 32254

276
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,760
BANGKOK, TEL. 32254

277
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,000
The grilled egg vendor asked me
to sell this to Madam for him.

278
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,640
He meant to give it to his lover
as an engagement gift.

279
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,520
But I suspect that
that guy was sent here by someone

280
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,800
to talk business with Anong as a cover.

281
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,600
This guy has good taste.

282
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,920
<i>The police informed us that a famous hotel</i>

283
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,440
<i>is suing an embassy staff

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,120

<i>He often comes by to look for jewelry
for the ambassador's wife.</i>

288
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,640
You scammed me
and tricked me into marrying you.

289
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,440
<i>You have the nerve to trick other women
when you already have a wife.</i>

290
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,160
Please follow me to the living room.

291
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,960
Actually, I have
urgent business to attend to.

292
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,000
<i>I have to go.</i>

293
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,400
Can I help you, sir?

294
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
Sir.

295
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,840
DEAR CHANTORN

296
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,320
I'M SORRY

297
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,400
This is why he ran away that day.

298
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,680
Where is Anong?

299
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,640
Is it this place?

300
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
I think so.

301
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,640
This is the address on the business card.

302
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,320
You just hung up with him.
It's possible that he's hiding here.

303
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
I'd like to ask him as well

304
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,840
why did he have to lie to me.

305
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,200
Is anyone home?

306
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,960
Kacha.

307
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
I have another way.

308
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,840
Goodness, Wichai!

309
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,520
Are you sure about this?

310
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
Wichai!

311
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Wichai, stop!

312
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,200
Let's not do this!

313
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
Wait for me here.

314
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,640
WIBOON WATTANA

315
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,880
ANAN KLAIKARN

316
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
Is it him?

317
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,440
I think so, but we're too late.

318
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,920
But there's enough evidence
to give to the police.

319
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,440
He has many names and identities.

320
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,400
There must be other victims.

321
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,280
I was such a fool.
How could I fall for his lies?

322
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
Everyone has a weakness.

323
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,120
Scammers know how to use
those weaknesses to their advantage.

324
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,480
So what's my weakness?

325
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,760
Your weakness is you want acceptance.

326
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,320
You're trying
to prove yourself to your brothers.

327
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
You want to help them
run the store, right?

328
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,880
How can this man

329
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,800
know so much about my personal life?

330
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,800
If I know about it, it's not strange
that others know as well.

SINTHAI BANK

334
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,320
If you're here to see Kacha,
you're too late.

335
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,320
Jamlong.

336
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,360
What are you doing here?

337
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,600
Well, I…

338
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,000
Are you here because Kacha Chinnaworn

339
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,240
is a comprador for your bank?

340
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,760
Don't tell me he scammed you
out of money too.

341
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,440
Does this mean
you and Kacha knew each other?

342
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,400
He was the middleman.

343
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
He took me to the bank to deposit money

344
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,920
and took all of it for himself.

345
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,960
I have nothing left.

346
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,120
I can assure you.

347
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,040
He didn't open an account with us.

348
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,600
I got scammed by him too.

349
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Don't tell me

350
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,080
that you tried to set me up with him.

351
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,720
Do you realize you almost got
a con artist to be your brother-in-law?

352
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,880
How would I know that
he wanted to scam us for money?

353
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,400
This guy doesn't just want money.

354
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,400
He wants Anong's inheritance.

355
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
You might've been outsmarted by him,

356
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,840
but you've really hurt
your sister's feelings.

357
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,840
I didn't expect this from you, Jamlong.

358
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,880
You tried to set me up with a guy
for your own benefit.

359
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,240
I saw that he has connections.

360
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,600
He brought a lot of money to our bank.

361
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,160
He got that money from scamming women.

362
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,040
If you can't read people,

363
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,720
you should worry about yourself
before you try to set me up with someone.

364
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,200
Please, Anong.

365
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,240
Don't tell Pong about this.

366
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,120
That nosy bastard.

367
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,520
He's probably going to tell Pong
so you can end up with his brother.

368
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,040
And you're still just a selfish person
who only cares about yourself.

369
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,560
Wichai is an outsider,
but he protected me more than you did.

370
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,760
If we weren't siblings,

371
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,280
you would be a stranger to me.

372
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,640
It's Wichai

373
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,160
who cares for me like a brother.

374
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,600
Wichai!

375
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
Wichai, stop!

376
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,400
<i>You might've been outsmarted by him,</i>

377
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,960
but you've really hurt
your sister's feelings.

378
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,320
I heard about what happened.
Wichai is such an observant guy.

379
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,320
He helped protect you
from a bad guy yet again.

380
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,920
He just happened
to be working on this case.

381
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,600
Let's see here.

382
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,560
What's this?

383
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,480
They are samples from the store.

384
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,240
I want to give one to Wichai.

385
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,880
I accidentally tore his shirt.

386
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,200
But I'm not sure which size would fit him.

387
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,320
This might be too big.

388
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,640
If something unexpected happens,
it's called a coincidence.

389
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
But when coincidence keeps happening,

390
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,600
it's called destiny.

391
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,320
What did you say?

392
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
It's destiny.

393
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,960
What happened between you and Wichai
isn't just a coincidence.

394
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
It's me again.

395
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,720
Is this the friend you invited?

396
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,360
No.

397
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,920
Stop.

398
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,320
Did you swallow it?
Spit it out. I said spit it out.

399
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,920
Don't chew it. Wichai.

400
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,320
I do run into him a lot.

401
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,520
See?

402
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,680
It's not a coincidence.

403
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,680
It's destiny.

404
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,800
It's not.

405
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,320
He's Chut's big brother.

406
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,920
How can it be destiny?

407
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,680
It's a small world. That's all.

408
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
But…

409
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
if there's another coincidence,

410
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,120
you have to believe it's destiny.

411
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,040
Deal?

412
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,840
It can't be.

413
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,680
It can't be destiny.

414
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,719
Just wait and see

415
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,560
whether it's destiny or not.

416
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,239
The police issued
an arrest warrant for him.

417
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,239
We've discovered that
this guy is named Manop.

418
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,040
He used to be a market vendor

419
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,320
and a chauffeur for a foreigner.

420
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,960
He used the foreigner's car
to trick people that he was rich.

421
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,200
He also sent me this picture.

422
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,880
He lived a lavish lifestyle

423
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,840
to trick women

424
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,760
into falling in love with him.

425
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,200
He scammed money from those women

426
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
before running away.

427
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,480
He went from a prince
to a woman's nightmare.

428
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,680
Our society judges people
based on appearances.

429
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,640
It's all thanks to you

430
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,480
that we were able to expose this man.

431
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,760
He's managed to get away with it until now

432
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,560
because most women were
too embarrassed to press charges

433
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,520
since people might say they deserved it.

434
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
If you see him again,

435
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
what will you do?

436
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,840
I'll probably make him apologize to you.

437
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,280
All done.

438
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,440
Thank you so much.

439
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,520
Thank you so much, Wichai.

440
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,520
Why are you thanking me?

441
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,240
You helped fix my shirt for me.

442
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,120
Thank you for showing sympathy

443
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,160
for a victim like me.

444
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,440
You can thank me
after I help you get your job back.

445
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,800
I don't want to work there anymore.

446
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,760
Where does Wichai usually go
to have lunch?

447
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,560
He usually eats near here.

448
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,360
And what time
does he usually get off work?

449
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,200
It depends on what time
he gets back from the court.

450
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,320
Does he usually go straight home?

451
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,560
Or does he make a stop
at the Barristers Club first?

452
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,360
You should come back later if you didn't
make an appointment with him.

453
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Mr. Wichai is a busy man.

454
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,640
Please, sir.

455
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,400
The exit is that way.

456
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,440
Prasit.

457
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,840
Wichai.

458
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,320
You should've told me you were coming.

459
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,560
I have to leave for a meeting soon.

460
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,520
What are you doing?

461
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,640
I came to thank you
for catching the thief.

462
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,120
I see.

463
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
Don't worry about it.

464
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,000
We're all acquaintances here.

465
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,080
Anong is like a friend of my brother's.

466
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,360
That sounds so distant.

467
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,920
Can't she be more than that?

468
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,040
You got a nice family name.

469
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,720
Right.

470
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,560
You mean she can be my sister-in-law?

471
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,120
No.

472
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,560
Anong can be more than that.

473
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,320
Do you still have a mouth ulcer?

474
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,000
That's my brother-in-law's
Chinese herbal medicine.

475
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,760
I pick it up for him every three days.

476
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,240
This is from Easae Pharmacy.

477
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,680
What a coincidence. Do you go there often?

478
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,880
Well, occasionally.

479
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,560
There's a shaved ice store
near the pharmacy.

480
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,720
I really like to go there with Anong.

481
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,560
Have you ever been there?

482
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,760
Maybe we'll run into each other.

483
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,640
I hope I'll get to see you there.

484
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,560
If we keep running into each other,

485
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,720
it will no longer be a coincidence.

486
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,680
Aren't you tired
of having shaved ice every day?

487
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,480
No, I'm not.

488
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,120
I can't have enough of it.

489
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,400
Goodness. I see you complain
about the food at home every three days.

490
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,240
Have you waited long?

491
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,120
Another coincidence.

492
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,520
Hello, Wichai.

493
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,320
Hey, there.

494
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,560
I just picked up my niece from school.

495
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,040
I remember Prasit said
that he likes to come here.

496
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,320
This is Nid.

497
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,120
She's my niece.

498
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

499
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,440
If you don't mind, please join us.

500
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

501
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,000
Are you in this neighborhood often?

502
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,600
I have to come pick up medicine
for my brother-in-law

503
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,960
every other day.

504
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,160
But today is special because… Thank you.

505
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,160
Nid has to work on a craft project.

506
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,960
So I brought her to buy some supplies.
Isn't that right?

507
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,680
The teacher told us to craft something
and we could win a prize.

508
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,960
I want to craft a magic object.

509
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,040
A magic object?

510
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,320
How about a magic casket?

511
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,920
Or maybe you could make a magic flute.

512
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,800
What do you think, Uncle?

513
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,280
That's up to you.

514
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,600
You can make anything you want to make.

515
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,920
I want to be as pretty as Ms. Anong.

516
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,080
Well then…

517
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,160
Why don't you ask Ms. Anong?

518
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,800
Ask her

519
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,520
what she does

520
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,800
that makes her so pretty.

521
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,920
Ask her

522
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,120
whether she drinks dewdrops for breakfast.

523
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
And at night,

524
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,960
does she spread her wings

525
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,840
and fly to meet other angels?

526
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,200
Ask her what she does
that makes her so pretty.

527
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,920
Please excuse me.

528
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,040
Where's the bathroom?

529
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,760
- It's over there.
- Thank you.

530
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,960
What should I do?

531
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,040
I suddenly can't look him in the eye.

532
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
I shouldn't have fantasized about him.

533
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,240
Come on.

534
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,400
Let's wash your hands and face.

535
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Yes? What is it?

536
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,360
I know now what I want to make.

537
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,000
I want to make something
that makes my dad smile.

538
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,720
In that case,

539
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,960
you need to make your dad believe
that he'll get better soon.

540
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,760
Okay?

541
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,680
Can I make a smile maker
for my craft project?

542
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,040
Then let's go back home
and work on it today.

543
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,440
Okay? All right?

544
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,760
You're all clean.

545
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Let's go.

546
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,200
Is that the shirt you tore?

547
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,960
Look at this.

548
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,280
I don't think so.

549
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
Maybe you can give him a new suit

550
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,560
to replace this one.

551
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,240
Will Wichai accept it?

552
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,720
Just leave it to me.

553
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,240
My goodness, Anong!

554
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,920
Anong, what should we do?

555
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,960
This is bad. What should we do, Anong?

556
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,040
- I--
- It's okay.

557
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,320
I can have it washed.

558
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,840
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive my clumsiness.

559
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,600
It's all right. This suit is old anyway.

560
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,920
- Let's go.
- Wichai, wait.

561
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,560
Please allow me.

562
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,720
Let me take care of it for you.

563
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,880
- I'll return it to you later.
- But…

564
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,160
Please.

565
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,320
Thank you very much then.

566
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
You're welcome.

567
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,400
Goodness. It's all dirty.

568
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,400
It's all right.

569
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
<i>We're proud to present</i>

570
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,760
<i>Lady Dajchanee.</i>

571
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,400
<i>It's a love story
that captivates the world.</i>

572
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,720
<i>This is the most magnificent play</i>

573
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,720
<i>like you've never seen before.</i>

574
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,120
<i>Tickets are available now.</i>

575
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,760
LADY DAJCHANEE
A LOVE STORY THAT CAPTIVATES THE WORLD

576
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,600
RUANG'S SHOP

577
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,960
My gosh.

578
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,920
Look, guys. There's a typing contest.

579
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,320
I want that prize.

580
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,600
Do you want the prize for second place?

581
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,680
You're good, Uncle. Can you win it for me?

582
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,680
My store also sells piggybanks like this.

583
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,240
But buying it won't be
as fun as winning it, right?

584
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,920
How about this? If you want the piggybank,

585
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,880
I'll try to win it for you.

586
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,720
I won't do it.

587
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,240
Are you sure it's a good idea?

588
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,760
I'm not good at typing.

589
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,040
You should do it.

590
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,640
If Wichai ends up getting first place,
we won't get the piggybank.

591
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,360
I'll do my best.

592
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,600
This is a touch-typing contest.

593
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,400
Participants must put on blindfolds.

594
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,520
The winner is the one
who types the fastest

595
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,960
with the fewest typos.

596
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,400
Please put on your blindfold.

597
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,120
Try to relax.

598
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,440
Relax your fingers.

599
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,720
You got this.

600
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,840
Focus, Anong.

601
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,440
You got this.

602
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,640
But don't come in the first place.

603
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,400
Is everyone ready?

604
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,920
If you're ready, you may begin.

605
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,360
"There is no greater happiness than peace.

606
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,160
If you think happiness is money,

607
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,920
you will seek wealth.

608
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,440
You will seek a partner

609
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,120
if you think happiness lies in a person.

610
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,360
If you think happiness means pleasure,

611
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,400
you will seek vices."

612
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,720
What does vices mean?

613
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,440
It means gambling.

614
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,800
"Like a bird jumping

615
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,360
from one branch to another

616
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,280
without knowing that true happiness

617
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,960
lies within oneself."

618
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,920
You've made two typos.

619
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,040
That means
your total score is eight points.

620
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,040
If the person who finishes second
made no typos,

621
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,520
they will win the contest.

622
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,400
But if they made more typos than you,

623
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,040
you'll win a typewriter from our store.

624
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,320
Don't win!

625
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,960
You finished second,

626
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,240
which gives you nine points.

627
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,640
You didn't make any mistakes.

628
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,120
That means
your total score is nine points.

629
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,240
That's the highest score right now.

630
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,320
We did it!

631
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,160
Hold on. Why are you guys so happy?

632
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,600
Why are you so happy?

633
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,960
You came in second.

634
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,400
- Do you like it?
- That wasn't fun at all.

635
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,160
You told me to compete, but not to win.

636
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,960
Don't make me do
something like this again. I feel stupid.

637
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,240
Can I have a consolation prize?

638
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,360
Here's a prize for you too, Uncle.

639
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,720
I can't tell anymore

640
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,560
who is kissing who.

641
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,160
You have lipstick on your face.

642
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,240
Right.

643
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,240
Be careful. That's a white shirt.

644
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,360
Let me help you.

645
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,560
Forgive me.

646
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,760
I didn't mean to get it on you.

647
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,440
If you meant it,

648
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,760
Wichai might've melted on the spot.

649
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,680
This way, Doctor.

650
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,680
Samarn can't keep anything down.

651
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,240
He keeps throwing up food.

652
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,120
The doctor said
we should prepare ourselves.

653
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,880
The doctor said…

654
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,640
he won't last through this month.

655
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,920
Here you go.

656
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,720
Here's a magic ring, Dad.

657
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,320
What powers does it have?

658
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,640
It will make you feel better.

659
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,080
Help your dad put it on, dear.

660
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,200
Uncle Wichai helped cast a spell on it.
It will make you better.

661
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,280
LADY DAJCHANEE

662
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,360
It wasn't even a big deal.

663
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,160
Then how come…

664
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,080
Wait. It's okay. Let me do it.

665
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,600
You should get to work or you'll be late.

666
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,360
You're leaving so early.

667
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,000
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

668
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,000
Wait, Soon.

669
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,480
Please don't bother.

670
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,120
I can look after myself.

671
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,560
All right.

672
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,880
This magic ring can turn tears into smiles

673
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,760
and vice versa.

674
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,480
No one can have the best
of everything all their lives.

675
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,000
The more we find out
about someone's secrets,

676
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,600
the closer we become to them.

677
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,240
I don't want to pretend.
I want to date you for real.

678
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,880
You must let her see your flaws,

679
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,200
so you know how much she can take.

680
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,160
You can't even look after yourself.

681
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,080
You're no different
from that cripple Prasit.

682
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,400
You shouldn't have been born a man

683
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,440
since you can't protect anyone.

684
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,320
This could be the reason why

685
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,920
people look down on our family!

686
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,480
Where did you drop Prasit off?
He's not home yet.

687
