00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,120
<i>Do you realize you almost got
a con artist to be your brother-in-law?</i>

3
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,240
<i>How would I know that
he wanted to scam us for money?</i>

4
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,040
You might've been outsmarted by him,

5
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,800
but you've really hurt
your sister's feelings.

6
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,960
<i>If something unexpected happens,
it's called a coincidence.</i>

7
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,760
But when coincidence keeps happening,

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,000
it's called destiny.

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,520
<i>Ask her what she does
that makes her so pretty.</i>

10
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,960
<i>Ask her whether she drinks
dewdrops for breakfast.</i>

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
I can't tell anymore

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,280
who is kissing who.

13
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Here's a magic ring, Dad.

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,480
It will make you feel better.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,880
Uncle Wichai helped cast a spell on it.
It will make you better.

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
Choy ordered persimmons for you
since they are your favorite.

17
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,720
Please have some.

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Aren't you going to work?

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,320
Samarn can't keep food down anymore.

20
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
I can tell from your expression.

21
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
If you want to go stay with Choy,

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,480
I can drive you there.

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,200
We haven't been friendly with each other.

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,920
If I go visit them, Samarn will think
I go there to bid him goodbye.

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
It will only hurt his feelings.

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
If you change your mind,

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
just let me know.

28
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,720
That's for Chut.

29
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,960
That's all that's left.

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,560
You usually don't eat at home.

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,120
I thought you already ate.
I didn't know you'd come home hungry.

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,480
I'll head out to work then.

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,400
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,560
Is Master an adopted child?

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
I've never seen a mother

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,000
who is as cruel as you.

37
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,200
You play favorites with your kids.

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,240
You also play favorites
and choose to serve only Wichai

39
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,360
when you're staying under my roof.

40
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,880
You're also biased like me.

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,640
I don't disagree.

42
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,560
How can you put up with this?

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,640
You're a well-respected man out there,

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,880
but you're treated like a servant
in your own home.

45
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Nothing you do is good enough.

46
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,160
When others cause trouble,

47
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
you always get blamed for it.

48
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
I don't understand. You must be adopted.

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,960
And you just put up with everything.

50
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,320
I remember a time

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,080
when Mom didn't speak to anyone.

52
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
I have only one daughter

53
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
and I'm struggling to survive.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,880
But Mom has four children

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,560
and Chut was just born then.

56
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,560
How did she get through it?

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,160
Mom found a reason

58
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,080
that helps keep her going.

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,800
A reason that helps keep her going?

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
It's okay, son. Don't cry.

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
Dad!

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,240
Dad.

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,480
- Dad.
- Go check on Chut.

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
It's okay.

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Mom! Dad, where's Mom?

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,960
She's upstairs.
You should go check on her.

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,240
Mom.

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
Mom!

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,960
It's stuffy in there.
I want to set it free.

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,800
It's dangerous. Come back inside.

71
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Mom!

72
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,360
Please don't climb up there.

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,760
Mom, I'm begging you.

74
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,360
I can't stand it anymore. Just let me go.

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,720
Just tell me what's wrong, Mom.

76
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,760
Let me help you.

77
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,200
No one can help me.

78
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Mom!

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,800
Please just let me go, Wichai.

80
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
Mom!

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
Chut. That's Chut crying.

82
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,360
Chut's crying, Wichai.

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Go check on your brother.

84
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Please go check on Chut.

85
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
<i>The reason that keeps Mom going</i>

86
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
<i>is Chut.</i>

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,360
It's my fault

88
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,880
for not being able to provide for you all.

89
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,160
I've become a burden to my family.

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,400
But one day, the truth will come out

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
that it wasn't me who stole the money.

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,880
You must keep doing the right thing.

93
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,560
Your integrity and honesty

94
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,560
are the only things that can save you.

95
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,360
Yes, Dad. I'll wait for that day.

96
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,120
Take care of your mom for me.

97
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,080
Don't worry, Dad.

98
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,720
I will look after everyone for you.

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
Please pass on my love to your brother.

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,200
Yes, Dad.

101
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,320
Mom's haunted by the past.

102
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,080
Every time she looks at me,

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,960
she fears that I'll turn out
to be a lousy man.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,840
So Chut's become the only hope she has.

105
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,000
It's just hope.

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,520
If Mom takes a good look at you,

107
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,880
she'll see that she's succeeded
in raising a good man.

108
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,400
Mom is so blessed

109
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,280
to have a good son like you.

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,480
Since you eat like a horse,
why don't you pack food to eat at work?

111
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,480
Gosh, Mom. If I do that,
people are going to make fun of me.

112
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,360
I'll just come home to eat your cooking.

113
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,039
You don't seem to mind bringing food
to work when you run out of money.

114
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,159
Well, I miss you.

115
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,799
I want to come home to see you.

116
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,160
Seeing you gives me an appetite.

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
- Just get to work.
- Yes, ma'am.

118
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Are you heading out to work?
Hold on a second.

119
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,840
Take this lunchbox with you.

120
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,040
I can't finish all of it myself.

121
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,200
And here.

122
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Give it to Choy's kid for me.

123
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Choy can sell it or keep it for herself.

126

What is <i>Khao Rang</i>?

127
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,720
<i>Khao Rang</i> is a local dish
in Rayong Province.

128
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
It's hard to find these days.

129
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,720
But I want to try it.
Can you make some for me?

130
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,760
Sure.

131
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,560
- I'll make you some.
- You can't.

132
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,040
Why not?

133
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,640
Where are you going to find <i>Krabok</i> seeds?

134
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
You're right.

135
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,680
I guess I can't make it for you.

136
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,600
If I can find

137
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
<i>Krabok</i>…

138
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
- <i>Krabok</i> seeds.
- <i>Krabok</i> seeds.

139
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,040
If I can find <i>Krabok</i> seeds for you,

140
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,560
you can make <i>Khao Rang</i> for me?

141
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,200
Yes, dear.

142
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Then leave it to me.

143
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
What is up with Prasit?

144
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,120
I'll go check on him.

145
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Madam, I've prepped
all the ingredients for you.

146
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,080
I wonder whether Wichai is home.

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Wichai has work to do.

148
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
He can't spend all day with us.

149
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,280
I want to be his friend.

150
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
He's fun to be around.

151
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,480
Do you think
he would want to be our friend?

152
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,640
They say that people become close
when they know each other's secrets.

153

I don't…

158
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,400
I don't want to be close to him.

159
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,360
You call me a blabbermouth,

160
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,440
but it's you who can't keep
your feelings to yourself.

161

You're getting him a new suit,

but you don't want to be close to him?

163
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
And whose idea was it?

164
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,640
Wasn't that your idea?

165
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,480
What am I doing?

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
Do I really like him?

167
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,600
He's just damaged goods.

He's not worth it.

Ta-da. Do you like it?

171
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,480
You got me a new suit?

172
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,080
It's a top-quality suit.

173
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,720
Doesn't it look great?

174
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
I saw it in the newspaper this morning.

175
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,360
I never thought I would get to wear it.

176
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,920
Anong had it tailored especially for you.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,360
She did?

178
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,400
Doesn't she have great taste?

179
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,640
It makes you look
so dignified and respectable.

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
Look.

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,160
What are you doing?

182
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm trying to stay in the shade.

183
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I've made you <i>Khao Rang</i> like you asked.
Come have a taste.

184
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,120
Really?

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
Okay.

186
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,120
So this is what <i>Khao Rang</i> looks like?

187
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,440
I didn't think
kids these days would know of it.

188
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,240
I thought only people
my age know what it is.

189
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,200
This guy I know

190
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,040
is quite old-fashioned.

191
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Old-fashioned?

192
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,440
Can I bring some for him?

193
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,160
- Sure.
- Go ahead, dear.

194
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,000
You can take all of it.

195
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,440
You're home, Anong?

196
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,240
Okay. I'll be right there.

197
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,400
Unbelievable.

198
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,040
Sorry if I'm overdressed.

199
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,680
I really didn't mean to outdress anyone.

200
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
I'll be right there.

201
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,120
La-di-da-di-da.

202
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Hey, wait a second.

203
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
Whose suit is that?

204
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,800
It's Master's suit.

205
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,480
Wichai must've spent a fortune on this.

206
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
No! Get your hands off it!

207
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Hey!

208
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
You can't have it!

209
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
Damn it.

210
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,440
This is a nice suit.

211
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,560
Do I look good?

212
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,840
It's Wichai's new suit.

213
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,880
He doesn't usually wear expensive clothes.

214
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,840
So I took it.

215
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,400
This is so disrespectful.

216
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't you know that this suit--

217
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,960
This suit is from my store.

218
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
So he doesn't like the suit.

219
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
He probably won't like these either.

220
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,840
Hello, ma'am.

221
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
So where should we go today?

222
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,360
What would you like to do?

223
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,680
Let's take the food
and have a picnic somewhere.

224
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,680
Okay.

225
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,080
What a bummer.

226
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,960
Hey.

227
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm not very good at rowing.

228
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,040
Wichai is heading to the temple,
so he offered to drop us off.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,160
Shall we head out?

230
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,400
We're sorry to bother you.

231
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,520
We've caused you trouble again.

232
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,160
Can you take this?

233
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
Thanks for offering.

234
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,760
Sure.

235
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
You should've said you don't like it.

236
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
Just be upfront about it.

237
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,560
Where should we have our picnic, Anong?

238
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,040
How about here?

239
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,840
Okay.

240
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
Boi, lay out the mat.

241
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,040
Well, you guys enjoy yourselves.

242
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,760
I'll go to the temple
to get holy water for Samarn.

243
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,560
You do it yourself. I'll go with Wichai.

244
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,960
Me too.

245
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,840
I still don't know any of your secrets.

246
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,480
Prasit, won't you stay here with me?

247
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,160
Auntie made <i>Khao Rang</i> for us to try.

248
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,800
No. I'm going to try
and bond with Wichai today.

249
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,480
I don't get why you want
to eat out here in the sun.

250
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
All right then.

251
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,119
Prasit can come with me.

252
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
- Let's go.
- All right.

253
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,520
This reminds me of the time
we had a picnic in York.

254
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,320
This is refreshing.

255
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey.

256
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
Can you stop over there?

257
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,720
I want to pick some lotus flowers.

258
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,280
I want to give them to someone I know.

259
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,080
This must be your secret.

260
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,560
You're a considerate person

261
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,040
who cares about everyone.

262
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
Well, not everyone.

263
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,480
Then this person must be
quite important to you.

264
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,880
I wonder if Prasit has found
any of Wichai's secrets.

265
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,480
Right.

266
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,440
Prasit has a theory that

267
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,120
the more we find out
about someone's secrets,

268
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,120
the closer we become to them.

269
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,760
I see.

270
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,720
But I never keep any secrets from you.

271
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Does that make us close?

272
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
Maybe there are things
that you don't know about me.

273
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,640
But we have one shared secret.

274
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
We pretend to date each other,
so others will leave us alone.

275
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,480
Chut.

276
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,920
There's no one else around.

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,760
You can drop the act.

278
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
That's my secret.

279
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,560
I don't want to pretend.
I want to date you for real.

280
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
I want to be with you like this forever.

281
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
Although we're very close,

282
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,680
it doesn't mean we have to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

283
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,320
We can be friends.

284
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,160
I don't believe that
you only think of me as a friend.

285
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,440
We're so compatible with each other.

286
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,600
But sometimes,

287
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,360
we can be attracted to someone

288
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,440
who is the total opposite of us.

289
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,400
But I think it has to do
with your peace of mind.

290
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,560
If you feel at ease with someone,

291
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,160
that's the person
you should spend your life with.

292
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,440
What is he up to?

293
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,000
He can't make up his mind

294
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,920
whether to go release some fish

295
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,800
or to cover the Buddha statue
with gold sheets.

296
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,720
Just pick one, Prasit.

297
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,840
I don't know which one
will bring me more merit.

298
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,360
Which will lead me to hell

299
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
and which will lead me to heaven?

300
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,440
A judge like me has to decide
people's fate all the time.

301
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,240
But when it comes to personal matters,

302
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,360
I don't think too much about it
if it's not a matter of life and death.

303
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
I look at my watch

304
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,680
and let the second hand
decide things for me.

305
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,280
If the second hand points to the left,
we'll go release the fish.

306
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,040
If it points to the right, we'll go put
gold sheets on the Buddha statue.

307
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,760
It makes life a lot easier.

308
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,040
Is it really that easy?

309
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,000
So we don't blame ourselves
if we make the wrong decision.

310
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,040
Then let's go.

311
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
- Gosh.
- Come on, guys!

312
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,320
- Hurry!
- Come on!

313
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,840
- Hey.
- Let's go.

314
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,680
- Wait for me!
- Hey!

315
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,560
Where are they going?

316
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,200
They're off to collect donation money

317
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,680
from the ordination ceremony.

318
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,520
Let's join them.

319
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,040
Come on, guys! Let's go!

320
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,640
Look at those coins!

321
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,280
- Get them!
- Gosh.

322
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
Hurry! Grab those coins!

323
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,080
Grab them!

324
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,960
It's raining money!

325
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,040
Does your friend think he's a kid?

326
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,000
At least he's happy.

327
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,120
It's raining money!

328
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Get it!

329
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Let me have some!

330
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,520
- I want some too!
- Hey!

331
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,880
Hey! Old man!

332
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,880
He's going to get stomped on.

333
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,920
- Take this!
- Gosh!

334
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,120
Stop! Gosh!

335
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,480
- I want money too!
- Stop!

336
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,680
Stop. It's okay. Calm down.

337
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,680
Are you okay?

338
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,920
Wichai.

339
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
- Let me borrow that.
- What?

340
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,160
Hey!

341
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,080
Hey! Back off!

342
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,440
Leave him alone!

343
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
Hey!

344
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
Back off, kids.

345
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
- Take this!
- Gosh!

346
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,360
Those little punks hurt us
right in the temple.

347
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Is the money worth getting
into a fight with those kids?

348
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,800
You can't have it.

349
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,800
Hey! Stop! What are you doing?

350
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,920
Stop it right now!

351
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,280
Get away from her! You shameless jerk!
How could you do this?

352
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,600
Prasit, wait.

353
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,440
How could you do that out here?
Have you no shame?

354
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,600
Prasit! Prasit, stop.

355
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,640
Chut was just getting dirt out of my eye.

356
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,720
I don't believe you! He can't be trusted!
Get away from her, you jerk!

357
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
Shall we head back?

358
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
I have to pee.

359
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,160
- I have to pee.
- What?

360
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,040
Hey. Don't unzip your pants here.

361
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,680
I have to pee.
Just take me where I can pee.

362
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
- Hurry.
- Keep your pants on.

363
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,480
Just come with me. Go that way.

364
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,920
- Where?
- Come help me, Boi.

365
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,280
Keep your pants on.

366
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,000
I can't hold it anymore.

367
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
Gosh. Come on.

368
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,840
The truth is,

369
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,280
the suit would've looked
a mess if I had kept it.

370
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,960
I don't take good care of things.

371
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,880
Good things aren't for me.

372
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,600
But thank you

373
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,920
for thinking of me.

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,200
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

375
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,960
I hope it didn't fall into the water.

376
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,720
So how did it go today?

377
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,240
How many of your secrets
did Prasit find out?

378
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,400
I think he learned quite a lot about me.

379
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,280
Can you tell me your secrets too?

380
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,960
If I tell everyone,

381
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,640
they won't be secrets anymore.

382
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,920
But I do know some things about you.

383
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,480
I know that you tend to space out a lot

384
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,440
and end up taking other people's things
back home by accident.

385
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
Pong often complains that

386
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,240
he can't find his lighter.

387
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,120
When you go home,

388
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,360
I bet you often grab
other people's things back with you.

389
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,280
Why don't you check your pocket
and see what you took today?

390
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,880
You stole from the temple.

391
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,800
That's a sin, you know.

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
That's not all.

393
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,240
You're also the kind of person
who doesn't assume things.

394
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,080
It's probably in your nature
as a judge to not rush to judgment.

395
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,880
When you have your coffee,

396
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,160
you always taste it
before adding anything to it.

397
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,240
That's something that
I didn't even know about myself.

398
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,480
There are also your daily reminder notes.

399
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,240
You write down things that you have to do
on a piece of paper as a reminder.

400
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,360
Am I right?

401
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,560
This means we're close friends now.

402
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,160
Do you know any of my secrets?

403
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,680
You don't have
many close female friends, do you?

404
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,280
I get jealous easily,

405
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,400
so no one wants to be friends with me.

406
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,360
But there's one girl
who gets along great with you.

407
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,160
She asked me to give you something.

408
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,520
It's Nid. She really likes you.

409
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,040
I got this a while ago, but I didn't
have a chance to give it to you.

410
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I brought it with me today,
knowing that I would see you.

411
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,720
This is Nid's magic ring.

412
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
Put it on for me.

413
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,720
I feel so lucky.

414
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,920
This ring

415
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,160
instantly makes me smile.

416
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,520
But it won't last.

417
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,080
It will pass.

418
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,800
This magic ring can turn tears into smiles

419
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,320
and vice versa.

420
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,800
Nid said that you always seem so happy.

421
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,680
So she's wondering whether this ring

422
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,640
might bring you misery instead.

423
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,200
Look at the inside of the ring.

424
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,720
It's to remind us

425
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,480
to not be too sad
or too reckless with life.

426
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,800
No one can have
the best of everything all their lives.

427
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,680
Let's do this again sometime.

428
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,120
Go! Get out of here!

429
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,160
Go!

430
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,680
Hey. That's…

431
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,920
That's my housewarming gift to Auntie.

432
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
So it's been here all along.

433
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,840
It's fine.

434
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,800
It's pretty.

435
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,960
I'll send someone to come take it back.

436
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,120
I don't want to trouble your mom.

437
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,360
You should come
have dinner with us sometime.

438
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,080
We can get to know
each other better as neighbors.

439
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,240
Chut and I have been to your house
countless times already.

440
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,200
Let Chut play host for a change.

441
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,920
How about next week?

442
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
You're all invited.

443
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,120
I'm not promising anything.

444
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Don't include me in your little party.

445
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,840
I don't want to know that woman.

446
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,360
I already know enough from what I've seen.

447
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,280
That brat bought that damn bird,

448
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,800
but she couldn't bother
to get a cage for it.

449
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,240
She just wants to flaunt
her wealth in people's faces.

450
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,000
Look at what you did.
You're asking for trouble.

451
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,160
You're too afraid
to introduce Anong to Mom.

452
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,200
If you want to become closer to her,

453
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,600
you must let her see your flaws

454
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,000
so you know how much she can take.

455
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,120
This magic ring can turn tears into smiles

456
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,360
and vice versa.

457
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,160
Look at the inside of the ring.

458
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,920
It's to remind us

459
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
to not be too sad
or too reckless with life.

460
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,760
<i>Nid said that you always seem so happy.</i>

461
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,600
So she's wondering whether this ring

462
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,360
might bring you misery instead.

463
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,800
I know misery.

464
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,120
I'm miserable because of someone
I shouldn't even care about.

465
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,160
No one can have the best of everything
all their life.

466
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,120
What is your brother really like?

467
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,720
In his eyes,

468
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,760
I'm just a silly girl
who will never be good enough.

469
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,640
To me,

470
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,400
having the best life

471
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,400
has nothing to do with material things.

472
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,160
It's the feeling of peace and comfort
that you share with someone

473
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
to the point where you wish
you could stay with them forever.

474
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
He doesn't have feelings for me.

475
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,040
I should just move on.

476
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,120
Is this <i>Khao Rang</i> that Samarn asked for?

477
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,159
Where did you get these?

478
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,440
Someone I know made them for me.

479
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,639
During the war, Samarn and his family
came to take refuge in my hometown.

480
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,679
I had a difficult life then.

481
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,280
Samarn saw me eat this with rice.

482
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,880
So he asked to have some too.

483
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Samarn hasn't been eating.

484
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,840
But he said he wanted <i>Khao Rang</i>.
You should give him some.

485
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,800
Thank you.

486
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,040
You'll serve chili paste to the guests?
Don't you know who's coming?

487
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,800
You invited them, so you have
to pay for the food yourself.

488
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,240
Mom.

489
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,840
You're doing this to spite me, right?

490
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
If she loves you, she shouldn't mind
living a hard life with you.

491
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,280
Today, she can prove herself
whether she can handle it.

492
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,640
If she can't stomach our food,

493
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,120
how can she stomach
being with you every day?

494
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,160
But…

495
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,440
You're so mean, Mom.

496
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,160
Don't make it look too good.
Just throw it on the plate.

497
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,520
Wichai is tending the garden.
He'll be with us shortly.

498
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,880
I developed the film from the other day.

499
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,640
This is Nid.

500
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,880
Right.

501
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,200
And this is Choy.

502
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,320
That's my brother-in-law

503
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
who's terminally ill.

504
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,320
Poor guy.

505
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,040
Who is this, Chut?

506
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
I don't know.

507
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,520
Probably a friend of Wichai's.

508
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,960
I don't know her.

509
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,320
It's okay, Prasit.

510
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,800
This is what we normally eat.

511
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,560
I hope it's okay with you.

512
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,200
We also eat this kind of food at home.

513
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
It's just that…

514
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,280
Prasit gets scared
when the fish is turned to face him.

515
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,520
How old are you?

516
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,680
What's your degree?

517
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,880
I graduated from high school.

518
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,520
I don't work.

519
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,360
I suppose you don't need to work
since you're already rich.

520
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,520
Our family owns a department store.

521
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,880
It's a family-run business.

522
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,480
Let me help.

523
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,160
Actually,

524
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,480
Prasit can remember
all the product labels.

525
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,600
He knows exactly where
each product at the store is placed.

526
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,800
That's right.

527
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,840
I love organizing the shelves.

528
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,960
Well…

529
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,480
When Prasit goes somewhere
he's not familiar with,

530
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,000
he can get anxious.

531
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,160
He probably doesn't socialize much,
so he has no manners.

532
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,560
Mom.

533
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,680
He just likes to keep to himself.

534
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,680
I want to go home.

535
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,120
Wait. Prasit.

536
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,440
- Please excuse us.
- Please stay.

537
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,680
I'll go after him.

538
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,160
Have a seat, Anong.

539
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,720
He probably thinks
he can do anything he wants

540
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
just because he has money.

541
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,960
I'm sorry that my mom was rude.

542
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
Your mom meant to provoke me.

543
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,400
I won't fall for it.

544
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,520
But Prasit has already lost it.

545
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,200
She was rude to you on purpose
so you wouldn't want to be with me.

546
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,000
Lamoon!

547
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,800
Do you see my cassette box?

548
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,760
I want to listen to music.
I think I put it somewhere here.

549
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,480
Hold on.

550
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,880
I remember it was here.

551
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,920
Goodness! It seems I've pawned it.
So the cassettes are all gone.

552
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,800
Chut, I don't have enough
to pay the annual association fee.

553
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,360
I still owe people money
for your tuition fee abroad.

554
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Not to mention the travel expenses.

555
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,840
Mom.

556
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,120
Are you sure you're okay with it
if Chut can't provide for you?

557
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,560
I have money.

558
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,800
I don't need anyone to provide for me.

559
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,800
You should know
that I had to sell my furniture

560
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,320
so Chut could afford to buy you drinks.

561
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,720
And don't even ask Chut

562
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,080
for a big engagement ring.

563
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,000
- You have to buy one yourself.
- Mom, enough.

564
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080
I don't really waste my time

565
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,640
thinking about silly things like that.

566
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,040
You'll never understand the struggle
as long as you have money.

567
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,480
This is why your family
treats Chut with disdain.

568
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,400
And you don't care
that people look down on him

569
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,960
as long as you can still live comfortably.

570
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,480
You're not only getting
in the way of his future,

571
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,880
but you're also bringing him to ruin.

572
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,200
Is this what you call love?

573
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,800
Please excuse me.

574
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,200
Anong.

575
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,600
What?

576
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,840
Mom.

577
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Why did you have
to embarrass me like that?

578
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,560
If you didn't have me looking out for you,

579
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,640
no decent woman would take you.

580
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,520
But you crossed the line.

581
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,680
You made me seem like a loser.

582
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,840
You can't even look after yourself.

583
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,360
You're no different
from that cripple Prasit.

584
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,520
You shouldn't have been born a man

585
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,480
since you can't protect anyone.

586
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,600
So I'm just supposed to make you proud?

587
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,680
I already chose a job
that you can boast about.

588
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,640
But when I embarrass you,

589
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,200
I suddenly become a good-for-nothing?

590
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,280
You should redeem our family name

591
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,640
and reclaim the respect that we deserve.

592
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,440
Instead, you let those
new money people look down on you!

593
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,600
You've disgraced this family
when you became a loan shark.

594
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,320
This could be the reason why

595
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,840
people look down on our family!

596
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,240
You're right!

597
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,520
Without me,

598
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,240
you wouldn't even be here
talking back to me!

599
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,800
Prasit.

600
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,040
Have you seen Prasit?

601
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,960
He isn't back yet.

602
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,040
He's not home? He left a while ago.

603
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,520
Wichai.

604
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,040
Where did you drop Prasit off?
He's not home yet.

605
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,840
I couldn't catch up to him.

606
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,280
<i>I thought he went back home.</i>

607
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,600
So what should we do?

608
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,120
Calm down, Anong.

609
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,640
Try to stay calm.

610
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,920
Hold on a second.

611
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,480
Chut.

612
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,240
Can you ask Anong

613
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,960
<i>if anyone came to take the peacock?</i>

614
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,760
The peacock?

615
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,240
It's here.

616
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,600
It's at her house.

617
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,080
<i>Tell me one of your secrets.</i>

618
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,560
What secret should I tell?

619
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,560
How about this?

620
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,160
I'll tell you my secret first.

621
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,440
Here goes.

622
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,560
I get upset

623
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,160
when I hear annoying sounds.

624
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,080
Like the sound

625
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,880
<i>of clinking coins.</i>

626
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,400
It's raining money!

627
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,080
Or the sound when people snore or sigh.

628
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,200
Those sounds are so annoying.

629
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,160
But there are also the things I like.

630
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,680
<i>You see.</i>

631
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,960
I like round objects,

632
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,080
especially if they can roll or spin.

633
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,040
Like tennis balls or footballs.

634
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,400
I also like fans and wind wheels.

635
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,640
I love it when they're spinning.

636
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,760
Right. There's another thing
which I love the most.

637
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,160
It's…

638
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,400
Wichai.

639
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,960
Where are you going?

640
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,520
Would Prasit come all the way here?

641
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,840
He told me he loves Ferris wheels.

642
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,400
- Is he up there?
- I don't see him.

643
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,120
He's right there.

644
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,080
Gosh. There he is.

645
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,560
Hello.

646
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,760
Prasit!

647
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,400
Prasit.

648
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,600
What are you doing here?

649
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,240
Hi, Wichai.

650
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,640
I'm with my friends.

651
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,400
Goodness.

652
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,560
Do you want to go again?

653
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,280
- Do you?
- Yes, please.

654
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,280
How did you know about this?

655
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,520
Because Prasit and I are close now.

656
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,000
Prasit is such a scaredy-cat.

657
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,120
He goes anywhere by himself.

658
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,400
He wants to have his own friends.

659
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,680
He knows others find him annoying.

660
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,160
He may seem oblivious,

661
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,000
but he's sensitive to people's feelings.

662
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,800
Do you want money to buy snacks?

663
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,600
Yes, please.

664
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,480
<i>When I go somewhere,</i>

665
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,440
people always stare at me.

666
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,200
I don't really mind it,

667
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,040
<i>but I don't want anyone to feel
embarrassed being seen with me.</i>

668
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,960
Prasit knows that his brothers
try to distance themselves from him,

669
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,320
so he wants to have
close friends of his own.

670
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,680
I never knew

671
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,640
that Prasit was so impacted
by what's going on around him.

672
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,360
Everyone is busy making money.

673
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,080
Prasit can't make money,

674
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,960
so people just dismiss him.

675
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,000
That's not true.

676
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,920
That day when he collected
coins at the temple,

677
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
<i>it made him really happy.</i>

678
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,720
<i>That was the first time
he earned his own money.</i>

679
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,720
He feels things just like we do.

680
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,080
He just can't put his feelings into words.

681
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,800
His heart is much more
sensitive than ours.

682
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,960
You too, Wichai.

683
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,840
What makes you so kindhearted?

684
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,000
You're unlike any man
I've ever met before.

685
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,160
If that's the secret you've kept from me,

686
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,200
can you give me a chance and let me in?

687
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,480
Anong.

688
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,480
I got you cotton candy.

689
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,240
Do not wander off
by yourself like this again.

690
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,280
Well, I didn't want
to ruin the mood for you.

691
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,680
I've never once walked out on you.

692
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,440
You're the one who keeps leaving me.

693
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,960
You'll leave me eventually
when you have a boyfriend.

694
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,760
No way.

695
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,600
I'll only date a man that you approve of.

696
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,520
Do you mean it?

697
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,320
You can ride the Ferris wheel
with another person.

698
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,200
Who will it be?

699
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,080
Take your pick.

700
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,680
And once you're on the Ferris wheel

701
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,680
and you get to the top close to the stars,

702
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,200
you should do this.

703
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,440
Then you make a wish

704
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,160
that you'll always be with that person.

705
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,840
No way. I don't dare do that.

706
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,680
Wichai taught me a trick.

707
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,880
If you're too scared to choose,

708
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,560
let the clock decide for you.

709
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,480
If the second hand points to the right,

710
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,440
it means you choose Chut.

711
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,640
But if it points to the left,

712
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,160
it means you choose Wichai.

713
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,840
Ride the Ferris wheel with me.

714
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,120
Come on, Anong. Let's go.

715
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,760
Master!

716
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,080
Master, something bad has happened.

717
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,760
It's your brother-in-law.

718
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,600
No.

719
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,760
Wichai.

720
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,360
What happened?

721
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,440
Where did your brother go?

722
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,920
My brother-in-law just passed away

723
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,280
so Wichai had to go.

724
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,840
<i>Wichai had to deal with death
since he was little.</i>

725
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,880
When our dad died,
he was the only one who didn't cry.

726
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,640
You can rest now.

727
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,880
Don't worry about anything.

728
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,560
I got it from here.

729
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
I'll take good care of everyone.

730
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,480
<i>People say that</i>

731
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,040
<i>if you wish to bring someone
back from the dead,</i>

732
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,120
<i>it means you still have regrets.</i>

733
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,240
Just let him go.

734
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,680
<i>Wichai was at peace</i>

735
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,520
<i>because he already made the most
out of the time he had with our dad.</i>

736
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,400
Will the villagers be able to get the moon

737
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,160
out of the pond?

738
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,720
Can we wake Dad up to finish the story?

739
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,000
The villagers got the moon
out of the pond.

740
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,680
But in the morning,

741
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,320
the moon was gone.

742
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,640
That's because it was just a reflection.

743
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,680
It's the same with life.

744
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,120
We all have to go when the time comes.

745
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,480
I'm having so much fun, Anong.

746
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,760
Let's come here again.

747
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,400
I'm sorry. What's wrong?

748
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,280
You can tell me.

749
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,360
This is the first time

750
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,720
that I'm crying for someone else's sorrow.

751
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,760
Can we be this affected
by other people's sadness?

752
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,760
I've never realized

753
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,200
that one person

754
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,440
can have the power

755
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,920
to make you laugh and cry because of them.

756
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,040
This is Anong.

757
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,560
- Chut's friend.
- Your mom is so protective of you.

758
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,880
I might end up with Wichai instead of you.

759
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,360
You're not Wichai's type at all.

760
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,600
You have no chance with him.

761
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,360
I thought you meant me well.

762
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,040
So this is the real reason
why you're doing this.

763
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,760
Wichai secretly took your photo.

764
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,920
He wanted you to have it.

765
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,720
I'd like to invite
a special guest to join us.

766
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,040
I met him on a ship to England.

767
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,040
It's probably that man

768
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,040
that she's inviting to her birthday party.

769
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,760
Which man?

770
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,640
This new guy must be special.

771
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,920
Anong is falling head over heels for him.

772
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,280
Let's see

773
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,120
how you're going to get rid of a good man.

774
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,280
