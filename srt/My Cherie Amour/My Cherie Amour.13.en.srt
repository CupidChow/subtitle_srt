00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
<i>Wichai isn't home.
He's in Trang right now.</i>

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,400
<i>A new court officer
just moved in next door.</i>

4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>I'm here to give you
my answer like I promised.</i>

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,440
<i>In Western cultures,
people don't just date each other.</i>

6
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,480
They actually try living together
before they get married.

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,680
<i>If you want to stay here,</i>

8
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,480
<i>your presence here
should serve some kind of purpose.</i>

9
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,880
<i>If you can get the people here</i>

10
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>to give you five compliments
with the word "very" in them,</i>

11
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,560
then I'll believe
that you truly belong here.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
If you receive five compliments
like that, we'll get married.

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,120
I've always been flirty,

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,560
but this is the first time
that you got jealous.

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
It finally worked.

16
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,840
Considering the nature
of the defendant's action,

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,200
I therefore sentence him
to three years of imprisonment.

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>Thank you so much.
Do you have other sweets?</i>

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,000
No one has lived here in a long time,
so the wires are damp.

20
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
The house needs to be rewired.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,640
Can you help take care of it?

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,000
Sure. I'll get it done as soon as I can.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Hello, Mrs. Warathabut.

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,880
I have to go now.
I'll be back to rewire the house.

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,000
I think I'd better get used
to being called Mrs. Warathabut.

26
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,400
For your own safety,

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,280
I guess I'll allow it.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
But you can stay with me only temporarily.

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
You'll have to move back here

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
once the house is rewired.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,240
But if I can get
five compliments from people,

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,240
you'll let me live with you
as your wife, right?

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm surprised you're still confident

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,480
after your failures today.

35
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
Are you thinking
naughty thoughts about me?

36
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,360
Of course not.

37
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
I wouldn't mind if you do.

38
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,600
You've never had those thoughts about me,

39
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,600
yet you have no problem
fantasizing about other women.

40
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,840
Well…

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
Anong.

42
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Why do you have this magazine?

43
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
About that…

44
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
It's Luang Sak.

45
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,560
He gave it to me before I came here.

46
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,240
I didn't buy it myself.

47
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,080
Luang Sak gave it to me as a gift.

48
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,520
He shoved it in my bag.

49
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll throw it away.

50
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
Wichai.

51
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,720
You don't have to throw it away.

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm glad to know

53
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,960
that you still have needs.

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,120
Give me that.
You shouldn't be looking at it.

55
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,720
Why do you want it?
You said you didn't like it.

56
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,480
Don't let me find out
you have fantasies about other women.

57
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,360
Fantasizing about someone else
also counts as cheating.

58
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Have you never seen
a woman putting makeup on?

59
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,560
I've never seen anyone
get all glammed up to go to the court.

60
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm pretty, right?

61
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Do I look too pretty?

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,320
Aren't I very pretty, Wichai?

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,640
It's not going to work.

64
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't trick me into complimenting you.

65
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
It's not going to happen.

66
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,600
I'll probably end up as a spinster since
you're too stubborn to admit you love me.

67
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,320
But that's all right.

68
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
If you're not ready for us to be together,

69
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,280
can you at least take me
to see a movie tonight?

70
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,160
I heard there will be
an open-air movie screening tonight.

71
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Can we go together after work?

72
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
Sure.

73
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,000
I asked Chaeng to come meet me here.

74
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,880
She still has to work
though she's an old lady.

75
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,560
I heard that she lives
in this neighborhood.

76
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,920
So I asked her to come in case
we could hire her to do some work.

77
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,080
Hello, Chaeng.

78
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Hello.

79
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,640
- Have you waited long?
- Not at all.

80
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
Hey.

81
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,400
Wait a minute.

82
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,440
Who is that man?

83
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
It's me.

84
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
Are you doing well?

85
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,720
Right. You're the judge.
That's why you look familiar.

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,440
Hello.

87
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
Do you know this woman?

88
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,960
I was the judge
who presided over her case.

89
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,880
I didn't know that you're the wife

90
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,680
of the judge who helped me.

91
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,840
Well, then.

92
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Why don't you let me come cook for you?

93
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,840
Just let me know

94
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,560
when you two want to have a meal

95
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,760
so I can prepare food for you.

96
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,840
I'll let you and Chaeng talk.

97
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,040
All right.

98
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,520
So what do you want to eat?
I can cook anything for you.

99
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
Well…

100
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm fine with anything.

101
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,440
Let me go ask Wichai what he wants to eat.

102
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,720
You said Chaeng has a son.

103
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,960
So why isn't he providing for her?

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,800
Or is he not here to take care of her

105
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,960
because he got sent to prison

106
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,640
for committing a crime?

107
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,240
Chaeng's son got injured and was crippled.

108
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,360
Many years ago,
Chaeng filed a case against the man

109
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
who injured her son.

110
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
That man was Boi.

111
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,960
<i>Five years ago,</i>

112
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
<i>Boi was a boxer around here.</i>

113
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,280
Boi was sentenced to prison

114
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
for attempted murder.

115
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,840
<i>Chaeng's son, Kan,</i>

116
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
<i>was Boi's major rival.</i>

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,680
<i>During their boxing match,</i>

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
<i>Boi knocked Kan unconscious.</i>

119
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,960
<i>Since then,</i>

120
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
<i>Kan hasn't woken up.</i>

121
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
<i>He remains unconscious
due to brain injuries.</i>

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,720
Kan.

123
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,680
Your nails are getting too long.

124
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,920
Let me clip them for you.

125
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,800
<i>So Chaeng filed a complaint against Boi</i>

126
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,680
for attempted murder.

127
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,920
She thought Boi intended to kill Kan
who was his rival.

128
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,160
Boi went to prison because of this?

129
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,320
<i>He was charged with reckless
endangerment of another person.</i>

130
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
The plaintiff filed a complaint
against the defendant

131
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,160
for attempted murder.

132
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,800
But it was found that
the defendant and the plaintiff's son

133
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,600
both willingly participated
in the boxing match on that day.

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,800
<i>Boi spent three years in prison.</i>

135
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
<i>After he was released,</i>

136
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,160
I took him in to live with me.

137
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
Boi and Chaeng haven't seen each other

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,440
since what happened.

139
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
Did he kill a man?

140
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,760
No wonder he seems so ruthless.

141
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,720
Boi didn't kill anyone.

142
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm telling you this

143
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,160
because I'm afraid that
Chaeng may not know Boi is here.

144
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,640
I don't know how she will react.

145
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,720
And I don't know whether her family

146
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,760
has forgiven Boi yet.

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,880
What are you doing?

148
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,720
What will you do with that knife? Stop!

149
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,560
Hey! Stop right there! Stop! I said stop!

150
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,520
Stop!

151
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
If you're here to talk about Boi,

152
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,160
just get out of here.

153
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,160
It looks like Chaeng will never
forgive Boi for what happened.

154
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
Since the incident,

155
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
Boi has been blaming himself.

156
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
He didn't even defend himself in court.

157
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
He confessed to killing Kan

158
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,440
when Kan wasn't even dead.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,040
I promise to spend the rest of my life

160
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,600
trying to make it up to Kan.

161
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,320
I will not abandon him.

162
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
I'd give up my life for him if I could.

163
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,360
<i>After Boi went to prison,</i>

164
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,720
<i>he had no one left.</i>

165
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,760
<i>His family abandoned him.</i>

166
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,640
Once he was released,

167
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,680
Boi worked hard to support Kan
and his family as he promised.

168
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,120
So I took him in to live with me.

169
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,640
Every month,

170
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,120
Boi would send money to Kan.

171
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,160
- Hey.
- Where's my money?

172
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,520
Did you steal my money?

173
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,560
Where's the money I sent Kan?

174
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,160
I don't know.

175
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Why is Kan in that state?

176
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
Tell me the truth.

177
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,720
Boi has kept all of his promises.

178
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,840
He thinks that he owes Kan his life.

179
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,600
It's like he's been punishing himself
for what he did.

180
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,080
<i>He barely does anything for himself.</i>

181
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,560
<i>Poor him.</i>

182
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,160
<i>It must be horrible
to live with that guilt.</i>

183
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
People can make mistakes.

184
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,800
The court's duty isn't just
to hand out punishment.

185
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,360
We also have to teach people remorse

186
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,280
and give them a chance
to start over in life.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,760
It's important to give people a chance
to redeem themselves.

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
Aren't you going to tell me?

189
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
I said I don't know!

190
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,760
Tell me the truth.

191
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,640
Hey.

192
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
Tell me or I'll kill you!

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,360
Get out of here, bastard!

194
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,640
Get lost!

195
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,880
Come and help him.

196
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,960
Watch out!

197
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,440
Wichai.

198
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,920
Are you hurt?

199
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,560
He took the money I sent Kan every month.

200
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,400
He never gave Kan the money.

201
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,960
That asshole made me a liar
for these past two years!

202
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,920
Hurting him won't help you
get your money back.

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,240
I couldn't just let him steal from me.

204
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,800
If you get sent to prison for this,

205
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,040
Kan won't be the only one who suffers.

206
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,080
How can we live without you?

207
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
If you want to be someone responsible,

208
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
you can't live a reckless life.

209
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,040
What will happen to Chaeng

210
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,400
if you get sent to prison?

211
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,320
Who will she rely on?

212
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,040
Please try to behave

213
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,760
or they might not let you go home.

214
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,600
We're here together

215
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,360
so we'll all go home together.

216
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Boi, what are you doing here?

217
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
Hey. Why are you here?

218
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,280
Just get out of here.

219
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,760
What are you doing to Kan?
Put him down right now.

220
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,760
I told you to get out.

221
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,600
Boi, listen to me.

222
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,040
I'll kill you
if you hurt my son in any way.

223
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,880
I told you to put him down.
Put him down right now.

224
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Get out of here. Just leave us alone.

225
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
Get out of my house!

226
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,359
I don't want to see your face. Get out.

227
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,800
Get out of my house right now.

228
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,599
I said get out.

229
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,440
Get out of here.

230
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,800
- Get out.
- Chaeng, come on.

231
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
Chaeng.

232
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,359
Please don't be mad at Boi.

233
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,440
He just wants to help.

234
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,640
Did you know he went after the guy
who took your money?

235
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,200
Boi sent you money every month,

236
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,200
but your cousin
took the money for himself.

237
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,640
Boi is trying to keep his promise to you.

238
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,520
He didn't know
that you didn't get the money.

239
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,560
He's here to make it up to you.

240
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
For the past five years,

241
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,960
Boi spent his life
trying to make amends to Kan.

242
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,800
If he could take on Kan's pain instead,

243
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,680
he would've done it already.

244
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,480
It should be me

245
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,320
who's lying there.

246
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,280
I caused trouble for everyone.

247
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
No one wanted this to happen.

248
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,800
This is my fault.

249
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
It's my fault Kan is like this.

250
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,400
<i>The mine was closed during the war.</i>

251
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,720
<i>Kan lost his job,
so I became a rubber tapper</i>

252
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,160
<i>while Kan started boxing for a living.</i>

253
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,640
<i>That day, I woke up feeling dizzy.</i>

254
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,960
<i>So Kan offered to go tap rubber for me.</i>

255
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,160
Goodness.

256
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,760
My gosh!

257
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,520
Mom! Are you all right?

258
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,920
Get up slowly, Mom.

259
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,880
I'm okay. I'm all right.

260
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,920
I'll go tap rubber for you.

261
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,640
You don't have to do that.

262
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,160
You just rest here. I'll get to work.

263
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
Kan, wait.

264
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,920
<i>He forced himself to go boxing.</i>

265
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,040
<i>I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't listen.</i>

266
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,320
<i>He didn't want to miss
his match against Boi.</i>

267
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,720
- Get him!
- Come on!

268
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,520
- That's it!
- Get him!

269
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,520
- Get back in there! Come on!
- You got this, Boi!

270
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Way to go!

271
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
Yes!

272
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Hey, Kan.

273
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,560
Kan, are you okay?

274
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Kan!

275
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,920
Kan!

276
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,360
Kan!

277
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,640
Then that means

278
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Kan was already injured before the fight.

279
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
So what happened was an accident.

280
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
What Boi did
shouldn't be considered as assault.

281
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,800
I just couldn't cope with it.

282
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,160
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

283
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,280
<i>The defendant is exempt from liability</i>

284
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,680
since the fight was for sport.

285
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,400
The defendant had no malicious intent
like the plaintiff had claimed.

286
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,000
The defendant's intention
can't be determined.

287
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,040
But considering the nature
of the defendant's action

288
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
and his opportunity
to not engage in the conduct,

289
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,560
it can be said that the defendant
committed an unreasonably dangerous act.

290
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,800
He will be charged

291
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,800
with reckless endangerment
of another person.

292
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,680
I therefore sentence him
to three years of imprisonment.

293
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,760
<i>I tried to find someone
to blame for what happened.</i>

294
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,200
So I blamed it on…

295
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,040
I blamed it all on Boi.

296
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,640
Does this mean an innocent man
got sent to prison for this?

297
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,040
I was wrong for sending you to prison.

298
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

299
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,760
No one knew that Kan was already injured.

300
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,120
He just happened
to pass out when I kicked him.

301
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,960
My verdict ruined your life.

302
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
Maybe not.

304
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,040
Maybe you've given me
a chance at a new life.

305
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
Three years in prison

306
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,680
is nothing compared to being stuck
in your own body like Kan.

307
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm a much luckier man than him.

308
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,680
In any case,

309
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,440
I still owe you for what I did.

310
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,920
Although Chaeng put the blame on me,

311
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,000
she didn't suffer any less than I did.

312
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,480
She's been punishing herself every day.

313
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
I can't be mad at her.

314
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,360
I understand how you feel.

315
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
It's not easy

316
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,440
to lose someone you love.

317
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,800
I spent forever trying to get over someone

318
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,400
and it wasn't even
a matter of life and death.

319
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
In the beginning,

320
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,560
we tend to be in denial.

321
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,400
Then we become angry
from losing our loved ones

322
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,600
and we try to blame someone
for our suffering.

323
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,680
We usually don't blame ourselves.

324
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,520
We see ourselves as victims
who have been wronged.

325
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
We'll try to find ways
to punish those people

326
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,520
to make them feel hurt just like we do.

327
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,360
But the more we deceive ourselves,

328
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,680
the more miserable
and depressed we become.

329
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,760
It's really difficult

330
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,360
to accept the truth

331
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,400
that we have no one left.

332
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
Chaeng.

333
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
Love is complicated.

334
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,440
It can make us selfish.

335
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,400
I didn't think you would understand.

336
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,080
If I were you,

337
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,320
I would've done the same thing as you.

338
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,680
You're a very good person.

339
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,840
What did you say?

340
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,240
I'm such an evil person,

341
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,640
but you still don't hate me.

342
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,360
You're a very kind-hearted woman.

343
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Thank you.

344
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,080
Did you hear what Chaeng said to me?

345
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
I did.

346
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Those are compliments from the heart.

347
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,680
I feel like I deserve you
a little bit more now.

348
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,360
That's nonsense.

349
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,560
Don't you see that I can also be wrong?

350
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,640
I sent an innocent man to prison.

351
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,080
I made a huge mistake.

352
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,080
Chaeng intentionally withheld
the truth from you.

353
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,800
It wasn't your fault.

354
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm ashamed
for handing someone a prison sentence

355
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,600
when they didn't deserve it
and I just got away with it.

356
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
I was right to quit my job.

357
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,920
From now on, I won't dare
to go around judging people.

358
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,920
You're brave enough
to own up to your mistake.

359
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,680
That's more than what most people do.

360
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,920
You said that the point of punishment
is to teach people remorse.

361
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,120
So you should give yourself
a chance to redeem yourself.

362
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,680
I've rewired the house.

363
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,520
I guarantee the power won't go out again.

364
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,040
If you want to cut the power,

365
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,440
just switch off the breaker.

366
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,400
It will cut power to the whole house.

367
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,760
Feel free to call me
if there are any problems.

368
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,040
All right.

369
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,200
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

370
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
Thank you for your help.

371
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,920
See you later.

372
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,600
I guess I'll have to move back now, right?

373
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,160
Actually,

374
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,440
the electrician isn't done
rewiring the house.

375
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,680
You're right.

376
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,640
Just stay with me for now.

377
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
You can move back here
once the house is rewired.

378
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,640
Tell the electrician there's no rush.

379
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,040
He can take all the time he needs.

380
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,320
<i>I'm thinking that</i>

381
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,520
I'll give my per diem to Chaeng.

382
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
This will give her
an incentive to work hard.

383
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,920
She can use this money
to take care of her family.

384
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,320
You're very sweet.

385
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,240
What did you say?

386
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,440
You heard me right.

387
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
I said that you're very sweet.

388
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,560
Why did you compliment me?

389
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,920
You can see someone's true colors

390
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,840
by looking at how they treat people
who are of no benefit to them.

391
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,160
You want to give Chaeng money
to help lessen Boi's burden, right?

392
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,200
You deserve compliments
when you do nice things

393
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,680
without expecting anything in return.

394
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,960
Of course.

395
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,240
I've always been sweet.
You just didn't see it.

396
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,040
Maybe that's another thing
I was wrong about.

397
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,240
It's okay.

398
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,840
I forgive you.

399
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,680
I received two compliments in one day.

400
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,800
It looks like I'll get to be your bride
sooner than I thought.

401
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,080
<i>Wichai.</i>

402
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,320
Why did you let yourself get hurt for me?

403
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,840
What if it makes your condition worse?

404
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,160
I have no luck when it comes to love.

405
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,960
We only get to be together
when I'm out of work.

406
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,800
And since I'm sick,

407
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
I can barely take care of you.

408
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Your job and your strength aren't
what made me attracted to you.

409
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,920
You should be with someone
who's better than me.

410
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,360
I'm not even strong enough
to take you to see a movie.

411
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
You're right.

412
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,840
How come things never seem
to go as planned when I'm with you?

413
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,000
How about this?

414
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,560
Let's make our own movie screen
and watch a movie here.

415
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,320
My family was poor when I was a kid.

416
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,520
My mom didn't have money for me
to take my siblings to the movies.

417
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,480
So we made a movie screen
to watch movies at home.

418
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,920
Are you pulling my leg right now?

419
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,920
Hold this and pull it apart with me.

420
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,080
Pull.

421
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,080
See?

422
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
You can be the lead actress.

423
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,960
We'll take turns
being the actor and the viewer.

424
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,400
This is a nice movie.

425
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,720
I really like

426
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,720
the lead actor.

427
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,360
If you want to be with me,

428
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,640
you'll have to live
a simple and modest life.

429
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,920
Can you do that?

430
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,000
You never fail to make me smile.

431
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,240
I feel like I am
the luckiest girl in the world.

432
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,240
I can even go through the screen.

433
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,680
Like this.

434
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,159
Lady, how dare you ask me
to give you things for free?

435
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,440
I was just asking.

436
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,400
Don't make a big deal out of it.

437
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,960
I have money, okay?

438
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,960
Are you planning to take
that money to the grave with you?

439
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,600
Just move out if you're so upset.

440
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,960
- Get out of my building!
- Please forgive my mother.

441
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,920
- Just get out of here!
- Mom, let's go.

442
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,199
- I'm sorry.
- You greedy bitch!

443
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,159
I hate your crappy building.

444
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,320
Just listen to him.

445
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,159
Stay away my shop!
You're not welcome here!

446
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,480
Mom.

447
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,840
Why would you ask him
to give you free stuff?

448
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,080
I thought he'd be
a bit generous to his landlady.

449
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,880
I don't get people these days.

450
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,520
They're so petty.

451
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,040
What are you doing here, anyway?

452
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,239
I'm here to collect rent from him.
At least he gave me the money.

453
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm glad I ran into you.
You can drive me home.

454
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,760
- Let's go.
- Mom, wait.

455
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
Do you mean right now?

456
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,360
I can find my own way back.

457
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,040
It's good to know that
I can't even depend on my own son.

458
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,640
I guess I'm no longer of use to you
now that you've moved out.

459
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
Chantorn.

460
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,080
I need to drive my mom home.

461
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,600
Just go.

462
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,720
I can find another ride home.

463
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,080
No way. I won't let you do that.

464
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,960
People already think badly of me
that my wife still has to work.

465
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,080
I want to come pick you up every day
so people can't say

466
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,600
that I don't take care of you.

467
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Your mom will be upset if you don't
make time to take care of her.

468
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,560
That's why I want to invite you
to come have dinner at her house.

469
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,960
Chut.

470
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,520
I actually meant to tell you
that I have to work overtime today.

471
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,920
You should take your mom home.

472
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,840
Don't worry about me.

473
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,560
I'll see you at home.

474
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,080
Don't leave your mom waiting.

475
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Just go.

476
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,400
What took you so long?

477
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,760
What are you doing?

478
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,360
I'm just studying some legal terms.

479
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,400
Why didn't you ask me for help?

480
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm just studying them for work.
It's no big deal.

481
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
You know what?

482
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,000
Some of those terms
can be quite confusing.

483
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,640
Come on. Let me help you study.

484
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,600
It's really okay.

485
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,920
Let me help.

486
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,600
No wonder why you looked so engrossed.

487
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,880
I just wanted to know

488
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,920
what men fantasize about.

489
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,520
Maybe you can help
shed light on the matter for me.

490
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,880
- Hey.
- The power is back.

491
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Then let's sleep here tonight.

492
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,960
Wait.

493
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,280
We can't let those two be by themselves.

494
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,200
Let's give them some alone time.

495
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,160
I bet they're sick of having us around.

496
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,600
Theft is defined as

497
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,960
the unlawful taking or exercising control
over another person's property.

498
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,280
A robbery means

499
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,000
stealing from someone by using
physical force, weapon, or threat.

500
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,600
Please continue.

501
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,480
A gang-robbery

502
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,720
is a kind of robbery

503
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,440
where three or more persons
participate in the act.

504
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,840
It's different from a robbery.

505
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,880
A robbery means

506
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,200
stealing from someone
by using physical force,

507
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,920
weapon, or threat.

508
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,880
Good night.

509
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,240
What you're doing
can be considered deception.

510
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,360
So what's my punishment? Will I get fined?

511
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,600
Why do you ask?

512
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,640
If the victim is aware of being deceived,

513
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,040
the act can't be considered deception.

514
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,920
Don't be cocky when you don't know
what you're talking about.

515
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
What? I'm a quick learner, you know?

516
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,560
Earlier, you were teaching me
the definitions of theft and rubbery.

517
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,400
Just go to sleep.

518
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,880
PRA ATTHAKADEE WICHAI

519
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,480
I'm ashamed
for handing someone a prison sentence

520
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,120
when they didn't deserve it
and I just got away with it.

521
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,360
I was right to quit my job.

522
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,680
From now on, I won't dare
to go around judging people.

523
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,360
Here you go.

524
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,720
Are you a lawyer?

525
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,920
Yes.

526
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
I need your help.

527
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,200
I don't know what else to do.
You're the only one who can help me.

528
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,080
I was on my boat that day.

529
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,560
A metal pipe fell on me from the bridge.

530
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,040
My boat capsized and I almost died.

531
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,760
I tried to get the municipality
to take responsibility,

532
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,120
but the court said the government

533
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,960
isn't the one responsible.

534
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,120
They said I have to sort this out
with the contractor of the bridge.

535
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,360
We want to file a complaint against him,

536
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,720
but no lawyers would represent us.

537
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,240
It's because everyone knows
that the contractor

538
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,440
is the mayor's son-in-law.

539
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,120
He'll never be prosecuted
even if we go to court with him.

540
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,520
Everyone is equal in the court of law.

541
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,040
The justice system was created
to provide everyone justice.

542
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,800
If you truly believe that,
can you help represent me?

543
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,920
The people here are too afraid
to go against these people.

544
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,160
More people will be hurt as time goes on.

545
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,000
Someone will die if you don't stop them.

546
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,120
He always forgets
to eat or rest when he works.

547
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
That's why he fell ill last time.

548
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,400
What are you doing?

549
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm hemming a gown.

550
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,560
Do you want to give it a try?

551
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,080
I can tell you don't know how to do it.

552
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,240
You're only good at causing trouble.

553
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,000
If Wichai didn't have
to run away from you,

554
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,040
he wouldn't have to be here
working as a lawyer.

555
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,040
He used to be a respectable judge.

556
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,440
But he threw his future away
all because of a girl.

557
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,360
TRANG PROVINCIAL COURT

558
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,840
Hey.

559
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,520
I got called here
to be the interpreter on your case.

560
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,160
The court asked you to come
because there's a witness from Penang.

561
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,520
Are you nervous?

562
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,800
I am.

563
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,160
I'm still not familiar
with the court rules and procedures.

564
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,520
We're lucky to have you here to help us.

565
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,280
The government could use
a competent woman like you.

566
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,320
I can only speak English.

567
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,400
I didn't get to use any of the skills
or the knowledge I've learned.

568
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,080
The person that our country needs
is a capable man like you.

569
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,440
We'll soon find out
who's most needed in this case.

570
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,720
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth, the whole truth,

571
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,240
and nothing but the truth?

572
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,160
There he is. That's Thian-chai.

573
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,440
That day,

574
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,200
you got into an accident
while going under the bridge.

575
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,800
What do you recall about the incident?

576
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,960
I was on a boat with my friend.

577
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,640
We were on our way home.

578
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,920
Something fell from the bridge
which caused my boat to capsize

579
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,680
and I almost drowned.

580
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,560
Do you remember
what it was that fell on you?

581
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,680
I didn't remember at first
because I was in shock.

582
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,360
I found out later that it was

583
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,360
a metal pipe that fell on me
and there was also a worker

584
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,880
who fell off the bridge.

585
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,440
Did the contractor do anything
to help you that day?

586
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,240
No one saw what happened.

587
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,400
If my friend hadn't been there to help me,

588
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,320
I would've died right then and there.

589
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,640
I've never received any compensation.

590
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,640
No further questions, Your Honor.

591
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,240
Were you the technician engineer
at the scene of the incident?

592
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,200
Yes, he was in charge of supervising
the construction that day.

593
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,800
Where were you when the incident occurred?

594
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,480
<i>He walked out to smoke a cigarette
by the canal. He wasn't on the bridge.</i>

595
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,520
How far away were you from the incident?

596
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,560
Did you see everything that happened?

597
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,160
He remembers walking out
to smoke a cigarette.

598
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,080
Something happened
just as he finished smoking.

599
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,720
He could see the incident
from where he was standing.

600
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,520
After the incident took place,

601
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,240
how did you address the situation?

602
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,440
He ordered for the injured man
to be brought up.

603
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,120
So the workers went down
to search for the man

604
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,280
and they finally managed to bring him up.

605
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,560
After that, they sent
the injured man to the hospital.

606
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,600
So you insist on being there at all times

607
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,360
and having played a role
in rescuing the injured man?

608
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,840
The witness insists that he was there.

609
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,240
No further questions.

610
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,160
The plaintiff's attorney
may cross-examine the witness.

611
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,640
Do you remember
what time the incident occurred?

612
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,240
Can you remember

613
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,840
what brand of cigarettes
you smoked that day?

614
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,000
Objection.

615
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,920
That's irrelevant to the case.

616
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Please ask only the questions

617
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,920
that are related to the matter at hand.

618
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,640
The witness claimed that
he went to smoke a cigarette.

619
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,240
The brand of cigarettes
he smoked can determine

620
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,000
how far he had walked off
before he finished smoking

621
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,000
and how much he could see
from where he was standing.

622
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,640
Objection overruled.

623
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,720
You may proceed, Counselor.

624
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Do you remember what type of cigarettes

625
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,520
you smoked that day?

626
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,360
The witness isn't sure.

627
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,520
He usually smokes cigarettes
made by the workers.

628
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,360
The length of hand-rolled cigarettes
are longer than store-bought ones.

629
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
It'd take him longer to finish smoking,

630
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,200
so he could be quite far from the bridge.

631
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,720
This means that

632
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,240
the witness may not even see
what happened clearly.

633
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,560
Objection. The plaintiff's attorney
is making a baseless allegation.

634
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,200
The witness's testimony has no weight

635
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,240
since he cannot say exactly
where he was standing.

636
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,080
Can the witness specify
how far he was from the bridge?

637
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,480
The witness believes that

638
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,480
he was about 100 to 200 m
away from the bridge.

639
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,000
Most engineers wouldn't make
such a rough estimation.

640
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,120
Objection. The translation
may not be accurate.

641
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,920
Can you ask the witness to specify
how far he was exactly from the bridge?

642
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,160
He said possibly 150 m.

643
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,680
The word "possibly"

644
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,680
indicates that you're unsure.

645
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,960
Objection.

646
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,240
The interpreter might've misinterpreted

647
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,560
what the witness has said.

648
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,000
I translated his testimony
exactly as he said it.

649
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,880
You're not a professional interpreter.

650
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,280
You made a mistake.

651
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,760
Your translation isn't accurate.

652
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,880
I didn't make a mistake.
That's really what the witness said.

653
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,080
I could understand what he was saying.

654
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,280
Your translation is incorrect.

655
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,960
Your Honor.

656
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,880
I don't believe that
this interpreter is capable enough.

657
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,240
I'd like to have her replaced
with a new interpreter.

658
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,680
I don't find the interpreter's
translation to be problematic

659
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,680
to the point that we need
to adjourn the hearing.

660
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,960
You may proceed, Counselor.

661
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,640
It's okay.

662
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,160
You did a good job in there.

663
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,640
I don't understand what I did wrong.

664
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,320
Why must that lawyer nitpick me like that?

665
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,480
They were just looking for an out.

666
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,880
Their witness went off-script.

667
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,120
So they tried to get the judge
to believe their version of the story.

668
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,200
By saying I mistranslated
the witness's testimony?

669
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,840
We all could see that
they were trying to twist the truth.

670
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,480
You handled things very well.

671
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,360
Wait a minute.

672
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,360
Did you just compliment me?

673
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,080
You were able
to keep your emotions in check

674
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,040
and you carried yourself really well.

675
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,320
Hold on. You've given me
three compliments already.

676
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,320
Do you realize that?

677
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,680
Of course.

678
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,080
You've earned those compliments.

679
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,440
Now go do your job
and try to keep your composure.

680
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,480
Try to be as impartial as you can.

681
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,440
Let me be the one to expose their lies.

682
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,040
All right.

683
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,720
I won't get angry even if they insult me.

684
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,360
The more they try to make a scene,

685
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,920
the more people will see
their true colors.

686
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,280
If the plaintiff's attorney
has no more questions for the witness,

687
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,600
does the defense have anything to add?

688
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,120
Before I continue with the examination,

689
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,240
I'd like to discuss
the interpreter's qualifications.

690
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,600
I suspect that

691
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,160
she may be close with someone
on the plaintiff's side,

692
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,160
which could lead her to be biased

693
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,800
when she provides
translation of the testimonies.

694
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,520
Do you know any of the people
involved in this case?

695
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,280
I know

696
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,840
Pra Atthakadee Wichai,

697
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,440
who's the plaintiff's attorney.

698
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,480
What's the nature
of your relationship with him?

699
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,320
We…

700
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,240
She's the woman I'm dating.

701
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,880
You should've informed
the court beforehand

702
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,640
about your personal relationship with her.

703
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,120
I apologize for not informing you
about our relationship.

704
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,760
If the interpreter has

705
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,280
a conflict of interest
related to the case,

706
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,560
the proper thing for her to do
is to drop out of the case.

707
