00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Wichai secretly took your photo.

3
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,200
He wanted you to have these.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,400
<i>Did you give her the photos?</i>

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,600
You're into her, right?

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
Who said I'm into her?

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,400
If you want Anong
to be your sister-in-law,

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,560
you must help me
get this man out of her life.

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,960
I'd like to invite
a special guest to join us.

10
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,320
I met him on a ship to England.

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,120
Anong is falling head over heels for him.

12
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
How did you get in there?

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,080
I didn't mean to be in here.

14
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,840
I stand by what I said.

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,880
If you meet a better guy than Chut,

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
I won't get in your way.

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,040
You'll find out soon enough

18
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,880
who that man is.

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,920
Once you know who he is,

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,320
<i>I hope you'll help me get my happy ending.</i>

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
A GUIDEBOOK ABOUT ANONG

22
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,960
Warathabut's residence.

23
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,440
You told me Wichai's wife died
when she was young.

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,400
When did she pass away?

25
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,760
I think she passed away eight years ago.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>I remember it was before New Year's Day.</i>

27
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You see.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,440
I found a letter in one of the books.

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,760
<i>In that letter,</i>

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,440
it seemed like she was saying goodbye.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,200
I also found letters that Soon wrote
to Wichai, but she didn't post them.

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,720
<i>All the letters had stamps on them,</i>

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
<i>but they weren't postmarked.</i>

34
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,520
<i>That means those letters weren't posted.</i>

35
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,840
And all of them were sealed,
so no one had read them.

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,360
<i>I found them all piled up</i>

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,360
in the storage room.

38
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Something feels off about this.

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,840
There must've been a problem.

40
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>I'm sorry to bother you,
but I can't live like this anymore.</i>

41
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,640
<i>Every time I write to ask you
if I can move there with you,</i>

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,720
<i>I've never got a clear answer from you.</i>

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,320
<i>You must be afraid
that it would cause a scandal.</i>

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,040
<i>Maybe you think me being there
will hurt your reputation</i>

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,880
<i>or that your career
will be ruined because of me.</i>

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
<i>If I just disappeared,</i>

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,520
<i>everyone's life would be better.</i>

48
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,520
<i>Even now, I already feel
like I'm invisible.</i>

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,760
<i>Everyone must be tired</i>

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,480
<i>of having me around.</i>

51
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,960
<i>The person who gives love
is the one who must bear its weight,</i>

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
<i>not the person who receives it.</i>

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,360
<i>I know I shouldn't be asking
for your sympathy.</i>

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Hey. Boi.

55
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
What happened?

56
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,520
- Boi passed out. Boi.
- Goodness.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Boi.

58
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,400
Where is she?

59
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,200
Maybe she decided to run away.

60
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,680
Do you think she ran away
to be with Wichai?

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,960
See if her clothes are in the closet.

62
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,480
- My gosh!
- My gosh!

63
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,640
What should we do?

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
She's dead!

65
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
Soon didn't die of illness.

66
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,480
And these unposted letters
were the reason she hung herself, right?

67
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,800
You made sure
Wichai didn't get her letters.

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Does Wichai know about this?

69
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
She was being overly clingy.

70
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,160
He didn't love her.
He shouldn't have to put up with her.

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,640
But you arranged for him to marry her.

72
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Why would you try to keep them apart?

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
Hey.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,520
She chose to hurt herself
to get Wichai to come back to her.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,960
She did it to herself.

76
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,920
No one forced her to do it.

77
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
You only care about your sons.

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,160
You never sympathize with other women.

79
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,680
My mother-in-law despised me

80
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,440
just like how you loathed
your daughter-in-law.

81
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
I shouldn't have brought the subject up.

82
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
I didn't realize

83
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,280
that Wichai's marriage ended so horribly.

84
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,200
This is why
Wichai is afraid to fall in love again.

85
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I wonder if he'll blame himself for this
until he dies.

86
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,200
Wichai is a good guy.

87
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,960
He deserves to have a happy marriage.

88
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,240
I want him to get his happy ending.

89
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
Go prepare dinner.

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,920
Would you like to have dinner now?

91
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm not hungry.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,440
Please tell my brothers to eat without me.

93
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,560
I'll let Mr. Wichai know then.

94
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,560
Wichai?

95
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,480
Is Wichai here?

96
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,120
The postcard didn't reach the man.

97
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,880
Anong couldn't find him,

98
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,799
but she still insists
that he'll come to the party.

99
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
PRAPAT LEFT, NOT HERE

100
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,799
I told her there's no one
with this name in Penang.

101
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
Then why did she have to lie?

102
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
Why lie about this man?

103
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,760
But this means
he's no longer in competition.

104
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,040
Have you been here long?

105
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,000
I just got off work.

106
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,240
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

107
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,040
I asked to meet with Sompong today
to call off our deal about Chut.

108
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,480
Like I said,

109
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,640
I'll let you decide for yourself
who you want to be with.

110
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
So in your opinion,

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,120
there's no one who is better than Chut?

112
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm not really an expert
at this love stuff.

113
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
You could say that

114
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,640
I got roped into doing this
because of what I do for a living.

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,760
You're a qualified judge
who can decide people's fate.

116
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,080
Maybe you're a better guy
than Chut will ever be.

117
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,520
If you knew me well enough,

118
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,720
you wouldn't say that.

119
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,680
You think way too low of yourself

120
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,880
and I know the reason.

121
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,880
In your eyes,

122
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,120
do you think I'm good enough for you?

123
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Considering my family's history,

124
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,720
you're too good to be marrying
into the Warathabut family.

125
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
So I'm only good enough
to be your sister-in-law?

126
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,440
Am I good enough to be more than that?

127
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
When people fall in love
for the first time,

128
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,440
they often assume that
that love will be their last.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,040
But when they find a new love,

130
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
it often makes them feel like

131
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,480
they're falling in love
for the first time.

132
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Why don't you give love another chance

133
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
and start over with someone new?

134
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,920
Who knows?

135
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,560
Maybe this person
will really be your first love.

136
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Did someone tell you something about me?

137
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,640
You're a widower, but that doesn't
make you an expert on relationships.

138
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,640
You're out of your depth
when it comes to women.

139
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,840
So why not let a single girl like me
give you a few tips?

140
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,040
But after that,

141
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
don't you flirt around with other girls.

142
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,600
You must let me choose a girl for you.

143
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,160
Here.

144
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,760
It seems you already know

145
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,080
how to be a gentleman.

146
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,080
A few months ago,

147
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,840
you were so cold and distant to me.

148
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,040
You didn't let me see
this side of you at all.

149
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,560
It's Wichai. He is Anong's soulmate.

150
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Anong might be interested in him.

151
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,000
That doesn't mean she's in love with him.

152
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,040
Wichai is the best guy
to be our brother-in-law.

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,480
Let me tell you something.

154
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,640
Wichai will never put anyone
before his family.

155
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
He will never steal

156
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,840
his own brother's lover.

157
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
What if he didn't steal her?

158
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
What if Anong chose him?

159
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,520
On the 11th of this month,

160
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,080
you must come to my birthday party.

161
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,880
You should write it down
so you don't forget.

162
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,120
I'll write it down for you.

163
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,600
Don't show up on the wrong date.

164
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
"August 11th."

165
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,520
"Anong's birthday."

166
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,680
Don't forget to bring a present.

167
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Don't forget to buy me a present.

168
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,320
BUY PRESENT

169
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,080
I wrote it all down for you. Don't forget.

170
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
We need music

171
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,040
for the party.

172
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
I'll go pick the songs right now.

173
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,400
Wait, Prasit.

174
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,720
I want to help you pick.
I want slow songs.

175
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,600
- No way.
- Calm down, you two.

176
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
The first one there gets to pick first.

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,280
Anong said that

178
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,600
she will introduce
her future husband to us at the party.

179
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,160
That's what I want to talk to you about.

180
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,960
You can stop pushing Anong
to be with Chut.

181
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,640
You should let Anong decide.

182
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Then I suppose you won't mind

183
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
if I find another guy for her.

184
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,640
If I can't find Anong a man
who can make her this happy,

185
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,120
I'll feel so guilty as her brother.

186
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,200
A happy family is the last thing
I can give to my sister.

187
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,720
You're the older brother.

188
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,640
You would want the same thing
for your brother, right?

189
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,160
No matter how much dowry we get,

190
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,840
it's nothing compared to all the love
and pampering we've given her.

191
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,079
If Anong had to live
a hard life after marriage,

192
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,960
it would be hard for me to accept.

193
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,800
Here.

194
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,880
This is the only asset Dad had left.

195
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,040
Can you build a house
for your family there?

196
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,920
You're giving me this land?

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,280
But you have to pay
for the construction yourself.

198
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,800
Mom probably won't help you pay the dowry.

199
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
I can help pay for you first.

200
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,120
But you must pay me back.

201
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,160
So you'll ask Anong
for her hand in marriage for me?

202
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
Thank you, Wichai.

203
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Hey, I'm not done talking.

204
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,920
For the engagement ring,

205
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
you must get Mom to give you her ring
if you can't afford one.

206
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,240
The rest is up to you.

207
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Gosh.

208
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
Isn't it beautiful?

209
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Nid.

210
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,200
Nid, come here.

211
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,000
Choy.

212
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,800
Hey, Nid.

213
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,280
- Are you here to shop?
- Come here.

214
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm here about the job you mentioned.

215
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,720
No problem. When would you like to start?

216
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,480
Well, I'm not actually looking for work.

217
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
I don't have a degree
or any qualifications.

218
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,080
I'm here to help someone find work.

219
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,360
This is Chantorn, my husband's sister.

220
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
She's looking for a job.

221
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,280
I see.

222
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
You were a jewelry salesperson?

223
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,400
That's right.

224
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,840
That was my job before I quit
to take care of Samarn.

225
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,480
I see you have great taste.

226
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,040
Our department carries
the perfume that you're wearing.

227
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,800
I'll hire you as a salesperson.

228
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,560
We'll discuss your pay

229
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
once I see your performance.

230
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Since you'll be working here,

231
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
let me explain
how things work around here.

232
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,120
I have a test for you.

233
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,160
Do whatever you can

234
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,920
to make that guy
buy something from our store.

235
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
Do you think you can do it?

236
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,800
We'll have a competition.

237
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,120
Let's see who can get
more money out of Wichai.

238
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,960
It will prove who is better
at reading a customer's mind.

239
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,600
Wichai always thinks of others
before himself.

240
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
If you want his money,

241
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,040
you must get him
to buy something for someone else.

242
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,600
Let's see if you're right.

243
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,560
Hello, Wichai.

244
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm surprised to see you here.

245
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,200
I asked Wichai to come pick us up.

246
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,840
Hey.

247
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,040
What happened to your hand, Choy?

248
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,200
I sprained my wrist

249
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,760
from using the pan at home.

250
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
Maybe the pan you have
is too heavy for you.

251
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,720
If you cook with it every day,
why not buy a pan set?

252
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
You'll have a variety of pans
to choose from.

253
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,280
You can buy it if you need it.

254
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,640
Right. I guarantee it will be
a worthwhile investment.

255
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,840
It's okay.

256
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,080
It's not that necessary.

257
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,840
Just buy it.

258
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Come on.

259
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,120
Wichai.

260
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
What's that stain on your hand?

261
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Looks like the ink you use to write
takes a while to dry on paper.

262
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
So your hand is all dirty.

263
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
You know,

264
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,080
our store carries fountain pens
that are much easier to write with.

265
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,800
Would you like one?

266
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,840
That's a good idea.

267
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,080
It looks bad to have ink-stained hands.

268
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,680
It writes very smoothly

269
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,360
and the ink also dries
much faster on paper.

270
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,880
You're right.

271
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
I'll take it.

272
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,640
Okay.

273
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,960
I'll wrap it up for you.

274
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
Hey.

275
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,320
What did you tell Anong to make her think

276
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,840
that she can put her fridge in my house?

277
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,200
She's giving that fridge to Choy.

278
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,800
You can't let her
throw money at you like this.

279
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
She must think
she can buy your love with money.

280
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
She'll soon have her aunt come
to ask for your hand in marriage.

281
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
Speaking of marriage,

282
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,000
where's the ring

283
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,560
that you said you'll give
to your daughter-in-law?

284
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,920
Only Sa-Ang will get
to wear my engagement ring.

285
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't even want to spend a day with her,

286
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,040
let alone spend our lives together.

287
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,160
Hey. How can you know that?

288
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,080
You've never spent
that much time with her.

289
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,240
An hour with her is enough
to make me realize I can't stand her.

290
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,360
Listen.

291
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
If you agree to spend one day with her,

292
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,520
I'll give you my engagement ring.

293
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,720
Do you mean it?

294
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
You can't go back on your word.

295
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
If you still feel the same way

296
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
after spending one day with her,

297
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,040
you can give my engagement ring
to whoever you want.

298
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,040
Okay.

299
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Come on, Anong.

300
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Come on in.

301
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Wichai!

302
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Hey.

303
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,880
Are you guys going somewhere?

304
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,240
We have some errands to run.

305
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,920
We almost missed you.

306
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,240
Well, you see.

307
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
Nid wanted to show you something,
so she asked me to bring her here.

308
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,160
I dressed my paper doll to look like you.

309
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
What do you think?

310
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,320
She's so pretty.

311
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,320
She's even prettier than me.

312
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Since it's the weekend,

313
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,680
Nid wants to ask you guys
to spend the day together.

314
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
Sure.

315
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,280
I can play with you all day
after I finish my errands.

316
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,840
I'm so happy you thought of me.

317
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,680
You're very smooth

318
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,960
getting your niece to play Cupid for you.

319
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,440
Well…

320
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,640
Our clothing department has items on sale.

321
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
Feel free to have a look.

322
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Chantorn.

323
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,840
Hello. Welcome to Deco Plaza.

324
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,440
How can I help you today?

325
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,440
I want to buy high heels.

326
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,560
Sure, ma'am. Please come this way.

327
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,080
Whose house is this?

328
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,360
It belonged to a family of aristocrats
before it was foreclosed on.

329
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,600
The children couldn't take care of it,
so they let our bank claim it.

330
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,440
Pong wanted me
to take a look in case I like it.

331
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,040
If I like it, he'll keep it for me.
If not, he'll sell it.

332
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,840
What would you do with a house this big?

333
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,240
I might make this place my home
after I got married.

334
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,680
What do you think?

335
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
How about we try pretending
that we both live here?

336
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,760
Let's pretend that
we've moved in here together.

337
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,440
What do you think? Let's pretend
that this is our house for the day.

338
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
You can just say you want to play house.

339
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,760
I know you don't really want
to see this place.

340
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,960
Come on, Nid. Let's go check upstairs.

341
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
That's not true.

342
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,960
That's not what I'm trying to do.

343
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,120
What's the first thing you do
after you wake up in the morning?

344
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,960
My mom brushes my hair for me.

345
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,240
She does?

346
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,680
Then let's pretend we just woke up
and I'll brush your hair.

347
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
Wichai.

348
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,240
Hurry and come brush my hair for me.

349
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,320
Come on.

350
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,920
What would you like to drink today?

351
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,400
I want a cream soda.

352
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

353
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,200
<i>Usually, I only make drinks
for my brothers.</i>

354
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,240
<i>If you want me to make you a drink,</i>

355
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,160
you'll have to become
a part of my family first.

356
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,720
Goodness. These are pretty.

357
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,360
What's your shoe size, ma'am?

358
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,760
I don't know.

359
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
Why don't you find out?

360
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,760
I thought you were here to help.
Help me find out my shoe size.

361
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,080
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,520
Do you have etiquette books for sale here?

363
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,800
Or maybe lessons for ladies
or something like that.

364
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
Someone here could really use them.

365
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,960
Or if you have some manners for sale,

366
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,600
I'll buy all of them.

367
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,760
Excuse me.

368
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,000
You could use some manners yourself.

369
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,680
Here's the receipt
for the 12 pairs of shoes the lady bought

370
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,720
and one pair for each of her friends.

371
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,240
That's 15 pairs in total.

372
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,400
She said you'll pay for them.

373
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,400
So I got 12 pairs of shoes
and you each got one.

374
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm so tired

375
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,120
of immature women

376
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,320
who can't go anywhere
without their friends.

377
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,600
Here.

378
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,600
So who is that woman?

379
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Why are you here with her?

380
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,840
You don't need to know who she is

381
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,720
since this will probably
be the last time I see her.

382
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,960
- One, two.
- So what do you think?

383
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,760
Do you like the house?

384
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,400
I think it's nice,

385
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,640
but Prasit said
it has the vibe of a haunted house.

386
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,800
He's afraid there might be the ghost

387
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,880
of someone who died in that house.

388
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,600
You're right.

389
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,600
I'm so sorry.

390
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,960
I said that without thinking.

391
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,720
Who told you?

392
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,280
Was it Choy?

393
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,280
I just had a feeling,
but I didn't think I would be right.

394
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,480
"The person who gives love
is the one who must bear its weight,

395
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,360
not the person who receives it."

396
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,000
That phrase really strikes a chord.

397
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,520
How did you know about that?

398
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,040
After I met you,

399
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,080
I've become quite a nosy girl.

400
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,440
You could say I'm observant.

401
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,240
Just like how you secretly read
the guidebook about me.

402
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
That makes us even.

403
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,160
This is why

404
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,880
I shouldn't have poked my nose
in your business from the start.

405
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Am I right?

406
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,560
Just because your marriage failed

407
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,440
doesn't mean you don't know
how to love someone.

408
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,480
Well…

409
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,760
I'm not a very good lover.

410
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,520
Especially since I'm a judge,

411
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,920
I tend to lead with logic and reason
instead of emotions.

412
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,960
Give me the ball.

413
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,080
Hey.

414
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,400
- Watch out.
- Gosh.

415
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,320
I'm sorry.

416
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,000
Don't interrupt them.

417
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,120
Let them have their moment.

418
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,800
Let's go.

419
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,800
Are you okay?

420
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,120
Your heart's beating so fast.

421
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,280
So how can you say
you don't feel any emotions?

422
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,040
"The person who gives love
is the one who bears its weight."

423
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,360
This is what it means.

424
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,960
Wichai.

425
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,680
Wichai.

426
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,480
Where are you going?

427
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,840
Did I say something wrong?

428
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,520
Wichai.

429
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
I meant to tell you several times now,

430
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,520
but you should know this
without me having to tell you.

431
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,280
Tell me what?

432
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,480
You need to watch what you say

433
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
and how you act around men.

434
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,600
Don't get too physical with men

435
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,120
because it will make them think that

436
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
you have feelings for them.

437
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,080
So you think I have feelings for you?

438
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,560
It's because of the way you act.

439
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,800
Well, you seem to like it.

440
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm serious.

441
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,440
So are you saying this

442
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,520
because you care about me?

443
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,960
Let's go.

444
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,520
He's so cute.

445
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
Let's go home.

446
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,360
- Shall we go home?
- Okay.

447
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,680
I got it.

448
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,960
All right. In you go.

449
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,080
I'll close the door now.

450
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,760
He's really cute.

451
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,960
Did you have fun?

452
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,760
Let's come back here again.

453
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,520
<i>One day with her is enough.</i>

454
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,520
No man would want to be with
an undesirable woman like Sa-Ang.

455
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,240
She'll surely end up as a spinster.

456
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
Watch your mouth.

457
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,680
Just take the ring.

458
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,400
I got the ring.

459
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm now one step closer to my dream.

460
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,760
What's this?

461
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,920
A house for you and Anong.

462
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,920
I asked Luang Sak to design

463
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,600
a few houses that could
be built on that piece of land.

464
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,880
Let's focus
on Anong's birthday party first.

465
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,720
I have no idea

466
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,840
what I should get her as a present.

467
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
Try this.

468
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,680
A fridge manual?

469
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,040
Try writing a guidebook about yourself.

470
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,640
It will let Anong know in a subtle way
that you're serious about her.

471
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,160
Women like handmade gifts
that can't be bought like that.

472
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,080
A GUIDEBOOK ABOUT ANONG

473
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,520
"August 11th."

474
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,120
"Anong's birthday."

475
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,280
Don't forget to bring a present.

476
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Don't forget to buy me a present.

477
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Chantorn.

478
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,080
Yes?

479
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,000
I have a favor to ask you.

480
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,000
Can you help me pick a birthday present

481
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,600
for Anong?

482
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,600
I'm afraid she won't like
what I pick for her.

483
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,440
Of course. I'll try to see
what kind of things she likes.

484
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,520
See you later.

485
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,600
<i>The woman Chut was with at the store
was Sa-Ang, the general's daughter.</i>

486
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,480
<i>He doesn't really want to be with her.</i>

487
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,600
Does that mean Chut

488
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,800
is going to marry Anong?

489
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
<i>They're not officially engaged yet,</i>

490
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,520
<i>but she's the one he wants to marry.</i>

491
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,400
Thank you for the other day

492
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
for not telling Anong about Sa-Ang.

493
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,720
It's okay. It's no big deal.

494
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm not some kind of womanizer
who dates many women at once,

495
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,120
but I had no choice but to spend
the day with Sa-Ang that day.

496
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,320
Well…

497
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,400
Let me buy this for you

498
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,760
as a token of my gratitude.

499
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,480
It's okay.

500
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,680
- I don't--
- I bought that woman

501
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
twelve pairs of shoes.

502
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,880
Let me buy this little something for you.

503
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,680
Excuse me.

504
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,640
I'd like to pay for this.

505
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,400
<i>She used her connections to get this job
and thinks she can do as she pleases.</i>

506
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,280
Ms. Anong likes to wear
the store's products

507
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,960
to advertise them to customers.

508
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,400
If employees like us wear them,
the customers will think they're cheap.

509
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,920
That's pretty.

510
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,840
Hey.

511
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,280
Wichai gave it to me
as a congratulatory gift for my new job.

512
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,720
NOTICE

513
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,880
TRANSFER LIST FOR 1947 A.D.

514
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,680
FLG.OFF. CHUT WARATHABUT

515
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,880
TO BE STATIONED IN KORAT

516
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,360
Lady Mayom did this to get back at me.

517
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,080
I knew it.

518
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,520
I got transferred
because of personal reasons.

519
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,960
Since you want to marry Anong so much,

520
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,280
let's see if she will be willing
to stick it out with you.

521
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,440
But don't expect

522
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,600
a fickle woman like her
to wait for you for long.

523
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,360
Why did you do this to me?

524
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,280
You did this to get back at me, right?

525
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,280
You're going to marry Sa-Ang
and that's final.

526
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,160
This is my life.
You have no right to do this to me.

527
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,480
I'm the one who gave birth to you.

528
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I have your future all planned out.

529
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,440
I'm practically handing you

530
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,040
a perfect girl on a silver platter,
yet you reject her

531
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,000
to be with a piece of trash like Anong.

532
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,680
If you won't follow
the plan I've laid out for you,

533
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,600
then just get out of my house!

534
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,160
Damn it!

535
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,720
Damn it!

536
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,920
Screw this!

537
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,440
Mom lied to Chut.

538
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,600
She intended to do this from the beginning
to teach Chut a lesson.

539
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,800
I knew Mom wouldn't let him
have his way that easily.

540
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Mom will keep pressuring Chut

541
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,880
until he changes his mind.

542
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,280
Damn it!

543
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,560
Fuck!

544
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,280
Yes, I meant to teach him a lesson.

545
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,680
Once he hits rock bottom, he'll learn
that there's more to life than love.

546
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,800
Don't you think you've crossed the line
by jeopardizing his career?

547
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,720
I've also found a wife for you
and you didn't seem to mind.

548
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,160
We're two different people.

549
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,120
Most importantly,
Chut has a girl he loves.

550
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,680
You can't force him
to love someone you choose for him.

551
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,520
Don't forget

552
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,000
that Chut became a soldier
to make you proud.

553
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,200
So can you take his place
to redeem our family's honor?

554
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,640
Me?

555
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,280
Have you done anything
to redeem our family name?

556
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,920
You're not a wealthy man.

557
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,880
You have no power or influence

558
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,120
to make people respect you.

559
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,560
You can't even make those women
who got married to well-off men

560
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,920
feel ashamed for stepping all over me

561
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,640
when my life was at its lowest!

562
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,560
Chut has to be the one to save our family

563
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,520
because you failed to do so.

564
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,680
Do you see that?
You're just like your dad.

565
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,520
You just have to be the good guy.

566
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,040
Isn't that right?

GUIDEBOOK ABOUT CHUT

568
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,360
I'm sorry I'm here so early.

569
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,000
I need your help with something.

570
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,920
Don't tell me

571
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,240
it's about Anong's birthday.

572
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,080
I want to celebrate her birthday
with just the two of us.

573
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,120
Can you try to get Anong
to come see me before her birthday?

574
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,840
Why don't you just tell her
you want to take her out to celebrate?

575
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,280
I have a surprise for her.

576
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,640
<i>I'll help Nid with her homework.</i>

577
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,320
Go run your errands.

578
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,440
No, that's okay.

579
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,720
There's something else
you can help me with.

580
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,560
I saw that Anong's car was parked at home.

581
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,280
Chut asked me
to get her ring size for him.

582
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,320
Can you help me?

583
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,280
Me?

584
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,240
Please? Do whatever you have to
without making her suspicious.

585
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,120
Just get the size of her ring finger.

586
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,560
Please?

587
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,520
What are these?

588
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,560
Hey. Did you make these yourself?

589
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,200
Yes.

590
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,400
I made them for my niece.

591
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,760
I don't know which one she'll like.

592
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,920
I want one too.

593
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,760
Okay.

594
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,760
Forgive me.

595
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,360
Gosh.

596
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,160
I'm sorry. Let's try another one.

597
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,680
You can keep it if you like it.

598
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,240
Do you like it?

599
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,800
- Wichai.
- I have what you asked for over there.

600
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,240
You wanted to know Anong's ring size.

601
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,960
I got it for you.

602
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,640
Gosh. Wichai.

603
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,200
You can really do everything.

604
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,080
Hey.

605
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,800
Will you really propose
to Anong before you leave?

606
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,840
You'll be far away.

607
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,040
I'll propose to see
if she will be willing to wait for me.

608
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,280
I plan to propose at the theater.

609
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,480
Will you come with me?

610
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,280
If she says yes, please ask her
for her hand in marriage for me.

611
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,840
Please, Wichai.

612
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,960
Come on in.

613
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,320
Come inside.

614
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,960
Please come in.

615
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,800
Come on in.

616
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,800
Did you buy out the whole theater?

617
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,680
I'm friends with the owner,
so he let me use this place for today.

618
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,280
I'm about to get married,

619
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,920
so all my friends are helping out.

620
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,480
I made Anong a guidebook

621
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,560
like you suggested.

622
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,120
GUIDEBOOK ABOUT CHUT

623
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,000
Shouldn't you two be alone
for a big moment like this?

624
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,240
No way. I need you there
for moral support.

625
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,840
I asked someone to bring
Anong here. She'll be here soon.

626
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
All right.

627
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,040
Okay, guys. Let's do this.

628
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,320
Once the phone scene comes on,

629
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,040
everyone, get ready.

630
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,480
<i>"The person who gives love
is the one who bears its weight."</i>

631
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,240
<i>This is what it means.</i>

632
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,680
I can't imagine my future

633
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,640
without you in it.

634
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,200
Will you marry me

635
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,800
and spend forever with me?

636
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,520
Let's spend the rest of our lives together

637
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,440
until the day we die.

638
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
Get a hold of yourself.

639
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,320
<i>I'll bring him over here.</i>

640
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,920
This is where I'll confess my love to him.

641
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,960
It's my birthday present to Anong.

642
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,400
I'll propose to her tonight.

643
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That's Prapat, Anong's dream guy.

644
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,000
Isn't he a perfect match for her?

645
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,880
I made this special drink

646
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,480
for someone I love.

647
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,960
Choy, have you seen Wichai?
I haven't seen him yet.

648
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,480
He's probably with Chantorn.
They're here together.

649
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,160
He's been courting her.

650
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,080
She's his date for tonight.

651
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,000
Will you marry me?

652
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,080
