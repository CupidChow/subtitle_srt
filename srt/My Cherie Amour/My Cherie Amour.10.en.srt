00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,760
Don't go see Lady Mayom just yet.
I think Chut ran away to Korat.

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,120
Urai just told me that
Chantorn ran away from home.

4
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,440
Let's live happily together.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,640
Does Chantorn love you?
She does. She'd been waiting for me.

6
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,640
But once Anong and I broke up,
you became the problem.

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Are you saying that
I'm the one standing between you two?

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,520
Don't betray me by asking
another girl to marry Chut.

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,080
They love each other. I can't stop them.

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,040
If she's so great,

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,240
why don't you marry her yourself?

12
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
You can call me selfish.

13
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,960
I don't want anyone
to be happy if I'm not.

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,360
If you can't be happy for others
when they find happiness,

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
maybe the problem is you.

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,000
Are you preaching to me right now?

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
Wichai!

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,040
We're told to prepare for the worst.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,480
Wichai may never fully recover from this.

20
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,320
If you want someone you love to be yours,

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,640
that's lust.

22
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,600
Or maybe it's infatuation.

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,240
If you want someone you love to be yours…

24
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
I get it now.

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,840
I know now
what you tried to run away from.

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
So you understand now

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,920
what it feels like
to not have anyone love you.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
The person who gives love

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
is the one who must bear its weight.

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll never forget that.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,720
My life was like a living hell

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
because I had to live with that feeling.

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,680
Please forgive me.

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,880
Master. Are you okay?

36
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,920
You damn ghost.

37
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,600
Get lost!

38
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,440
Where are you?

39
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,880
It's you, right?

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,360
Damn you.

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Just leave Wichai alone!

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,480
This is Wichai's coworker
from the radio station.

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,360
I brought you a gift basket.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,720
Take it, Lamoon.

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Mom.

48
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,320
This is Wichai's assistant judge.

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,640
Hello, ma'am.

50
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't forget the basket.

51
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,080
Take it, Lamoon.

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,840
-Thank you.
-Please make yourself at home.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Hey, come here.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
When Wichai was conscious,
he asked me to write down information

55
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
about the subpoenas he has issued

56
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,720
and all the cases he's responsible for.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,480
I wrote it all down here.

58
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,680
Thank you.

59
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
Actually,

60
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,160
I already asked other judges
to take over all of Wichai's cases.

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,920
I'll let him know once he wakes up.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
All right.

63
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
Tell him not to worry.

64
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
Please excuse me.

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Madam.

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
Ms. Chuen.

67
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll take my leave now.

68
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,520
-Thank you for coming.
-Sure.

69
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,440
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Goodbye.

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,480
Goodbye.

71
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,880
Madam.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
Doctor.

73
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,440
Wichai has been unconscious all day.

74
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,880
I think we should limit
the number of visitors.

75
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
With this many visitors,

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,320
Wichai might not get to rest

77
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,640
and his condition may become more severe.

78
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,760
I agree with you.

79
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,480
But I can't stop people from coming.

80
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Excuse me, ma'am.

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,200
I just wanted to bring Wichai
letters from our listeners.

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,160
They might help cheer him up.

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
Here you go.

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
A lot of people sent him
their well wishes.

85
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,400
I'll be off now. Goodbye.

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,560
Goodbye.

87
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,440
Chut isn't home.

88
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
You can leave
if you're only here out of courtesy.

89
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
We just want to--

90
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,160
Prasit, let me take that.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Please give this to Wichai.

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Once Wichai feels better,

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
we'll come to visit him again.

94
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,640
Doctor.

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Let's go see how Wichai is doing.

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way here.

97
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,400
Wichai wanted to know
if you've made your decision yet.

98
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
From the looks of it,

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,160
your mom seems to really dislike Chantorn.

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,440
It's one of the reasons
I'm reluctant to let her marry Chut.

101
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,640
I'm afraid she'll have problems
with her mother-in-law

102
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,200
once she's moved in here.

103
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,840
Wichai is really worried about this.

104
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
He wants to help Chut while he still can

105
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,559
so Chut can marry the girl he loves.

106
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
We're not asking for much.

107
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
We just want Chantorn

108
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,600
to have a house in her name.

109
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,400
This is so that she will at least
have somewhere to go

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,440
if she gets kicked out of here.

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,000
You mean you're okay
with letting Chantorn marry Chut

112
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,160
if they have their own house to live in
once they're married.

113
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,760
We're still disappointed
Chantorn isn't marrying Wichai.

114
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,480
Chut doesn't seem
like the right man for her.

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Wichai is really sick.

116
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
He wouldn't want to marry anyone
when he's in this state.

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,320
Maybe Chantorn
just isn't meant to be with him.

118
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Chantorn made her own decision.

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I'll let Wichai know

120
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,640
that you agree to let Chantorn marry Chut
under the condition stated.

121
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,520
Where is Chut anyway?

122
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,320
He doesn't dare face anyone
after what happened.

123
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,120
C. WARATHABUT

124
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,160
Congratulations.

125
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,560
You two are now legally married.

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,160
I wish you

127
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,320
a long and happy marriage.

128
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm sorry

129
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,680
that we can't have a wedding
since Wichai has fallen ill.

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,520
But I promise that

131
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,960
I'll love and be faithful to you
no matter what happens.

132
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,800
This ring represents my promise

133
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,400
that I'll work hard
and fully commit myself to you.

134
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
I don't care what anyone else says.

135
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,240
They can't change my mind.

136
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,560
This is all I want.

137
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,960
I want to start a new life with you.

138
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,360
Congratulations.

139
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,480
You're now a married man.

140
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,480
Wichai got sick because of that girl.

141
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,520
Why are they in such a hurry
to have a wedding now?

142
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,720
That woman caused
Wichai and Chut to fight.

143
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,600
It'd be absurd
if Chut still wants to marry her.

144
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,640
Wichai just wants to keep his promise
to Chantorn's family.

145
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,160
What about Chut's promise to marry Sa-Ang?

146
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,520
He didn't seem to care
about his promise to her.

147
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
Wichai has never asked you
for much, ma'am.

148
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,160
Just do this for him
if it's not too difficult.

149
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
You know this will break Wichai's heart.

150
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,320
Do you want his condition to get worse?

151
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,400
And where is Chut?

152
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,560
Does he know it's his fault
that Wichai got sick?

153
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Chinese people believe that

154
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,360
peach blossoms can bring luck

155
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,200
and drive away misfortunes

156
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,440
from our lives.

157
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,920
Don't bother your uncle.

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
How annoying. Just get out of here.

159
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,440
Mom.

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
Let's go, honey.

161
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm telling you.

162
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll never accept her
as my daughter-in-law.

163
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,600
I'll never welcome

164
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,800
a fickle woman like that into my family.

165
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,800
You think some women are like flowers
that are out of your reach,

166
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,720
so you go for the ones
that are closer to the ground.

167
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,360
And I'm just a weed
on the side of the road

168
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
that's not even worthy of your attention.

169
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,320
If you aren't going to fight for him,

170
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,920
we should let him be with Chantorn.

171
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,160
We're part of the reason he's heartbroken.

172
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
If I had known,

173
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,400
I wouldn't have encouraged Chantorn
to leave him for Chut.

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,360
I wonder if I can do something to fix it.

175
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,480
It's too late.

176
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,440
You can't do anything now.

177
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,760
I'll get the door for you.

178
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
-Come on out.
-Thank you.

179
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,680
-Go on inside.
-All right.

180
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,760
-Have a nice day.
-Okay.

181
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
-See you.
-See you.

182
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,160
Look after my girl for me.

183
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
Don't be too harsh on her.

184
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,680
She means a lot to me.

185
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Sure.

186
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,760
I heard that Chut just bought a new car.

187
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
He probably wants to rub it in our faces.

188
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,480
Ever since Chut quit his job,

189
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,880
he suddenly has a lot of money to spend.

190
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,400
People suspect
that he married a rich girl.

191
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
He seems to be lucky

192
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
both in the game and in love.

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,640
He doesn't care who has to suffer
as long as he's happy.

194
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,240
Thank you.

195
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,600
Hey!

196
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,359
His condition is stable.

197
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,079
He's occasionally conscious,

198
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,560
but the doctor still
won't let him out of bed

199
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
since he might faint again.

200
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,960
He sleeps all day

201
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,080
after he takes his medicine.

202
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,640
It might be good if he gets
to go outside once in a while

203
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,800
instead of staying in bed all the time.

204
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,000
I promise

205
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,560
to help you find happiness.

206
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,600
If I can't do it,

207
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,840
I'll never show my face here again.

208
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,800
Please wake up so you can be happy.

209
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,400
We're thinking about moving him downstairs

210
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,520
so he's closer to the garden.

211
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,920
I wish he would wake up and talk to us.

212
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,680
It's unlike him

213
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,160
to be quiet like this.

214
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,080
A girl brought you flowers.

215
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,760
Won't you wake up
to see who they are from?

216
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
Will you bring Wichai
Chinese herbal soup tomorrow?

217
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,000
Can you ask the kitchen staff
to prepare it?

218
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,560
Sure. I'll let them know.

219
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Thank you.

220
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,520
I know now.

221
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,920
I know where Chut got his money from.

222
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
An old palace was on sale recently.

223
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,440
They put it on an auction

224
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
and invited our bank to bid on it.

225
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
It turned out there were only two bidders,

226
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,480
our bank and a mogul
who owns a movie theater.

227
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,000
But on the day before the auction,

228
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,280
that man

229
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,840
just gave us one million baht

230
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
and asked us to drop out of the auction.

231
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,000
ONE MILLION BAHT

232
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,360
Chut was the one who brought us the check,

233
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,080
but the check was made out

234
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
in the theater owner's name.

235
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,400
This means that

236
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,880
Chut must be investing
in a business with him.

237
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,120
The mogul you mentioned

238
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
is probably Prach.

239
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,520
He and Chut are close friends.

240
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
My guy looked into it and told me that

241
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,560
they plan to turn the palace into a club

242
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
with annual membership fees.

243
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,840
I heard they plan
to make the club really luxurious

244
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,840
with a billiard room and a cigar lounge.

245
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,120
This means that

246
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,960
Chut is probably a partner in the club.

247
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,920
Hang on.

248
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
The club isn't even open yet.

249
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
Why is Chut already getting rich?

250
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,640
That mogul was willing
to give us one million baht.

251
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,760
They must have a lot of money

252
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,920
to spend on their project.

253
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
But I heard that

254
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
Wichai had to pay for the house

255
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,640
that Chut and Chantorn will live in.

256
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,040
I don't think
Chut has that much money to spend.

257
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,240
In that case, I'll wait and see

258
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,480
whether they're really good for the money.

259
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,680
Okay.

260
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
I haven't approved your resignation yet.

261
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,880
How can you just disappear?

262
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,720
Something happened that caused me
to suddenly change my life plans.

263
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,280
It seems congratulations are in order.

264
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,200
Is that a wedding ring?

265
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,880
Actually,

266
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,040
Chut doesn't want me to tell anyone yet.

267
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,280
Is Chut the reason why
you can't come back to work?

268
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,480
Is he still mad at me?

269
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,040
It's not like that.

270
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,960
Chut's fine with me working here.

271
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,280
Then come back to work.

272
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,840
I'll give you a promotion.

273
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,120
Unless Chut wants you
to be a stay-at-home wife.

274
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,760
If I no longer have to move
to the countryside with Chut,

275
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,280
I think I'll still be able to work here.

276
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,080
But still,

277
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,040
I'll have to talk to Chut
about this first.

278
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,720
I hope to hear good news from you.

279
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,000
You're a competent woman.

280
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,640
It'd be a shame

281
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,960
to lose someone like you.

282
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,720
DECO PLAZA APPLICATION FORM

283
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,680
Goodbye.

284
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,400
Ms. Anong.

285
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,880
There's something different

286
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,680
about her information
in the job application form.

287
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,640
Come on in.

288
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,960
Mom went to the temple to pray for Wichai.

289
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,480
I tricked Boi to go run errands for me

290
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,640
so I could sneak you in.

291
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,520
Otherwise, he wouldn't let
anyone come in here.

292
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,200
Is he doing better?

293
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,640
He's awake occasionally,

294
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,000
but he's asleep most of the time.

295
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,360
The doctor said
Wichai has peripheral neuropathy

296
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,360
which affects his motor functions.

297
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,920
So we don't know
whether he'll be able to walk

298
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,080
once he wakes up.

299
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,960
What's this?

300
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,680
It's the blueprint
for Chut and Chantorn's house.

301
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
Her family wants them to get married
in three months.

302
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,320
So Wichai asked Luang Sak
to help with the wedding arrangements.

303
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,480
Wedding arrangements?

304
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,720
Do you mean
there will be a wedding ceremony?

305
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,720
Wichai promised Samarn
that he would look after Chantorn.

306
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,480
So he wants everything to be done
according to tradition.

307
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,080
There's something different about her
information in the job application form.

308
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,920
So she ran off to get married.

309
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,280
But it's strange that
she didn't tell anyone about it.

310
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,240
Did you know about this, ma'am?

311
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,640
I thought that

312
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,000
they would just go register their marriage
at the district office.

313
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Wichai insists on holding
a wedding ceremony for them.

314
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,000
He doesn't want them to wait

315
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,280
until he gets better to have a wedding.

316
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,280
How can someone be this generous?

317
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm thirsty.

318
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
Can I have some water?

319
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,360
I'm sorry. I forgot.

320
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,600
I'll get you water.

321
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,160
Hurry. I'm really thirsty.

322
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,240
All right.

323
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,080
Are you in a lot of pain?

324
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,120
Is that why you don't wake up?

325
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

326
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,960
I was angry
and I took my anger out on you.

327
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,640
I encouraged those two
to run away together

328
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,480
because I wanted you
to be heartbroken like me.

329
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,680
I know now that I went too far.

330
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,120
But I'm going to make it up to you.

331
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,040
I know that I'm not good enough for you.

332
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,720
Since I'm a bad person,

333
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,960
I'm going to be as bad as possible.

334
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
I'll get the woman you love back for you.

335
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,280
You won't have to see her
with anyone else.

336
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,560
There will be no wedding.

337
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,040
And you can live with Chantorn

338
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,280
in the house
that you're building for Chut.

339
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,800
Thank you.

340
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Can I have more?

341
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
Do you want more?

342
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,840
Brother…

343
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,080
What did you say?

344
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,160
You said you'd think of me
as your brother.

345
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,280
Can you hear me, Wichai?

346
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,880
What day is it today?

347
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,640
It's Tuesday. Why do you ask?

348
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,440
Do you remember me?

349
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,000
Thank you for being here.

350
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,160
I've been wanting to come visit you.

351
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,360
Why?

352
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,040
Can you promise me

353
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,040
that you'll live a long life
so that I can keep loving you?

354
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,520
You don't have to love me back.

355
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,920
Just stay with me and don't go anywhere.

356
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,120
Thank you.

357
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,920
Why are you thanking me?

358
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,360
Do you understand what I'm saying?

359
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,240
Please say something.

360
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,480
Tell me whether you understand.

361
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,520
Don't you want to hear me
call you big brother?

362
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,360
What are you doing here?

363
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,920
We're not doing anything.

364
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
"We"?

365
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,800
No, that's not what I mean.

366
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,920
Please don't go in there.

367
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,880
Wait.

368
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,320
Who let you come up here?

369
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,680
You sneaky bunch.

370
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,400
We're just visiting Wichai.
We'll leave soon.

371
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,000
Prasit.

372
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,360
Your zipper is down.

373
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,000
Wichai doesn't want to see anyone.

374
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
Can't you see you're bothering him?

375
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Don't make me kick you out. Get out!

376
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,520
I let them in. Stop yelling at them.

377
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,320
Why can't you let Wichai sleep in peace?

378
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,880
There's no need to yell. We're leaving.

379
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
Don't come here again

380
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,600
or I'll hurt you.

381
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,640
Hey.

382
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,080
Who are you yelling at?

383
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,840
Madam.

384
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Hey.

385
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,000
What's with you people?
What do you want with Wichai?

386
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,280
I just wanted to visit him.

387
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,280
What business did you have with him?

388
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,040
She came to see how Wichai was doing

389
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,040
so she could consult a doctor she knew.

390
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,680
All right then.

391
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,600
I thought you were using Wichai
to get back together with Chut.

392
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,520
You can leave now
since you got what you came for.

393
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,600
I forgot to congratulate you.

394
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,440
Congratulations on
your new daughter-in-law.

395
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,360
I wish Wichai could see

396
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,320
how much his mom
loves and cares about him.

397
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,640
He's craved for your love all his life.

398
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,440
You've only started to care for him
when Chut has let you down.

399
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,640
Don't forget to make it up to Wichai

400
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,520
for all the horrible things
you've done to him.

401
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,720
Let's go, Prasit.

402
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,480
Madam.

403
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
How dare she say that to you?

404
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,360
Uncle Wichai is awake.

405
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,360
Mommy, Uncle Wichai is awake.

406
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,440
I almost slipped.

407
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,400
Wichai.

408
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,400
Have some food, Wichai.

409
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,200
Eat up, Wichai.

410
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,920
You're getting too thin.

411
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,960
It's my salary for this month.

412
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,920
They still paid me

413
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
though I couldn't go to work.

414
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,760
Stop worrying about me.

415
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,720
Don't worry about work or anyone else.

416
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,960
You've already given us so much.

417
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,760
We'll be fine even if
we don't have this money.

418
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,920
I don't plan on dying anytime soon.
I promised Samarn I'd look after Nid.

419
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I can't leave her.

420
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,520
Don't think you have to live
because of your obligations.

421
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,520
You've helped pay our family's debt
since you were in school.

422
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,880
You've provided for all of us.

423
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,520
You're my son.

424
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,880
I can manage and look after you just fine.

425
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,000
Even if you don't work,

426
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,640
our family will be fine.

427
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Others won't let us starve.

428
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,120
You're loved by so many people.

429
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,080
People brought you so many gifts
that we could set up a store.

430
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,360
People brought us so much food

431
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,720
that I almost didn't have to cook at all.

432
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,360
Everyone helped look after me
in your place.

433
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,680
You can put them there.

434
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,640
You can't buy
this kind of generosity with money.

435
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,760
You have nothing to worry about.

436
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,600
Just stay with me like this.

437
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,160
You've given me life.

438
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,040
So I'm going to make the most of it.

439
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,200
You must rest if you're tired.

440
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,720
Don't overwork yourself.

441
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,280
Your body won't be able to take it.

442
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
I know that now.

443
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,160
I've been living too recklessly.

444
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,400
You've also been too selfless.

445
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,600
Your body is telling you
to take care of yourself for once.

446
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,440
Do you want to look outside?

447
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,160
Come on.

448
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,920
Get up so you can get a good look.

449
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,560
Are you stunned by its beauty?

450
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm more stunned by the man you've become.

451
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,120
Why is there still music
this time of night?

452
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,440
Anong came to stay with her aunts.

453
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,840
If it bothers you,
I'll call and tell her to stop playing.

454
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,640
Tell her to come play every day.

455
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,120
I've been asleep for so long,
I don't know what day it is anymore.

456
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Is it almost your wedding day?

457
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,400
It's two more months

458
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,200
until the wedding.

459
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,880
But if you're too weak to attend,

460
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,200
Chantorn and I think we'll postpone it.

461
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,080
We've agreed that

462
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,120
we want to wait until you're better.

463
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,440
Without you,

464
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,440
there wouldn't even be a wedding.

465
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,320
From now on,

466
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,960
I guess it's finally my turn

467
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,000
to take care of everyone.

468
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,440
I'm not just talking about my family.

469
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,200
I'll take care of Mom

470
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,760
and take on the responsibilities
in this house.

471
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,280
You can rest now.

472
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
It's like I've been given a new life.

473
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,320
Am I really not dreaming?

474
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,400
Now that I'm awake,

475
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,640
why does the world seem different?

476
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,680
You're the one
who has woken me up to reality.

477
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,360
I've just realized

478
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,680
that I can't live without you.

479
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,280
You have to get better, Wichai.

480
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,120
Stay with me
so I can show you my gratitude.

481
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,600
I'm going to make you proud of me.

482
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,200
You'll see that

483
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,960
everything you've done isn't in vain.

484
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,640
I'm glad to hear that.

485
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,840
I hope you'll get to experience
more moments like this.

486
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,240
Hey, there.

487
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,920
What are you guys doing?

488
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,240
Gosh.

489
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,600
That looks good. Keep at it.

490
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,760
Right. I was wondering
where those paper flowers came from.

491
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,680
Anong and I made these charms for you.

492
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,040
We wrote messages on them
and Nid read them out loud to you.

493
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,880
So how is Anong doing?

494
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,840
I haven't seen her in months.

495
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,960
Wait.

496
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,560
You don't know that she's been here?

497
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,080
Every time she came to visit you,

498
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,960
you were always asleep.

499
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,240
I didn't know that.

500
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,080
I'm still worried about

501
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,240
whether she has gotten over Chut yet.

502
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,320
Anong doesn't care about him.

503
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,280
She's too busy worrying about you.

504
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,560
Visiting time is over.

505
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,600
-See you later.
-Thank you for coming.

506
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,680
People can feel dead on the inside
while they're alive.

507
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
If I continue to waste my life away,

508
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,200
I might be the one
to experience death before you.

509
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,360
If we give something enough time,

510
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,480
we'll start to appreciate its value.

511
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,400
When I go to visit you,

512
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,920
it makes me realize
how important you are to me

513
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,120
and how much I don't want to lose you.

514
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,320
I used to wonder

515
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,800
why movie characters
like ramble to themselves

516
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,240
about problems in their love life.

517
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,840
But now that I'm the one rambling,

518
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,040
I also keep talking
about my own heartache.

519
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,520
Thank goodness
you can't complain about it.

520
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,280
The reason I'm so miserable

521
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,840
is probably because
I pressure myself to be happy.

522
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,080
Even if you wake up,

523
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,200
I'm still not sure
if I can ever be happy again.

524
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,600
Prasit said that the first thing
you'll forget about someone

525
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,640
is their voice.

526
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,480
And the last thing
you'll forget about that person

527
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,760
is their smell.

528
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,600
But…

529
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,320
I still remember the smell
of your massage oil from that day.

530
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,360
A lie that we tell ourselves repeatedly

531
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,520
will eventually come true.

532
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,880
I convince myself every morning

533
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,080
that you'll finally wake up
and talk to me.

534
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,080
But it's been so many days

535
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,080
and you still haven't woken up.

536
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,600
Try to stand up first.

537
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,560
There you go. That's it.

538
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,520
How are you feeling?

539
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,160
Slowly put your weight on your feet.

540
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,440
You're doing really well.

541
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,840
Ms. Anong is waiting for you upstairs.

542
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,120
Chantorn.

543
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,080
I'm sorry I asked you to come
all the way here.

544
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,720
It's okay.

545
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,160
Here you go.

546
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
This is this week's sales report.

547
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,480
Give me some time
to read through the report.

548
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,400
Then you can take it back to the store.

549
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Please take your time.
I don't mind waiting.

550
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,960
Anong.

551
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,120
Anong.

552
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Let's go.

553
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,560
Since you're not doing anything right now,

554
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,800
can you take the compresses to Wichai?

555
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,840
No way. She can't have them.

556
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,880
Prasit.

557
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,360
I asked Aunties to make these.

558
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
She can't have them.

559
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,360
Prasit.

560
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,240
Take these to Wichai for me.

561
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,120
They will help him feel better.

562
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Yes, ma'am.

563
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,640
Hey. What are you doing here?

564
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,320
I came to see Ms. Anong
at the house next door,

565
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,920
so she asked me to come
and see how you're doing.

566
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,800
What about Anong?

567
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,840
She's busy at the moment.

568
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,440
So how have you been doing?
Are you feeling better?

569
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,600
Well…

570
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,520
The doctor allowed me to come outside now.

571
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,760
But I still have trouble walking.

572
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,120
I have to learn how to walk again.

573
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,160
Well then.

574
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,600
I'll help put the compresses on your feet.

575
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,360
Wait. It's okay.

576
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,120
You don't have to do that.

577
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,080
I can call Boi to help me.

578
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,080
I really don't mind.

579
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,360
Let me be the one
to take care of you for once.

580
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,040
Thank you.

581
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,120
This is nothing

582
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,000
compared to what you've done for me.

583
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,120
You've helped me with my marriage.

584
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,120
You're even building a house

585
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,560
for me and Chut.

586
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,800
Before Samarn died,

587
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,920
he asked me to help look after you.

588
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,960
I just want to keep my promise to him.

589
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,320
You've been too kind to me.

590
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,560
I'm doing it for my own peace of mind.

591
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,040
I don't want to have any regrets.

592
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,920
I don't know what I can ever do

593
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,840
to repay you for the kindness
you've shown me.

594
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,360
Well…

595
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,520
You can repay me

596
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,320
by giving Chut all your love.

597
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,040
That's all I want from you.

598
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,400
Why did you want her to go see Wichai?

599
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,120
Seeing her would only hurt him.

600
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,000
Wichai might be happy
to have Chantorn look after him.

601
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,080
He would feel awkward.

602
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,880
She went from being his lover
to being his sister-in-law.

603
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,520
His physical wounds are treated.

604
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,760
All that's left
are the wounds in his heart.

605
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,560
And Chantorn is the only one
who can heal them.

606
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,040
She'll only make him feel worse.

607
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,440
You should be the one
to help mend his broken heart.

608
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,280
If my presence could help,

609
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,960
he would've all been better by now.

610
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,000
Chantorn is the one
who's stuck in Wichai's heart.

611
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,040
She just came to visit me.

612
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,040
Are you sure she didn't come
to try to rush the wedding?

613
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,600
She already told everyone about it.

614
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,760
Don't be so prejudiced against her
and try to get to know her first.

615
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,840
She's a girl born out of wedlock
who tries to find herself a nice man.

616
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,560
She's asking us for a house

617
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,600
when she herself comes from nothing.

618
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,560
It's clear that she wants money.

619
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,000
Mom.

620
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,040
If you give her a chance,
you'll know she's not like that.

621
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,560
The only possession your dad left behind

622
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,120
was wasted on a low-class woman
that your brother picked as his wife.

623
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,320
A good woman wouldn't make
such shameless demands.

624
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,680
You mark my words.

625
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,720
Ms. Anong.

626
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,040
Here's the name card
you asked me to print out.

627
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,040
CHANTORN WARATHABUT,
HEAD OF SALES DEPARTMENT

628
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,680
Mom didn't even go ask
for Chantorn's hand for Chut.

629
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,680
I don't know why they think
they'll still be getting married.

630
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,280
Mom will never accept Chantorn
as her daughter-in-law.

631
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,720
If she approves,

632
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,480
it will be like she condones
how Chut stole a girl from Wichai.

633
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,160
Mom is punishing Chut for what he did.

634
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,400
It's funny how everyone is suddenly
doing nice things for Wichai.

635
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,160
They all want to do whatever they can
for him one last time.

636
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,960
Everyone tries to do something
for him in their own way.

637
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,120
I want to return these.

638
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,560
These shoes hurt my feet.

639
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,320
When did you buy them?

640
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,000
Do you have the receipt?

641
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,160
You sold us a low-quality product.

642
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,040
Won't you take any responsibility?

643
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,720
It was that woman who sold me these shoes.

644
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,040
She tricked me
into buying a defective product.

645
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,040
Hey, you.

646
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,600
Can I have a word?

647
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,840
Are they already married?

648
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,120
This is why that woman told everyone
Chut is her man.

649
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,480
What about the house?

650
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,280
Did Chut give it to her?

651
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,040
This is the house deed.

652
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,960
It's in your name.

653
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,440
I lost Chut to that woman,

654
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,080
but I won't let them have the money
that's supposed to be your inheritance.

655
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,480
Just walk away from him.

656
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,880
Let go.

657
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,680
Someone tried to break us up.

658
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,920
Was it Anong?

659
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,360
So that's why she came to the wedding.

660
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,120
Anong must've told Chantorn
something about me.

661
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,240
The wedding is ruined.

662
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,760
If this is your doing,

663
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,280
then you're very cruel.

664
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,760
You can't stand to see them happy.

665
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,440
You don't know how to love anyone.

666
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,480
The only one you love is yourself.

667
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,760
You've hurt people for your own pleasure.

668
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,720
You should be happy they broke up.

669
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,640
Is it that hard to be selfish
for once in your life?

670
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,600
