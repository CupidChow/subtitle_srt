00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,600
<i>I just realized that
I haven't been taking good care of you.</i>

3
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,720
<i>That's the only reason
that I can't let myself die yet.</i>

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,360
I don't want to make you cry.

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>May I have your permission to marry Anong?</i>

6
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,920
<i>If you promise to build
a suitable house for Anong,</i>

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,320
we'll ask for a dowry of 500,000 baht.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,520
My brothers didn't offer you money
because they wanted to help you.

9
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,800
<i>What they want</i>

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
<i>is to benefit
from your influence and connections.</i>

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,920
They're just taking advantage of you.

12
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,759
<i>He's going to regret this one day.</i>

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,560
He can't keep making compromises
in his marriage forever.

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
Is the position of the chief magistrate
a high-ranking position?

15
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,480
You've never asked me for anything.

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,720
I know you deserve so much more
than what I can give you.

17
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
You've made so many sacrifices for me.

18
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,440
You've done more for me
than what I've done for you.

19
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,880
Don't bend over backward for me.

20
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Let me be the one to do things
for you once in a while.

21
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
If you keep trying to please me,

22
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,440
I'll become so spoiled.

23
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm giving you the land
near the beach in Ang Sila

24
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,320
as your wedding gift.

25
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,600
May your marriage be filled
with love, trust, and respect.

26
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,399
May you learn to have the patience

27
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,240
to go through every obstacle together.

28
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,880
This is the Phra Somdej amulet.

29
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,800
It's to protect you

30
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,160
so that you can live
in happiness and peace.

31
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
- Thanks, Chut.
- Sure.

32
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,520
Hold on, Wichai.

33
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
This is a 1 kg gold bar.

34
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
I want you to have it.

35
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,200
It's to help you start a family.

36
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,920
I have no gold bars or amulets
to give you.

37
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,160
But here's what I have.

38
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
Direk.

39
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,280
You can put down

40
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
any number you want.

41
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,360
How does it feel

42
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,760
to lose all of this to Wichai?

43
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
Anong and I aren't meant to be.

44
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm not looking to compete with anyone.

45
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,720
You say that now, but you might
feel different in the future.

46
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,640
If Wichai didn't have what it takes,

47
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,160
these guys wouldn't let him
marry their only sister.

48
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,880
But he got everyone to accept him.

49
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,160
I've got to say I'm impressed.

50
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,880
We still don't know
whether they will make it.

51
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,920
Do you still doubt those two?

52
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,920
Sometimes I wonder

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,320
whether it would kill you
to be happy for your kids.

54
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,160
To the happy couple.

55
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,120
May you two

56
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,840
have a long and happy marriage.

57
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,960
May your love last forever!

58
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

59
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,120
Cheers.

60
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
Anong.

61
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,240
Should you be drinking?

62
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,720
How can she drink when she's pregnant?

63
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
About that…

64
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
The truth is, Anong isn't pregnant.

65
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
What?

66
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,400
That's what you all thought.

67
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,840
I never said that I was pregnant.

68
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,240
We were afraid that

69
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,720
you wouldn't let us get married,
so we went along with the rumor.

70
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,440
You punk.

71
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,320
You had me fooled.

72
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,640
Everyone thought that
I let myself get pregnant

73
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,440
to trap a man into marriage.

74
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,160
You all just assumed things.

75
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,640
You can't blame me for it.

76
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
So you're not pregnant.

77
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,400
Do you think you're so smart?

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,919
Do you think you've outsmarted us?

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,159
- Then take this!
- Gosh!

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,720
Get her!

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,760
Stop it!

82
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
My gosh!

83
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,640
It's unbelievable

84
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,040
how everything has turned upside down
in just a few months.

85
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,840
If I'd known
they were meant to be together,

86
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,200
I wouldn't have come between them.

87
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,880
Without you,

88
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,800
those two might not
have ended up together.

89
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Since everything that happened
led us to be together,

90
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,080
I wouldn't change a thing.

91
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Take good care of my sister.

92
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,160
I suppose you can stop worrying now
that all your kids are married.

93
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,200
Says who?

94
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,520
You're still a widow
and Chut is still out of work.

95
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't you know that Chut's been
hanging out with military people?

96
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
They're recruiting people
to serve as military diplomats.

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,520
The diplomats are likely to be assigned
to the countries they graduated from.

98
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,760
Is Chut going to rejoin the military?

99
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,840
He might even get assigned overseas.

100
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,000
As you know, Chut has
an advantage over other lieutenants.

101
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,880
In case you forgot,

102
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
Wichai hasn't been thrown in the air yet.

103
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,560
- Get him!
- Yes!

104
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,040
I shouldn't.

105
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,760
This is considered a bad omen.

106
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't mind.

107
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,200
We want you to give us your blessing.

108
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Marriage is hard.

109
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't know how I made it through.

110
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,640
I can barely remember the happy times.

111
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
I only remember the trouble
that your dad caused our family.

112
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
He took the blame for what his worker did.

113
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,880
We almost starved to death because of him.

114
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
I was so humiliated
that I couldn't face anyone.

115
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,200
Do you remember how
you got teased at school because of it?

116
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,600
But you never left him.

117
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,840
You stood by him
until the last moment of his life.

118
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,280
That's love.

119
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,560
It's because I knew in my heart
your dad didn't take that money.

120
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,960
You knew that Dad was betrayed

121
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,960
by his worker.

122
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Yet you stood by him.

123
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,000
That's what marriage is all about.

124
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,000
No matter what problem comes your way,

125
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,680
you must always protect each other.

126
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
When you have someone
to share your problems with,

127
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,480
it can help make those problems
seem less overwhelming

128
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,720
because you know you won't have
to face everything by yourself.

129
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,800
We'll always remember that.

130
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
Anong.

131
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
What?

132
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Come on.

133
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,720
Don't wait for him.

134
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
Wichai is probably busy with something.

135
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,920
It's his wedding night.

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,920
He'd probably rather be with his bride.

137
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Goodness.

138
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,120
They just turned off the lights.

139
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
This is only the first day.
You'll get used to it.

140
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,480
A new addition to the family
should make things livelier around here.

141
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Wait. Madam.

142
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
I lost my appetite.

143
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,480
Goodness.

144
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,400
I'll go see if I can get her anything.

145
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,720
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

146
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
Madam.

147
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,640
ANONG WARATHABUT

148
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
What are you doing?

149
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,680
I couldn't sleep.

150
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm still excited about my new name.

151
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,160
I just realized that

152
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,000
Anong Suntorapong is no more.

153
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,920
Did it take you this long to realize that?

154
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Come here.

155
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
So this is why you can't sleep?

156
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,000
It's exciting.

157
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560
You'll get used to it tomorrow.

158
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,080
Let's sleep.

159
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,320
If I wake up tomorrow
and everything turns out to be a dream,

160
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,800
what will I do?

161
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
You're being silly.

162
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,800
If I had known it'd feel this good,

163
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,400
I would've gotten married a long time ago.

164
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,000
I feel so lucky

165
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,119
that I get to lie here next to you

166
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,640
and listen to the sound of your breathing.

167
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,000
The food is already cold.

168
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,600
Anong went to bed late.
She couldn't sleep last night.

169
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,720
It was almost dawn when she fell asleep.

170
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,000
So I'm letting her sleep in.

171
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
If a family doesn't have
a strong foundation,

172
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,920
it's going to fall apart.

173
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,360
The wife is the one to sacrifice

174
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,600
and help solve everyone's problems.

175
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
But Anong wants to be spoiled.

176
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,760
She won't sacrifice for you.

177
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
What will become of your family

178
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,120
if your wife refuses
to devote herself to you?

179
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,160
Nid! Are you ready? We have to leave now.

180
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Nid, we're late!

181
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,000
Wichai, take this lunchbox with you.

182
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
All right.

183
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,840
Right, Choy.

184
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,880
Here's the camera you asked to borrow.

185
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,000
Thanks, Wichai. I'll use it
to take pictures of my handicrafts.

186
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,960
Okay.

187
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,160
Nid!

188
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Wait, Choy.

189
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,640
Look at you.

190
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,040
You will go to work looking like this?

191
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Can you at least make yourself
look presentable?

192
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
You got a chance to work in the palace.

193
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
Someone might marry you
and make you a duchess.

194
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
They just hired me
to help them write a cookbook.

195
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,120
So don't get your hopes up.

196
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,960
You have a stain on your shirt.

197
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
Being a mom is a tough job.

198
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
I get tired just watching you.

199
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
All your kids are a handful.

200
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,520
Are you all right, sir?

201
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,400
- Anong.
- It hurts here.

202
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
What happened?

203
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,680
Please help him.

204
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
All right. Just calm down.

205
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,400
Are you okay, sir?

206
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Please take this money.

207
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,280
Sorry for wasting your time.

208
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,560
Thank you, sir.

209
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,680
It's all taken care of.

210
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,160
He won't press charges.

211
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,840
Thank you, Chut.

212
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,080
I'm afraid people will think badly
of Wichai if this gets to the police.

213
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,560
It would look bad if people knew
his wife caused an accident.

214
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,880
Wichai doesn't have to know about this.

215
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,440
If he finds out,
I'll say that I was the one driving.

216
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,800
Why would you take the blame for me?

217
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,200
Well, I scratch your back

218
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
and you scratch mine.

219
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,000
Do you want Nid to sleep here?

220
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,680
Yes. Choy isn't home yet.

221
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,600
She's still working at the palace.

222
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,600
Nid can't sleep with me

223
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,400
since I snore.

224
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,240
Aren't you the one
who usually puts her to bed?

225
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
But it's fine if this is
too much of a bother.

226
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Listen, Nid.
You're not a little kid anymore.

227
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,240
Uncle Wichai is already married.

228
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,680
Let him be with his wife. Come on.

229
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,720
Wait.

230
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Huh?

231
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,520
It's all right.

232
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,080
She can stay with me.

233
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,920
Choy didn't mean to leave Nid in our care.

234
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,640
I know that Choy has to work.

235
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,040
Choy just used her job as an excuse
so she could go to night school.

236
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
She was afraid that

237
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,480
Mom wouldn't approve
and wouldn't look after Nid for her.

238
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,200
Why couldn't she tell your mom the truth?

239
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,480
My mom thinks it's harder
for educated women to find a husband.

240
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,800
She's afraid that Choy
will remain a widow forever.

241
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,720
I get it now why your mom wants
Choy to become a duchess.

242
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,960
It's because Choy is a woman.

243
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,000
She had to stay home
while Chut and I got to go to school.

244
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,280
That's why she doesn't have a degree.

245
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,840
I want to give her
that chance to receive education,

246
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,240
so she has options
in life like other people.

247
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
If we help look after Nid,

248
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,400
Choy can have a new start in life.

249
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,440
You understand, right?

250
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,000
Choy has always been kind to you.

251
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm willing to do this for her.

252
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,800
I just talked to the company
that we ordered the pens from.

253
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,640
I'm not sure whether we…

254
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Please excuse me.

255
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,800
Is something the matter?

256
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,160
Wichai had to go pick up Madam.

257
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,320
So he asked us to pick Nid up for him.

258
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,560
Where is his mom?

259
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,240
She's at the salon.
She asked Wichai to pick her up.

260
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,960
Then why can't you…

261
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,280
I see.

262
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,400
It's all right. You can go pick up Nid.
You don't have to wait for me.

263
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
What?

264
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,200
I haven't had a chance to congratulate
your son on his marriage.

265
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,400
Thank you so much. He'll be here shortly.

266
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,760
You can congratulate him
in person once he gets here.

267
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,160
I heard he's a respectable judge.

268
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,120
You must be proud of him.

269
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,600
There he is. Is that your son, ma'am?

270
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,040
What are you doing here?

271
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,200
Wichai is busy,
so he asked me to pick you up.

272
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,000
Wichai said that

273
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,600
something came up so he couldn't make it.

274
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,480
Are you almost done?

275
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,840
No.

276
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,680
I bought juice for you.

277
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Have a sip.

278
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,240
Just put it there.

279
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,360
All right.

280
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,360
Here.

281
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,280
Thank you.

282
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,440
Here's one for you. Have at it.

283
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,440
Is this your other son?

284
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,640
No, he's not my son.

285
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,680
I thought you had another son
you wouldn't tell us about.

286
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,440
I only have two sons.

287
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,560
There's no way that this dimwit…

288
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,120
There's no way that he's my son.

289
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,280
He's actually very sweet.

290
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,560
Other men wouldn't be willing

291
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,040
to sit around waiting
for a woman at a salon.

292
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
Take your time.

293
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
I don't mind waiting.

294
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
These shoes are very popular
with our customers.

295
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,040
Would you like to try them on?

296
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,240
- Sure.
- Can you help her, Nampueng?

297
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,520
Please follow her.

298
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,040
Anong.

299
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,280
Hey, Chut.

300
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,680
Is it okay with you if I bring
my seniors to the party tonight?

301
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,080
Gosh. I completely forgot about that.

302
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,800
It's all right.

303
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,440
I'll let Jamlong know
that you'll be bringing your friends.

304
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,840
Thank you.

305
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,040
We'll need more liquor and glasses.

306
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
Sure, ma'am.

307
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,000
Where's Chantorn? I thought I invited her.

308
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
She's not feeling well,
so I told her not to come.

309
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,840
Don't you need to be with her?

310
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,720
Is she badly sick?

311
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,600
I'll only stay for a bit.
Then I'll head home to be with her.

312
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
Hold on.

313
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,440
Are you back to being a party animal
after less than a year of marriage?

314
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,680
Jamlong likes to host parties here

315
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,240
and he invites girls
to spite Sa-Ang, right?

316
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,960
Right now,

317
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,920
the military is selecting people
to be military diplomats.

318
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,120
So lots of single men are looking
to marry girls with connections.

319
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,360
Some even asked me to be their matchmaker.

320
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,440
It's so strange how men use marriage
to help them climb the ranks.

321
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,880
Marriage is a kind of investment.

322
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,800
And not everybody is born
with good taste and good personality.

323
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,240
So those people need me

324
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,440
to help them build a good image.

325
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,800
I'll let this slide if you agree
not to tell Wichai about the accident.

326
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,480
I guarantee that
he will never know about it.

327
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,720
Hey, guys.

328
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,000
You look dashing in your full uniform.

329
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,640
Welcome to the party. Let's go have fun.

330
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,840
Are you here to get Ms. Anong?

331
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,840
- Yes.
- Please come inside.

332
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,120
- Just a moment.
- Sure.

333
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Chantorn.

334
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,600
Chantorn.

335
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,320
Chantorn.

336
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you okay? What are you doing out here?

337
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm waiting for Chut.

338
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,280
Chut went in to say hi to his friends.

339
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Then why didn't you go in with him?

340
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,160
I was feeling tired,
so I wanted to rest here.

341
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,400
Let me go get Chut for you.

342
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,560
What?

343
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,360
Chantorn is here?

344
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,160
Chut didn't tell me
that Chantorn is waiting outside.

345
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,440
- We should tell him to go home.
- That's a bad idea.

346
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
I don't think he can go home now.

347
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,120
But if Chantorn is feeling sick,
you should take her home.

348
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,560
I'll send Chut home once he sobers up.

349
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,440
No, thank you. I'm good.

350
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm sorry about the mess.

351
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,000
Chut must've brought
his friends to drink here.

352
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,720
Wait. You don't need to clean up.

353
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,960
It's okay.

354
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,400
- But I--
- Just leave it.

355
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,040
You should go rest.

356
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,080
Thank you.

357
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

358
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,360
Take some medicine and rest.

359
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,160
I'll wait for Chut to come home.

360
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Well then…

361
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,160
Please make yourself comfortable.

362
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,280
Hey.

363
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,560
Chantorn is on sick leave today.

364
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,960
Is there anything you need, ma'am?

365
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,560
I'm looking for a copy of the contract
from a business partner.

366
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,680
- I'll find it for you.
- It's okay. I'll look for it myself.

367
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,960
- Okay.
- Thank you.

368
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Where is it?

369
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,520
Mr. Sompong wants you
to go see him immediately.

370
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,480
Thank you.

371
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,280
Goodness.

372
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,280
MENSTRUAL TONIC

373
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,960
MENSTRUAL TONIC

374
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,840
Anong.

375
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,960
Did you hear that General Promsak
is being sued for fraud?

376
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,720
The plaintiff is a customer of our bank.

377
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,480
They want to file for bankruptcy against
the general to get their money back.

378
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,400
They want to know
if Wichai can do anything to help them.

379
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,200
Wichai? What does this
have to do with him?

380
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,320
Rumor has it that Wichai
once got his wife to accept a bribe.

381
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,520
That's impossible.
Wichai is such an upright person.

382
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,160
I suppose he is.

383
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,200
It seems that Wichai took the man's money

384
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,200
and still sent him to prison.

385
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,600
So that man holds a grudge against Wichai.

386
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
He threatens to send
a complaint letter to the court.

387
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Who is he?

388
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,960
He's an ex-con.

389
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,320
He sent me a letter once he learned
that Wichai is your husband.

390
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,160
He's threatening to expose Wichai.

391
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,320
That man just wants money

392
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,800
in exchange for his silence.

393
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,520
I've been trying to keep him away from you

394
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,400
since he might be lying.

395
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,400
Wichai would never accept a bribe
and destroy his integrity.

396
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,080
That's impossible.

397
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,720
How can you be sure

398
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,360
that his ex-wife didn't do it?

399
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,480
I'm confident that
Wichai had nothing to do with it.

400
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,840
But if his ex-wife took the money,

401
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,400
he's going to have
to take responsibility for it.

402
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,680
If the truth comes out now,

403
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,720
everything he's done to redeem
his family's honor will be for nothing.

404
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,560
Why isn't Chut here yet?

405
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,679
I don't think he'll come.
Time is money to a guy like him.

406
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,600
Did you hear about Sa-Ang's family
being charged with fraud?

407
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,639
What are you talking about?

408
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,520
Lady Mayom tricked people
into investing in a construction project

409
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
by claiming that it was for the military.

410
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,600
For a man like the general to be tried,

411
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,440
must the presiding judge
be someone of equal standing?

412
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,360
That's right. They still haven't decided

413
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,639
who will be presiding over this case.

414
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,840
But whoever gets to work on this case

415
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,840
will probably become famous, right?

416
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,600
The general is being sued for fraud
together with his wife.

417
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,800
It's rare for an officer of his rank

418
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
to appear in a civil court.

419
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,280
So people are interested in the case.

420
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,200
But a case this big will
definitely be in the public eye.

421
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,800
The appointed judges
must be carefully selected.

422
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,520
Otherwise, there's a chance
that they will get dismissed.

423
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,160
No one is more perfect
for this role than you.

424
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,160
<i>That man just wants money
in exchange for his silence.</i>

425
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,280
<i>I've been trying to keep him away from you</i>

426
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,040
<i>since he might be lying.</i>

427
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,440
If they choose you
to be the presiding judge,

428
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
will you dare convict the general?

429
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,200
I'll convict him if he's guilty.

430
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,400
Then you're perfect for this role.

431
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
This could be your big break.

432
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,800
I already brought your clothes over.

433
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,440
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Thank you.

434
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,920
Are you sad that I'm not pregnant?

435
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,240
We still have a lot of time.

436
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,880
If the baby isn't ready to come yet,
then that's all right.

437
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,320
Seeing what happened to you,

438
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,200
I don't want our firstborn to be a boy.

439
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
Why not?

440
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,080
I'll feel sorry for him.

441
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,600
Being a big brother is tiring.

442
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,200
Let's raise our children
not to be like us.

443
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,360
You've never raised anyone before.

444
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,600
But you'll soon find out that

445
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,600
it's impossible
to raise someone to be exactly

446
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
the way we want them to be.

447
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Hold on.

448
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,640
Is Anong pregnant?

449
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,960
No, she's not.

450
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
What makes you think that?

451
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,120
I thought it was her pregnancy
that made her sick.

452
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,240
Isn't that why she's so clingy to Wichai?

453
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,520
She's just having period cramps.

454
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,800
Period cramps?

455
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
That's not a reason for him to pamper her.

456
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,400
Wichai really wants to have a baby.

457
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,680
He's disappointed that she's not pregnant.

458
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,680
He probably needs some time
to get over it.

459
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,800
You should leave him be.

460
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,520
Anong is hardly wife material.

461
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,080
I really can't imagine her as a mom.

462
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,240
OBSTETRICS CLINIC

463
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,600
To be honest,

464
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,880
I'm still reluctant about having a baby.

465
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm afraid the baby will become repressed

466
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
if he grows up in this family.

467
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,440
I'd rather not have kids now

468
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,160
if that's going to be the case.

469
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,840
I want to wait until we're really ready.

470
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,600
OBSTETRICS CLINIC

471
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,000
So she doesn't want to have a baby.

472
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,640
I knew it.

473
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,920
An abortion?

474
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,640
She said she had a stomachache.
I think she might've got an abortion.

475
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,280
What are you talking about?

476
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,960
She's not ready to be a mom.
I heard it with my own ears.

477
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,320
Most importantly, I have proof.

478
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,760
She went to an obstetrics clinic.

479
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,360
She took Chinese medicine
to end her pregnancy.

480
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,840
Hang on. This is ridiculous.

481
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,600
Anong isn't even pregnant.
How can she get an abortion?

482
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,120
She still wants to fool around.

483
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,240
She might not even want
to settle down with you.

484
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,400
She doesn't want to be tied down.

485
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,440
I already had the medicine checked out.

486
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,480
It's used to induce menstruation.
She meant to kill the baby.

487
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,040
Mom, you can trust me on this.

488
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,080
Anong would never do something like that.

489
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,280
Please stop making assumptions.

490
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,280
It only shows how prejudiced
you are against Anong.

491
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,880
<i>Someone called to ask about you.</i>

492
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,920
<i>She wanted to know
why you came to the clinic.</i>

493
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Did she say who she was?

494
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,520
<i>She didn't. She sounded quite old.</i>

495
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,080
<i>I told her I don't know
who she was referring to.</i>

496
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,120
<i>We always keep
our patients' information confidential.</i>

497
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,880
Keep following her. Don't let her see you.

498
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,960
Gosh.

499
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,640
Why the hell did you honk?
You'll get us caught.

500
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
A dog ran past me.

501
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,240
Since when are you an animal lover?

502
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,080
Wait.

503
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,080
Where did she go?

504
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,480
- My gosh.
- Hey.

505
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,480
There she is.

506
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,480
Open the door.

507
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,720
I'm going to work.
I'm not going to get an abortion.

508
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,120
I don't believe you.
You even lied to Wichai.

509
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,520
Why are you so skeptical?

510
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,640
Just drop the innocent act.
You're not serious about Wichai.

511
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,720
So you're doing everything you can
to not have his baby.

512
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,880
It wasn't that long ago when you believed

513
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,280
that I let myself get pregnant
so Wichai would have to marry me.

514
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,760
You're doing something shameful.

515
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,800
Wichai's about to make a name for himself.

516
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,640
I have to make sure he doesn't do
anything to jeopardize his career.

517
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,760
I don't want him to waste time
with an insincere woman.

518
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,560
You can't get rid of me
like you did to Soon.

519
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,720
I'm not some timid girl
that you can easily run off.

520
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,680
You got away with it once,
but you won't always be that lucky.

521
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,560
What are you talking about?

522
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,880
Wichai could lose everything
because of what you did.

523
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,320
You're the one
who will ruin things for him.

524
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,520
Do you want to bet on that?

525
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,680
We can find out once and for all

526
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,920
whether it's you or me
who's not fit to be a mom.

527
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,600
Ms. Anong already left.

528
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,080
She left a moment ago.

529
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,520
I see.

530
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
I probably missed her on my way in.

531
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,920
Excuse me.

532
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,520
Is Chantorn here?

533
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,160
Chantorn took sick leave.
She's not feeling well.

534
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,000
She's sick?

535
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,080
Ms. Anong let her
take a sick leave for half a month.

536
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,240
She'll be back in about two weeks.

537
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,120
Chantorn left for work this morning.

538
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,760
Did you forget what day it is?

539
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,920
<i>She's probably at the department store.</i>

540
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,280
Can you come meet me?
I want to ask you something.

541
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,280
Chut.

542
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,440
Are you having problems with Chantorn?

543
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,120
No, we're not having problems.

544
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,320
You need to take better care of her
and show her more respect.

545
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,040
What are you talking about?

546
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,240
Have you ever helped her do the dishes?

547
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,840
Did she complain to you about me?

548
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,200
You need to be more considerate of her.

549
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,720
She's not your servant.

550
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,400
And do you think
you're such a great husband?

551
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,960
Can Anong come to you
when she has problems?

552
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
You want to help solve others' problems

553
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,720
when you can't even solve your own.

554
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,160
Did you know your wife leaves the house
every morning and never goes to work?

555
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Did you know that?

556
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,120
Your wife crashed her car
and kept it from you.

557
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,200
Stop obsessing over my life

558
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
and just focus on yours.

559
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,160
What are you two fighting about?

560
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
You never had any problems

561
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
until that woman came along.

562
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,160
Let this be a lesson to you, Wichai.

563
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,760
One woman can make people
lose respect for you.

564
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,720
Come see for yourself.

565
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,680
I'll show you what Anong is up to.

566
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,560
Come on. I'll show you.

567
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,080
Hurry up.

568
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,440
Women often use heat therapy
to cure childbirth wounds.

569
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,480
I saw Anong ask someone to set up

570
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,200
a heat therapy tent for her
while you were at work.

571
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,320
She's trying to keep this from you.

572
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,040
What is this about?

573
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,960
Lamoon.

574
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,200
Get over here.

575
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,440
Is she still in there?

576
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,240
I think so. No one has come out yet.

577
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,560
Good.

578
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,720
Come see for yourself
what she's keeping from you.

579
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,120
Let's go.

580
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,760
Goodness. Can you smell that?
That's the tent right there.

581
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,080
Let's go.

582
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,120
Hey. What are you doing here?

583
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,640
Why are you all here?

584
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,640
Where did Anong go?

585
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,920
Tell me where your sister is.

586
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,040
Anong isn't even here, Mom.

587
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,440
Come on.

588
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,960
Don't worry. No one will know about this.

589
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,760
But people will see the heat therapy tent.

590
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,880
Anong will help cover for you.

591
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,640
Mr. Sompong wants you
to go see him immediately.

592
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,840
Thank you.

593
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,720
Goodness.

594
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,960
MENSTRUAL TONIC

595
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,440
TAKE THIS TWO TIMES A DAY

596
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,000
Chantorn.

597
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,840
Tell me honestly.

598
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,720
What exactly is wrong with you?

599
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,160
Are you keeping something from me?

600
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,560
Are you…

601
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,080
TAKE THIS TWO TIMES A DAY

602
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,680
Are you pregnant?

603
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
I lost the baby.

604
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Why didn't you tell me?

605
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,200
Did Chut know about this?

606
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,320
Chut is trying to get assigned overseas.

607
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,680
He wouldn't be happy

608
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,560
if we had a baby now.

609
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,560
And if he chose to stay
because of the baby,

610
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,640
it would make me feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

611
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,520
The baby would be holding him back.

612
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,440
Chantorn.

613
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,000
Don't worry about a thing.

614
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,360
Right now,

615
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,080
just focus on taking care of yourself.

616
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,840
I'll take you to see a doctor.

617
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,240
We'll go together.

618
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,240
<i>Chut's mom is suspicious.</i>

619
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,320
<i>She called the clinic to ask about you.</i>

620
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,000
How did she know?

621
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,280
She likes to find fault with me.

622
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,920
She must've gone through my stuff.

623
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,080
So what are we going to do?

624
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,240
Chuen doesn't have
a very high opinion of me anyway.

625
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,880
I don't care if she misunderstands me.

626
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,840
<i>If it's really necessary,</i>

627
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,160
I'll let her believe
I'm the one who's pregnant.

628
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
I can't let you do that, ma'am.

629
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,680
I don't want to cause you trouble.

630
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,960
Trouble is my middle name.

631
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,160
I can handle this.

632
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,400
To be honest,

633
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,280
I'm still reluctant about having a baby.

634
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,640
I'm afraid the baby will become repressed

635
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,920
if he grows up in this family.

636
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,240
<i>Wichai will never let that happen.</i>

637
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,560
I'd rather not have kids now

638
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,480
if that's going to be the case.

639
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,040
I want to wait until we're really ready.

640
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,920
Tell me where your sister is.

641
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,520
- Tell me!
- What's going on here?

642
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,840
Why is there a heat therapy tent here?

643
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,840
I use it for herbal steam saunas

644
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,760
to help with my circulation.

645
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,920
Don't you lie to me.

646
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,480
You don't have to believe me.

647
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,680
Anong.

648
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,480
Do you know where Chantorn is?

649
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,920
I heard she hasn't been to work in days.

650
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,480
I don't know.

651
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,240
Why would you ask me?

652
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,920
Don't try to change the subject.

653
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,120
Tell me right now

654
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,280
what you're keeping from Wichai.

655
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,360
Ms. Anong didn't have an abortion.

656
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,000
I had a miscarriage.

657
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,200
I was pregnant.

658
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,680
But I didn't tell Chut.

659
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,800
I see that he's still out of work.

660
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,760
I didn't want the baby
to add to his burden.

661
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,800
I didn't want Chut to see me

662
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,600
and the baby as a nuisance.

663
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,120
That's why I kept it from him.

664
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,000
Chantorn.

665
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,120
I would never think that.

666
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,520
But I've always been the one
who's holding you back.

667
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,880
Chantorn.

668
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,320
Don't blame yourself.

669
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,080
You didn't want to lose the baby.

670
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,640
These days,

671
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,520
I secretly feel relieved
that I lost the baby.

672
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,800
It's like a weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

673
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,680
I know I'm a horrible woman
for thinking that.

674
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,720
That's cleared up.

675
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,080
I guess we can--

676
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,360
Shut up!

677
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,800
You shut your mouth!

678
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,960
This is none of your business.

679
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,040
- Have some manners.
- Why are you mad at him?

680
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,720
What he said might be inappropriate.

681
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,360
But at least he's not heartless like you.

682
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,400
I know it gives you pleasure
to see others in pain.

683
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,560
You're rooting for your kids to fail.

684
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,760
You want our marriage to fall apart
so you can rub it in our faces.

685
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,960
Are you really blaming me
for how your life has turned out?

686
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,680
They will never choose you
to be a diplomat.

687
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,120
The most you can be

688
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,680
is someone who waits
on the diplomat's hand and foot.

689
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,240
I know you've been
kissing up to your old boss

690
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,040
so that he'll let you
go abroad with him, right?

691
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,120
You've never done
the dishes your entire life.

692
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,320
Even a servant is more useful than you!

693
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,360
It's because I'm a snob like you!

694
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,640
Nothing is ever good enough for you.

695
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,160
You're even unhappy
that Wichai is married to Anong.

696
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,880
- Shut your mouth!
- That's enough.

697
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,840
There's no point in fighting.

698
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,280
Sometimes I wish that

699
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,000
I was a failure like Dad.

700
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,880
So you'd leave me alone

701
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,520
and let me die in peace.

702
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,360
- Chut.
- Wichai.

703
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,320
You must see that this family is toxic.

704
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,080
No one is ever happy living in this house.

705
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,880
You're the one
who keeps our family together.

706
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,520
But I know you want
to get out of this hellhole.

707
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
That's enough!

708
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,520
Mom didn't make me
take responsibility for our family.

709
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,160
I'm willing to take care
of everyone in this house.

710
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,520
It's my intention

711
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,560
to take over from Dad.

712
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,080
You can't blame Chantorn
for what happened.

713
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,320
Chut's the one to blame
for being a lousy husband.

714
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,200
It will be harder on Chantorn
if they have a kid when they're not ready.

715
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,880
You should be supportive of Chantorn

716
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,600
instead of trying to find fault with her.

717
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,320
Having a miscarriage is hard enough.

718
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,960
But she also has to worry
about Chut's feelings.

719
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,600
You should blame yourself
for raising Chut to be this way.

720
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,560
He has no idea how to take care of anyone.

721
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,120
<i>Everyone knows this isn't the first time
Wichai has accepted a bribe.</i>

722
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,080
<i>That's how his family could afford</i>

723
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,760
<i>to send his brother</i>

724
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,600
to study abroad.

725
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,200
<i>I just want you to stand by me</i>

726
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,320
when I make a mistake.

727
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,840
Wichai doesn't know about this.

728
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,400
<i>There's a way to prove</i>

729
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,560
<i>whether your mom is the one behind this.</i>

730
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,480
What is this? How did you get this?

731
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,720
Don't let him get involved
with the general's case.

732
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,160
Wichai! Did you go
pick Nid up from school?

733
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,520
I thought you picked her up.

734
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,280
Does this have to do with your case?

735
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,200
You asked the deceased to come see you.

736
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,240
Were there issues between you two?

737
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,600
I'm the one

738
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,400
who should be demanding justice.

739
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,800
<i>After everything you've done,</i>

740
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,080
<i>will you be sad if you don't get
to work on the case?</i>

741
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,040
<i>I'm sorry my family caused you trouble.</i>

742
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,040
<i>But I'd rather be the one
to handle everything.</i>

743
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:17,040
