1
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,360
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,640
<i>Time passes by, but love stories
never become outdated.</i>

3
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,240
<i>Dok Mai Sod's literary works are proof</i>

4
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,880
<i>that good stories will always be timeless.</i>

5
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,080
<i>Inspired by 1 of 100 legendary books
which Thai people should read,</i>

6
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,280
<i>retold to a timeless romance</i>

7
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,400
<i>to watch at least</i>

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,080
<i>once in your lifetime.</i>

9
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
<i>There's a saying that</i>

10
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>it's women who make the world go round.</i>

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,400
<i>Men often expect women to be angels,</i>

12
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,560
<i>but they rarely make
this world heaven for us.</i>

13
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,240
<i>So how can women
be expected to live in hell?</i>

14
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,520
<i>Women deserve to be with men
who appreciate their worth.</i>

15
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,560
Hello. Can I help you, ma'am?

16
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm here to see Mr. Sompong.

17
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,600
Sure. Please wait a moment.

18
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
Hey. Anong.

19
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,240
Anong.

20
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,800
How did you get here?

21
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,320
And what are you doing here?

22
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm here to see
what you've done with this place.

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,960
If you don't even use
the products we're selling,

24
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,959
then who would want to buy them?

25
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,040
Let's see.

26
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
After all, it's women

27
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
who do the shopping for men.

28
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
Hold on.

29
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,160
I got you something.

30
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
If the things here

31
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,880
don't catch a woman's eye,

32
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,400
then you won't have any customers.

33
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,920
Don't men earn money

34
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,920
so that women can spend it?

35
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
It's much better.

36
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Pong, turn around and show off that tie.

37
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
It looks great.

38
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,680
My gosh.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,040
- Let go!
- Stay where you are!

40
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,520
Stop! Stop right there!

41
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
- Hey, stop!
- Give me back my purse!

42
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,960
You just stay put!

43
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>What makes men think we need them?</i>

44
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,920
<i>What makes them so confident</i>

45
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,200
<i>that they are the boss of women?</i>

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,480
- Stop!
- Stop!

47
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,840
Stop!

48
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,080
Hey, stop!

49
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,080
<i>Not only are they not smart,
they are know-it-alls</i>

50
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,400
<i>who think they are so superior.</i>

51
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,960
<i>Growing up with my brothers
makes me realize that</i>

52
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,400
<i>men want women to be weak</i>

53
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
<i>so that they can control us.</i>

54
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,120
Move.

55
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,640
<i>Women may not have muscles,</i>

56
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
<i>but we have brains.</i>

57
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
Stop right there!

58
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,920
Stop!

59
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,800
You thief!

60
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,120
Anong.

61
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,120
You're a thief?

62
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
Hey!

63
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
Here.

64
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,560
Are you okay?

65
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,600
I thought I lost it.

66
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,600
Chut.

67
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,040
God must've sent you to help me.

68
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,560
Thank you.

69
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
You're welcome.

70
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,160
MY BELOVED HUA HIN

71
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,120
<i>People like to think that</i>

72
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,560
women need to be protected by someone.

73
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,159
We need parents to look after us as kids.

74
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
As we get older, we need teachers
to teach and guide us.

75
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,760
After graduation, we're expected
to find a husband as soon as possible

76
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,559
as if that's the finish line.

77
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,520
When will we women
get to live our own lives?

78
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
So you're not seeing anyone right now?

79
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
I think…

80
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I just haven't found the man

81
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,120
that I want to give my life to.

82
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,880
SOMYOD PANPETCHAKUL, PLAINTIFF
MANOP THEPDEE, DEFENDANT

83
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,280
<i>I'm still wondering
whether that man exists.</i>

84
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
Gosh.

85
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
Gosh.

86
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,640
It's like I'm in heaven.

87
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,840
I see angels everywhere.

88
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
Where's your brother, sir?

89
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,040
I don't see him.

90
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,320
Maybe he stood you up.

91
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,440
Wichai!

92
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,600
Chut! Come on.
We're going to miss the train.

93
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200
We can't go yet. I've got a problem.

94
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,640
What?

95
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,160
Master!

96
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,480
Where are you going?

97
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
Just go without me.

98
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,400
Master!

99
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,040
Is this the problem?

100
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,480
That's Anong Suntorapong,

101
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,160
the heiress of Sinthai Bank.

102
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,080
We met at school back in England.

103
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
She just came home after graduation.

104
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,280
This is my chance to woo her
after running into her.

105
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
If I leave now,
some other guy might snatch her away.

106
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,080
I thought you wanted to meet me
on my way back to Bangkok

107
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,120
to give me a hand with my luggage.

108
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,360
Turns out

109
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,720
you're here pining after a woman
and using helping me as an excuse.

110
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,040
Wichai.

111
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,880
Don't you see

112
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,280
how different Anong is from me?

113
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,240
It's a 1-in-a-100 chance
a perfect girl like her will like me.

114
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,080
I have to grab at the opportunity.

115
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Women who know their worth

116
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,480
can be dangerous.

117
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't love anyone else
if it's not Anong.

118
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
- Chut.
- Did you have fun?

119
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Thank you.

120
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Is your brother mad
that we made him miss the train?

121
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
All my life, I've never seen him
get mad at anyone.

122
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,720
His name is Pra Atthakadee Wichai,

123
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,040
but it'd be more appropriate
to call him a saint.

124
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,240
Are you sure he's "Pra Atthakadee Wichai"

125
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
and not "Priest Atthakadee Wichai"?

126
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm scared he will start preaching to us.

127
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,880
Tonight, let me buy you two dinners
to apologize for wasting his time.

128
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,640
Why are there so many people here?

129
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,560
I bet you never go out, Your Honor.

130
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,000
How about I find you a girl to dance with?

131
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,080
We're here for one night
and you might get lonely

132
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
because I'll be dancing with Anong
until morning.

133
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,160
No, thank you. You go have fun.

134
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
You're not even that old yet.

135
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,240
You should try to enjoy yourself.

136
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,760
You're so uptight
that Anong thinks you'll be ordained soon.

137
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
Hello.

138
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,400
I hope it doesn't make you uncomfortable
that we're the center of attention.

139
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,240
I don't mind. Let them stare.

140
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll make sure no one
can take their eyes off of you tonight.

141
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,160
My gosh!

142
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Goodness!

143
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,160
Chut!

144
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,320
That was your fault.

145
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,080
- Gosh!
- Anong!

146
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,440
Goodness.

147
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,320
It's me again.

148
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,120
Come on, Anong.

149
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I just bumped into his head.

150
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
Wichai!

151
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,200
Come dance with us!

152
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,320
Nice save.

153
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,440
Well…

154
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,079
Did you change your mind
and decide to join us?

155
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,760
How about one dance with Anong?

156
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
Give me the room key.

157
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm going to bed.

158
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,360
Going to bed?

159
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
Right now?

160
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
I can't breathe.
There are too many people here.

161
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
I went to play golf this morning
and left my ring here.

162
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,920
But when I came back to pack my things,

163
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,880
my ring was gone.

164
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
We've looked everywhere
and couldn't find it.

165
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,920
Wichai.

166
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Here you are. What should we do?
Anong's ring is missing.

167
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,800
It's my mom's wedding ring.

168
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,440
If I can't find it,

169
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll be devastated.

170
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,760
Have you seen it, ma'am?

171
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,880
Normally, our housekeepers don't touch
the guests' personal belongings

172
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,520
without permission.

173
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,280
I don't think she even knows

174
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
what the ring looks like.

175
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,120
If the ring isn't in this room,

176
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,080
it may be with someone in this hotel.

177
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,960
If you expect us
to search the entire hotel,

178
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,840
I'm afraid it will disturb
other guests here.

179
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,440
What are you saying?

180
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,480
Is there no way for me
to get the ring back?

181
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,960
The train will be leaving soon.

182
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,800
If the ring is really in this hotel,

183
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,200
I'll find it for you.

184
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll have it delivered to you
as soon as I find it.

185
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,960
But can you please
not make a big deal out of this?

186
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,800
You may not find it even if you stay.

187
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,200
Once we're in Bangkok,
I'll help follow up on the matter here.

188
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,440
- Chut.
- It will be okay.

189
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,040
Don't you worry.

190
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,640
Someone in Bangkok might propose
to you with a new engagement ring.

191
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,840
Next time you come here,
you might be on your honeymoon.

192
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,600
Wait.

193
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,720
Please wait.

194
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,080
Here.

195
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,040
How did she have my ring?

196
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,640
She said she just found it.

197
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,400
And you believed her?

198
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,800
How can you call yourself a judge?

199
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,680
Can't you tell that she's a thief?

200
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,600
She wouldn't have returned it
if she wanted it.

201
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,560
She was just afraid she'd get caught.

202
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,800
Are you going to let her get away with it?

203
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
Do you have proof that she stole it?

204
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
Here.

205
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,720
The ring is enough proof.

206
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
That's right. Most importantly,

207
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,720
you know,

208
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
she's a housekeeper.

209
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,600
So what?

210
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,680
Being poor doesn't make you a thief.

211
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,120
Just like how education
doesn't necessarily make you smart.

212
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,880
You can't judge people
based on something like that.

213
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,720
Master!

214
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,640
Master, how could you leave me like that?

215
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,440
Madam gave me an earful
for leaving without you.

216
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,240
Where have you two been?

217
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,840
I see you're finally home.

218
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,440
You kept me waiting long enough.

219
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,800
Hello, Mom.

220
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,480
We spent one night in Hua Hin.

221
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,920
There I was thinking you went
to welcome your brother back.

222
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,800
Turns out you just went there
to have fun with that party girl, right?

223
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,840
Her name is Anong.

224
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,040
- I know.
- I know.

225
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,120
I know that.

226
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,400
I just didn't want to waste my breath
mentioning her name.

227
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,160
Wichai, look at you.

228
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
You look more handsome.

229
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I thought I wouldn't get to see you.

230
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,200
I almost didn't come.

231
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,560
You kept me waiting
at Hua Lamphong Station for nothing.

232
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,720
I'm only here for the sarong.

233
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,120
What?

234
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,560
Boi hasn't given the sarongs to everyone?

235
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,360
Go get the sarongs.

236
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,560
Sarongs?

237
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,840
- The sarongs.
- Right.

238
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,600
Here, sir.

239
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Don't let me choose for you.

240
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,120
You and Mom can have the first pick.

241
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,320
- Sure.
- Choy can have what's left.

242
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,360
There's one for you too, Lamoon.

243
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,520
Here, ma'am.

244
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,480
Did you enjoy your trip?

245
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,880
The weather was quite nice.

246
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
I'm starting to like that place.

247
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,440
Mr. Sompong is waiting for you, ma'am.

248
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,800
Where are you going?

249
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Well?

250
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,840
Goodness.

251
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,160
How come you're home today, Pong?

252
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,720
You told me you were going
to Hua Hin with Anek and Pasan.

253
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,520
So why were you staying
at a hotel with someone else?

254
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,320
I wasn't with anyone. We just happened
to check in at the same hotel.

255
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,960
You went out of town on a trip together.

256
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,360
That's scandalous enough.

257
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,840
Come on, Pong. Times have changed.

258
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,440
You went out in public with a girl
who has nothing but a pretty face.

259
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,280
You'll lose your chance with other girls
if they think you're seeing her.

260
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,000
Mom, please.

261
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm a man.
What harm can it do to my reputation?

262
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,480
If the general's daughter Sa-Ang
finds out about this,

263
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
she will think that you're taken.

264
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,080
Then screw her.

265
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,280
I don't want to know that girl anyway.

266
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,560
Everyone knows you're the heiress
of the Suntarapong family.

267
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
After you come of age,

268
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,080
you'll inherit the family's
department store business.

269
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,920
You should be careful
with the men you hang out with.

270
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,920
Lots of men will want
to marry you for your money.

271
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,240
Especially a cadet like Chut.

272
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,080
I don't see how he can provide for you.

273
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,960
But I don't need anyone to provide for me.

274
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,880
If you keep hanging out with him,

275
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,440
it will make him think

276
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,560
that he has a shot with you.

277
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,280
Come on, Pong.

278
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,880
You're no longer my guardian.

279
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,840
Let me take care of myself.

280
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,680
Sa-Ang's family can help you
to advance in your career.

281
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,760
When you love someone,
you have to also think about your future.

282
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,600
You can marry her yourself, then.

283
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,640
I would if I could.

284
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,280
Don't you dare ruin
everything I've planned for you.

285
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,400
You have to go meet Sa-Ang
and that's final.

286
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,440
Mom, I've never said I wanted
to be engaged with anyone.

287
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,240
Just get a new son and make him
marry the girl of your choice.

288
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,040
Is this because of that girl Anong?

289
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,320
She has you wrapped around her finger.

290
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
You despise Anong

291
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,640
when she might not
even be interested in me.

292
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,600
She can marry an angel
if she thinks she's so perfect.

293
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,400
There are plenty of respectable women
who want you as their husband.

294
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,280
Thank you, Wichai,

295
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,600
for still thinking of me.

296
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,320
If I had known

297
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,240
that Samarn was so sick,

298
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,480
I would've come here
the minute I got back.

299
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,760
People at the house don't care about us.

300
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,320
They probably see us as a burden to them.

301
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,320
Well, I'm back now.

302
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,920
I'll visit you every day.

303
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,000
I can help look after my niece

304
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
and give you time to rest.

305
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,880
Thank you so much, Wichai.

306
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,440
Let's put the sarong away.

307
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,200
That's Samarn's car.

308
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,440
It's been parked there

309
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,960
ever since he got sick.

310
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
What did the doctor say

311
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,200
about Samarn's condition?

312
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,720
They said he will probably
never walk again.

313
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
He wants to go see his parents,

314
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
but they want nothing to do with him.

315
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,840
It's because he went against them
and married me.

316
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,320
I'm scared that he will die

317
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,120
before they forgive him.

318
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,560
So how are you earning money these days?

319
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,280
I do as many odd jobs as I can.

320
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,240
I heard that Mom is quarreling with Chut.

321
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,120
It's the same old stuff.

322
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,480
Mom is trying to marry Chut off
to a respectable woman

323
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,800
in the hope of continuing the family name.

324
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Is that right?

325
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,720
You know,

326
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,920
it's much more peaceful here
than back at my house.

327
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,840
If it's possible,
I'd like to be here every day.

328
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,760
Hey, Wichai.

329
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Goodness, Wichai.

330
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,200
Did the state give you that car?

331
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,880
It's Samarn's car. I bought it from him.

332
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,520
Why would you buy yourself a used car?

333
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,000
You could do better, man.

334
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,280
I did it to help Choy.

335
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,280
She wouldn't accept my money.

336
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
I bought the car from her
so she has some savings.

337
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
Does this thing still run?

338
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,280
I wouldn't drive it
even if someone lent it to me.

339
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,040
Well…

340
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,160
Would you like us
to call someone to help you?

341
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,720
That's okay.

342
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
I'll call Boi to help me.

343
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,280
You should sell it.

344
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,800
It's a piece of scrap.

345
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,200
- We'll be off now.
- Okay.

346
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's go.

347
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Bye.

348
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll be happy to drive for you
for the rest of my life.

349
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,880
I'd rather you teach me how to drive.

350
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,679
Sure. When do you want me to teach you?

351
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,120
Well…

352
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,679
Hello, Auntie.

353
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,679
Hello.

354
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,679
Whose car is that?

355
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
Pong bought it for me.

356
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
But I still can't drive well,

357
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,480
so Chut is going to teach me how to drive.

358
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm Chut. I live right next door.

359
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,600
Auntie.

360
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,680
While I'm learning how to drive,

361
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,440
can I please leave my car here?

362
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,600
I'll have Chut drive me around
in the meantime.

363
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,360
But if you want to use the car,

364
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,920
you can tell Chut.

365
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,280
He can drive you.
He's an excellent driver.

366
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,640
That's right.

367
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
And he lives close by too.

368
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
What are you doing?

369
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,760
Come here. Look at that.

370
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,480
That woman is using a car
to win Chut over.

371
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,560
She's trying to buy his love.
Do you see now

372
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,360
why Chut fell head over heels for her
without caring what people say?

373
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,520
Wichai.

374
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,560
You must talk some sense into him.

375
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,680
He's a grown man. He won't listen to me.

376
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,800
Listen. That woman is leading Chut astray.

377
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,720
Look at these.

378
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,360
Look.

379
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,480
Just look at them.

380
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,240
She sent these to tempt him.

381
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,200
What kind of good woman
gets this handsy with a man?

382
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,160
She even printed out the photos
to show off her shamelessness.

383
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,280
Chut is so blindly in love with her.

384
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,920
Now he wants her
to become part of our family.

385
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,320
Listen, Wichai.
It's your duty as a brother

386
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,040
to teach him
how he should conduct himself.

387
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,960
Gosh.

388
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Master.

389
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,760
A letter came for you from Hua Hin.
It just arrived today.

390
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,520
- Did you get the car fixed?
- All done.

391
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,440
It's all good?

392
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,280
It's good and dead.
There's no getting it to run.

393
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
You should buy a new car.

394
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,400
When will your friend be here?

395
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,720
He's almost here.

396
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
I guarantee he's a catch.

397
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,040
Are you sure about that?

398
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,360
Just wait and see.

399
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,320
My, my.

400
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,080
What's going on here?

401
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,960
Why are the three of you here together?

402
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
We're waiting for you.

403
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,920
Why?

404
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,280
Tell me what's going on.

405
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,960
There's usually only Prasit

406
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,440
who is always home.

407
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,160
The three of us agreed that

408
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,360
if anyone wants to marry you,

409
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
they should get approval
from all of us first.

410
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,040
Because once they marry into this family,
they will also become our brother.

411
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,920
This again?

412
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,320
You've become so popular.

413
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,720
We're afraid you'll attract bad men.

414
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,160
That's right.

415
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,280
Before you pick your partner,

416
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,080
I want you to consider
the men we've found for you.

417
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,080
We also don't want you
to commit to Chut too soon.

418
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,240
We know how men think.

419
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,200
So we all agreed that

420
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,560
we'll try to find a good man
for you to choose.

421
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,800
You're like a princess
who gets to choose her prince.

422
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,280
So you've all come together

423
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,880
just to try to keep Chut out of my life?

424
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,680
I don't want anyone you marry

425
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,840
to become the reason
for us to fight later.

426
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,440
Please believe that
we all have your best interest at heart.

427
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,000
Why must it become
a matter of life and death

428
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,800
every time I decide to date someone?

429
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
But if you don't like
any of the men we've found for you,

430
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,280
we won't object
if you decide to marry Chut.

431
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,640
All I ask is for you to keep an open mind
and give other guys a chance.

432
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,280
Starting today,
someone is coming to meet you.

433
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,600
Someone's about to fall in love.

434
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,440
Wait a minute. Today?

435
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,360
Let's get to know him together.

436
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,840
The three of us can help you
make a decision.

437
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,320
Why just three of you?

438
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,120
Can't I help too?

439
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,000
You'll only give us a headache.

440
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,040
- Jamlong is already a handful.
- What?

441
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,080
Let's see how good your friend is.

442
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,440
- Wait, Anong.
- Just wait and see.

443
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,440
I won't.

444
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
Pong.

445
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,680
Pong.

446
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,080
Are we really doing this?

447
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,640
Your guest is here, sir.

448
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,800
No, Pong. Please.

449
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,120
No, Pong.

450
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,880
Please don't make me do this.

451
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,680
There he is.
My future brother-in-law is here.

452
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,560
He's early.
He must be very excited to meet her.

453
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,360
He's here. Come on.

454
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,120
Hurry.

455
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,240
Have you waited long?

456
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,120
Wait.

457
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,080
Wichai?

458
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,680
Is this the friend you invited?

459
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,720
No.

460
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,040
Then how come…

461
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,840
We have an appointment.

462
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,840
This must be a mistake.

463
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,560
We have an appointment,
but it's not today.

464
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,240
So you got the date wrong?

465
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,080
I was wondering why
everyone seemed so excited.

466
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm sorry I got the date mixed up.

467
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
We're waiting for an important guest.

468
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,320
But never mind that.

469
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,640
We can talk now since you're here.

470
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,240
I heard that you contacted
the hotel in Hua Hin

471
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,040
to press charges against the housekeeper.

472
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,240
I suppose you want her
to be held responsible for stealing.

473
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,840
So that's what this is about.

474
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,600
I want the hotel to take
responsibility for what happened.

475
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
They didn't really try to help Anong

476
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,600
because they didn't take her seriously.

477
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,640
About that…

478
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,800
We're having a small get-together.

479
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,200
A man is coming to meet Anong.

480
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,040
How do Pong and Wicha know each other?

481
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,840
They were high school friends.

482
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,560
I was so shocked. I thought that was
the man you're setting me up with.

483
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,880
Don't worry.

484
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,360
We won't pick
a geeky guy like that for you.

485
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,600
The guys we pick must be worthy
to be a part of our family.

486
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
Thank you.

487
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,800
Hey. Get up.

488
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,360
Go sit over there.

489
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Where?

490
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,960
Go sit on that side.

491
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,200
The other guests will be here soon.

492
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,720
Stop it.

493
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,840
Anong.

494
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
My friend is here.

495
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,280
It's nice to meet you, Anong.

496
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,360
Hello.

497
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,200
Please have a seat.

498
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Come on. Have a seat.

499
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,840
You go sit over there.

500
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,320
Come sit over here.

501
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,640
Since you vouched for her,

502
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,960
you must really think she's innocent.

503
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,960
Sinthai Bank is a major creditor
of the hotel,

504
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,880
so they feel obligated to you.

505
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,480
But I assure you that the woman
didn't mean to steal anything.

506
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,280
I'll contact the hotel to sort this out.

507
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,920
Thank you so much.

508
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
Chut is your brother.

509
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,280
This means that

510
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,400
you must know my sister.

511
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,120
Since you're here,

512
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,960
can you lend your expertise
and help me judge something?

513
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,400
I heard that you're having
a vacation home built in Hua Hin.

514
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,080
You're welcome to visit my house there
for a change of scenery.

515
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,960
That's right. Anong often goes
to Hua Hin to play golf.

516
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,240
You two can hang out.

517
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,800
I don't go there that often.

518
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,720
I've invited my friend to join us.

519
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,880
This is Pra Atthakadee Wichai.

520
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,440
He's a judge and also my friend.

521
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,200
We've already met.

522
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,000
Pra Atthakadee Wichai is Chut's brother.

523
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,000
Wichai, please have a seat.

524
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,280
Chut Warathabut.

525
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,040
Everyone knows him.

526
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,720
He's such a ladies' man.

527
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,600
Everyone knows his family.

528
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,640
Their embezzlement case
was quite scandalous.

529
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,760
The district chief embezzled money

530
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,000
and was dismissed from government service.

531
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,560
Who could forget about that?

532
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,440
Anong.

533
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,920
Did Chut tell you about this?

534
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,920
No, he's never told me.

535
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,280
Yet the government
still lets you work for them.

536
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,280
You must be really competent.

537
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,840
I imagine you have a lot to prove

538
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,280
working as a judge.

539
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,480
You must be under a lot of stress
when you make a ruling in court.

540
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,000
Is that true?

541
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,440
What my dad did was a long time ago.

542
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,600
Maybe Chut didn't tell you about it

543
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
because it was well in the past.

544
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,120
Chut was just born when it happened.

545
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,840
But didn't he go
to study abroad in the hope that

546
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,760
people would see him as a new man?

547
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,720
If there are people who dislike our family
because of what happened,

548
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,040
I can't change their mind.

549
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,720
By not telling us, it's like you are
deliberately hiding the truth from us.

550
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,520
If you were my friend,

551
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,440
it would be hard for me to trust you.

552
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,040
You're right.

553
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,560
I'm glad you invited me to join you today.

554
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,360
Otherwise, I wouldn't know that
you people were discussing my family.

555
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,360
Since you said it to my face,

556
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,360
I can't accuse you of gossiping.

557
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
That's right.

558
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,320
Real men shouldn't gossip.

559
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,120
If I could bring my dad here
to defend himself to everyone,

560
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,240
I would love to do it.

561
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,520
When you gossip,

562
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,800
it reveals your true character.

563
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,200
I see it now.

564
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,400
Wichai.

565
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,280
Please wait a moment.

566
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,240
Don't worry.

567
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,640
I won't tell Chut
about the arrangement today.

568
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,200
No, I'm not worried about that.

569
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,800
Pong said you came here
to talk about the ring.

570
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,520
Is that the ring?

571
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,640
Can I see it?

572
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
My dad didn't embezzle any money.

573
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,520
He just took responsibility for failing
to guard the money in the safe.

574
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,240
Just like what that woman did.

575
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,560
If you look carefully,

576
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,280
you can see an oil stain on the ring.

577
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,560
You were right.

578
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,400
Someone stole your ring.

579
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,760
But it wasn't the housekeeper.

580
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,400
An oil stain?

581
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,280
Some people step up to take the blame
for something they didn't do.

582
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,440
There really are people like that.

583
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,240
That housekeeper

584
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,520
once had an engagement ring.

585
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,280
She gave it to her lover
to pawn it for money.

586
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,120
The man promised
he would get the ring back.

587
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,920
The electrician went
into your room to steal the ring

588
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,840
and told the housekeeper
he got her a new ring.

589
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
She was overjoyed.

590
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,160
But once she knew
it was stolen from someone,

591
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,600
she felt bad about it.

592
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,120
She blamed herself for causing her lover
to do something so thoughtless.

593
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,000
She quickly gave the ring back.

594
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,360
Please return the ring to the lady.

595
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,360
Take this money to buy your ring back.

596
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,240
You can pay me back
once you have enough money.

597
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,920
<i>The only mistake she made</i>

598
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,760
<i>was trying to protect her lover.</i>

599
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,320
<i>But she's come to her senses now.</i>

600
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,120
<i>She broke up with that man</i>

601
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,160
and gave me back
the money that I lent her.

602
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,080
Here.

603
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,800
She had no intention of stealing from you.

604
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,040
She just took responsibility
for what her lover did.

605
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,880
Just like how your dad
was accused of stealing?

606
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,920
My dad's subordinate took the money.

607
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,560
My dad took responsibility
for not being able to get the money back.

608
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,360
The whole thing became a scandal
after my dad already passed away.

609
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,480
My dad has been branded

610
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,280
as a fraud up until today.

611
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,440
Like how everyone here thinks him to be.

612
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,160
One day, the truth will come out

613
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,680
that it wasn't me who stole the money.

614
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,560
You must keep doing good deeds.

615
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,400
Your integrity and honesty

616
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,840
are the only things that can save you.

617
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,760
Yes, Dad. I'll wait for that day.

618
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Wichai.

619
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,200
If what people say isn't true,

620
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,120
why didn't you tell everyone
what really happened?

621
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,760
Because it's no use.

622
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,640
Most people can't resist the chance
to feel superior to others.

623
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,960
When someone does something bad,

624
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,320
people never hesitate to criticize them
in order to appear superior.

625
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,520
People like to show off their virtue
by pointing out others' flaws.

626
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,800
It's because we want
to look good in others' eyes.

627
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,640
What I'm trying to say is,

628
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,960
we shouldn't be too quick
to judge someone.

629
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,280
So that's why

630
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,120
you see me as a shallow woman.

631
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,440
You also didn't hesitate to criticize me.

632
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,960
Don't you remember

633
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,480
what you said at the train station?

634
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,480
Being poor doesn't make you a thief.

635
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,960
Just like how education
doesn't necessarily make you smart.

636
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,360
You can't judge people
based on something like that.

637
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,240
Once you learned the truth,

638
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,840
you looked down on my intelligence.

639
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,080
Now who's the one

640
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,720
that wants to show off their virtue
by pointing out others' flaws?

641
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,120
You're right.

642
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,880
You think I'm shallow
just because I'm rich.

643
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,760
So what?

644
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,120
You think you understand the world
better than me because you're a judge?

645
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,880
You're right.

646
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,480
Everything you said is true.

647
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,440
All right.

648
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,440
Therefore,

649
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,840
it's not just me

650
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
who's narrow-minded and judgemental.

651
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,480
You shouldn't take what I said to heart.

652
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,160
Sometimes I may be
too confident in my view.

653
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,440
But that wasn't the first time

654
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,840
people spoke badly about me.

655
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Some even call me a prostitute.

656
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,640
Don't you think that's too harsh?

657
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,520
Mr. Chut?

658
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,040
He's taking a shower.
He hasn't come down yet.

659
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,320
What is it now?

660
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,760
- Is it that tramp again?
- Mom.

661
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,120
- She will hear you.
- She's a tramp.

662
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,480
Let her hear me. I'm not scared.

663
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,000
"Tramp?"

664
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,400
Well…

665
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,680
If you mean…

666
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,520
Your family also said
untrue things about me.

667
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,760
You shouldn't let
those hurtful words get to you.

668
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,760
Especially if they're from someone
who doesn't know you.

669
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,480
If you're upset,

670
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,600
you can just let it out.

671
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,840
Hold on.

672
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,840
I've heard that

673
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,200
women like to write down their worries

674
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,680
in the sand

675
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,440
and let the wind blow them away.

676
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,960
Is that what women like to do?

677
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,320
TRAMP

678
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,160
There's no sand here.

679
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,360
You can burn this instead.

680
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,280
TRAMP

681
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,680
TRAMP

682
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,720
Maybe I'm the shallow one.

683
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,120
<i>Madam!</i>

684
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,200
We've got a problem! Madam!

685
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,720
Madam!

686
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,120
Madam!

687
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,280
We've got a problem. She's here.

688
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,360
- What? Who do you mean?
- Come with me.

689
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,880
What's with you?

690
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,080
Look there. It's that tramp.

691
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,800
<i>It's not wrong to choose
what's best for yourself.</i>

692
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,320
<i>It shouldn't be hard for a perfect girl
like you to find someone worthy.</i>

693
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,600
<i>It's you</i>

694
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,560
<i>who thinks I'm not worthy
to be with your brother.</i>

695
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,360
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

696
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,480
<i>If you think Chut is the best man,</i>

697
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,640
you can help him
eliminate the competition.

698
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,680
Anong only deserves what's best.

699
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,440
<i>Anong isn't stupid.</i>

700
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,360
<i>She won't lower herself to be with him.</i>

701
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,320
I'm wondering as well
where you found a thug like that.

702
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,240
I never want to marry Sa-Ang.

703
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,160
It's all my family's idea.

704
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,400
You can't fool me,
but you can keep fooling yourself.

705
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,640
I don't want a son-in-law
with such low taste.

706
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,360
I'll find you a husband.

707
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,800
Don't bother if you can't find
anyone better than Chut.

708
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,280
Anong, are you okay?

709
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,760
When you smile,

710
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,880
I almost don't believe it's really you.

711
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,560
Right now,

712
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,440
I still haven't found a man
who makes my heart race.
