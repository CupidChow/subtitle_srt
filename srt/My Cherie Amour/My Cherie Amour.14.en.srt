00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,440
You're very sweet.

3
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,840
What did you say?

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,320
<i>You deserve compliments
when you do nice things</i>

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
<i>without expecting anything in return.</i>

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
Are you a lawyer?

7
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,240
Someone will die if you don't stop them.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
<i>Everyone is equal in the court of law.</i>

9
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,680
<i>The justice system was created
to provide everyone justice.</i>

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,960
The court asked you to come
because there's a witness from Penang.

11
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,800
The witness may not even see
what happened clearly.

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>Why must that lawyer nitpick me like that?</i>

13
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,120
The witness went off-script, so they tried

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>to get the judge to believe
their version of the story.</i>

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,440
<i>I suspect that</i>

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,760
she may be close with someone
on the plaintiff's side.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,600
I know Pra Atthakadee Wichai.

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
She's the woman I'm dating.

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,280
Anong. Wait up.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm so sorry for getting you in trouble.

21
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,440
I also didn't think this through,
so they were able to use it against us.

22
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,600
Your reputation
wouldn't have been tarnished

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,720
if I hadn't moved in with you.

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
I led everyone here to believe
that I'm your wife when I'm not.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,400
It is only a problem
because there's a conflict of interest

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
that's related to the case.

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,680
We're two adults who chose to be together.

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,480
We didn't do anything wrong.

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,600
But I made you look bad

30
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
in the eyes of the people here.

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,120
I get it now

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,800
why you wanted me to go back to Bangkok.

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,480
We can't change what people think.

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,040
And we don't need to prove ourselves
to make people approve of us.

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
What we need to do

36
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,880
is to keep our focus on the trial
and stick to the facts.

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,720
We can't let those guys divert
people's attention away from the case.

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,160
The witness's testimony proved that
the metal pipe that fell from the bridge

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,000
was merely an accident.

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
The plaintiff's demand for damages

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
can be considered unreasonable.

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,440
It caused the construction

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,400
to fall behind schedule,
leaving the defendant's company

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,640
with only five days
to complete the project.

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,040
The completion of this bridge

46
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,240
will benefit the public at large.

47
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,240
If the bridge isn't completed on schedule,

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,480
the community as a whole will be affected.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,520
Therefore, I'd like for this case
to be dismissed for the sake of justice.

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
What? That's not right.

51
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
You can't do that.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,840
The plaintiff's attorney will now
give a closing statement.

53
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,160
The accident that happened
could've been prevented

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,240
considering the expertise that
the witness possesses as an engineer.

55
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,680
Inadequate safety measures
are indicative of negligence.

56
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,960
Therefore, if we allow
the defendant's company to continue

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,120
with the construction of the bridge,

58
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,920
there's a risk of
similar accidents taking place.

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,200
In the past,

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
there was a law which required

61
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
contractors to set up campsites
by the construction areas.

62
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
With that said,

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,720
if the defendant agrees
to reside at the construction site

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
for the remaining period
of the project to make sure

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,160
that there are no more injuries or deaths,

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,920
that is what's considered
a public service.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,680
If the defendant continues to push
the responsibility onto the people,

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,880
it would show that

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,440
he has no conscience

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,440
and no intention
of addressing the problem.

71
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,360
Hear, hear.

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
- Well said.
- That's right.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,480
Order in the court!

74
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,080
Do you think this is a kangaroo court

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,480
where you can say whatever you please?

76
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,760
You're trying to get people
to pressure us to take responsibility.

77
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,760
That's a dirty tactic.

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,240
If you didn't use
your connections to get this job,

79
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,080
then prove it to us.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,480
Show us you're capable
of carrying out this project.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,120
Do you really have to go?
Why must you put yourself through this?

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,840
We have to show the government

83
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,120
that we won't let influential people
take advantage of us.

84
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,120
We must be willing to go all in
if we want to hold those guys accountable.

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
But even so,

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,320
what would be the point
if we have to accept

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,240
whatever the court decides?

88
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,800
But if Thian-chai refuses
to come to the site,

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,160
he will be shunned by the whole community.

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,600
It doesn't matter that
he's the mayor's son-in-law.

91
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,960
The people here have the power
to make his life miserable.

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
Thank you.

93
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Will he really come?

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Maybe he's backed out of the deal.

95
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,080
You're all dirty, Wichai.

96
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,400
You're too kind to me.

97
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm not used to
being taken care of like this.

98
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,640
You'll spoil me if you keep indulging me.

99
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,880
You do so much for others.
This is the least I can do for you.

100
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,520
What will you do if I become spoiled?

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,600
You should spoil yourself once in a while.

102
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,880
Do you even know how to do that?

103
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Of course I do.

104
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,679
You always give your family
what they want.

105
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,960
You've never asked for anything
that you're entitled to.

106
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,400
So I'll change that.

107
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,080
I'll give you love and support
without you having to ask me.

108
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,720
I'll make you so happy that
you'll choke on all the happiness.

109
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,920
Is that how you plan to kill me?

110
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,520
You make me feel like
I'll never be good enough for you.

111
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,640
The longer I'm here,
the more I feel like I don't deserve you.

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,160
Good guys like you are one in a hundred.

113
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
That's nonsense.

114
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm the one who should say that to you.

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
I've never met anyone who would sacrifice

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
their own happiness
for the interest of others.

117
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,040
Our country needs
a dedicated man like you.

118
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,080
A good civil servant like you
can make our country a better place.

119
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,920
So I'll make sure
to take very good care of you.

120
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
I was being inappropriate again.

121
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,800
You should do it more often.

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,640
So people get used to it.

123
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,680
He's here. Come and see.

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,720
I didn't think he'd come.

125
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,200
He could be setting up camp
just to fool us.

126
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,760
But he brought his family with him.
He probably doesn't want to lose face.

127
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,840
We can't let him out of our sight.

128
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,200
If he wants the work to get done fast,

129
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,360
he should stay
until the construction is finished.

130
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,960
Why don't we go
and stay with Wichai at the campsite?

131
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,880
I don't want to cause any more scandals.

132
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
I suspect that

133
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Wichai might've gone
to stay at the campsite

134
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
so he could be away from me.

135
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,120
But I think

136
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,960
he went there because of work.

137
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
Wichai is distancing himself from me

138
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,840
because he doesn't want
people to gossip about me.

139
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
In people's eyes,

140
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm the one dragging Wichai down.

141
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,040
CHUT WARATHABUT,
CHUEN WARATHABUT, CHOY WARATHABUT

142
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,160
A lot of people came
to ask you for legal advice.

143
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,160
Will you have time
to read all these letters?

144
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,800
You can read them for me.

145
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,920
But these are personal letters.

146
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,960
That's why I want you to read them.

147
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,560
I can't ask you to help me with my case,

148
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,160
but you can handle
my personal matters for me.

149
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,160
These letters came from your family.

150
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,880
Looks like everyone wrote to you.

151
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,320
They kept sending you more letters
when you didn't write them back.

152
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,000
Goodness. I don't think
I'll be able to read all of these.

153
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,280
Do you see now why I haven't read them?

154
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
It'd take too much time for me

155
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
to go through every letter.

156
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,560
Let's see.

157
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
There are four letters from your siblings

158
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,080
and your mom wrote to you every other day.

159
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,840
Everyone wrote to complain about Chantorn.

160
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,320
Your mother wrote that
Chut has gotten a lot thinner

161
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,320
and she blames it on Chantorn.

162
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,960
Your mom even blamed her

163
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,440
for being the reason why
you decided to leave home.

164
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,520
So what do you think

165
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,560
I should write back to her?

166
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,640
You should tell her

167
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,240
that you came here because of me.

168
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
You should tell everyone

169
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
who it is that you really love.

170
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,360
Everyone just dumps their emotions on you.

171
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,600
Do you see now

172
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,760
what you'll have to deal with
if we're married?

173
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,560
Your family tore a nice girl
like Chantorn to pieces.

174
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,960
Won't they do even worse to me
if they know we're together?

175
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,960
Your mother really dislikes me.

176
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
She will blow a fuse
if she knows about us.

177
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,960
Maybe not.

178
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm not her golden child.

179
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Maybe she'll let this slide.

180
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,400
Did you let me read your letters

181
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,040
so that I would get scared and give up?

182
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
No.

183
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,840
I just want you to be prepared

184
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,280
for what's to come.

185
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
Because from now on,
I will write about you

186
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,320
in all of my letters.

187
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Everyone seems protective of you,
but that doesn't bother me.

188
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
It's because I know

189
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,360
that my brothers will also try
to find fault with you.

190
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,640
So I guess that makes us even.

191
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,560
Our families might try
to keep us from being together.

192
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,360
They won't think we're a good match.

193
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,960
But we're in the same boat now,
so we have to stick together.

194
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm the one taking all the heat

195
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,000
for being involved with you.

196
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,480
If you also love me like I love you,

197
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,600
then we should face
every problem together.

198
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,480
Anong. Wichai. Come here.

199
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,319
We had it all wrong

200
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,839
about Thian-chai's family.

201
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,079
That kid isn't his legitimate son.

202
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,800
And that woman is only his mistress.

203
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,560
This is his wife.

204
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,599
Thian-chai married the mayor's daughter
so he'd have power and influence.

205
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,440
Does he have a mistress
and a secret child?

206
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
It's no secret, ma'am.

207
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,080
Everyone here knows
that his wife can't have children.

208
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,200
How can his wife be okay with this?

209
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,960
I'll take these.

210
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,440
Hello.

211
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,000
Hello.

212
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,080
Did you move here with your husband?

213
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,680
I think you've probably heard
what people say about me.

214
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
You mean the rumor
that you ran away here with a man?

215
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,800
Yes.

216
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,960
When people know
I'm not actually Wichai's wife,

217
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,240
everyone looks at me differently.

218
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,880
I thought I'd be able to get along
with the people here,

219
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
but now I'm not so sure.

220
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,640
It's difficult.

221
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,480
I also don't get along with everyone
though I was born and raised here.

222
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,760
Wichai told me to prove myself

223
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,240
by trying to get people to compliment me.

224
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,320
If I can prove
that my presence here has a purpose,

225
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
he'll believe that I can survive here.

226
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
Compliments?

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
Do women really get such things?

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,120
If you don't have a pretty face,

229
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,680
you need to have a kind heart

230
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,560
to make up for it.

231
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,120
If you're a pretty girl

232
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
who is feisty and unladylike,

233
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
people will think that you have no worth.

234
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,480
I'm a submissive woman who can't get

235
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,480
her own husband to stay faithful to her.

236
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,880
So people say that
I must've done something wrong.

237
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,080
What are those people doing?

238
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,800
This is where the locals gather

239
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,800
to share their knowledge.

240
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,240
They teach others
how to cook, bake, and weave.

241
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,520
All the girls here

242
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,160
must know how to cook and bake.

243
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,080
Most importantly,
they must know how to weave

244
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,040
once they become adults.

245
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,440
I see.

246
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
It's so hot.

247
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Hey, the boss is coming. Get up.

248
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
Wait, everyone.

249
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,080
I have a favor to ask you.

250
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,760
Can you read this for me?

251
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,400
How about you? Can you read this for me?

252
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,120
These guys should be working.

253
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,520
- Why are you bothering them?
- I was just wondering.

254
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,840
I wanted to check

255
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,840
whether the workers here

256
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,400
have gotten enough rest.

257
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,560
None of them has the strength
to catch this piece of paper.

258
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,960
It's like all of them are half asleep.

259
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,560
Butt out and let them work.

260
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,840
We're trying to meet the deadline here.

261
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
It's dangerous.

262
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,160
Working with these machines
puts all the workers' lives in danger.

263
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,560
People could get hurt.

264
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
I know they don't let any of you rest.

265
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,280
You haven't slept.
How long will you put up with this?

266
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,840
<i>If he walked back to his campsite,</i>

267
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,560
he would have plenty of time
to finish his cigarette.

268
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
We can't help those people

269
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,760
if they don't stand up for themselves.

270
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,360
Anong.

271
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,200
Hey.

272
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,120
Where did you get that?

273
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,120
Thian-chai's wife said
someone sold her this bracelet.

274
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,440
I recognized it, so I bought it from her.

275
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,240
Those people come here

276
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,960
because they know you'll give them money.

277
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,440
I feel bad listening to their stories.

278
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,240
They can't afford the court fees.

279
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,240
I don't mind giving up my things

280
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,600
if it means I can help those people
get back on their feet.

281
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,960
I know that you have money,

282
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,560
but I don't want you
to trouble yourself for me.

283
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,280
There are other ways to help people
besides giving them money.

284
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,760
More importantly,

285
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,120
this shows that I failed
to provide for you.

286
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,480
Why do you think
you have to provide for me?

287
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
I can provide for myself.

288
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,640
- My gosh!
- Watch out!

289
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,840
Come on! Hurry!

290
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,440
Let's go.

291
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Come on.

292
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,920
Damn it. Are you all right?

293
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,960
Look after my wife and kid.

294
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
You morons! How could you let that happen?

295
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,720
Were you trying to kill me?
My family was right there.

296
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,480
You bastards would have nothing

297
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,640
if it weren't for me!

298
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,640
And you.

299
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
You screwed everything up.

300
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,280
You're fired! Get out!

301
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,920
You too! Get the hell out!

302
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,560
All of you are fired! Just get out!

303
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
What happened?

304
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,160
Get lost!

305
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,760
These contracts…

306
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,160
- The workers are illiterate.
- Right.

307
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,720
They can't read or write.

308
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,920
How can they understand the contract?

309
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,840
The plaintiff filed a complaint
regarding an accident

310
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,080
where construction material fell on him

311
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,640
and injured him.

312
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,760
Based on the proof of damage

313
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
and proof of injury presented,

314
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,960
it's evident that

315
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,960
Chamnankan Construction Company

316
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,360
performed substandard work

317
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,960
which poses a danger to the people.

318
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,320
It can be considered that

319
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,240
the defendant who represents
Chamnankan Construction Company

320
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,440
committed a tortious act
against the plaintiff,

321
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,800
including those
who have been affected by the incident.

322
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,400
The contractor who's responsible
for the bridge construction was found

323
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,640
to be negligent of his duties

324
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,360
and must be held liable.

325
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,280
He must pay the plaintiff compensation

326
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,160
for the damage he has caused.

327
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,080
In addition, the construction
of the bridge shall be suspended

328
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,560
until an inspection has been carried out

329
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,480
as required by the law.

COURTROOM 709

331
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,400
Hey.

332
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Come on.

333
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,480
The people here can live in peace
now that we've taken Thian-chai down.

334
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,760
They won't have to live in fear
of his influence anymore.

335
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,680
I've never been more proud
of the work that I've done.

336
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,120
See? Your skills and knowledge
can help a lot of people.

337
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,560
You may no longer be a judge,

338
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,560
but you can still help people

339
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,080
by working as a lawyer.

340
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,080
I hope you don't mind
that they paid us with fish sauce.

341
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,280
- What? This is fish sauce?
- Yes.

342
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,000
There are so many bottles.

343
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,200
There's still more.
Bring the rest over here, guys.

344
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,240
Come on. Hurry.

345
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't mind at all.

346
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,680
I'm happy that we could make
this community a better place.

347
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,440
This fish sauce is made by locals.

348
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,400
I hope you like it.

349
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,240
- I can't wait to try it.
- I'll help you carry these bottles home.

350
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
- I'll carry them for you.
- Thank you.

351
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,440
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's help each other.

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,040
Did Anong say why she moved out?

354
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,480
She's probably ashamed of herself.

355
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,240
It's scandalous
how she just moved in with you.

356
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
You'd lose people's respect
if this happened

357
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,840
while you were a judge.

358
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,880
Here are the names of the workers
Anong collected before she left.

359
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,480
These workers want you to represent them
in suing the company.

360
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,440
Anong talked to all these workers
by herself?

361
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
You have a lot of work to do.

362
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
Maybe it's a good thing
that she's not here to distract you.

363
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,840
This isn't lust.

364
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,200
This is love.

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
ADUL, SOMPORN, SAMORN

366
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,040
PITA, WALEE, SOMRAK

367
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,720
- I see.
- This is how you do it.

368
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,960
All right. I see.

369
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,200
Thank you.

370
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
What are you doing?

371
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,840
I'm weaving.

372
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,200
I can see that.

373
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
I'm just wondering why you're doing it.

374
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
All the women here know how to weave.

375
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,600
I want to learn how to do it

376
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,240
so I can fit in.

377
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,920
It's getting late.
When will you come home?

378
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,320
There's no loom for me to use at home.

379
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,400
But if you want me to come home now,

380
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,760
then give me a couple
of compliments first.

381
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,440
I just need two more compliments,
then I'll move back in with you.

382
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,600
So what do you think of my weaving?

383
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,840
I won't fall for it.

384
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,280
Just stay wherever you want.

385
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,240
You said you don't want to marry me.

386
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
But I know you secretly tried
to get my ring size.

387
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
I'm onto you.

388
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
You're planning to ask me to marry you.

389
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
Right?

390
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,280
I see you won't admit it.

391
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,160
But that's all right. I forgive you.

392
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,640
You can ask me to marry you

393
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,080
once you've got the ring ready.

394
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,200
I can wait.

395
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,320
Damn.

396
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,600
Don't tell me you miss her already.

397
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,040
Mark my words.

398
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,560
She'll move in here as your wife
in less than a month.

399
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,280
Hey. Show some respect
when you talk about her.

400
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,720
She's clearly flirting with you.
She's even woven you a shawl.

401
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,120
A shawl?

402
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
What shawl?

403
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,120
Come on. It's a local tradition.

404
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,920
A woman will weave a shawl
for the man she will marry

405
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,200
so he can wear it on their wedding day.

406
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,320
Girls are taught how to weave
when they're about to get married.

407
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,760
A woman will weave
a special shawl in advance

408
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,720
to give to the man
who asks for her hand in marriage.

409
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,320
Every woman here puts
extra effort into weaving this shawl

410
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,840
for her special day.

411
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,360
Are you still here?

412
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,199
What are you doing here?

413
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,320
You left this at my place.

414
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,280
Well…

415
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,679
I see.

416
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,639
I don't wear this perfume anymore.

417
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,000
It attracts mosquitoes.

418
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,000
You haven't noticed that
I've been wearing a new perfume?

419
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,800
This is the perfume I've been wearing

420
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,760
since you went to stay at the campsite.

421
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,000
It smells nice.

422
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,840
Wichai, what's gotten into you?

423
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,520
You'd normally get nervous
when I do something like this.

424
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
This is what I like about you.

425
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,840
Do you know that?

426
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,120
You're a very sincere person.

427
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,440
Did you just compliment me?

428
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,880
Goodness.

429
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,400
You absolutely refused
to compliment me earlier this evening.

430
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,960
I've been watching you for a while.

431
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,080
I wanted to see whether you'd change

432
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,800
after we started dating.

433
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,640
When people get what they want,

434
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
they tend to take that thing for granted.

435
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,040
I wanted to see if you'd still care for me
after I gave you my heart.

436
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,960
Are you proposing to me?

437
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,520
No.

438
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,600
I'll spend the night with you.

439
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,880
What?

440
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,560
I just want to keep you company.

441
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,680
You won't ask me to marry you.

442
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,560
Yet you have no problem
asking to stay the night with me.

443
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,080
I've never seen you blush before
until now.

444
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,120
It's a nice sight to see.

445
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Come on.

446
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,960
Let's go home.

447
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
Be careful.

448
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,760
It's so dark, Wichai.

449
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,080
A GUIDE TO WICHAI WARATHABUT

450
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,080
Someone broke in last night.

451
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,440
But I don't think they took anything.

452
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,040
Master.

453
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,400
Does it have to do with the case?

454
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,200
Maybe they are trying to get back at us.

455
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,520
Should we tell the police?

456
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Let's wait and see.
It's still not that serious.

457
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,600
Will you wait until they hurt us?

458
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,520
Let's try to stay calm.

459
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Don't tell Anong about this.

460
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,960
Keep an eye on things for now.

461
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,520
You have a client
who lives all the way out here?

462
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
This means you're famous now.

463
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,360
So where is your client's house?

464
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,160
We're not here for work.

465
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,000
We're here on holiday.

466
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,880
You've been here for months
without getting to visit the beach.

467
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,920
Prasit. Wichai took us here for a holiday.

468
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,360
Really, Wichai? Are you serious?

469
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,880
Let's go explore the island.

470
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,840
- Let's go.
- Hold up. This is my turf.

471
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,360
Let me lead the way. Follow me.

472
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,720
Come on, guys.

473
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,120
So where should we go first?

474
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,360
Come on down.

475
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,680
Be careful.

476
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,040
Come on, Prasit.

477
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,360
A GUIDE TO WICHAI WARATHABUT

478
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,320
Is this a guidebook about you?

479
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,320
"Number one,
I've never chased after a woman.

480
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,120
I don't really know how to do it.

481
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't even know

482
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,640
how to let a woman know
I'm interested in her."

483
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,960
I already know this about you.
That's why I made the first move.

484
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,840
I was afraid you would mind

485
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,600
that I was once married to a girl
that my mom found for me.

486
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,880
I might've still been single

487
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,600
if my mom hadn't arranged
for me to get married.

488
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,200
This guide counts
as you making a move on me.

489
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,880
You're a quick learner.

490
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,600
I'll give you that.

491
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,320
You should read the rest of it.

492
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
Just give it a read

493
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,040
to see whether you can accept
who I am as a person.

494
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,160
"I'm a boring guy.

495
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,240
In the eyes of others,

496
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,840
I'm like a wallflower

497
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,840
that's rarely the center of attention.

498
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,160
You might get bored of me when you see

499
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,600
how invisible I am in others' eyes."

500
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,800
You're the center of my attention
and that's enough.

501
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,680
If other girls can see what I see,

502
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,480
they might steal you from me.

503
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,760
We all have our own preferences.

504
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,160
Forget what people think of you.

505
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,360
What matters is that you know
what kind of person you like.

506
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,600
Ever since I realized
what kind of man I like,

507
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,520
there's nothing holding me back
from chasing after that person.

508
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,000
Anong.

509
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,840
Your brothers might've spoiled you
since you're the youngest.

510
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,400
But I'm the eldest brother.

511
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,640
I can't choose what's best for me.

512
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,160
I'll always have to put my siblings first.

513
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,600
If you want to be with me,
you need to understand

514
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,080
that we might not get
the best of everything in life.

515
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,800
I'll make everyone jealous of you
for having the best partner.

516
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,880
You'll have the best wife
a man could ask for.

517
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,640
Gosh.

518
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
There's no talking sense into you.

519
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,120
Well…

520
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,280
I'm okay with what I've read so far.

521
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,640
I can handle whatever hangups
or inhibitions you have.

522
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,760
Let's go play in the water.

523
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,560
<i>I can't really distinguish colors.</i>

524
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
<i>I don't know the cost of things.</i>

525
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
<i>You could say I have bad taste.</i>

526
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,000
<i>I can't tell what's cheap or expensive.</i>

527
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,640
<i>It's possible that</i>

528
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,880
<i>you'll never get a gift
that you like from me.</i>

529
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,560
<i>I never lock my bedroom door.</i>

530
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,920
<i>Anyone can come
into my room as they please.</i>

531
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,360
They're over there.

532
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,840
Get me my pants.

533
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,280
<i>People always want me
to solve their problems.</i>

534
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,360
<i>Your life will become very chaotic.</i>

535
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,160
<i>You won't have any personal space.</i>

536
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,360
<i>I don't live a lavish lifestyle
because of what happened to my dad.</i>

537
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,040
<i>Ever since he was charged
with embezzlement,</i>

538
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,160
<i>my family learned to live modestly.</i>

539
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,840
Let's go, Boi!

540
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,880
Go faster!

541
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,080
<i>I was taught to never overspend.</i>

542
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
<i>So I've never been wasteful.</i>

543
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,080
<i>I fear that this might embarrass
a woman of your status.</i>

544
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,400
I've decided that

545
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,800
I can handle everything
that I've read about you.

546
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,800
Then that means
we can spend our lives together.

547
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,880
Are you asking me to marry you?

548
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,680
If you'll have me.

549
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,240
Will you marry me?

550
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,840
But I'm not just proposing to you.

551
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,680
I want you to do something for me.

552
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
Can you go wait for me in Bangkok?

553
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,720
If we're to get married, I want
to do it right according to tradition.

554
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,280
But you said we would live here together.

555
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,120
It's dangerous here.

556
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,920
I couldn't get
five compliments from people.

557
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,400
Is that why you think I don't belong here?

558
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,240
I don't want your family to think
that we're rushing into this.

559
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,080
That's why I want you to go home.

560
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,560
We'll do this right
according to tradition.

561
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,640
You have to promise me

562
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,160
that we'll live together

563
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,160
once we're married.

564
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,440
I refuse to be away from you.

565
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,320
I promise.

566
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,320
Can you at least give me
something to look forward to?

567
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,920
Promise me that we'll come back
to watch the sunset here together.

568
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,120
I promise that we'll always be together.

569
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,440
Please marry me.

570
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,160
We don't need to go home now.

571
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,000
I had someone send a letter
from Hua Hin to our family.

572
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,240
No one suspects that we're here.

573
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,960
They won't even suspect anything
once we're home.

574
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,760
We've been here for a while.

575
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,320
We should go home before we get caught.

576
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,200
Wichai!

577
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,200
There's a big problem!

578
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,400
You must come with me!

579
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,200
What happened? Is Boi okay?

580
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,080
Did something bad happen? What's going on?

581
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,960
The villagers organized a wedding for you.

582
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,360
- What?
- That's right.

583
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,520
You see, we don't have money
to pay you for the legal fees.

584
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,040
We don't know

585
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,240
how to repay you
for the kindness you've shown us.

586
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,600
So we decided to organize a wedding

587
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,440
for you and your lady.

588
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,120
Well…

589
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,280
Actually,

590
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,560
you don't need to do this.

591
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,240
You don't have to repay me.

592
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,160
But I really appreciate the gesture.

593
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,960
Don't be rude, Wichai.

594
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,280
What?

595
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,280
Everyone went out of their way
to organize a wedding for us.

596
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,320
Why don't we just get married now?

597
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,680
Anong.

598
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,560
Thank you all for being here.

599
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
We both really appreciate it.

600
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Let's go get you dressed.

601
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,360
- Okay.
- Get her dressed?

602
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,840
Just come with us, ma'am.
Come right this way.

603
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,320
Come with us, sir.

604
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,120
You need to get dressed.

605
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,160
- Come stand over here.
- All right.

606
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,720
- Right here? Okay.
- Yes. Let's get you dressed.

607
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,680
My gosh.

608
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,720
This is great.
You can have kids once you're married.

609
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,680
Hey. Listen, Prasit.

610
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,760
Go stop Anong.

611
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,080
Anong? I see.
You want to see your bride, right?

612
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,240
You're so impatient.

613
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,160
- I'll go tell her.
- Just wait a moment.

614
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,120
This is the shawl
that your bride wove for you.

615
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,440
You have to make sure
everything is done right.

616
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,160
The wedding ceremony

617
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,680
will bring you blessings

618
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,320
of happiness and long-lasting love.

619
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,440
- My goodness.
- She's so beautiful.

620
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,960
Here comes the bride.

621
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,160
The bride is here.

622
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,880
Here she comes.

623
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Please excuse us for a moment.

624
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,200
Is this how you want to do this?

625
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,120
I don't see anything wrong with it.

626
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,840
Are you sure you want to do this?

627
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,040
I don't want to rush you.

628
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,800
If you're not ready,
it's not too late to call this off.

629
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,280
You don't have to do this

630
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,800
if you don't want to.

631
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,000
Are the bride and groom ready?

632
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,080
- Come on, you two.
- Let's get started.

633
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Come on, Wichai. Come here, Anong.

634
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,280
Everyone here wants us to be happy.

635
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,480
There's no reason for us to hesitate.

636
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,120
I see that you have
beautiful-looking fruit here.

637
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,240
I'm wondering if I can have it.

638
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,960
I don't have any fruit,
but you can have my sister instead.

639
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,160
Well, that was easy.

640
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,880
You can have her.

641
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,120
Are you sure the fruit is ripe

642
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,640
and ready to be picked?

643
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,120
Fruit? What fruit?

644
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,360
Do you all want to go pick fruit?

645
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,800
She's asking whether the bride is ready

646
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,480
to be married.

647
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm ready.

648
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,200
Compose yourself.

649
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,520
Don't sound so eager.

650
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,920
Just pretend to act coy
and demure like a lady.

651
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,040
So is the fruit ripe
and ready to be picked?

652
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,560
I'll let my brother decide.

653
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,720
I know you're dying to marry Wichai.

654
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,280
So just say yes.

655
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,240
He's right.

656
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,040
You're way beyond ripe at this point.

657
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,640
Just say yes already.

658
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,080
Then we can have a feast.

659
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
- Right.
- Let's eat.

660
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,240
All right, dear.

661
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,240
I wish you two a long and happy marriage.

662
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,560
May you two be together
until you're old and grey

663
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,760
with a lot of kids and grandchildren.

664
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,000
Hey. Prasit.

665
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,240
- Come on out.
- Right.

666
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,680
I hope you have kids soon.

667
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,000
<i>I'm starting to feel like
my life will be happy from here on out.</i>

668
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,960
<i>I also feel like
my life is finally worth living</i>

669
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,560
now that we're together.

670
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,840
<i>I don't have any cases to work on,</i>

671
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,240
<i>so I have time on my hands.</i>

672
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,600
Be gentle, Wichai.

673
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,640
It's getting hot in here.

674
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,320
How did you get in here?

675
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,720
Wasn't the door locked?

676
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,560
<i>The door was open,
so I thought you guys were up.</i>

677
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,760
Carry this with you if you're worried.

678
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,920
Come on, guys.

679
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,640
Let's work together.

680
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,960
- Yes!
- All right!

681
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,320
- Let's go!
- You got this!

682
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
That's the bastard.

683
