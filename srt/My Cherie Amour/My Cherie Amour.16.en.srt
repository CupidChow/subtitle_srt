00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,520
Wichai.

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
Every day that I spend
with you is extraordinary.

4
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,720
<i>So how can you say you're boring?</i>

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Someone sent me
these documents to expose him.

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,360
This person wants me
to help them take Thian-chai down.

7
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,480
About what happened yesterday,

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
the gunman wasn't sent there to kill us.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,640
<i>Yesterday, Eiam knew that
a gunman was coming to kill me.</i>

10
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,520
<i>He was going to make it look like
a fight broke out between two villages.</i>

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,920
<i>So Eiam sneaked me out of there.</i>

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,960
Thian-chai's wife wanted me to ask you

13
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400
if you would help her
file a divorce against her husband.

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
Wichai can't even protect you.

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,760
It was his fault that Prasit almost died.

16
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,680
<i>You should take Prasit to recover at home.</i>

17
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
<i>Follow me home soon.</i>

18
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,200
You once promised us

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,200
that you wouldn't marry
anyone we don't approve of.

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,080
Honestly, who would want a man
like Wichai as their brother-in-law?

21
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
Me. I like him.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,960
Anong.

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,600
You see?

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Even his own best friend

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
doesn't approve of him.

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't like what he did to you.

27
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,440
It was like he forced your hand
to be with him.

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,120
Wichai didn't steal me away.

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
I ran away to be with him.

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
How many times do I have to tell you that?

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,680
Why are you so besotted with him?

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,000
It's like he put a spell on you

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
to make you fall head over heels for him.

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,640
Wichai's job requires him to judge people.

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
But personally,

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I've never seen him
impose his own values onto others.

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,120
What I like about him is that

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
he never looks down on anyone.

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,480
Right.

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,440
Unlike some people here.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,280
<i>I'm helping the madam
file a divorce against her husband.</i>

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>Thian-chai didn't expect that
his wife would dare divorce him.</i>

43
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,600
<i>I heard that the mayor
is very upset by this matter.</i>

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
<i>He's afraid that his daughter
will leave Thian-chai for her driver.</i>

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
<i>This has become the talk of the town</i>

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,600
<i>after the gunman turned himself in
and confessed that</i>

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,240
<i>he was indeed hired
to kill Thian-chai's wife.</i>

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,760
Madam. Look at this.

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,520
"The beautiful socialite disappeared

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
to mend her broken heart.

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,000
She's now having a shotgun wedding
after getting knocked up.

52
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,120
We'll soon see which unlucky man
she has found to be her groom."

53
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,640
I knew that girl was up to no good.

54
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,280
She slept around
and got herself knocked up.

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,480
Maybe she did it out of spite
after getting dumped by Chut.

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,600
Chut really dodged a bullet.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,120
If he's still single, he might be the one
to offer to take responsibility.

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,960
I wonder which unlucky man
she's found to marry her.

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,000
This is just a rumor.

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,880
You're too prejudiced.

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
You're ready to believe she's pregnant
when that's not the truth.

62
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Choy is way too naive.

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,600
Will she raise her daughter
to be a fool like her?

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,400
I think that's possible.

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,960
<i>I have exciting news.</i>

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,560
<i>The government is planning to hold
a Constitution Day celebration.</i>

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,000
<i>They assigned each ministry</i>

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
<i>to select pretty women
to participate in a beauty pageant.</i>

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,320
<i>The girls will have to wear swimsuits,
so none of the women want to do it.</i>

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,560
<i>But someone thought of me
and invited me to join the contest.</i>

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,680
<i>They think I should be
forward-thinking enough to do it.</i>

72
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,640
<i>Those who participate
in the contest can't be married.</i>

73
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,760
<i>They have to be single.</i>

74
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,480
<i>The contest is at the end of the year.</i>

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
<i>If I agree to do this,
it means we can't get married yet.</i>

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,480
<i>But I already turned them down.</i>

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,400
<i>I told them I can't wait that long
since I have plans to get married.</i>

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,880
ANONG

79
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,400
Master!

80
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,000
Master!

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,440
Looks like a storm is coming.

82
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Thank you.

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,720
BIG STORM HITS TRANG

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,080
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE MISSING
AND SEVERAL DEAD

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,200
Is there a letter for me from Wichai?

86
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
No, ma'am.

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
Prasit.

88
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,440
I haven't heard from Wichai in a few days.

89
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Maybe he's busy.

90
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
There's a storm in Trang.

91
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
The waves are huge.

92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
BIG STORM HITS TRANG

93
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,480
He's probably lost at sea somewhere.

94
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,320
We still haven't heard from Wichai.
We can't contact anyone.

95
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,760
We also haven't heard from Boi.

96
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,280
All we can do is pray for Wichai's safety.

97
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,800
Mom is about to go make merit for Wichai

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,120
and pray to the gods to protect him.

99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,280
Thank you so much
for coming to ask about him.

100
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
- Let's go, Choy.
- Okay.

101
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,240
If you need me to,

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,240
I'll go to Trang and look for Wichai.

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,320
It's okay. Chut already said he would go.

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
If there's anything I can do,

105
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,200
please let me know.

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,120
Thank you.

107
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,200
How is Anong doing?

108
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,880
She hasn't slept or eaten.

109
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,120
She seems weak and often gets dizzy.

110
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
Don't tell anyone about this.

111
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,440
Shouldn't we get a doctor to examine her?

112
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,720
Wichai has the nerve to leave her
after doing this to her.

113
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,560
What will we do
if something really happens to him?

114
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
He's a scumbag for leaving Anong

115
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,880
to carry his baby.

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
It's here.

117
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,560
Wichai sent you a letter, Anong.

118
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,120
It's from Trang.

119
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>No matter what happens,
please know that I love you.</i>

120
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,640
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
PLEASE KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

121
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,160
What's the matter? Is everything okay?

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
What's wrong?

123
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
Why are you all acting weird? Let me see.

124
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,960
Anong.

125
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
It's okay, Anong.

126
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
- Direk.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
Send someone to look for Wichai.

128
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,240
Tell them to bring him back
even if he's dead.

129
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,440
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,120
It's okay, Anong.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
I promise.

132
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
I'll bring him back to you.

133
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,720
Chut was about to go find Wichai,
but then we received a letter.

134
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Hurry up and read it.

135
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
What happened?

136
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,400
Is Wichai okay?
Why are you making that face?

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,680
He's more than okay.
He's planning to get married.

138
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,000
"I'm on my way home.
I'm going to ask a girl to marry me."

139
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,360
Is he getting married?

140
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,160
Who will Wichai marry?

141
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm wondering the same thing, ma'am.

142
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,400
This is impossible.
How can Wichai get married?

143
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,320
Chut, are you sure
this is addressed to us?

144
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,040
Yes. This is our address.

145
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
We were worried for nothing.

146
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,400
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

147
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,400
This can't be happening.
How can Wichai get married?

148
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,400
That letter can't be from him.

149
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
I am his mom.

150
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,640
Why don't I know anything about this?

151
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
Who is Wichai marrying?

152
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,960
This can't be true.

153
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,600
Anong.

154
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,120
Are you here to hear news about Wichai?

155
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,920
Right.

156
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,280
She's here to get an update
about the situation.

157
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,680
At least this is good news.

158
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,040
Wichai is coming home.

159
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
Aren't you all happy about that?

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Wichai isn't even home yet
and he just dropped a bomb on us.

161
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,080
What if he's being fooled by some woman?

162
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,480
My gosh. Who is he planning to marry?
Why don't I know about this?

163
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,320
Wichai!

164
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I thought I wouldn't make it back.

165
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,720
Do you know how worried I was about you?

166
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,080
I just realized that
I haven't been taking good care of you.

167
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,320
That's the only reason
that I can't let myself die yet.

168
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
I don't want to make you cry.

169
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,680
I won't let anything happen to you
as long as I'm alive.

170
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,400
Forget the beauty pageant.

171
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
Just be my bride.

172
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,840
May I have your permission to marry Anong?

173
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,880
Isn't it a bit too late to ask me that?

174
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I fought my way back home

175
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,160
just for this reason.

176
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,280
<i>You gave us no choice</i>

177
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
but to say yes to you.

178
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,400
I admit that what we did was wrong,

179
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,440
but we didn't do anything inappropriate.

180
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,320
They're already married.

181
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,920
As a judge,

182
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
you make people take an oath.

183
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,920
So you shouldn't go around

184
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,960
telling lies to others.

185
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,440
The people there
only threw a small wedding for us.

186
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,120
It was just a celebration.

187
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,160
Anong and I agreed that
we'd have another wedding here.

188
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
I'll have my family come
and ask for her hand.

189
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm ready to take full responsibility.

190
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,920
You barely made it back home.

191
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
How will you be able
to take care of Anong?

192
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I'll rejoin the government service.

193
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,240
We won't have to move
if I get to work here as a judge.

194
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,360
That's good.

195
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,520
I won't let Anong live a rough life.

196
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,280
I promise that I won't let Anong
go through any hardships.

197
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
You've all taken good care of her

198
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,119
and I'll make sure to do even better.

199
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,680
Hey, Wichai. Get over here.

200
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,960
Who are you planning to marry?
You've never shown interest in anyone.

201
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,480
Now you suddenly want to get married.

202
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,000
Tell me who the woman is.

203
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,119
How did you two know each other?

204
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,440
You already know this person.

205
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,040
She is someone who's close to our family.

206
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,120
Who is it?

207
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm marrying Anong.

208
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
That name sounds familiar.

209
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,160
That's right.

210
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,640
It's Anong Suntorapong,
the girl who lives next door.

211
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,600
What?

212
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,760
Do you mean Anong?

213
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
Anong who used to date Chut?

214
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Are you going to take responsibility
for the baby?

215
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,680
What are you talking about? What baby?

216
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,080
Anong is pregnant.
Didn't she tell you that?

217
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,480
Everyone knows about it.

218
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,720
You're a fool for letting her
trick you into marrying her.

219
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Listen, Mom. Anong isn't--

220
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,520
Here. Just take a look at this.

221
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,400
So you're the unlucky man
who will be marrying her?

222
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
WE'LL SOON SEE WHICH UNLUCKY MAN

223
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,800
SHE HAS FOUND TO BE HER GROOM

224
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,920
<i>Someone must've told the press</i>

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,880
that I was with you in Trang.

226
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,600
It has to be someone in my family

227
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,600
since no one else knew about this.

228
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,400
Someone in my family
must have ratted us out.

229
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,080
It's no wonder why
all your brothers seem to detest me.

230
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,600
They all act like
they won't let you marry me.

231
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,040
They probably think I'm pregnant.

232
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,520
If that's what they want to believe,

233
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,280
we can let them think what they want.

234
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,160
Anong, we can't do that.

235
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,320
This rumor is hurting your reputation.

236
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,160
If my brothers think I'm not pregnant,

237
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,680
they will never let us get married.

238
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,600
I think we should go along with it
and let everyone think I'm pregnant.

239
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,400
We can't lie about something like this.

240
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,440
Soon enough,
people are going to know the truth.

241
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,080
No one will see me in a better light
even if I try to defend myself.

242
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,720
People don't care about the truth.

243
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,280
They just want to have
something to gossip about.

244
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,080
I'd rather it be me than you
who's the target of gossip.

245
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,480
Anong.

246
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,640
This isn't spicy. You can eat this.

247
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
You need to eat more.

248
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,000
You're getting too thin.

249
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,760
I heard that Chuang wants her daughter
to study accounting.

250
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,120
Her dad wants her to get a good education.

251
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,760
And how is Luang Sak doing?
Does he still have a headache?

252
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,120
I have some medicine
that can help with that.

253
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,480
He said it comes and goes.

254
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,440
So he and Chuang moved
their family abroad.

255
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,080
Is that so?

256
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
I see.

257
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,240
Right, Chut.

258
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,760
My store now carries
the new model of radio that you want.

259
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,000
You should come to check it out.

260
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,280
How did you know about that?

261
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
I let her read all of your letters.

262
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,960
So she knows about everything.

263
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,200
I usually ask Anong to help me

264
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,400
type up the letters that I sent you.

265
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,240
Did you have someone come
to fix the rain gutter yet?

266
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,960
I remember that you wanted Wichai
to help pay for the repair.

267
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,160
Did you give your mom the money, Wichai?

268
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,960
I don't want you to think that

269
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,120
I intentionally keep things to myself.

270
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,760
You really know a lot.

271
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,040
I suppose we really are close
since you know so much about us.

272
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,840
I truly apologize
if I overstepped my boundaries.

273
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,360
It was me

274
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,720
who gave Anong permission
to read all of your letters.

275
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
I wanted her to know you better.

276
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,120
I wonder how much you know about Wichai.

277
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,520
If Wichai rejoins
the government service as a judge,

278
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,320
this premarital pregnancy

279
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,600
can cause people to lose respect for him

280
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,880
because it will show
that he lacks self-control.

281
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm glad you brought that up.
I want to explain--

282
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
Personally,

283
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,920
I think it'd be such a shame
if the state had a regulation against that

284
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,040
since they'd be losing
a good and capable man like Wichai.

285
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,440
He didn't do anything

286
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,560
that's against the law.

287
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,040
What he did may not be illegal,
but it is immoral.

288
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,160
You got that?

289
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I think I can explain
to the government about this,

290
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,600
but no one has yet to ask me anything.

291
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,720
You should hold off on the wedding
since the mistake is already made.

292
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,880
We'll just have to go with it.

293
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,360
Try to keep this to yourself.

294
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,840
Just wait until the baby is born.

295
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,400
Then we'll see whether
the baby really is Wichai's.

296
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
If the baby takes after his dad,

297
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
I know he will have good manners.

298
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,960
Wichai's flesh and blood
wouldn't go around

299
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,920
making spiteful comments about others.

300
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,280
But I can't say for sure

301
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,160
whether the baby will have
Wichai's self-control.

302
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,960
Show me what you've learned
since we last saw each other.

303
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,680
Can you write me something?

304
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,600
Can you write a sentence for me?

305
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Yes.

306
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
Hey.

307
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,680
Congratulations.

308
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,560
You and Ms. Anong are a perfect match.

309
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,880
You're the first person to tell me that.

310
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,560
You're a caring and generous person.

311
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,320
You need someone
straightforward like Ms. Anong

312
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
to help speak up for you.

313
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,200
Just look at how
she talked back to your mom.

314
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,880
No one would dare do that except her.

315
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,680
Where is everybody?

316
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,360
Are you going to marry Ms. Anong?

317
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
Would you like her

318
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,080
to become a part of our family?

319
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,000
If you love her, then I'll love her too.

320
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Gosh.

321
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,040
That's so sweet of you.

322
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,520
Without you,

323
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,680
Ms. Anong and I wouldn't
have ended up together.

324
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,320
She had you play matchmaker
for the longest time.

325
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,120
What are you all doing?

326
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,400
The radio just played our song, Wichai.

327
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,760
Our song?

328
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,400
You know, it's the song

329
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,080
that you like to sing for me.

330
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
I want to hear it again.
Can you come sing it for me?

331
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
All right.

332
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,720
We'll be right back.

333
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,240
- All right.
- Okay.

334
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,200
You and I know we don't have a song.

335
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,200
You just don't want me near Chantorn.

336
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,680
Let's rub our love in her face
and make her regret not choosing you.

337
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
Come on. You're not going
to make her regret anything.

338
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,720
I want her to see that
she missed out on a really great guy.

339
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,560
You really don't have to do this.

340
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,480
We've never danced together.

341
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,600
You've never asked me to dance with you.

342
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,160
You're always dancing with some other guy.

343
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,960
You'll be the only guy
I dance with from now on.

344
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,840
This is to get back at Chut.

345
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,480
Chantorn might've left you for him,

346
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,240
but you've found someone better.

347
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,800
How do you know this will work?

348
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,640
Chut might be thinking he's the lucky one

349
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,520
since his wife isn't the jealous type.

350
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
I have the right to be jealous

351
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,600
since you are mine.

352
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,120
Other women have no right

353
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,520
to be jealous of you.

354
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,680
Some people here must be annoyed
to see how in love we are.

355
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,000
No one is feeling that way.

356
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,160
Your mom doesn't want me
as her daughter-in-law.

357
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,400
But I'm going to make her see your worth.

358
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,920
You'll no longer be invisible in her eyes.

359
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,920
Anong.

360
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,880
Since when does a girl dare
show her love so openly?

361
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,760
Even Wichai is more reserved.

362
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,520
Wichai has never been seduced.

363
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,920
He's completely bewitched by that tramp.

364
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
Life has been cruel to Wichai.

365
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,080
His first marriage failed.

366
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,600
You should let him be happy.

367
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,080
Wichai could lose everything he has

368
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,560
if he doesn't have self-control.

369
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm not going to let that happen.

370
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
I sincerely apologize

371
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
for disrespecting you and Anong
with my rash actions.

372
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,560
You had never overstepped your boundaries.

373
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,920
Anong was the one who chased after you

374
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,160
and caused the matter to get out of hand.

375
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,680
It's both our decision
to start dating each other,

376
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,600
but we were wrong
for not coming to you first.

377
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
So I've brought my mom with me today

378
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,520
to ask for Anong's hand in marriage
and to talk about the dowry.

379
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,360
We're relieved that
Anong's decided to settle down,

380
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,280
especially when the person
that she will be marrying is you.

381
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,880
As for the dowry,

382
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,600
we won't ask for much.

383
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,000
What's important here is
that these two love each other.

384
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Anong is the whole package.

385
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,600
A dowry of one million baht
seems like a reasonable ask to me.

386
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,160
One million baht?

387
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,080
It's one thing
if your sister is without flaws.

388
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,960
But she's like damaged goods.

389
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,000
One million baht is just too much.

390
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,080
You seem to forget that

391
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,000
it was Wichai
who put her in this position.

392
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,680
My son also lost his chance
to be with a good woman.

393
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,080
What are you implying?

394
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,720
Calm down, everyone.

395
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,600
Let's talk about the living arrangements.

396
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Have you thought about where you'll live?

397
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,400
I have.

398
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm going to build us a house.

399
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,800
In the meantime,
we'll be staying at my family's house.

400
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,480
There will be too many people
living in that house.

401
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,920
It will be too crowded.

402
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,080
Then let's not rush the wedding.

403
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,560
They can get married
once their house is ready.

404
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,960
Are you willing to wait that long?

405
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,280
I've found an auspicious date.

406
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
It's in six weeks from now.

407
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,680
I don't want to wait any longer.

408
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,800
If you promise to build
a suitable house for Anong,

409
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,840
we'll ask for a dowry of 500,000 baht.

410
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,520
But you must throw Anong a wedding

411
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,960
that's appropriate
for a woman of her status.

412
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,840
You really think
like a banker and a businessman.

413
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,520
You even try to profit
from your sister's wedding.

414
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,680
That money is nothing
compared to what my sister has.

415
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,840
Not to mention the money
that she'll make in the future.

416
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,760
- Then let her--
- It's settled then.

417
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,200
I agree to all of your conditions
and I promise that

418
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,720
I won't touch Anong's inheritance
or any of her assets.

419
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
I want no part in her family business,

420
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,440
including the profit she makes.

421
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,360
You have my word.

422
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,760
What a relief.

423
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,880
I thought Pong would never agree
to let us get married.

424
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,560
Sompong was just unhappy with me.

425
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,840
Don't forget that he once asked me
to help get guys out of your life.

426
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,440
Pong has never been this critical of you.

427
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,880
He really tries to find fault with you
now that he knows we're getting married.

428
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,760
He just has high standards
for his sister's partner.

429
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,000
I also thought a lot of guys
didn't deserve you.

430
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,520
I need to hold myself
to the same standards.

431
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,280
I just need to earn your brothers' trust.

432
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,080
Thank you for fighting for me.

433
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,520
But you shouldn't let my brothers
bully you too much.

434
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,160
If I had known things would be this hard…

435
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,360
- What?
- What would you have done?

436
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,960
Well, I'm just thinking that

437
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,720
I should've waited

438
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,920
and asked you to marry me

439
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,120
when you were about to become a spinster.

440
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,400
If I knew you saw me as a sure thing,
I wouldn't wait for you.

441
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,880
Looks like I'm stuck with you forever.

442
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,160
Fine. Then in our next life,

443
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,199
I hope you fall in love with me first.

444
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,960
So I won't have to be the one
to chase after you.

445
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,880
I look forward to it.

446
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,400
Hello.

447
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,440
This is quite late.

448
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,679
Do you need me to go now?

449
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
Are you sure he can do this?

450
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,600
It's been almost 20 minutes.
He still can't get us a table.

451
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,200
Is he gullible or just clueless?

452
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Wichai isn't gullible.

453
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,600
He's just honest.

454
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
What's that?

455
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,760
Let me see.

456
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,920
He doesn't like to break the rules
since he's a judge.

457
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,680
He's too naive for his own good.

458
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,720
He's just like this dork.

459
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,880
Which dork?

460
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
He can't even get us a table.

461
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,200
How can he look after Anong?

462
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,080
Are you sure this guy's not dumb?

463
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,720
Hey. Wait for me.

464
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,760
What are you doing?

465
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,080
We didn't reserve a table.

466
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,760
Right this way, sir.

467
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,080
Do you think those people
made a reservation?

468
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,440
Why didn't you say you're with me?

469
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,960
Mr. Jamlong?

470
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,640
Goodness. Good evening, sir.

471
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,160
Here.

472
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,240
This is my brother-in-law.
Take good care of him.

473
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,480
It's a pleasure to serve you, sir.
I'll go prepare a table for you.

474
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,520
You're a respectable judge.

475
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,760
You need to learn
to use your title to your advantage.

476
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,640
You can use your title
to get special treatment,

477
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,560
but it can make people think
you owe them a favor.

478
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
So I try not to do it.

479
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
You're too principled.

480
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,000
It's why no one respects you.

481
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,400
Please come inside, sir.
Your table is ready.

482
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,360
Let's go.

483
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,120
Right this way, sir.

484
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Please come in.

485
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,000
- Let's go.
- Welcome.

486
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,400
Come on.

487
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,720
Let's go home.

488
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
- Hey, Sawaeng.
- Prasit, watch your step.

489
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,720
- Where's our car?
- It's over there.

490
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,720
- Right there?
- It's not that way.

491
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,280
The car is over there. Go that way.

492
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,520
- Which way do I go?
- Come on, Pong.

493
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,760
- Watch your step, Prasit.
- Come on.

494
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,120
Wait. Just hold it in.
Wait until we get to the car. Prasit.

495
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,320
- Prasit, wait.
- Pong, help him!

496
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,880
Hey. You bastard.
What the hell are you doing?

497
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm sorry. Please forgive my brother.
I'll clean this up for you.

498
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
He threw up on my car.

499
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,680
- Sir, please calm down.
- This is a mess.

500
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,800
- Gosh.
- I'll take care of it.

501
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,200
I need to lie down, Wichai.

502
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,360
Here. Just take this money.

503
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,200
This isn't enough.

504
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
Do you want more money?

505
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Here.

506
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,760
- What?
- Take this.

507
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,040
We can settle this in court.

508
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,880
See you in court.

509
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,360
You heard him. We'll see you in court.

510
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,960
- Bye.
- See you soon.

511
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,800
- Do we have to go to court?
- Hey!

512
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,520
Stop giving my name cards to people!

513
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,200
- Wichai.
- Prasit.

514
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,200
- We're almost there.
- I'm sleepy.

515
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,080
Let me help, sir.

516
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,800
- I got it from here.
- Thank you.

517
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,400
- Direk.
- Be careful, sir.

518
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,240
Come on. Watch your step.

519
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,480
- Just walk slowly.
- I feel dizzy.

520
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,920
I need to lie down.

521
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,360
- Hey.
- Let me lie down.

522
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,360
Did my brothers make you drive for them?

523
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
Why did you agree?

524
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,080
It's fine.
I think they just wanted to test me.

525
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,880
This is unacceptable.

526
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,000
- How dare they do this?
- Anong.

527
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,080
We're about to become one family.

528
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,600
I don't mind taking care of your brothers.

529
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm afraid they won't just ask you
to drive for them next time.

530
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,520
Wichai.

531
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,040
You don't need to put up with their crap.

532
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,640
You have my permission
to stand up to them.

533
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,720
Prasit is getting out of control.

534
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,760
He likes to put stuff
in my shoes every morning.

535
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,960
The other day, I pricked my foot
because he put a cactus in my shoe.

536
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,000
Thank you.

537
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,560
It serves you right.

538
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
You get naughty every time you drink.

539
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,400
What the hell is this?

540
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,440
Did you do this? Look at it!

541
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

542
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,040
- You didn't?
- No.

543
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,160
- It wasn't me.
- Get over here.

544
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,720
All you ever do is cause trouble.

545
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,120
- I should give you a beating.
- No. Don't do it.

546
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,120
- Get over here.
- Leave me alone.

547
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,840
It's not just the shoes now.

548
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,080
Prasit even caused trouble with the bird.

549
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,600
What bird?

550
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,240
It's the general's bird.

551
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,480
The general asked Sawaeng
to take care of it.

552
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,680
It suddenly said
something rude this morning.

553
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,840
Someone must've taught
those words to the bird.

554
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,640
Now Sawaeng is afraid to give the bird
back to his future father-in-law

555
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,760
since the general might think
Sawaeng taught it to curse at him.

556
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,760
I can't believe Prasit would do that.

557
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,160
I know, right?

558
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,040
Should I let the dress out
at the waist just in case?

559
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,680
What did you hear about me?

560
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,480
Oh, it's nothing.

561
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,600
I just see that
you're looking a little plump.

562
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,800
Goodness.

563
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,720
Congratulations.

564
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,600
It's almost your wedding day, right?

565
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,840
It's unbelievable

566
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,120
that you'd eventually end up
with someone in the Warathabut family.

567
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,920
Everyone wants to know who your groom is.

568
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,560
When I told them it's Wichai
who works at the court,

569
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,880
they all thought I meant the tennis court.

570
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,320
Gosh.

571
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,360
No one seems to know who Wichai is.

572
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,560
Some even think
you're marrying an imaginary man.

573
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,880
Are you here by yourself?

574
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,040
Isn't Jamlong here with you?

575
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,240
I have some errands to run today,
so I didn't ask him to come.

576
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,280
Jamlong mentioned that
he was going to take a girl

577
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,960
to see a movie.

578
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,640
I really thought

579
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,920
that he was talking about you.

580
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,440
Goodness. I wonder
who Jamlong is going to bring

581
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,320
to our wedding as his date.

582
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,600
I heard she's getting
her dressed tailored here.

583
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,520
He even gave me a check for the dress.

584
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,280
He also told me

585
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,320
to help take care of his future bride.

586
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,160
Here you go.

587
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,600
I don't think you'll need a dress

588
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,120
since you might not
be invited to the wedding.

589
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,360
Do you really want

590
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,960
a woman like her
to be the mom of your kid?

591
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,560
I'll tell you what.

592
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,040
Once we have
our wedding invitations ready,

593
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,080
I'll have one sent to you.

594
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,680
We hope to see you at our wedding.

595
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,760
Let's go.

596
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,040
We'll be back later for the dress.

597
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,320
Can I see that?

598
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,960
NUALNART SUKSAWAI - 1,000 BAHT

599
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,440
Why did you have to invite her?

600
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
People call you Priest Atthakadee Wichai.

601
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,040
Are you trying to live up to that name?

602
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,520
No.

603
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,600
I invited her to the wedding

604
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,880
so we can tell her and everyone else
that you're not pregnant.

605
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,240
She already knows that.

606
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,200
She's just looking
to destroy my reputation.

607
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,200
Is Sa-Ang the reason
your brothers are fighting?

608
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,640
What?

609
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,160
I'm talking about
the pranks with the shoes.

610
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,920
Prasit is just a scapegoat.

611
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,400
I think the person who puts things
in Jamlong's shoes is Sawaeng.

612
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,520
He's mad that Jamlong
won't settle down with Sa-Ang,

613
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,680
so he can't marry Payom.

614
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,200
What makes you think that?

615
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,160
Well…

616
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,120
It's like what people do
at the courthouse.

617
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,960
People write stuff
all over the bathroom walls

618
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,960
because they want to let out
their anger towards the court.

619
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,120
They're too afraid to break the laws,
so they break small rules instead.

620
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,800
Goodness. You seem
to know a lot about this.

621
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,320
I do.

622
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,440
Someone put chewing gum in Sompong's shoe.

623
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,680
That was you, right?

624
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,720
Did you do this?

625
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,400
Look at it!

626
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,040
I'm onto you.

627
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,160
You're mad that
Sompong is hostile towards me,

628
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,280
so you tried to get back at him.

629
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,320
Right?

630
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,960
But I had nothing to do with the bird.

631
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,520
I didn't teach it to say anything.

632
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,080
What did the bird say?

633
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,800
Here you go.

634
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,200
- Dead broke.
- What?

635
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,520
Now say that again.

636
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,040
- Dead…
- Dead broke.

637
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,400
- Dead broke.
- Good job.

638
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,200
Jamlong is mad at the general

639
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,720
because he got the bank to give him
a loan and wouldn't pay it back.

640
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,080
Jamlong approved
the general's loan request

641
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,760
and Pong was furious at him.

642
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,960
This is why Jamlong
is distancing himself from Sa-Ang.

643
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,320
I think that

644
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,440
Jamlong is still mad about the loan,

645
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,680
so he tries to get back at the general.

646
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,440
This is because

647
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,480
everyone knows that

648
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,080
they can blame everything on Prasit.

649
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,360
So everyone threw the blame on him.

650
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,640
Are you starting to get scared

651
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,240
now that you see what my family is like?

652
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,200
Not really.

653
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,840
Actually,

654
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,520
I think everyone's ready to take my side.

655
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,440
Here.

656
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Everyone is willing
to help me pay the dowry

657
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,800
if I can find proof to catch
the person who pranked them.

658
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,440
Wichai, can you help discipline him?

659
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,040
If you can do it,
I'll help you pay for the dowry.

660
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,720
- I'll give you 100,000.
- What? Are you joking?

661
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,160
I'm totally serious.

662
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,720
Just help straighten him out.

663
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,800
Help me out here.

664
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,160
After you told me about the bird,
I knew Sawaeng would ask for my help.

665
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,280
Even Prasit called and asked me
to help talk to Pong for him.

666
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,520
At this rate, I might not have
to pay a single baht for the dowry

667
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,840
if everyone helps me pay for it.

668
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Did my brothers really offer to help you?

669
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,960
Now I get it.

670
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,600
That's why I found this at my house.

671
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,520
What?

672
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,080
I was wondering

673
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,640
how your name cards ended up at my house.

674
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,520
My brothers

675
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,800
didn't offer to give you money
because they wanted to help you.

676
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,560
What they want

677
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,520
is to benefit from
your influence and connections.

678
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
They're not taking your side.

679
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,360
They're just taking advantage of you.

680
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,600
Come on.

681
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,040
How can a lowly civil servant like me
help them with anything?

682
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,600
You know what?

683
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,840
I don't think we need
to have a big wedding.

684
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,520
Let's have a small ceremony
with just our families.

685
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,440
Why?

686
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,960
My brothers will probably invite
lots of influential people to the wedding.

687
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,040
Those people might bring gifts for us.

688
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,080
They might expect you

689
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,240
to do something in return for them.

690
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,120
I think we should avoid the problems
and just have a small wedding.

691
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,080
But it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

692
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,920
Don't you want to have
a beautiful wedding like other people?

693
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,760
We've already had a wedding.

694
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,240
In my eyes, we already
got married a long time ago.

695
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,920
- Hey, there.
- Are you leaving?

696
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,480
I need to get back to work.

697
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,000
I'll see you.

698
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,760
Wait. Hold on.

699
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,800
Are you going to work looking like this?

700
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,720
Right.

701
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,920
Thank you.

702
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,320
MANAGER'S OFFICE

703
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,320
Wichai acts like
a completely different person

704
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,720
after he came back from Trang.

705
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,880
People at the ministry said that

706
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,280
Wichai was offered the position
of the chief magistrate in the north,

707
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,080
but he turned it down
so he could stay in Bangkok

708
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,960
because he didn't want
that woman to live a difficult life.

709
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,080
He's probably forgotten

710
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,840
that the reason he became a judge
was to redeem our family's honor.

711
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,680
He's going to regret this one day.

712
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,800
He can't keep making compromises
in his marriage forever.

713
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,200
Yes?

714
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,360
What do you think would be the reason

715
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,360
that might break us up?

716
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,720
What kind of question is that?

717
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,120
I think if we were to break up,

718
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,640
it would be because of other people.

719
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,040
I never had any doubts
when we were in Trang.

720
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,520
Now I'm not so sure if we'll make it.

721
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
Listen.

722
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,800
If being here makes you uncomfortable,

723
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,320
you can tell me.

724
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,960
Is the position

725
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,560
of the chief magistrate

726
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,200
a high-ranking position?

727
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,240
You should've called me.

728
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,720
I could come give you a massage.

729
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,320
You won't have time for me

730
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,520
once you're married.

731
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,920
I'll always have time for you.

732
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,360
If you're upset about something,

733
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,200
you can tell me.

734
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,840
If you don't want Anong to live here,

735
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,240
I can move out.

736
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,800
What did she tell you?

737
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,120
Do you know why

738
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,920
I decided not to take the job
outside of Bangkok?

739
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,840
It's because I want
our family to be together.

740
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,680
But if you're uncomfortable,

741
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,000
I can move into Anong's house.

742
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,560
I just don't want people
to think I'm living off of her.

743
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,040
So I'm taking Anong
to live here temporarily.

744
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,720
This is just temporary.

745
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,360
She can stay here. I'm not complaining.

746
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,640
Mom.

747
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,880
If you're unhappy, just be honest with me.

748
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,600
Don't do to me what you did to Chut.

749
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,240
I know it was you

750
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,520
who showed Chantorn's family
the mortgage contract

751
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,440
and caused Chut and Chantorn to fight.

752
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,240
If you don't approve of Anong,

753
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,920
I'll be the one moving out.

754
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,360
But please don't say
that she ruined my future.

755
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,800
But it's true.

756
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,160
Anong was the reason

757
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,160
that I decided to become a judge again.

758
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,640
I know my career is important.

759
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,760
But my family is important to me too.

760
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,640
I don't want to have
another failed marriage.

761
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,440
You should get some rest.

762
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,560
Give us a second.

763
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,040
We're ready now.

764
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,640
<i>May your marriage be filled
with love, trust, and respect.</i>

765
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,480
<i>May you have the patience
to go through every obstacle together.</i>

766
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,120
Anong Suntorapong is no more.

767
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,520
ANONG WARATHABUT

768
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,600
<i>She said she had a stomachache.</i>

769
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,440
I think she might've got an abortion.

770
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,640
What are you talking about?

771
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,160
I heard it with my own ears.

772
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,280
I'm afraid the baby will become repressed

773
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,840
if he grows up in this family.

774
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,560
I'd rather not have kids now.

775
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,400
<i>I have proof.</i>

776
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,920
<i>She took Chinese medicine
to end her pregnancy.</i>

777
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,320
Rumor has it that Wichai
once got his wife to accept a bribe.

778
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,720
He took the man's money
and still sent him to prison.

779
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,880
So that man's holding
a grudge against Wichai.

780
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,240
Who is he?

781
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,080
He's an ex-con.

782
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,080
Chantorn took a sick leave.
She's not feeling well.

783
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,200
Did you know your wife
leaves the house every morning

784
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,560
and never goes to work?

785
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,360
