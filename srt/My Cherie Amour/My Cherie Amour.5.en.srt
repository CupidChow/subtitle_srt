BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
You should come
have dinner with us sometime.

3
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,880
We can get to know
each other better as neighbors.

4
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
You're asking for trouble.

5
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,120
You must let her see your flaws,

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,440
so you know how much she can take.

7
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
This magic ring can turn tears into smiles

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
and vice versa.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,640
No one can have the best
of everything all their lives.

10
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,840
You can't even look after yourself.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
You're no different
from that cripple Prasit.

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,520
You can't protect anyone.

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,040
Where did you drop Prasit off?
He's not home yet.

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
There's another thing
which I love the most.

15
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,520
It's…

16
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,440
Do not wander off
by yourself like this again.

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
It's your brother-in-law.

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
I've never realized that one person

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
can have the power

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,400
to make you laugh and cry because of them.

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
Choy.

22
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Mom.

23
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,960
You must stay strong.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
You'll be fine. Trust me.

25
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,160
All right.

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
Gosh.

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,600
Damn it.

28
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
Hey.

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,880
Is that the charcoal I ordered?

30
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,840
How much do I owe you?

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,800
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,960
Don't be crazy.

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
Anyway…

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Well…

35
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,760
Can you put the charcoal in the kitchen?

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Sure.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,200
And here.

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Use it to wipe your face.

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,640
Chut, here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

40
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,960
Wait.

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,240
This is Chut, my youngest brother.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,200
This is Chantorn, Samarn's sister.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,640
I'm sorry. I thought you were…

44
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
A delivery boy.

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,760
No delivery boy
is this well dressed, you know.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,800
That really hurt my self-esteem.

47
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm really sorry.

48
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,120
I see.

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,680
So you're Chantorn, Samarn's sister.

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,640
I thought you were an angel.

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,080
Hey. Knock it off.

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,320
They should be divided
into different piles.

53
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Mom, Ms. Anong is here.

54
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
This is Anong.

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
She's my friend.

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
Thank you for coming.

57
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,760
If there's anything I can help you with,

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,920
please don't hesitate to let me know.

59
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,880
Thank you.

60
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,160
Let's go say hi to my mom.

61
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Who is that?

62
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
That's Anong, Chut's girlfriend.

63
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,720
She's a socialite and a millionaire.

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,520
-Hello.
-They met back in England.

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,960
She's the angel that turned
a tiger like Chut into a kitten.

66
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

67
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,760
Catch a tiger by the toe.

68
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,600
If he hollers, let him go.

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

70
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,640
My mother told me

71
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,360
to pick the very best one.

72
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm giving this to you
because you're a good girl.

73
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,480
Do you know how good girls should behave?

74
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,640
Good girls should listen to adults
and do as they're told.

75
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
That's right.

76
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
There's one more thing.

77
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,280
Good girls should try to be helpful.

78
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Look over there.

79
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,040
Your uncle is so tired that
he can barely keep his eyes open.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,760
Nid.

81
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,760
Can you take this tea bag

82
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,840
and put it on your uncle's eyes?

83
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Okay.

84
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,240
-Put it on his eyes.
-Okay.

85
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
Uncle.

86
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
Yes?

87
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,520
What is it?

88
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,040
Thank you.

89
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Tons of people asked me who you are.

90
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
So I told them you're the daughter-in-law.

91
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,240
Your mom is so protective of you.

92
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,920
I might end up with Wichai instead of you.

93
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
You'll definitely end up with me.
You'll never be with Wichai.

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
Let me tell you.

95
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,039
You're not Wichai's type at all.

96
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,440
You have no chance with him.

97
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,600
You'd have to be born as someone else

98
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,280
for him to like you.

99
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,720
Why? What's wrong with me?

100
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
Nothing's wrong with you.

101
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,040
It's just that you're like a princess

102
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,240
while Wichai is more into commoners

103
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
because there's no competition.

104
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,560
1 WEEK LATER

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,000
Goodness.

106
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Must we prepare so much food
to give to the monks?

107
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,320
I knew this would happen
when Anong said she wanted to give alms.

108
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,720
-Goodness.
-Look at all this food.

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,720
Auntie.

110
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,040
Why isn't he out yet?

111
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,760
He'll probably be out in a bit.

112
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
Wichai!

113
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
You're not giving alms today?

114
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
I didn't prepare any food this morning.

115
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,200
That won't be a problem.

116
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,760
I've prepared some for you.

117
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,680
Thank you.

118
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,000
May those who pay homage to the Buddha

119
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,280
and give respect to their elders

120
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,640
be blessed with a long life, good health,

121
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,040
happiness, and energy.

122
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
I rejoice in your merit.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,920
Please excuse us, Wichai.

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,560
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

125
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,960
Do you think it's true

126
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,200
that if we make merit or do good things

127
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,040
together in this life,

128
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,040
we'll meet again in our next lives?

129
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
I don't know.

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
There's no way to prove it.

131
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,080
You know, maybe we've done this together
before in our past lives.

132
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,320
In this life, we went from being strangers

133
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,840
to being neighbors and friends.

134
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,600
And maybe we'll get to become
even closer in the future.

135
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Maybe we can share our…

136
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
We can share our…

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,880
We can share our…

138
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,800
We can share our…

139
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
We can share our merit with Samarn, right?

140
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,240
That's right.

141
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,400
Well,

142
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,800
since you're kind enough
to share your merit with the dead,

143
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
won't you share some of it
with the person next to you?

144
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,840
Since I still owe you for the food,

145
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,720
I'll go visit your store today
like I once promised.

146
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,200
Really?

147
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll go there after work.

148
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,440
It seems my prayer has been answered.

149
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,840
See you this evening.

150
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,880
See you.

151
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,160
Boi!

152
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,960
Boi!

153
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Where the hell is he?

154
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,760
He's probably slacking off
while his master is at work.

155
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,680
That lazy pig.

156
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,800
I wonder where he's hiding. Go find him.

157
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,720
Boi!

158
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,080
Boi!

159
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,080
Come out right now!

160
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
Boi!

161
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,960
Where are you hiding?

162
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,000
You'll get in trouble for this.

163
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,960
Boi!

164
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,840
Boi!

165
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,760
Help! It's a ghost!

166
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,000
I saw a ghost! Help me!

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,880
There's a ghost in the closet!

168
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,320
Help me!

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Somebody help me.

170
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,240
Boi, what's the matter?

171
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,200
-Stay away from me!
-Boi!

172
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,800
-What's gotten into you?
-Get away from me!

173
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
-Leave me alone.
-What's wrong?

174
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm scared. Please leave me alone.

175
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
Please don't hurt me.

176
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,520
Boi.

177
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,880
What's the matter?

178
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,760
There's a ghost upstairs.

179
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,120
She's in the closet!

180
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,920
That's what she was wearing.

181
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,960
She was wearing that dress!

182
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,960
That dress belongs to Wichai's late wife.

183
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,640
Welcome to Deco Plaza.

184
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,040
How can I help you today?

185
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,400
What's with the grand welcome?

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,000
You can just greet me normally.

187
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,200
I want to buy a gift for someone,

188
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,080
but I don't know what women like.

189
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,680
You've come to the right person.

190
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,720
Women like everything men buy for them.

191
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,880
It doesn't have to be expensive.

192
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,440
It just has to come from the heart.

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,880
If you don't mind me asking,

194
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,880
can you tell me a little bit

195
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,200
about this woman?

196
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,840
Well…

197
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,760
She's well-mannered.

198
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,920
She's a serious person.

199
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,920
And she likes to read.

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Some women don't really need you

201
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,760
to buy anything for them.

202
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,640
They just want you
to say nice things to them.

203
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
Write them a card.

204
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Compliment them
and say you appreciate them.

205
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,840
That's enough for them.

206
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,920
Sometimes

207
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,120
women also appreciate it

208
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,120
when you express your love
through your actions.

209
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
Wichai, look.

210
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,800
Do you see that?

211
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,680
You can hold a woman's hand.

212
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,920
Carry things for her.

213
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Take care of her.

214
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,720
That's enough to show her that you care.

215
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
All right.

216
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
But it all depends

217
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
on who that woman is

218
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,760
and how important she is to you.

219
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,720
Can you tell me?

220
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Well…

221
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,640
She's…

222
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
Yes?

223
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,960
So what's your relationship
with this woman?

224
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,320
She's just someone I know.

225
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm asking because

226
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
if you two are close,

227
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,000
you might want to give her
something extra special.

228
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,120
You know,

229
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,040
a lot of people who come to our store

230
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,760
aren't here to shop at all.

231
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,960
They come to spend time
with their loved ones.

232
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Sometimes

233
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,600
the best gift you can give someone

234
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,960
is to spend time with them.

235
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,120
Do you know what else

236
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,440
women want from men?

237
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,400
This perfume?

238
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,400
Yes. It smells nice.

239
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,280
That's not what I mean.

240
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,160
Women want physical intimacy.

241
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,000
You can stroke her hair

242
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,760
or hold her close to you.

243
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,360
Well, have you decided

244
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
what you'll give to your lady friend?

245
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,600
I'll take this perfume.

246
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,800
All right then.

247
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
So you're buying her a gift.

248
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,520
That's good.

249
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,800
It means you're not
intimately involved with her.

250
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,280
I'll wrap this up for you.

251
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
There's a new restaurant
near Ratchawong Pier.

252
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,680
Anong said she wanted to go eat there.

253
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,960
Are you free tomorrow?
Please come with us.

254
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Well…

255
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,960
I already have plans tomorrow.

256
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,640
Wichai.

257
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,000
You're the first person
to turn down a date with Anong.

258
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,560
Listen.

259
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,120
I really can't make it tomorrow.

260
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,040
You've got some nerves, Wichai.

261
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,280
Anong helped you choose a gift.
You need to thank her properly.

262
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,200
Okay.

263
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,920
Very well then. When I'm not too busy,

264
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
I'll treat her.

265
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,520
You promised.

266
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,800
Thank you.

267
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,800
Lamoon.

268
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,920
Do you believe what Boi said?

269
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,640
I think he could be
telling the truth, ma'am.

270
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,080
Are you out of your mind?

271
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,680
Maybe Boi was right about…

272
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,520
Madam.

273
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,280
Open the door.

274
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,960
Do it.

275
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,200
Everything looks fine to me.

276
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,880
It's been so long. Why is she still here?

277
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Madam.

278
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,360
Gosh. These are all her things.

279
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,080
Why would Wichai keep them?

280
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,280
Don't tell Wichai
about what happened today.

281
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,520
The matter with Soon
is over and done with.

282
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,400
No one should dig up the past.

283
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,000
It's a shame you have
to go back to your hometown.

285
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,200
A pretty lady like you

286
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,200
can easily make it as a movie star.

287
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,680
This is from Wichai.

288
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,920
Wichai secretly took your photo.

289
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,960
He wanted you to have these.

290
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,000
We may be apart,
but you'll always be in my heart.

291
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
With all my love.

292
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,320
Wichai.

293
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,560
It's a pity

294
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,240
you didn't get to take
any photos with him.

295
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,000
Poor Wichai.

296
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,120
He has no luck with women.

297
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,120
Prasit, I'm ready to go.

298
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,760
Wait.

299
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,800
We have to wait for Wichai.

300
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,960
Did you invite him to join us?

301
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,920
We're going to surprise him.

302
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,960
Surprise him?

303
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,400
How do you know where to find him?

304
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
For today's Folk Law,

305
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,520
we have Pra Atthakadee Wichai
in the studio with us.

306
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,120
He is a young judge

307
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,960
who will answer all your questions.

308
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,160
And here's a letter

309
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,760
that we've received
from a listener at home.

310
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,920
Here's what Ms. Jintana wrote to us.

311
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
"My husband is a civil servant.
He's a loyal man.

312
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,280
He's never cheated on me,
but he's never helped me with housework

313
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,400
or helped take care of our kids.

314
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,960
When I asked him,
he said it wasn't his job.

315
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,320
He thinks he's done his part
in providing for the family.

316
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,400
The other day, we took a train
to visit my parents out of town.

317
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,800
He bought himself a first-class ticket.

318
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,120
When I asked why
he wouldn't sit with his family,

319
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,280
he said to me that

320
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,960
he already went to the trouble
of coming with me.

321
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,520
I'd like to know

322
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,480
whether this is an acceptable reason

323
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
for me to divorce him?"

324
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,560
According to the law,

325
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,040
women have the right
to file for divorce from their husband.

326
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,440
But from what you wrote,

327
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,280
I don't think you really want
to divorce your husband.

328
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,720
You just want him
to not take you for granted, right?

329
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,440
Someone recently taught me
about love languages.

330
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,320
For both men and women,

331
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,320
besides telling your partner
that you love them,

332
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,760
there are five other ways
that you can express your love.

333
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,440
I'd like every couple

334
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,840
to try and do the following things.

335
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,760
When you've been married a long time,

336
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,640
most men tend to forget
to say nice things to their wives.

337
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,960
It's little things

338
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,520
like complimenting her
or saying you appreciate her.

339
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,640
I said those words to him.

340
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,520
Those were my words.

341
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,400
He remembers.

342
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,200
Or you might tell her
she looks beautiful today.

343
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,760
Prasit! Did you hear that?

344
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,240
Those words can let your partner know
that you love them.

345
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,000
Besides sweet words and gifts,

346
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,440
you can also show your love
through small gestures

347
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,560
like cooking for your partner,

348
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
ironing their clothes,

349
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
or taking nice pictures of them.

350
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,960
These actions might be

351
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,560
even more touching
than saying, "I love you."

352
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
There's one more thing
that we tend to dismiss.

353
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
It's physical intimacy.

354
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,600
These little things
can keep your love alive.

355
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,040
But people often forget
to do those things after a while.

356
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,120
Wichai.

357
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,360
Wichai.

358
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,600
Yes?

359
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,400
Ultimately, do you think Ms. Jintana
should divorce her husband?

360
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,120
Right. About that.

361
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,840
I just want to say that

362
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,320
women shouldn't feel like

363
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,240
they need to have a partner.

364
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,960
You can live your life
and be happy without a husband.

365
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,400
Marriage isn't the answer for every woman.

366
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,560
Some women are strong and independent.

367
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Don't live your life revolving
around what society expects of you.

368
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
Right on, Wichai.

369
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,160
Very well said.

370
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,880
Hey.

371
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,040
You look very sharp today.

372
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,320
Anong was so thrilled

373
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,080
that you quoted
what she said on the radio.

374
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,200
Come on. Let's go celebrate.

375
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,080
I'm sorry I got here late.

376
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
I just finished work.

377
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,520
It's okay.

378
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,480
Where's Wichai?

379
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,040
I was listening to you
on the radio earlier.

380
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,920
Urai said you were brilliant.

381
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,600
She said it's no wonder you managed
to become a judge at such a young age.

382
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,440
Luang Turakit
who is Chantorn's brother-in-law

383
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,520
once set her up
with a merchant in Sawankhalok,

384
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
but Chantorn didn't want to get married.

385
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,520
She told him she wanted to come
to be with Samarn.

386
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,440
She's probably out of excuses
now that Samarn is gone.

387
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,240
She'll have to go back and get married.

388
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,160
Prasit.

389
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,080
What happened?

390
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,040
This new guy must be special.

391
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Anong is so into him

392
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
that she wrote
a guidebook on herself for him.

393
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
This means that

394
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,600
Anong is serious about this guy.

395
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,200
A guidebook?

396
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,720
What do you mean?

397
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,480
It's a book that contains facts

398
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,240
about the things
she likes and doesn't like.

399
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
We must find out

400
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,560
who this man is.

401
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,280
You promised that you'd help me
screen the men who approach Anong.

402
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,440
But Anong isn't stupid.

403
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,040
If this man is the one she loves,
maybe he's a good guy.

404
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,040
But we agreed to help Chut
eliminate the competition.

405
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,960
We've managed to expose several guys.

406
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,360
We can't let some random guy
snatch Anong away.

407
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,600
Wichai.

408
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,280
If you want Anong
to be your sister-in-law,

409
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,360
you must help me
get this man out of her life.

410
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,120
We've managed to expose several guys.

411
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
We can't let some random guy
snatch Anong away.

412
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
If you want Anong
to be your sister-in-law,

413
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,520
you must help me
get this man out of her life.

414
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I thought you meant me well.

415
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,640
So this is the real reason
why you're doing this.

416
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,639
YOUR SECRET ADMIRER

417
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,639
I want to have a birthday party this year.

418
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,280
What do you guys think?

419
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,000
Sure. Let's do it.

420
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,960
We haven't had a big party in a while.

421
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,440
I'd like to invite
a special guest to join us.

422
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,679
Is he the one that you wrote
a guidebook on yourself for?

423
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,800
A guidebook?

424
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,719
What guidebook?

425
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,920
So you're really seeing someone?

426
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,840
The only one Anong has eyes for is--

427
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,000
This guy.

428
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,840
I…

429
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,080
I wrote that guidebook for this guy.

430
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,240
"Secret Admirer."

431
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,240
That's my nickname for him.

432
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,640
Secret Admirer?

433
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,080
Yes.

434
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,080
Anong said he's the son
of a millionaire in the south

435
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,080
and that he owns a mining company.

436
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,600
I met him on a ship to England.

437
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,880
We immediately hit it off.

438
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,520
The other day,

439
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,960
I had a dream about him,
so I want to see him again.

440
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,720
I think that

441
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,880
this guy is perfect in every way.

442
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,920
I believe you won't find anyone

443
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,520
who is as perfect for me as this man.

444
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,720
I don't know if we can trust this guy.

445
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,440
Who knows?

446
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
Maybe he's already married.

447
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,360
ALREADY MARRIED

448
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
Wichai.

449
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,920
Can you help me find out who this guy is?

450
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,360
So from everything you've told me,
the only thing we know for sure is that

451
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,560
he has a mining company in the south.

452
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,520
I'm really worried for Anong.

453
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,760
I don't want this guy to snatch her away.

454
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,560
Let's talk once we have more information.
I have to go.

455
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,960
Wichai.

456
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,240
Chut, I need to talk to you.

457
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,080
I'm late. Let's talk this evening.

458
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,720
Did you go to see Chantorn?

459
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,360
Did you give her the photos?

460
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,480
I had no idea

461
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,640
that you took these photos of me.

462
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,960
It's like I get to see myself

463
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,840
through your eyes.

464
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Why did you give her that note?

465
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,440
To let her know
that you have feelings for her.

466
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,560
You're into her, right?

467
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,600
Who said I'm into her?

468
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,880
I can tell from the way you look at her
and how you act around her.

469
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,960
You've never been interested
in anyone since your wife died.

470
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,760
If you like this woman,
you should hold on to her.

471
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,960
Don't let her slip through your fingers.

472
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,120
Who gives you the right
to decide things for me?

473
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,840
Did it change her mind?

474
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,880
Does she still want to go home?

475
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,920
Just focus on your own problems.

476
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,520
What I did made her stay.

477
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
I told you to mind your own business.

478
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,600
You don't know
how to approach women anymore.

479
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,840
I don't want to commit to her
and end up hurting her.

480
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,280
You're already hurting her
by leading her on.

481
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,720
You give her no clarity,

482
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
so she thinks she has a chance with you.

483
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,280
If she has false hope,

484
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,000
it's because you won't tell her
how you really feel.

485
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,600
Do you want her to make the first move?

486
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,520
You don't know what I'm feeling!

487
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,800
Don't try to make me
a hopeless romantic like you.

488
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,880
What are those two fighting about?

489
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,400
I don't know.

490
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,640
You haven't seen him in ages.
How do you know he's still single?

491
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,760
If he agrees to come to the party,

492
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,280
it means I have a chance with him.

493
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,880
But it's been so long.

494
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,160
Maybe he's changed.

495
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,960
Let's wait until he gets here
before you judge him.

496
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,400
How do you know where he lives?

497
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,040
I'll send the letter
to his company in Penang.

498
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,680
I heard that
he's running a business there.

499
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,320
I'll take the letter to the post office
and post it for you.

500
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,760
But if it doesn't reach him,

501
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,240
then it's not meant to be

502
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,960
and you'll have to move on.

503
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,280
This is Anong's guidebook.

504
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,240
"Prapat Watsiri."

505
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,720
Should we just rip the letter up?

506
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,640
So they can't find each other.

507
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,440
Just post the letter.

508
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,200
If they're meant to be together,

509
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,440
a small issue like this
won't be able to keep them apart.

510
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,280
If Anong decides to marry him,
what are you going to do?

511
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,240
You know,

512
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,480
Anong is serious about this guy.

513
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,400
She even made this for him.

514
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,320
Anong is falling head over heels for him.

515
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,680
I DON'T LIKE LIARS

516
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,560
I DON'T MIND MAKING THE FIRST MOVE

517
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,080
I appreciate you looking out for Chut.

518
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,120
You're the one I'm rooting for.

519
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,960
It's all right.

520
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,000
If he's really a good guy,
then we should be happy for Anong.

521
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,880
Let's find out where this Prapat guy is,

522
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,800
so we can see for ourselves
if he's worthy to be with Anong.

523
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,600
I believe that

524
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,680
if you want to get to know someone,

525
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,800
you should spend at least
three days with that person.

526
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,040
Only then will you see
each other's true colors.

527
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,440
Otherwise,

528
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,520
you'll never truly know each other.

529
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,400
I don't mind getting into arguments.
To be close to someone,

530
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,120
you need to see them
when they're furious at least once.

531
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,560
I don't like liars.
If you're going to lie to me,

532
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,680
don't ever let me find out.

533
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,920
If I find out
you're being dishonest with me,

534
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,040
I'll never fully trust you again.

535
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,280
Why didn't you tell me
you wanted to play tennis?

536
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,560
I heard that you're here,
so I came to play with you.

537
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,840
Give me a second.

538
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,960
I'll go get changed.

539
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,040
I'm done playing for today.
I'm about to head home.

540
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,560
Then let's go grab food
at Ratchawong Pier together.

541
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,040
What's that for?

542
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,520
I ordered this.

543
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
I can pay for my own drink.

544
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,120
You don't need to act all generous
when you barely have money.

545
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,440
Anong.

546
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
Anong.

547
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Anong, what's the matter?

548
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,600
Why are you mad at me?

549
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,840
Maybe you've never seen me mad,

550
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,960
so you don't know what I'm really like.

551
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,960
But here's the thing.

552
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,080
I no longer care if I hurt your feelings

553
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,040
since you betrayed me first.

554
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,520
Wait a second.

555
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,920
When did I betray you?

556
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,280
You're the guy
that Pong chose for me, right?

557
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,560
I didn't know,

558
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,760
so I asked you to help me
keep other guys away.

559
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,640
When in truth, you're the one
that Pong wants me to marry.

560
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,440
Is this a misunderstanding?

561
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,040
Your brother has been trying
to get every guy out of my life

562
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,360
to make you the best choice for me.

563
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,880
I was completely fooled.

564
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,760
I thought he did it
because he cared about me,

565
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,200
but he did all of that
so I would end up with you.

566
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,440
If that's true, what's so bad about it?

567
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,040
It means I won't get a chance
to be with a good guy.

568
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,560
A good guy?

569
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,720
-You mean a better guy than me?
-Yes.

570
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,840
You're the reason why

571
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,280
he only sees me as a friend.

572
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,720
Throw them all away.
I don't know why he keeps them.

573
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,440
They all belong to a dead woman.

574
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,280
Goodness.

575
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,320
-Wait!
-Let me go.

576
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,240
Where are you going?

577
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,600
-Take these clothes downstairs.
-No, I'm scared.

578
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,160
Let go of me.

579
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,640
They are in your master's room. Take them.

580
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,680
This room is haunted.
I'm not going in there.

581
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
Let me go!

582
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,760
If you don't come in,

583
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,320
I'll take these dresses
and put them in your room.

584
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,560
Gosh. Let go of me!

585
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,680
-Let me go! Let go!
-Come on.

586
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,960
I'll go get the dresses!

587
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,520
My gosh.

588
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,440
I'm out of here.

589
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,880
Why didn't you tell him
Soon didn't die here?

590
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,600
He's scared senseless.

591
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,520
Do you like paper dolls, Nid?

592
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,760
I do. I like to cut out
paper dresses for them.

593
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,680
These dresses look nice.

594
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
Goodness.

595
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,200
I'm so sorry. I sat on your stuff.

596
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,400
Let me see.

597
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,360
Is this your paper doll?

598
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,720
Gosh.

599
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,480
I like this dress.

600
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,560
TO RATREE WARATHABUT

601
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,160
FROM WICHAI WARATHABUT

602
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,160
How could you do this to me?

603
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,120
Anong thinks I'm a liar because of you.

604
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,240
She now thinks I'm two-faced.

605
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,320
Do you know how it feels

606
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,040
to have people decide things for you?

607
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,360
I meant you well.

608
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm also doing this to help you.

609
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,480
Anong thinks we're working together

610
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,320
to stop her

611
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,600
from being with a good guy.

612
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,080
It's probably that man

613
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,520
that she's inviting to the birthday party.

614
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,200
Which man?

615
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,080
Whose birthday party?

616
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,760
Anong's having a birthday party.

617
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,920
It's next month.

618
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,280
She didn't even invite me?

619
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,040
At this point,

620
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,000
she'll probably want to break up with me.

621
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,320
FROM WICHAI WARATHABUT
TO RATREE WARATHABUT

622
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,880
I arrived in Lampang five days ago.

623
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,200
The provincial court is quite big.

624
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,200
It rains quite a lot here,
which makes traveling difficult.

625
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,880
The people here warned me
of a malaria outbreak,

626
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
but my house looks secure enough.

627
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,560
I'll try not to get sick while I'm here.

628
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,920
It's freezing here at night.

629
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,640
The only good thing
about the rainy season is that

630
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,960
the rain lilies are all in bloom.

631
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,720
You would've liked them.

632
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,360
I picked one for you
in case you want to dry it.

633
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,960
Back home when it's nighttime,

634
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,760
the air is usually filled
with the scent of night-blooming jasmine.

635
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,200
You can smell them from our bedroom.

636
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,120
I hope they can help ease your loneliness.

637
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,200
Please tell my family not to worry.

638
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,040
I'm doing fine here.

639
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,480
After the termination
of the forest concession agreement,

640
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,800
I don't have to deal
with many complicated cases.

641
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,560
I'll try to find time
to write to you regularly.

642
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,440
Miss you always, Wichai.

643
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm sorry I had to ask you for help.

644
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,320
The men in this house are no help at all.

645
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,240
Is this the room that
you're cleaning up for Wichai?

646
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,920
Wichai isn't home much,

647
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,560
so others often
put their things in his room.

648
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,760
That's why
I want to tidy up his room for him.

649
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,840
Will you also throw these books away?

650
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,760
Feel free to take the ones you like.

651
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,080
Thank you so much.

652
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,840
Can I take some time
to browse through them?

653
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,360
Be my guest.

654
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,040
I have to go prepare dinner for Nid now.

655
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,520
Sure. I'll be fine here.

656
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,200
He only talks about work.

657
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,240
How boring. There's nothing
romantic about these letters.

658
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,160
Boi!

659
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,880
Is Nid back from school?

660
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,560
Not yet, sir.

661
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,440
Choy hasn't picked her up yet.

662
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,600
Tell Choy I'll pick Nid up.

663
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,600
Just let me shower and get changed first.

664
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,920
Here we go again.

665
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,320
Hey! Boi!

666
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,560
Hey. Boi.

667
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,440
Boi.

668
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,680
-What happened?
-Boi passed out.

669
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,160
-Boi.
-Boi.

670
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,960
Boi.

671
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,680
-Hey.
-Boi, wake up. Boi.

672
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,360
My goodness.

673
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,200
How did you get in there?

674
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,400
I didn't mean to be in here.

675
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,760
Anong, wait!

676
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,480
Wait.

677
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,120
Where are you going?

678
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,960
I just went up there
to help Choy tidy up the room.

679
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,920
Please don't be mad at Chut.

680
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,640
Sompong asked me to help him.

681
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,560
Chut knows nothing about it.

682
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,480
What makes you think
you know love well enough

683
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,680
to make decisions for me?

684
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,640
I'm sorry I poked my nose
in your business.

685
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,040
But every guy who has approached you

686
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,200
all has an ulterior motive.

687
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,840
I also used to think that

688
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,200
you did everything you did
because you truly cared about me.

689
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,480
But it turns out you only care about Chut.

690
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
I stand by what I said.

691
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,520
If you meet a better guy than Chut,

692
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,200
I won't get in your way.

693
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,840
I've already met that guy.

694
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,840
He just isn't interested in me.

695
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,760
If you mean the guy in Penang,

696
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,360
he doesn't really exist, right?

697
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,640
I did some digging.

698
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,640
You just used him as an excuse

699
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,400
to break things off with Chut.

700
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,560
So Pong did tell you about that guy.

701
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,240
You guys must've been busy
trying to find fault with him.

702
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,400
Your dream guy doesn't exist.

703
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,960
He's not real.

704
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,840
You only wrote this guidebook

705
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,680
to make your lie more believable.

706
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,280
I can't tell anymore
if you're smart or stupid

707
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,120
since you really can't seem to tell
who I want as my husband.

708
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,560
I promise to stay out of this from now on.

709
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,160
I'll let you make your own decisions.

710
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,640
I hope you can keep your word.

711
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,120
No matter who I choose to love,

712
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,360
you do not get to stop me.

713
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,320
I won't stop you.

714
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,520
I'll even be happy for you
if you end up with the man you love.

715
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,960
You'll find out soon enough

716
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,560
who that man is.

717
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,440
I won't let him get away from me.

718
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,520
Once you know who he is,

719
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,880
I hope you'll help me get my happy ending.

720
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,520
I don't mind making
the first move on a guy.

721
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,040
I've found that
being secretly in love with someone

722
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,520
can actually make me happy.

723
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,400
That feeling of having
a secret crush on someone

724
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,360
makes me feel younger
and prettier than I've ever been.

725
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,160
Warathabut's residence.

726
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,080
You told me Wichai's wife died
when she was young.

727
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,120
When did she pass away?

728
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,400
Is that you, Anong?

729
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,120
I think she passed away eight years ago.

730
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,080
Eight years?

731
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,200
I found a letter in one of the books.

732
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,520
In that letter,

733
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,680
it seemed like she was saying goodbye.

734
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,080
I also found letters that Soon wrote
to Wichai, but she didn't post them.

735
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,600
I found them all piled up

736
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,600
in the storage room.

737
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,480
Something feels off about this.

738
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,160
Nid!

739
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,800
Give me that dress, Nid.

740
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,280
Its owner died a tragic death.

741
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,400
It's bad luck.

742
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,840
Give it back to me.

743
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,640
It's Wichai.

744
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,800
He is Anong's soulmate.

745
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,920
Wichai will never put anyone
before his family.

746
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,920
You should let Anong decide.

747
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,520
Then I suppose you won't mind

748
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,920
if I find another guy for her.

749
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,560
Since you want to marry her so much,

750
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,560
let's see if she would be willing

751
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,480
to stick it out with you.

752
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,560
Mom will keep pressuring Chut

753
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,800
until he changes his mind.

754
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,040
Chut has a girl he loves.

755
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,520
You can't force him
to love someone you choose for him.

756
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,800
You're just like your dad.

757
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,960
You just have to be the good guy.

758
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,280
Isn't that right?

759
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,000
I plan to propose at the theater.

760
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,360
Will you come with me?

761
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,760
If she says yes, please ask her brother
for her hand in marriage for me.

762
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,840
